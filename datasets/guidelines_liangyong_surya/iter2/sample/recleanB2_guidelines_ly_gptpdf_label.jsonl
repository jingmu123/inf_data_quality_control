Imaging tests for local tumour bed should include simple X-ray complemented by other techniques as MRI, CT scan or even ultrasounds.

In other words, how can the wind overcome the barrier of the geomagnetic field and drive the motions of the plasma inside the magnetosphere?\n\n【1】### Blowing in the Solar Wind\n**ONE ANSWER, PROPOSED IN 1960** by Frank Johnson of Lockheed Missiles and Space Division, is that the magnetosphere is essentially closed. According to this hypothesis, the solar wind could transfer energy and momentum to the plasma surrounding the earth only by wave motions along the magnetopause. The motions would be produced by viscous interaction between the solar-wind plasma and the magnetosphere plasma; the process is analogous to the generation of waves by the flow of wind over water. Waves are in fact observed along the magnetopause. But they do not seem capable of driving the large-scale circulation of the magnetosphere or the great disturbances that often occur there. Such waves also would not allow the efficient entry of accelerated solar-wind plasma into the magnetosphere.\n\n【2】For these reasons, magnetopause waves are not considered the primary means by which the solar wind affects the magnetosphere. An alternative mechanism called magnetic reconnection—first proposed in 1961 by British physicist James W. Dungey—is generally thought to be a better explanation. In this process, the field lines of the IMF become temporarily interconnected with the geomagnetic field lines on the dayside of the magnetopause. This tangling of the field lines allows large amounts of plasma and magnetic ener-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 73, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Indeed, scientists say, GM crops in many countries could end up growing near their ancestral plants—and sharing more than the sunshine overhead. “Almost every crop has weedy relatives somewhere in the world,” says Stephen Duke, a USDA plant physiologist in Oxford, Miss. “How do you keep GM crops out of places where they’re not supposed to be?”\n\n【1】### Taking Refuge\nFinally, one risk follows GM crops wherever they’re planted: evolution. Over time, insect pests and weeds can become resistant to killing by routine chemical sprays. The same is bound to happen in the biotech age: eventually, impervious insects will munch away on GM insect-resistant plants, and the weeds surrounding herbicide-tolerant crops will shrug off the herbicide of choice. “Agriculture is an evolutionary arms race between plant protections and pests,” comments botanist Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State University. “And GM crops are just one more way that we’re trying to outsmart pests—temporarily.”\n\n【2】After five years of commercial Bt crop use, no reports of insect resistance to the crops have emerged, according to Monsanto. The company contends that roughly 90 percent of Bt corn and cotton growers comply with refuge requirements.\n\n【3】But some environmentalists question that rosy scenario and also argue that non-Bt refuges are either too small or too poorly designed to keep insect resistance at bay for long. “At the EPA meeting last fall, scientists seemed to agree that bigger, better refuges were the way to go but that cotton farmers would never agree to big refuges,” says Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit organization based in New York City. More broadly, Goldburg questions how much GM crops really do for the environment. “In however many years,” she says, “we’ll lose Bt as an effective control against insects, and then we’ll be on to another chemical control. Many of us view this current generation of biotech crops as a kind of diversion, rather than a substantive gain for agriculture.” She favors sustainable agriculture alternatives, including careful crop rotation and organic farming methods, over pesticides sprayed on or engineered into plants.\n\n【4】U.S. landscape logistics make it unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotech genes. It may be harder to avoid creating superweeds elsewhere.\n\n【5】To keep weeds vulnerable to herbicides, Monsanto and other companies urge growers to use the sprays responsibly, and only when necessary. To slow insect resistance to Bt crops, the EPA requires Bt crop growers to set aside some part of their farmland for crops that have not been genetically modified. These \"refuges\" may be a corner of a field outside a Bt crop, for instance, or rows of standard plants that break up a Bt plot. Inside the refuges, insects that have acquired some Bt resistance breed with those that have not, diluting the resistance rate.\n\n【6】Virus-resistant GM crops have escaped widespread public concern, but they, too, pose some of the same risks as other GM crops. Some scientists worry that viruses will pick up resistance traits from virus-fighting GM crops and evolve into hard-to-treat strains that infect a newly expanded repertoire of plants. Some critics also question the ecological safety of emerging crops designed to resist drought, tolerate salt or deliver an extra nutritional punch. For example, Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that salt-tolerant rice could potentially behave like a disruptive weed if it found its way into vulnerable wetlands.\n\n【7】“I don’t think it’s fair to say that every single GM crop is going to be a problem,” Rissler remarks. “But we need to devote the research to risks now, rather than deal with repercussions later.”\n\n【8】Still, some farmers are confident that GM technology can revolutionize agriculture for the better. For 30 years, Ryland Utlaut of Grand Pass, Mo., has been sowing and reaping 3,500 acres along the Missouri River. Last year, for the first time, he planted only herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans across his entire, soil-friendly, no-till farm. As a result, he claims, he sprayed the crops half as often as he did before and got bigger yields. “If even the strongest environmentalist could see my farming practices now, I think they’d understand the benefits,” Utlaut says. “I’m a fervent believer in this technology.” Now he has to wait and see whether science confirms that belief.\n\n【9】Kathryn Brown is a science writer based in Alexandria, Va.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 41, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Treating it as if it is distorts this important debate. It is also amazing to me how quickly some have dismissed the virtues of traditional breeding—the technology that, after all, made us into an agricultural powerhouse.**\n\n【2】## Can we turn to another potential benefit that people claim for GM foods: agriculture that is more environmentally friendly?\n\n【3】Let’s ask a question: What is a green agriculture? Is it one that doesn’t depend on pesticides? I think it’s a lot more than that, actually. But if we just consider avoiding pesticide use, we now have some data on the impacts of engineered crops. Surveys of American farmers by the Department of Agriculture show that the use of Bt [pest-resistant] corn aimed at the corn borer, for example, hasn’t done much to reduce the application of pesticides to corn, because the vast majority of corn acreage isn’t treated with pesticide to control that pest.\n\n【4】The introduction of Bt cotton, however, has resulted in a measurable drop in pesticide use. That’s good for the environment and good for the farmers who grow those crops. But I think most scientists expect that new Bt crops that are deployed will lead—sooner rather than later—to the evolution of resistance in the target pests, which means that the Bt cotton won’t work anymore. We are likely to run through Bt cotton just like we ran through all the pesticides before it. So it isn’t a durable path to a greener agriculture.\n\n【5】And there are environmental risks out there. Most scientists agree now that gene flow will occur—genes will go from genetically modified crops to nearby relatives. That means pollen will carry novel genes from the agricultural settings into neighbors’ fields or into the wild. Gene flow from herbicide-resistant GM crops into the wild is already leading to the creation of herbicide-resistant weeds in Canada.\n\n【6】## What about the health risks of GM foods? Do you see any looming problems?\n\n【7】I know of no reason to say the foods currently on the market are not safe to consume. But I don’t have as much confidence as I should in that statement. There was a letter published in the journal *Science* last June from someone who had searched the literature for peer-reviewed studies comparing GM food to non-GM food. The researcher found something like five studies. That’s not enough of a basis on which to claim, from a scientific standpoint, that we know enough to assure ourselves that these foods are going to be safe.\n\n【8】With the little we know about the food safety issue, I would say the biggest concern is allergenicity. Introducing new toxins into food is also a risk. Of course, breeders are going to try to avoid doing that, but plants have lots of toxins in them; scientists manipulate systems that they don’t completely understand, one of the unexpected effects could be turning on genes for toxins. There are rules that govern how genes come together and come apart in traditional breeding. We’re not obeying those rules.\n\n【9】## So you don’t see genetic engineering of crops to be an extension of traditional breeding?\n\n【10】No, not at all. You just can’t get an elephant to mate with a corn plant. Scientists are making combinations of genes that are not found in nature.\n\n【11】From a scientific standpoint, there is no dispute that this is fundamentally different from what has been done before. And that it is unnatural. Now, because it’s new and unnatural doesn’t necessarily mean that it will prove to be more risky. But it is certainly a big enough break with what we have done before to demand an extra measure of caution.\n\n【12】And caution is particularly appropriate where the technology involves our food supply. Lots and lots of people—virtually the whole population—could be exposed to genetically engineered foods, and yet we have only a handful of studies in the peer-reviewed literature addressing their safety. The question is, do we assume that technology is safe based on an argument from analogy with the extension of traditional breeding, or do we prove it? The scientist in me wants to prove it is safe. Why test assumptions when you can go into the lab?\n\n【13】## Science can never prove that any technology is 100 percent safe. Will you ever be satisfied that we’ve tested GM foods enough? And how much risk is acceptable?\n\n【14】Sure, I could be satisfied that GM foods have been adequately tested. But it’s premature to address that question now. Nobody is saying, “Look, we’ve got this large body of peer-reviewed experimental data comparing GM with non-GM foods on a number of criteria that demonstrate the food is safe.”\n\n【15】When we have generated such a body of evidence, then there will be an issue of whether what we have is enough. And eventually, if things go well, we’ll get to a point where we say, we’ve been cautious, but now we’re going to move ahead—we need to fish or cut bait. But we’re nowhere near that point now.\n\n【16】Obviously, we take risks all the time. But why are we taking these risks? If we didn’t have an abundant food supply, if we didn’t have something like 300,000 food products on our shelves already, then we would have an argument for taking this society-wide risk. But we’ve got plenty of food. In fact, we’ve got too much.

Cancer patients have a higher incidence of sarcopenia due to hypercatabolic and low anabolic states. This sarcopenia associated with malignant tumors, called cancer-related sarcopenia, which not only affects the normal metabolism of body components in patients, but also reduces the efficacy of treatment, quality of life and survival of patients. Therefore, it has far-reaching significance for the long-term survival of patients to do a good job in nutritional screening and evaluation of cancer patients, timely detection of cancer-related sarcopenia, and effective intervention for the long-term survival of patients. Based on this, the Chinese Society for Nutritional Oncology organized experts to formulate this consensus, which contents mainly based on the current Chinese cancer-related sarcopenia diagnosis and treatment status, evidence published at home and abroad, combined with the experience and opinions of experts in the fields of clinical, pharmaceutical, nutrition, nursing, etc., use the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) evidence grading and recommendation intensity standards, and focused on the screening, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment of malignant cancer-related sarcopenia for analysis, discussion and summary. Finally, the clinical diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer-related sarcopenia were formulated for clinicians to provide a reference basis for standardized diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【6】**Key words:** Cancer; Sarcopenia; Diagnosis; Treatment; Guidelines\n\n【7】肌肉减少症 (sarcopenia) 是一种以进行性、广泛性 的骨骼肌量减少和功能减退为主要特征的综合征 \\footnote{。临床上主要表现为肌体营养状态减退，常伴随呼吸、咀嚼、吞咽功能障碍，跌倒和骨折及死亡风险增加。肌肉减少症在老年人群中发生率 较高。数据显示，肌肉减少症的患病率在60～70岁老年人 中为5％～13％, 在80岁以上的老年人中为11％～50％ 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[1]</u></u>。 影 响肌肉减少症发生发展的因素包括合成代谢减弱、蛋白质摄入减少、能量代谢减少等删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[2]</u></u>。 肌肉减少症发生的机制较为 复杂，与多种因素密切相关。癌症是导致肌肉减少症的高 危因素，称为肿瘤相关性肌肉减少症 (cancer-related sarcopenia)，其特异性因肿瘤类型及患者的营养状况不同而异。一项研究表明，在65岁以上老年人群中肿瘤患者肌肉减少症发生率高达28.8％ 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[3]</u></u>。肿瘤相关性肌肉减少症多伴有高代谢、低合成代谢状态，与炎症因子过度释放、严重营养不良相关，还会降低抗肿瘤药物的疗效，增加不良反应，降低生存质量，缩短患者的预期寿命。因此， 做好肿瘤患者的营养筛查和评估及时发现和干预肿瘤相关 性肌肉减少症，并针对性治疗，对肿瘤患者的长期生存具有积极意义。\n\n【8】#### 1 指南制订基本信息\n\n【9】1.1 目标\n本指南目标是规范肿瘤相关性肌肉减少症的诊断和治疗，将在国内相关领域专家意见分歧合并，最终整合形成多学科团队的临床治疗共识，对肿瘤相关性肌肉减少症的临床筛查、评估、治疗提供可操作的参考指南。同时，本指南将为临床医师及其他相关领域提供临床诊疗指导依据。\n\n疑似页脚【10】1.2 指南制定的负责人\n本指南制定的主要负责人是中国抗癌协会肿瘤营养专业委员会及其团队成员，其主要统筹中国营养学与专家共识，并结合多学科领域的实际情况。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 0, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2022】全科室最全临床指南+专家共识（最全版）/2022全科室临床指南/肿瘤科/肿瘤相关性肌肉减少症临床诊断与治疗指南（2022）.pdf"}}

Global images of the plasmasphere from IMAGE's EUV instrument have now confirmed this 30-year-old hypothesis 删除9:<u>[see illustration at left]</u>. At the same time, the images have revealed structures in the plasmasphere that raise new questions about its dynamic response to magnetospheric disturbances.\n\n【2】### On the Horizon\n\n【3】Although IMAGE has opened a new window on the magnetosphere, our view of space weather is still imperfect. Unlike terrestrial clouds, the clouds of plasma seen by IMAGE are completely transparent: nothing is hidden from sight, but depth perception is lacking. Thus, there will always be the need for satellites that make local measurements of the plasmas, as well as the fields and currents that govern their motion.\n\n【4】The next step for space weather observation will involve clusters of satellites acting like hurricane-hunter planes—they will go where the action is. The European Space Agency is conducting the first such mission, called Cluster II, which was launched in the summer of 2000. 删除19:<u>(A predecessor mission, Cluster I, was destroyed in a rocket explosion just after liftoff in 1996.)</u> Cluster II consists of four closely grouped identical spacecraft designed to probe turbulent plasma phenomena in the magnetosphere and nearby solar wind. NASA is planning a similar cluster mission for launch in 2004. The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission will study reconnection, charged particle acceleration, and turbulence at the dayside magnetopause and at specific locations in the magnetotail where substorms are triggered.\n\n【5】The space agencies are considering even more ambitious missions involving constellations of satellites: dozens of tiny spacecraft that will monitor large regions of space, just as the global weather networks now monitor conditions on the earth. The first constellations will most likely observe the inner magnetosphere and the dayside magnetopause, with each cake-size craft recording the basic characteristics of the plasmas and magnetic fields.\n\n【6】The earth’s magnetosphere is at once protective and dangerous. Its strong magnetic field shields humans from penetrating radiation that would otherwise be lethal. But the field is not strong enough to ward off the most powerful shock waves from the sun. Like the tornado belt or the tropical cyclone zone, the magnetosphere is a place of sudden storms.

The survey was based on an in-person discussion at the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome (ESSTS) meeting in Lausanne in June 2022. Members of an invited group with extensive clinical experience working with patients with TS and FTLB discussed potential clinical criteria for diagnosis of FTLB. An initial set of criteria was developed based on common clinical experiences and review of the literature on FTLB and revised through iterative discussions, resulting in the survey items for voting.\n\n【3】### Results\n24 members of the working group were invited to participate in the Delphi process.

Intel, the company that has served as the standard bearer for Moore’s law, has waged a five-year crusade to develop a method of printing circuit patterns on chips that could take the reigning CMOS chip technology until circuits can be made no smaller, the last data point on the Moore curve.\n\n【4】These new lithographic machines for making billion-transistor microprocessors will mark one of the most spectacular forays into the realm of nanotechnology, the precise manipulation of matter at the scale of a few billionths of a meter. The Intel-nurtured technology—extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV)—has recently created one of its first images of a whole chip at a Department of Energy laboratory set up to engineer nuclear weapons. At a wavelength of 13 nanometers, EUV will eventually have the ability to print a transistor element just 40 atoms in width.\n\n【5】Progress toward what the industry calls its next-generation lithography lends credence to Intel’s strategy of relying on collaborations with universities or national laboratories to tap a wellspring of basic research and development resources. The Intel approach stands in marked contrast to the large centralized laboratories built by AT&T, IBM and Xerox, which have often invented technologies that they never succeeded in commercializing. “The classic research model never worked,” says G.

Bush managed in one fell swoop to alienate myriad family-planning groups, women’s health organizations, physicians and European allies. A memo to the U.S. Agency for International Development revived what is officially known as the Mexico City Policy—or, less formally, the Global Gag Rule. The order states that U.S. aid cannot dispense family-planning money to an organization unless it agrees to neither perform nor promote abortion. Rather than barring funds for abortion itself—the 1973 Helms Amendment already does that—the policy instead curbs health care providers’ ability to talk about medical options at organizations that continue to accept aid. For those that do not comply, the policy means a loss of funds for counseling and contraception.\n\n【2】Many public health experts say the effects of this order today may be more devastating than they were in 1984, when the policy was first introduced. The world is a different place with regard to the AIDS epidemic, the desire for contraception and family-planning services, women’s rights and attitudes toward abortion. President Bush’s initiative will cut money where it is most needed, says Aníbal Faúndes, an obstetrician in Brazil and a member of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. “Consequently, he will certainly be responsible for increasing the number of abortions instead of reducing them.”\n\n【3】Some of the places hardest hit may be those where abortion is legal, such as Russia, India and Zambia. For instance, the International Planned Parenthood Federation has been actively promoting contraception in Russia. As a result, Russian women have shifted away from abortion—formerly considered the only method of family planning—to birth control. In recent years, the percent...\n\n【4】### SETTING UP GAG RULES\nThe Mexico City Policy originated at an international conference on population in Mexico City 17 years ago. The rule, issued by former president Ronald Reagan, did not include a great deal of detail about implementation, and it was not until the administration of the elder George Bush that the policy was clarified in 10 pages of U.S. AID rules. President Bill Clinton lifted the policy by executive decree immediately after he took office in 1993. The Republican-led Congress reinstated the gag rule last year—linking it to appropriations for U.N. funding—but President Clinton waived it.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

In a process called reconnection, the field lines of the IMF connect with the northward geomagnetic field lines at the dayside of the magnetopause 删除11:<u>(1)</u>. Energy and particles from the solar wind rush into the magnetosphere, enlarging its northern and southern lobes and narrowing the plasma sheet. Then the geomagnetic field lines themselves reconnect 删除11:<u>(2)</u>, accelerating ions and electrons toward the earth.\n\n【2】The magnetosphere, weather results from the interaction between the earth’s magnetic field and the solar wind. The solar wind has its own magnetic field, which travels with the outflowing plasma into interplanetary space. As the wind carries this interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) away from the sun, the field lines typically stretch out so that they are directed radially (pointing toward or away from the sun). Under certain conditions, however, the IMF’s field lines can tilt out of the equatorial plane of the sun, taking on a northward or southward component. A strong and sustained southward IMF direction is a key factor in triggering geomagnetic storms. The IMF was oriented southward for many hours during the Bastille Day storm.\n\n【3】Protons are the dominant constituents of the solar wind, accounting for about 80 percent of its total mass. Helium nuclei make up about 18 percent, and trace quantities of heavier ions are also present. The average density of the solar wind at the earth’s orbit is nine protons per cubic centimeter. The wind’s average velocity is 470 kilometers per second, and the average strength of the IMF is six nanoteslas (about one five-thousandth the strength of the earth’s magnetic field at the planet’s surface). These properties, along with the orientation of the IMF, are highly variable, and it is this variability that ultimately explains the changing weather in space.\n\n【4】All the bodies in the solar system are immersed in the solar wind, which continues flowing outward until it encounters the ionized and neutral gases of interstellar space. The solar wind does not impinge directly on the earth and its atmosphere, however. The earth is shielded by its magnetic field, which forms a kind of bubble within the stream of charged particles emanating from the sun. The shape of this cavity—the magnetosphere—is determined by the pressure of the solar wind and by the IMF. The wind compresses the earth’s magnetic field on the dayside of the planet—the side facing the sun—and stretches the field on the nightside to form a long tail resembling that of a comet. This magnetotail extends more than one million kilometers past the earth, well beyond the orbit of the moon.\n\n【5】Between the solar wind and the magnetosphere is a thin boundary called the magnetopause, where the pressure of the geomagnetic field balances that of the solar wind. On the earth’s dayside, this boundary is usually located about 64,000 kilometers from the planet’s center, although the distance varies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 71, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

For high-grade metastatic osteosarcoma, primary tumor resection and resection of metastases (e.g., stereotactic radiotherapy) of metastases are recommended 删除19:<u>(Franzius et al., 2002)</u>. Osteosarcoma is relatively radioresistant and, as such, where surgery is not feasible, carbon ion or proton beam therapy should be discussed [IV, A] and, if available in the country, a consideration to perform such treatments in foreign centres could be considered [II, B]. Where this is not possible, high dose conventional RT can be offered [III, B].\n\n【1】#### 1.4.1.2. Low-grade osteosarcoma.\nLow-grade osteosarcoma includes central low-grade osteosarcoma, parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are useful to confirm MDM2 amplification in the context of parosteal and central low-grade osteosarcoma. For low-grade osteosarcoma, wide surgical resection without systemic treatment is the standard approach [III, A]. Marginal resection is acceptable in selected cases [III, B] 删除19:<u>(Cesari et al., 2011; Ginzel, 2005; Laitinen et al., 2015)</u>.\n\n【2】#### 1.4.1.3. Osteosarcoma of the jaw.\nThe usual treatment for high-grade osteosarcoma of the jaw includes neo-adjuvant or adjuvant ChT and wide resection [II, A]. High-grade craniofacial osteosarcoma could be treated in the same way as high-grade osteosarcoma at other locations [III, B]. However, some authors defend different approaches, to be in initiative with surgery, since the main risk in this location is related to local recurrence 删除19:<u>(Ferrari et al., 2017)</u>. There is not a clear reason to avoid chemotherapy in the context of high-grade craniofacial osteosarcoma, given the high rate of early recurrence, local or distant. For a list of high dose biomarker relevant adjuvant ChT is conditioning by the main ways to achieve long term event-free survival during high-dose ChT 删除19:<u>(Ferrari et al., 2003; Casali et al., 2018)</u>.\n\n【3】#### 1.4.1.4. Treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma.\nThe treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma should take into account the timing of recurrence and the number and location of the metastases 删除19:<u>(Lewis et al., 2007)</u>. Number and bilaterality of lung metastases; metastatic pattern and disease-free interval (> 2 years) are known prognostic factors for recurrent osteosarcoma. For limited number of lung metastases, complete surgical resection should be attempted, whilst definitive RT as alternative option for patients unfit for surgery 删除19:<u>(Bielack et al., 2004; Carrle and Bielack, 2006; Lewis et al., 2007; Yutani et al., 2017)</u>. The role of second-line therapy for recurrent osteosarcoma is not well defined but options include ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide, with etoposide and/or carboplatin; high-dose ifosfamide alone plus etoposide [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Berger et al., 2009; Fagioli et al., 2002; Gentet et al., 1997; Palmerini et al., 2016; Zogopoulos et al., 2006)</u>. Several oral antiangiogenic agents have shown activity, including regorafenib [II, B] and sorafenib [III, B] 删除19:<u>(Duffaud, Florence et al., 2019; Grignani et al., 2015b)</u>.\n\n【4】### 1.4.2. Ewing sarcoma\nThe general strategy for the treatment of localized ES includes neo-adjuvant ChT, then treatment of the primary tumour with wide surgical resection and/or RT, followed by adjuvant ChT [I, A]. In case of metastases at diagnosis, in addition to systemic therapy, any attempt to treat all sites of metastases with radiotherapy and/or surgery should be attempted [III, A].\n\n【5】#### 1.4.2.1. Molecular diagnostic and staging.\nAll ES are high-grade tumors and are defined by EWS-ETS fusion usually involving the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22, in a reciprocal translocation with t(11;22)(q24;q12). Recently, expert pathologists incorporated a new chapter identified as undifferentiated small round cell sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, in the new WHO sarcomas classification (Board, n.d.). This new section encompasses three different subsets, apart from Ewing sarcoma, namely EWRS1 fusing and non-ETs family gene small-cell sarcomas, CIC rearranged sarcomas and BCO rearranged sarcomas 删除19:<u>(Antonescu et al., 2017; Bridge et al., 2019; Kao et al., 2018)</u>. Most fusions of Ewing-like tumours can be recognized or suspected with classical histomorphology and a novel stain and IHC, but molecular confirmation is strongly recommended to confirm diagnosis [III, A] and to perform differential diagnosis with other previously mentioned small round cell sarcomas 删除19:<u>(Antonescu et al., 2017; Brennan et al., 2020; Gaspar et al., 2015; Grier et al., 2003; Macedo et al., 2009; Sorensen et al., 1994; Zoubek et al., 1994)</u>.\n\n【6】#### 1.4.2.2. Treatment.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for all Ewing sarcoma [II, A]. Chemotherapy is based in five- to six-drug combinations including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, dactinomycin and etoposide 删除19:<u>(Gaspar et al., 2015; Grier et al., 2003; Nesbit et al., 1990; Paulussen et al., 2008; Schuck et al., 2003; van den Berg et al., 2010)</u>. Administration of alternating VDC/IE have outmatched VIDE/AVA according to EuroEwing2012 trial [II, A] and is the standard for recommendation 删除19:<u>(Brennan et al., 2020)</u>. Current trial is cycle 9 cycles of initial combination ChT as induction, followed by local therapy and another 5–8 cycles of ChT, usually at 2/3-week intervals [II, A]. Short intervals (every 2 weeks) have demonstrated to be significantly better in terms of event-free survival than standard 3-week VDC/IE therapy intervals [I, B]. This difference did not reach a significant level in patients 18 years of age [II, B] 删除19:<u>(Womer et al., 2012)</u>. High dose consolidation with busulfan and melphalan followed by autologous bone marrow rescue improved survival over conventional standard chemotherapy alone as consolidation in a pivotal trial cohort with metastatic patients, achieving unmet long term event-free survival [I, B]. This is recommended as adjuvant treatment for young patients with localized Ewing sarcoma 删除19:<u>(Gaspar et al., 2019)</u> but not in patients with larger tumour burden polyurethane patients 删除19:<u>(Gaspar et al., 2019)</u>. RT may be given in case of unresectable tumour or postoperative residual disease to consolidate local treatment when surgical excision or to obtain adequate margins is not possible or considered as not obliged to RT, [II, A] 删除19:<u>(Schuck et al., 2003)</u>. The new treatment principles for extraskeletal ES are the same as for skeletal ES. Cases with metastatic disease at diagnosis are treated in the same way as localized cases, attempting to treat all sites of metastases with radiotherapy and/or surgery [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Haeusler et al., 2010)</u>. Whole-lung irradiation is an option for patients with clinically evident lung metastases as prophylactic use [III, C] 删除19:<u>(Bölling et al., 2008)</u>. For patients with recurrent ES, an extended time to relapse is a favourable prognostic factor [III, B] 删除19:<u>(Stahl et al., 2011)</u>. There are no standard ChT regimens for recurrent disease and options include cyclophosphamide plus topotecan, ifosfamide plus etoposide, high-dose ifosfamide, irinotecan with temozolomide or gemcitabine plus docetaxel 删除19:<u>(Ferrari et al., 2020; Fox et al., 2012; Saylors et al., 2001; Wagner et al., 2004)</u>. Interestingly, information derived from the rEECur trial 删除19:<u>(EudraCT 2014–000259—99, a multi-arm phase II/III group-European randomized trial)</u> showed that topotecan plus docetaxel was less active than the remaining high-dose ifosfamide, irinotecan plus temozolomide, or cyclophosphamide plus topotecan after the first interim analysis 删除19:<u>(McCabe et al., 2020)</u>. Additionally, in a second analysis, irinotecan plus temozolomide was significantly less active than the remaining arms 删除19:<u>(McCabe et al., 2020)</u>. Thus, high-dose ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide plus topotecan have shown to be the most active schemes in second lines of progressing metastatic Ewing sarcoma. The study is still ongoing, testing new arms.

The use of up-to-date, standardized CBA is of crucial importance. Both fixed and live CBA have been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for detecting AQP4-IgG; the use of other methods is currently discouraged. Confirmation of positive test results is generally recommended and a misdiagnary of red flags are present. MRI, CSF, electrophysiological, and OCT analyses can support the diagnosis. For NMOSD with negative or unknown AQP4-IgG status, obligatory MRI criteria exist. Particularly careful attention must be paid to ruling out differential diagnoses, especially in patients with seronegative NMOSD. The most important differential diagnoses include MOG-EM/MOGAD, MS, neurosarcoidosis, paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, and infectious diseases. In part 2 of this article series, we will provide detailed recommendations regarding the treatment of NMOSD.\n\n【2】# Acknowledgements\n\n【3】The authors are grateful to Healthgration Inc. for excellent organizational support.

Literally dozens of such processors are currently needed at each site to keep up with the demands of tele-immersion. These accumulate either as personal computers in plastic cases lined up on shelves or as circuit boards in refrigerator-size racks. I sometimes joke about the number of “refrigerators” required to achieve a given level of quality in tele-immersion.\n\n【1】Most of the processors are assigned to scene acquisition. A sea of cameras consists of overlapping trios of cameras. At the moment we typically use an array of seven cameras for one person seated at a desk, which in practice act as five trios. Roughly speaking, a cluster of eight two-gigahertz Pentium processors with shared memory should be able to process a trio within a sea of cameras in approximately real time. Such processor clusters should be available later this year. Although we expect computer prices to continue to fall as they have for the past few decades, it will still be a bit of a wait before tele-immersion becomes inexpensive enough for widespread use. The cost of an eight-processor cluster is anticipated to be in the $30,000 to $50,000 range at introduction, and a number of those would be required for each site (one for each trio of cameras)—and this does not even account for the processing needed for other tasks. We don’t yet know how many cameras will be required for a given use of tele-immersion, but currently a good guess is that seven is the minimum adequate for casual conversation, whereas 60 cameras might be needed for the most demanding applications, such as long-distance surgical demonstration, consultation and training.\n\n【2】Our computational needs go beyond processing the image streams from the sea of cameras. Still more processors are required to resynthesize and render the scene from shifting perspectives as a participant’s head moves during a session. Initially we used a large custom graphics computer, but more recently we have been able instead to draft commodity processors with low-cost graphics cards, using one processor per eye. Additional processors are required for other tasks, such as combining the results from each of the camera trios, running the imperceptible structured light, measuring the head motion of the user, maintaining the user interface, and running physics-based object-world simulations.\n\n【3】Furthermore, because minimizing apparent latency is at the heart of tele-immersion engineering, significant processing resources will eventually need to be applied to predictive algorithms. Information traveling through an optical fiber reaches a destination at about two thirds the speed of light in free space because it is traveling through the fiber medium instead of a vacuum and because it does not travel a straight path but rather bounces around in the fiber channel. It therefore takes anywhere from 25 to 50 milliseconds for fiber-bound bits of information to cross the continental U.S., without any allowances for other inescapable delays, such as the activities of various network signal routers.\n\n【4】By cruel coincidence, some critical aspects of a virtual world’s responsiveness should not be subject to more than 30 to 50 milliseconds of delay. Longer delays result in user fatigue and disorientation, a degradation of the illusion and, in the worst case, nausea. Even if we had infinitely fast computers at each end, we’d still need to use prediction to compensate for lag when conducting conversations\n\n【5】---|删除段之间换行-4|【6】**MORE TO EXPLORE**\n\n删除1:<u>【7】- National Tele-immersion Initiative Web site: www.advanced.org/teleimmersion.html</u>删除1:<u>\n- Tele-immersion at Brown University: www.cs.brown.edu/~tsh/teleI.html</u>删除1:<u>\n- Tele-immersion at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: www.cs.unc.edu/Research/stc/ teleimmersion/</u>删除1:<u>\n- Tele-immersion at the University of Pennsylvania: www.cis.upenn.edu/~sequence/teleiml.html</u>删除1:<u>\n- Tele-immersion site at Internet2: www.internet2.edu/html/tele-immersion.html</u>删除1:<u>\n- Information about an autostereoscopic display: www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/autostereo</u>\n\n【8】---|删除段之间换行-4|疑似页脚【9】**SEVEN CAMERAS** scrutinize the user in the tele-immersion setup in Chapel Hill.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 56, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma (ES) have a higher incidence in adolescents and young adults, with male predominance 删除19:<u>(Jawai et al., 2009; Mirabello et al., 2009)</u>. In contrast, chordoma and chondrosarcoma are more frequent in older population 删除19:<u>(Valery et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016)</u>.\n\n【2】## 1.1. General statements\n\n【3】- Management of bone sarcoma should be carried out within multidisciplinary reference centres for sarcoma or expert networks [III, A]. Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTB) should include at least the following specialties: medical oncology, paediatrics (if paediatric patients are discussed), radiology, surgery, pathology and radiation oncology. \n- A MDTB cannot be defined only by the volume of patients followed, but also by the periodicity of meeting (weekly MDTB is recommended), its contribution to clinical trials and scientific production, its participation in national or international guidelines. These MDTB ideally should be periodically audited to ensure quality. \n- All diagnostic procedures and therapeutic decisions should be discussed within a MDTB 删除19:<u>(Andreou et al., 2011; Blay et al., 2017; Mankin et al., 1982)</u>. \n- The diagnosis procedures are identical for all bone sarcomas . \n- Discussion of fertility preservation strategies is strongly advised in younger patients when systemic treatment is considered for localized disease, in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma 删除19:<u>(Casali et al., 2018)</u>.\n- Several reports indicate better clinical results and better cost-effectiveness if sarcoma or presumptive sarcoma patients are managed within MDTB [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Blay et al., 2019)</u>.\n\n【4】## 1.2. Diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\n\n【5】- The recommended imaging tests upon suspicion of bone tumour is x-ray of affected extremities and MRI of the entire compartment and nearby joints; a CT scan should be performed in case of a suspected bone sarcoma of the trunk and head and neck [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Meyer et al., 2008)</u>. Preoperative biopsy is strongly recommended. Core-needle is preferred to incisional biopsy, but both are valid when performed by an expert team [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Andreou et al., 2011; Blay et al., 2017; Casali et al., 2018)</u>, aiming to obtain enough material for a correct diagnosis. A fine needle aspirate is generally inadequate to make a sarcoma diagnosis, though it can be useful in confirming recurrence or metastasis. Central pathology review, with molecular characterization as appropriate according to pathologist and available resources (for example when Ewing sarcoma is suspected), is strongly recommended [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Abdul-Karim et al., 2004; Boardr; Casali et al., 2018)</u>.\n\n【6】## 1.3. Staging and risk assessment\n\n【7】- The initial staging to rule out distant metastasis requires chest CT scan ± abdominal and pelvic CT scan [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Picci et al., 2001)</u>. Whole-body FDG-PET or whole-body MRI may be useful for staging purposes if available [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Biermann et al., 2020; Buchbender et al., 2012; Volker et al., 2007)</u>. As an alternative, for osteosarcoma and ES staging, bone scintigraphy is adequate, if PET/CT or whole-body MRI are not available to exclude bone involvement [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Hungler et al., 2016)</u>. Iliac bone marrow biopsy is not currently a universally accepted standard work-up in Ewing sarcoma, as the percentage of bone involvement exclusively detected by bone marrow biopsy is extremely low (< 0.5%) 删除19:<u>(Cesari et al., 2019)</u>.\n- Adverse prognostic factors for localized (extremity) osteosarcoma include: large tumour size (different cut-offs used by authors, more than one third of the whole diameter of bone; or 15 cm; or 150 ml in studies considering volume), tumor site (axial or proximal limbs was worse), elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and older age (older than 15 years, but also older than 40 years) 删除19:<u>(Basile et al., 2020; Bielack et al., 2002; Bramer et al., 2009; Picci et al., 1994)</u>.

I had this vague, naive notion that if we could genetically improve plants with the new tools of molecular biology, we would find a way to make biotechnology relevant to agriculture.  \nThat has now happened. Biotechnology is a great tool that will allow us to produce more food on less land and with less depletion or damage to water resources and biodiversity. I am convinced that biotechnology is not just relevant but imperative for helping us meet the rapidly growing demand for food and other agricultural products. The combination of more people and rising incomes will increase the demand for food by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years.\n\n【2】**But critics of genetically modified foods point out that companies are not going to start giving products away. Can a corporation like Monsanto make biotechnology affordable for farmers in the developing world?**  \nCultivating commercial markets and applying technology to help the developing world are not mutually exclusive at all. One approach that works very well is to segment the market into three different areas. One is the pure commercial market. It makes economic sense, as a for-profit company, for us to invest in products and market developments in places where we can sell our products and where we think we can make a profit.  \nThe other end of the spectrum is noncommercial technology transfer, which is largely focused on public-sector collaboration. Take, for example, our collaboration to put virus-resistance genes in the sweet potato. We will never have a commercial business in the sweet potato because it’s just not a market economy crop. But by sharing our intellectual property and our technical knowledge with scientists from Kenya, we have helped them develop sweet potatoes that show resistance to the most serious sweet potato disease in Africa, which can cause the loss of 20 to 80 percent of the crop.  \nThen there’s a third area, what I call a transitional market, where we have less experience related to biotechnology but that in the long run I think may be more powerful and beneficial for development efforts.

Termination performed by a registered medical practitioner, is no longer a criminal offence under the Criminal Code; nor is it a criminal offence for a woman to consent to, assist in or perform a termination on herself. The purposes of the ToP Act are to:\n- Enable reasonable and safe access by women to termination\n- Regulate the conduct of registered and student health practitioners in relation to terminations\n\n【4】## 2.1 Performance of a termination\n\n【5】Table 1.

We also have observed a history of simple tics in childhood in a minority of patients with FTLBs, without any real impact or change on the expression of their FTLB in comparison to patients without a history of tics. Indeed, individuals with pre-existing tic disorders do not appear to be exempt from, and may be more prone to experiencing FTLB, just as is the case in other neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, in which a minority of individuals may experience nonepileptic seizures. Ganos and colleagues highlight the differences between TS and functional tic-like movements and areas of overlap. Since the publication of this seminal paper in 2019, we have had an avalanche of patients with FTLBs, and many of these tenets hold, although originally based on a much smaller sample of patients. FTLBs in the pandemic era start predominantly in adolescence or adulthood, its mainly involve the arms/trunk, with common interference with voluntary actions; there are atypical responses to anti-tic medication, and there is often coexistence of other functional neurological signs. It is unclear what the overall long-term impact of social modelling will be on the FTLB phenotype, and the prevalence of FTLB. We suspect that like all social media trends, the hype related to #Tourette and #tics will ultimately plateau and decrease in popularity over time, and this may in fact be already occurring based on anecdotal observation of clinical referrals during the past 6 months.\n\n【2】It is reasonable to consider the phenomenon of FTLB in the context of emerging observations about adolescent females with TS. In recent years, several authors have hypothesized sex differences in tic disorders. Results have varied between studies. We analysed 203 children and youth with TS/primary tic disorders (age at evaluation 10.7 years, SD 3.0, 48 females, 155 males) from our Tic Disorder Registry in Calgary, Canada 删除19:<u>(Nilles 2022, manuscript submitted)</u>. Age at tic onset and age at presentation were similar between the two sexes, a finding also demonstrated in a TS sample from Germany and an international TS sample. In females, the most common tics at presentation were simple tics (eye blinking (54%), simple head movements (54%), simple eye movements (46%), simple nose movements (44%), throat clearing (40%) and sniffing (38%)), as in males. Females had a slightly higher motor tic severity score than males but there was no difference between the two sexes in number, complexity and interference of tics, in accordance with earlier work. Another recent study in 201 individuals with tic disorders (age 4-65 years) found that age at onset and frequency, distribution and complexity of tics were also similar between sexes. Although mild differences were found in the group of patients younger than 18 years these authors have suggested that tic severity, tic complexity and related impairment may be slightly greater with age in women compared to men. However, these small differences between males and females with TS do not allow for the confounding of TS and FTLBs in women, in view of strikingly different presentation and phenomenology (in terms of type and distribution of behaviours, number, frequency, intensity and complexity) between the two conditions, regardless of sex. Furthermore, in some geographical areas, such as Germany, the female predominance in FTLB was less clear.\n\n【3】Independent of our effort, Trau and colleagues developed a diagnostic checklist for functional tics based on a retrospective chart review of children with typical tics (n=113), functional tics (n=31) and acute worsened tics (n=20) at a single centre. They proposed that patients with functional tics must have age of onset >12 years, that tics must be sudden and fulminant in onset and must include at least one of the following patient characteristics: 1. comorbid anxiety, 2. female sex, 3. lack of family history, or 4. lack of premonitory urge and suppressibility. In addition, functional tic patients must have at least two of the following: 1. “tic attacks”, 2. “blocking” tics, 3. frequent", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 ESSTS国际共识：功能性抽动样行为(FTLBs)的诊断标准(1).pdf"}}

Some 1.3 million Americans will undergo laser surgery this year, making the operation one of the most popular in the U.S. For about 2 percent of patients, however, laser in situ keratomileusis (better known as LASIK) has left them with vision that's worse or with annoying side effects such as starbursts when their pupils open wide. Now a more precise technique may lower the risks, offer better room results and even help eyeballs achieve the legendary vision of a hawk.\n\n【2】Currently in most LASIK procedures, a laser beam trims the cornea on a relatively broad scale. By correcting what is termed spherocylindrical error, the method usually results in light focused more accurately on the retina. But smaller-scale bumps and depressions that vary for each person go undetected and unimproved. That may soon change, thanks to adaptive optics—a system that measures light distortion and corrects it with flexible mirrors. It was adopted by earthbound astronomers to correct for atmospheric distortions and later borrowed by researchers—notably David R. Williams of the University of Rochester—who examined the eye's tiny rods and cones through its shifting vitreous liquid.\n\n【3】Further exploration demonstrated that adaptive optics could detect and compensate for imperfect cornea-lens combinations. Laboratory subjects achieved astonishing, above-average acuity, particularly in low light. \"When you're using the adaptive optics system, you just say, 'Wow,’\" Williams remarks.\n\n【4】Researchers are testing half a dozen or so instruments that rely on adaptive optics for laser eye surgery, known as customized corneal ablations. The first step is to map the corneal defects. Such a map can be generated in several ways: from individual points of light on the retina; from superimposition of a grid projected onto the retina (squiggly lines show corneal imperfections); or even from patients using joysticks to shift perceived points of light on markers. The data guide lasers in ablating tiny amounts of tissue.\n\n【5】For the moment, the technique is restricted to research status in the U.S. \"Everyone is racing\" to get government approval, says Marguerite B. McDonald of the Southern Vision Institute in New Orleans. Firms involved include Bausch & Lomb, Nidek, VISX and Summit Autonomous.\n\n【6】Considering the potential complications of surgery, the rush to substitute possible hazards for the minor inconvenience of wearing lenses may be hard to understand. Indeed, unless one is a baseball player, say, or has suffered previous eye damage, customized corneal ablation \"is essentially cosmetic surgery,\" comments Stephen Burns of the Schepens Eye Research Institute in Boston. \"Most people work in offices and have no reason to see to infinity.\"\n\n【7】Burns raises philosophical questions as well. Could the slight differences in focal distance created by corneal irregularities actually aid the eye in seeing a variety of light frequencies? If so, is that more desirable than excellence of vision at a single frequency? The rapid pace of innovation, however, would seem to leave little time to ponder such questions. \"There's so much happening, with so much equipment and so much money,\" Burns sighs. \"It's hard to keep up with it all.\"\n\n【8】---|删除段之间换行-4|【9】**Need to Know: Sight Lines**\n- A hawk's vision is estimated to be 20/5: it sees from 20 feet what most people see from five.\n- Adaptive optics mirrors descended from \"Star Wars\" missile defense technology—they were developed at the urging of the U.S. military to sharpen images taken of Soviet satellites in orbit.\n- There are several caveats to customized corneal ablations. Dilation agents added to the eye distort the cornea slightly, thereby affecting the data taken to program the laser. The eye changes shape over time, a natural process nearly guaranteed to throw any adjustment out of camber eventually. And corneal thinness may make difficult the resections needed to correct for problems of earlier operations, such as starbursts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 11, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

This objection, it turns out, may be applicable only when key minerals are left out of the equation. The idea that minerals might have sheltered the ingredients of life received a boost from recent experiments conducted at my home base, the Carnegie Institution of Washington’s Geophysical Laboratory. As a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie, my colleague Jay A. Brandes (now at the University of Texas Marine Sciences Institute in Port Aransas) proposed that minerals help delicate amino acids remain intact. In 1998 we conducted an experiment in which the amino acid leucine broke down within a matter of minutes in pressurized water at 200 degrees Celsius—just as Miller and his colleagues predicted. But when Brandes added to the mix an iron sulfide mineral of the type commonly found in and around hydrothermal vents, the amino acid stayed intact for days—plenty of time to react with other critical molecules.\n\n【2】### A Rock to Stand On\n\n【3】Even if the right raw materials were contained in a protected place—whether it was a tidal pool, a microscopic pit in a mineral surface or somewhere inside the plumbing of a seafloor vent—the individual molecules would still be suspended in water. These stray molecules needed a support structure—some kind of scaffolding—where they could cling and react with one another.\n\n【4】One easy way to assemble molecules from a dilute solution is to concentrate them on a flat surface. Errant molecules might have been drawn to the calm surface of a tidal pool or perhaps to a primitive “oil slick” of compounds trapped at the water’s surface. But such environments would have posed a potentially fatal hazard to delicate molecules. Harsh lightning storms and ultraviolet radiation accosted the young earth in doses many times greater than they do today. Such conditions would have quickly broken the bonds of complex chains of molecules.\n\n【5】Simple molecules could have used rigid mineral surfaces as the scaffolding on which they reassembled into more complex structures.\n\n【6】Origins scientists with a penchant for geology have long recognized that minerals might provide attractive alternative surfaces where important molecules could assemble. Like the container idea, this notion was born half a century ago. At that time, a few scientists had begun to suspect that clays have special abilities to attract organic molecules.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 63, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

That evening, painful red blisters erupt across his forearms. The celery—a newly-developed variety prized for its resistance to disease—unexpectedly produces a chemical able to trigger severe skin reactions.**\n\n【5】Traditional breeding methods generated this noxious vegetable. But opponents of genetically modified foods worry that splicing foreign genes (often from bacteria) into food plants through recombinant-DNA technology could lead to even nastier health surprises. The stakes are high: GM foods are sold in many countries. In the U.S., an estimated 60 percent of processed foods in supermarkets—from breakfast cereals to soft drinks—contain a GM ingredient, especially soy, corn or canola; some fresh vegetables are genetically altered as well.\n\n【6】Detractors cite several reasons for concern. Perhaps proteins made from the foreign genes will be directly toxic to humans. Maybe the genes will alter the functioning of a plant in ways that make its food component less nutritious or more prone to carrying elevated levels of the natural poisons that many plants contain in small amounts. Or perhaps the modified plant will synthesize proteins able to elicit allergic reactions.\n\n【7】Allergy was the big worry last year when StarLink corn—genetically modified to produce an insecticidal protein from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt)—turned up in taco shells, corn chips and other foods. Before the corn was ever planted commercially, U.S. regulators saw signs that its particular version of the Bt protein could be allergenic; they therefore approved StarLink for use only in animal feed, not in grocery products. They are examining claims of allergic reactions to foods harboring that corn, but a scientific advisory committee has determined that the amounts in consumer products were quite low and thus unlikely to provoke allergic reactions.\n\n【8】Proponents offer a number of defenses for genetically engineered foods. Inserting carefully selected genes into a plant is safer than introducing thousands of genes at once, as commonly occurs when plants are crossbred in the standard way. GM crops designed to limit the need for toxic pesticides can potentially benefit health indirectly, by reducing human exposure to those chemicals.

Advocates assert that growing genetically altered crops can be kinder to the environment and that eating foods from those plants is perfectly safe. And, they say, genetic engineering—which can induce plants to grow in poor soils or to produce more nutritious foods—will soon become an essential tool for helping to feed the world’s burgeoning population. Skeptics contend that GM crops could pose unique risks to the environment and to health—risks too troubling to accept placidly. Taking that view, many European countries are restricting the planting and importation of GM agricultural products.

The gusts of particles can have severe effects on:\n\n【2】#### Power Grids\nAs electrons cascade toward the earth, they create a strong current in the upper atmosphere called the auroral electrojet. This current causes fluctuations in the geomagnetic field, which can induce electrical surges in power lines on the ground. During an intense geomagnetic storm on March 删除13:<u>13, 1989</u>, a surge knocked out the Hydro-Quebec power grid, plunging large parts of Canada into darkness.\n\n【3】#### Satellites\nWhen particles strike a satellite, the craft's surface becomes charged. This buildup sometimes triggers sparks that can short-circuit the satellite's electronics. Also, space storms heat the earth's atmosphere, causing it to expand. If the atmospheric density at a satellite's orbit becomes high enough, friction will slow the craft and drag it downward. This process led to the premature fall of Skylab in 1979.\n\n【4】#### Astronauts\nA severe storm could expose the International Space Station to protons that could penetrate a spacesuit or even the station's walls. To protect its astronauts, NASA monitors space weather data. If an oncoming storm poses a risk, NASA will postpone or cancel any planned space walks and may order the astronauts to seek shelter in a shielded part of the station.\n\n【5】### It’s Not the Heat or the Humidity\n\n【6】Like weather on the earth, weather in space is extremely variable. Conditions can turn from quiet to stormy in a matter of minutes, and storms can last for hours or days. And just as terrestrial weather changes with the seasons, so does space weather, too, follows its own cycles. Solar magnetic activity, which causes flares and CMEs, rises and falls every 11 years, and therefore geomagnetic storms follow the same pattern. The Bastille Day storm took place during the solar maximum, the most active part of the cycle. Space weather also varies, though less dramatically, according to the sun's 27-day rotation period, as alternating streams of fast and slow solar wind sweep past the earth.\n\n【7】Space weather, however, arises from physical processes that are profoundly different from those responsible for terrestrial weather. The medium for terrestrial weather is the dense, electrically neutral gas in the earth's lower atmosphere, whose behavior is governed by the laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. The medium for space weather, in contrast, is plasma—very sparse gas consisting of equal numbers of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. Unlike the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere, these plasma particles are subject to the influence of electric and magnetic fields, which guide and accelerate the particles as they travel through the space surrounding the earth.\n\n【8】Terrestrial weather is driven by the sun's radiation as it heats the earth's atmosphere, oceans and landmasses.

Given the fact that no serological assay is 100% specific and taking into account the important and often life-long diagnostic and therapeutic consequences of obtaining a test result, positive results should ideally be confirmed, either in a second, methodologically different cell-based assay or, if such an assay is not available, at least in a second sample, especially in the case of low-titer results (e.g., at cut-off or only one dilution step above cut-off) or a non-approved (in-house) assay is used.

As the currently available serological tests for MOG-IgG (especially in patients with low titers) are of lower specificity than those for AQP4-IgG, this is particularly important before a diagnosis of MOG-EM/MOGAD is made and seronegative NMOSD or MS consequently dismissed 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[77]</u></u>.\n\n【2】## Practical recommendation—CSF analysis\n\n【3】Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not formally required to make a diagnosis of NMOSD according to the current diagnostic criteria; however, we strongly recommend lumbar puncture in patients with suspected NMOSD, since CSF analysis can support a diagnosis of NMOSD and help to distinguish the disorder from MS and other differential diagnoses.\n\n【4】Basic CSF examination should include determining oligoclonal bands, CSF white cell counts (WCC), CSF WCC differentiation (cytology), CSF erythrocyte counts, CSF total protein levels, CSF L-lactate levels, and CSF and serum glucose levels. However, we recommend to assess also IgG, IgM, IgA and albumin CSF/serum ratios (in combination with Reiber’s diagrams 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>173, 174, 226</u>]</u>), IgG/IgM/IgA fractions, and, if available, the so-called measles, rubella, and zoster virus (MRZ) reaction 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>68, 69, 76, 83</u>]</u>. The use of Link's IgG index is discouraged due to limited specificity, especially in patients with moderate to severe blood–CSF barrier dysfunction). While CSF-specific oligoclonal IgG bands are a diagnostic mainstay of MS (present in > 95% of continental European patients, lower frequency in Asian patients) and persist over time, irrespective of clinical disease activity, they are absent in the majority of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (present in around 25% at first LP in 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u> and in only ~20% of acute samples and 10% of remission samples in 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[79]</u></u>), AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD (present in around 35% at first LP in 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>), or MOG-EM/MOGAD (~10%) and may be present only transiently 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>76, 79, 83, 87</u>]</u>. CSF WCC≥ 50/µl, CSF neutrophils (occasionally also eosinophils), and an albumin CSF/serum ratio (QAlb) > 12 ×10^−3 are atypical for MS but nor uncommon in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (WCC≥ 50/µl in ~15%; neutrophils seen in ~50%; and QAlb ≥ 12 × 10^−3 in ~30% of all patients with acute attacks and in as many as 50% of those with blood–CSF barrier dysfunction) and MOG-Em/MOGAD (WCC ≥ 50/µl in 46% with acute myelitis, but only very rarely during acute ON; neutrophils in ~60% during acute myelitis and ~25% during acute ON; QAlb ≥ 12 × 10^−3 in 44% of all patients and 43% of those with elevated QAbl during acute myelitis, but only rarely during acute ON; CSF eosinophils in ~5% with myelitis and in a single case with ON). Of note (a) that the detection of MOG-IgG by live CBA seems to be associated with higher CSF WCC (especially neutrophils), is most often also increased in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (an additional albuminocytological dissociation due to blood–CSF barrier dysfunction in an AQP4-IgG-postive NMOSD cohort was reported in 17–80% of cases in Europe and Japan).\n\n【5】CSF analysis is thus critical for the diagnosis of MS and other differential diagnoses, and should be considered in all patients. It is important to notet (a) that the frequency and extent of CSF abnormalities, as detected by lumbar puncture, depends strongly on the lesion site (spinal cord> brain> optic nerve), reflecting the rostrocaudal CSF gradient and lesion volume, and (b) that CSF finds may be normal, even during attacks, particularly (often in patients with acute ON 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>76, 79, 83</u>]</u>.

And in San Diego, protesters smashed sorghum and sprayed paint over greenhouse walls.\n\n【4】This far-flung outrage took aim at genetically modified crops. But the protests backfired: all the destroyed plants were conventionally bred. In each case, activists mistook ordinary plants for GM varieties.\n\n【5】It's easy to understand why. In a way, GM crops—now on some 109 million acres of farmland worldwide—are invisible. You can’t see, taste or touch a gene inserted into a plant or sense its effects on the environment. You can’t tell, just by looking, whether pollen containing a foreign gene can poison butterflies or fertilize plants miles away. That invisibility is precisely what worries people. How, exactly, will GM crops affect the environment—and when will we notice?\n\n【6】Advocates of GM, or transgenic, crops say the plants will benefit the environment by requiring fewer toxic pesticides than conventional crops. But critics fear the potential risks and wonder how big the benefits really are. “We have so many questions about these plants,” remarks Guenther Stotzky, a soil microbiologist at New York University. “There’s a lot we don’t know and need to find out.”\n\n【7】As GM crops multiply in the landscape, unprecedented numbers of researchers have started fanning into the fields to get the missing information. Some of their recent findings are reassuring; others suggest a need for vigilance.\n\n【8】### Fewer Poisons in the Soil?\nEvery year U.S. growers shower crops with an estimated 971 million pounds of pesticides, mostly to kill insects, weeds and fungi.  But pesticide residues linger on crops and the surrounding soil, leaching into groundwater, running into streams and getting gobbled up by wildlife. The constant chemical trickle is an old worry for environmentalists.\n\n【9】In the mid-1990s agribusinesses began advertising GM seeds that promised to reduce a farmer’s use of toxic pesticides. Today most GM crops—mainly soybean, corn, cotton and canola—contain genes enabling them to either resist insect pests or tolerate weed-killing herbicides. The insect-resistant varieties make their own insecticide, a property meant to reduce the need for chemical sprays. The herbicide-tolerant types survive when exposed to broad-spectrum weed killers, potentially allowing farmers to forgo more poisonous chemicals that target specific weed species. Farmers like to limit the use of more hazardous pesticides when they can, but GM crops also hold appeal because they simplify operations (reducing the frequency and complexity of pesticide applications) and, in some cases, increase yields.\n\n【10】But confirming environmental benefit is tricky. Virtually no peer-reviewed papers have addressed such advantages, which would be expected to vary from plant to plant and place to place. Some information is available, however. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farmers who plant herbicide-tolerant crops do not necessarily use fewer sprays, but they do apply a more benign mix of chemicals. For instance, those who grow herbicide-tolerant soybeans typically douse weeds with noxious weed killer, turning instead to glyphosate herbicides, which are less toxic and degrade more quickly.\n\n【11】Insect-resistant crops also bring mixed benefits. To date, insect resistance has been provided by a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This gene directs cells to manufacture a crystalline protein that is toxic to certain insects—especially caterpillars and beetles that gnaw on crops—but does not harm other organisms. The toxin gene in different strains of B. thuringiensis can affect different mixes of insects, so seed makers can select the version that seems best suited to a particular crop.\n\n【12】Of all the crops carrying Bt genes, cotton has brought the biggest drop in pesticide use. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 1999 growers in states using high amounts of Bt cotton sprayed 21 percent less insecticide than usual on the crop. That’s a “dramatic and impressive” reduction, says Steven Johnson, an administrator in the EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs. Typically, Johnson says, a farmer might spray", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 36, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

If protein formation can indeed occur, this result becomes even more exciting, because recent experiments by other investigators indicate that some proteins can self-replicate. In the earth’s early history, perhaps a self-replicating protein formed on the face of a calcite crystal.\n\n【2】Left- and right-handed crystal faces occur in roughly equal numbers, so chiral selection of L amino acids probably did not happen everywhere in the world at once. Our results and predictions instead suggest that the first successful set of self-replicating molecules—the precursor to all the varied life-forms on the earth today—arose at a specific time and place. It was purely chance that the successful molecule developed on a crystal face that preferentially selected left-handed amino acids over their right-handed counterparts.\n\n【3】Minerals undoubtedly could have acted as containers, scaffolds and templates that helped to select and organize the molecular menagerie of the primitive earth. But many of us in origins research suspect that minerals played much more active roles, catalyzing key synthesis steps that boosted the earth’s early inventory of complex biological molecules.\n\n【4】**Getting a Jump on the Action**\n\n【5】EXPERIMENTS LED by Carnegie researcher Brandes in 1997 illustrate this idea. Biological reactions require nitrogen in the form of ammonia, but the only common nitrogen compound thought to have been available on the primitive earth is nitrogen gas. Perhaps, Brandes thought, the environment at hydrothermal vents mimics an industrial process in which ammonia is synthesized by passing nitrogen and hydrogen over a hot metal surface. Sure enough, when we subjected hydrogen, nitrogen and the iron oxide mineral magnetite to the pressures and temperatures characteristic of a seafloor vent, the mineral catalyzed the synthesis of ammonia 删除9:<u>[see box on page 80]</u>.\n\n【6】The idea that minerals may have triggered life’s first crucial steps has emerged most forcefully from the landmark theory of chemist Günter Wächtershäuser, a German patent lawyer with a deep interest in life’s origins. In 1988 Wächtershäuser advanced a sweeping theory of organic evolution in which minerals—mostly iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deepsea hydrothermal vents—could have served as the template, the catalyst and the energy source that drove the formation of biological molecules. Indeed, he has argued that primitive living entities were molecular organisms that adhered to the positively charged surfaces of pyrite, a mineral composed of iron and sulfur. These entities, he further suggests, obtained energy from the chemical reactions that produce pyrite. This hypothesis makes sense in part because some metabolic enzymes—the molecules that help living cells process energy—have at their core a cluster of metal and sulfur atoms.\n\n【7】For much of the past three years, Wächtershäuser’s provocative theory has influenced our experiments at Carnegie. Our team, including geochemist George Cody and petrologist Hatten S. Yoder, has focused on the possibility that metabolism can proceed without enzymes in the presence of minerals—especially oxides and sulfides.

The acuteness and severity of presentations was atypical for Tourette syndrome, with many patients seeking care in emergency rooms and requiring hospitalization due to the incapacitating nature of the tic-like behaviours. These rapid onset tic-like behaviours showed striking similarity between patients across the globe, suggesting the possibility of the role of social modelling through online platforms . Further examination of these patients suggested that this phenomenon was a functional neurological disorder subtype, which was possibly socially influenced, with underlying triggers related to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly anxiety and depression. The situation was deeply concerning, due to the level of distress of affected people, and the international scale of the problem. Specialty clinics for Tourette syndrome (TS) and tic disorders were suddenly overwhelmed with consultation requests for possible “late onset TS”, with more than doubling of referral volumes over the course of several months with no increase in resources .\n\n【2】Tic and TS experts were able to identify characteristic features of these functional tic-like behaviours (FTLB) that allowed them to differentiate them from tics in TS. Recognizing that the current situation was unsustainable for most TS clinics, the high level of distress of patients as they waited for diagnosis, and the need to optimise care, we assembled a working group of experts to develop criteria for the clinical diagnosis of FTLB to help general neurologists, paediatricians, psychiatrists and psychologists recognize and confidently diagnose this condition.\n\n【3】## Methods\n\n【4】To develop criteria for the clinical diagnosis of FTLB, we used a formal consensus development process, using a multi-round, web-based Delphi survey. The Delphi method uses an anonymous voting system that limits the dominance of the most vocal group members, allowing all an equal opportunity to express ideas and opinions. It provides more time to reflect on questions and make changes, using an iterative process that allows recommendations to be refined.\n\n【5】The Delphi survey was developed in English by TP based on an in-person discussion on this topic at the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome (ESSTS) meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland on June 9th, 2022. During this meeting, members of an invited working group of neurologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists with extensive clinical experience working with patients with TS and FTLB discussed potential clinical criteria for diagnosis of FTLB. An initial set of criteria was developed based on both common clinical experiences and review of all available literature on FTLB and revised through iterative discussions, resulting in the survey items for voting. Criteria to fulfil a clinically definite, and clinically probable diagnosis of FTLB were proposed, recognizing that clinical certainty regarding diagnosis was based on the concurrent presence of several defining features.\n\n【6】The survey was disseminated to all members of the working group by the ESSTS, and with panellists completing the survey anonymously on Survey Monkey. All items were rated by panellists on a 9-point Likert scale, with a score of 1 representing “inappropriate” and a score of 9 representing “appropriate”. The research team reviewed all responses, calculating median results and incorporating narrative comments provided by the panellists. Our established threshold for recommendation appropriateness was a median score of 7 or greater, and inappropriate if the median score was 5 or less. If the median score fell between 5 and 7, the recommendation was discussed for exclusion or revision with revoting by the research team. The recommendation was determined to generate disagreement if at least one third of the participants rated the item <5.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 ESSTS国际共识：功能性抽动样行为(FTLBs)的诊断标准(1).pdf"}}

In patients with FTLB, adolescent onset is most common, with only 22/294 patients (7%) in the international registry younger than age 12 at the time of symptom onset. This is in strong contrast to children with TS, with only 13/183 children (7%) reporting symptom onset after age 12 in the Calgary Tic Disorder Registry 删除19:<u>(Nilles 2022, manuscript submitted)</u>, and the majority (93%) of children in a large international registry 删除19:<u>(n=3500)</u> reporting symptom onset before the age of 10 18. While some clinicians on our panel have seen children with FTLB younger than 12, we felt that using age 12 as a cut-off allowed greater distinction between FTLB and tic onset. Evolution and escalation to peak severity of symptoms over days to weeks is also an important distinguishing factor, with TS patients reporting a slow, insidious onset, in comparison to rapid onset of FTLB. As mentioned previously, the international registry 12 had peak severity data for 172 participants, with latency to peak severity under 4 weeks in 70% of patients, and under 3 months in 76% of patients, suggesting that a period of a few weeks, but occasionally up to a few months, may be a reasonable time frame expectation for many patients. The phenomenology, particularly the complexity of tic-like behaviours, is also an important feature, with 48.5% of TS patients reporting no complex motor tics at their first clinical assessment, and 68.7% reporting no complex vocal tics. Only 9% of children with TS reported a greater number of complex motor tics than simple motor tics, 13% a greater number of complex vocal tics than simple vocal tics, and 19% two or more complex vocal tics in the Calgary Tic Disorder Registry 删除19:<u>(Nilles 2022, manuscript submitted)</u>.\n\n【2】While nearly all case series and the international registry report a strong predominance of female sex at birth in people affected by FTLB, we ultimately did not include female sex as a major or minor criterion for diagnosis of FTLB in the ESSTS 2022 criteria. Although female sex has been previously associated with the diagnosis of functional neurological disorders it should not be used as a diagnostic predictor 19. In the case of FTLB, the issue of sex and gender is complex and requires further analysis, as preliminary data suggest that people with nonbinary, gender fluid, and trans identities may be over-represented in this clinical population, for undetermined reasons20. Geographical variations in the proportion of patients with female sex at birth have also been documented, with both studies performed in Germany finding either a more equal distribution in cases by sex, or more male than female patients with FTLB.\n\n【3】Functional tic-like movements and vocalizations have been seen and described prior to the pandemic, although they represented a small minority of patients with functional movement disorders. Case series by experts in TS and functional movement disorders have tried to identify distinguishing features between tics and functional tics, recognizing the challenge in doing so, especially with only a brief period of observation and no historical context 21. Isaacs and colleagues noted in children and adolescents with functional tics that onset was dramatic, urges were less common, sense of agency was reduced, and that concurrent focused tasks in the same body area, during the clinic neurological examination, did not diminish tics22. Baizabal-Carvallo and Jankovic 23 described clinical features in a series of 9 patients and found that, in contrast to patients with TS, patients with functional tics were predominantly female, had additional functional movement disorders, did not experience premonitory urges, could not suppress their movements, and did not respond to treatments commonly employed for the management of tics. A case series by DeMarchi and colleagues24 found that absent family history of tics, inability to suppress the movements, lack of premonitory sensations, absence of pali-, echo- and copro-phenomena, presence of blocking tics, lack of the typical rostrocaudal tic distribution and the coexistence of other functional movement disorders were common features in their sample.

The process could have applications ranging from extremely precise measurements of properties of atoms to quantum computing.\n\n【1】Lene V. Hau’s group at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and at Harvard University carries out these tricks in a tiny cloud of sodium atoms chilled to less than a microkelvin above absolute zero. The other group, led by Ronald L. Walsworth and Mikhail D. Lukin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge, achieves much the same results in a four-centimeter-long cell of rubidium vapor almost as hot as boiling water. Both use the same two-step process to freeze the light.\n\n【2】First a laser sends a carefully tuned pulse of light into the gas. Usually the gas would be as opaque as a brick wall to this “signal” light and would completely absorb it. In these slow-light experiments, however, a second “control” laser beam is irradiated into the gas, making it transparent to the signal pulse. This effect, called electromagnetically induced transparency, was pioneered in the early 1990s by Stephen E. Harris of Stanford University and others. The control light interacts with the atoms and by a process of quantum interference eliminates their ability to absorb photons of the signal pulse. The changes to the gas’s optical properties also greatly slow down the speed of the signal pulse. Such slow light was demonstrated a couple of years ago by Hau and Harris and their colleagues.\n\n【3】Traveling through the gas in unison with the slow pulse is a pattern in the alignment of the atoms’ tiny magnetic fields, which exactly mimics the form of the light pulse. The combination of atomic polarizations and light is called a polariton. Stopping this polariton—the second step of the process—is achieved by turning off the control beam while the polariton is still traversing the gas. As the control beam’s intensity ebbs, the remaining signal light is absorbed, and the increasingly atomic polarization slows even more. At zero intensity, the last glimmer of the light vanishes into the atoms, and the polariton comes to a dead stop.\n\n【4】All the properties of the light pulse remain encoded in this motionless entity. The experimenters demonstrated this by waiting for a while—only a fraction of a second but aeons on the timescale of the original light pulse—and then turning the control beam back on again. The polariton is converted back into a pulse that now crawls onward to the far end of the gas and then speeds away through the air.\n\n【5】Of course, the storage and regeneration of the light is not perfect; the longer the pause, the more degraded the output pulse becomes. The atoms that carry the polarizations are not, after all, frozen in place. Diffusion and collisions steadily disperse and destroy the polariton—more rapidly in the hot gas.\n\n【6】The process achieves a key function needed for large-scale quantum-information processing, as would occur in quantum computers: reliable interconversion of fast-moving quantum states (light pulses) and robust stationary ones (polaritons). Quantum-computing expert David P. DiVincenzo of IBM cautions, however, that other aspects of the slow-light system are not so well suited for quantum computation. “It doesn’t produce a straight shot to a quantum computer,” he says. Nevertheless, he calls it “beautiful research” that is “a very positive step forward in the manipulation of quantum systems.”\n\n| A PULSE OF LIGHT | a brief burst of electromagnetic oscillations (orange), is compressed and slowed in the artificially transparent atomic gas (blue).

These six are also the major \"lifestyle\" diseases—that is, diseases that trace mainly to imprudent living, such as poor diet, obesity, lack of exercise, and cigarette smoking. Indeed, shifts in lifestyle account for much of the change in mortality rates over recent decades. Coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and colon cancer rates declined among both sexes. Rates of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both of which result overwhelmingly from cigarette smoking, declined among men but have been rising among women, a pattern that reflects the later adoption and subsequent abandonment of smoking by men in the years after World War II. Lung cancer and COPD rates among women, however, are expected to turn down eventually because of women's declining use of cigarettes since the 1970s. Diabetes registered a big increase in mortality rates, apparently resulting from the growing trend to obesity.\n\n【5】The prospect for future declines in the leading chronic diseases depends in part on trends in risk factors. Prevalence of cigarette smoking, which sends more than 400,000 Americans a year to a premature death, appears to be stabilizing at about 25 percent of the population. More disappointing is the rise in obesity. The substantial declines in prevalence of high serum cholesterol and high blood pressure of recent decades may be difficult to maintain, as those most concerned about their health have already mended their destructive ways, whereas those who remain at high risk are relatively resistant to change. That suggests that mortality rates of the major chronic diseases will not decline as fast in the coming years as in the past, but it is likely that the number of deaths from lifestyle diseases will climb dramatically after 2010, when the baby boomers enter old age.\n\n【6】With few exceptions, such as the discovery of insulin, \"magic bullets\" have played a minor role in the prevention, cure and palliation of lifestyle diseases. This could change because of new work now under way, including genetic research and promising cancer treatments. Such research, if successful, will probably have its greatest impact beginning in the next decade.\n\n【7】## RISK-FACTOR PREVALENCE IN U.S.\n\n| YEAR | CIGARETTE SMOKING | HYPERTENSION | OBESITY | HIGH SERUM CHOLESTEROL |\n|------|--------------------|--------------|---------|------------------------|\n| 1960 | 44                 | 35           | -       | -                      |\n| 1970 | 37                 | 35           | -       | 33                     |\n| 1980 | 33                 | 24           | -       | 26                     |\n| 1990 | 28                 | 20           | 12      | 20                     |\n| 2000 | 25                 | 18           | 23      | -                      |\n\n【9】SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n【10】## THE SIX LEADING LIFESTYLE DISEASES\n\n| DISEASE                             | DEATHS IN 1998 (THOUSANDS) | PERCENT CHANGE IN MORTALITY RATE, 1980-1998 | LEADING RISK FACTORS                             |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| CORONARY HEART DISEASE              | 460                        | -47                                          | C,H,S,O,P                                        |\n| STROKE                              | 158                        | -38                                          | C,H,S,O                                          |\n| LUNG CANCER                         | 155                        | +6                                           | S                                                |\n| CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE| 113                        | +34                                          | S                                                |\n| DIABETES                            | 65                         | +35                                          | O                                                |\n| COLON CANCER                        | 57                         | -24                                          | D                                                |\n| ALL CAUSES                          | 2,337                      | -19                                          | -                                                |\n\n【12】Risk-factor abbreviations: C = high serum cholesterol; H = hypertension; S = smoking cigarettes; O = obesity; P = physically inactive; D = diet inadequate (for example, insufficient fruits or vegetables)\n\n【13】SOURCE: American Public Health Association.

Strictly speaking, it is misleading to talk of “people high in self-esteem” as if they were a distinct type, but the need for efficient communication pushes researchers into using such terms. By “people high in self-esteem,” I refer broadly to those who scored above the median on the self-esteem scale. Statistical analyses respect the full continuum.\n\n【2】Many laypeople have the impression that self-esteem fluctuates widely, but in fact these scores are quite stable. Day-to-day changes tend to be small, and even after a serious blow or boost, a person’s self-esteem score returns to its previous level within a relatively short time. Large changes most often occur after major life transitions, such as when a high school athlete moves on to college to find the competition much tougher.\n\n【3】Quantifying aggression is trickier, but one approach is simply to ask people whether they are prone to angry outbursts and conflicts. These self-reported hostile tendencies can then be compared to the self-esteem scores. Most research has found a weak or negligible correlation, although an important exception is the work done in the late 1980s by Michael H. Kernis of the University of Georgia and his colleagues. They distinguished between stable and unstable self-esteem by measuring each per-|删除段之间换行-4|【4】\n\n【5】son’s self-esteem on several occasions and looking for fluctuations. The greatest hostility was reported by people with high but unstable self-esteem. Individuals with high, stable self-esteem were the least hostile, and those with low self-esteem (either stable or unstable) were in between.\n\n【6】Take a Swig, Take a Swing\n\n【7】Another approach is to compare large categories of people. Men on average have higher self-esteem than women and are also more aggressive. Depressed people have lower self-esteem and are less violent than nondepressed people. Psychopaths are exceptionally prone to aggressive and criminal conduct, and they have very favorable opinions of themselves.\n\n【8】Evidence about the self-images of specific murderers, rapists, and other criminals tends to be more anecdotal than systematic, but the pattern is clear. Violent criminals often describe themselves as superior to others—as special, elite persons who deserve preferential treatment. Many murders and assaults are committed in response to blows to self-esteem such as insults, “dissing” and humiliation. (To be sure, some perpetrators live in settings where insults threaten more than their opinions of themselves. Esteem and respect are linked to status in the social hierarchy, and to put someone down can have tangible and even life-threatening consequences.)\n\n【9】The same conclusion has emerged from studies of other categories of violent people. Street-gang members have been reported to hold favorable opinions of themselves and to turn violent when these views are disputed. Playground bullies regard themselves as superior to other children; low self-esteem is found among the victims of bullies but not among bullies themselves. Violent groups generally have overt belief systems that emphasize their superiority over others. War is most common among proud nations that feel they are not getting the respect they deserve, as Daniel Chirot discusses in his fascinating book *Modern Tyrants*.\n\n【10】Drunk people are another such category. It is well known that alcohol plays a role in either a majority or a very large minority of violent crimes; booze makes people respond to provocations more vehemently. Far less research has examined the link with self-esteem, but the findings fit the egotism pattern: consuming alcohol tends to boost people’s favorable opinions of themselves. Of course, alcohol has myriad effects, such as impairing self-control, and it is hard to know which is the biggest factor in drunken rampages.\n\n【11】Aggression toward the self exists, too. A form of threatened egotism seems to be a factor in many suicides. The rich, successful person who commits suicide when faced with bankruptcy, disgrace or scandal is an example. The old, glamorous self-concept is no longer tenable, and the person cannot accept the new, less appealing identity.\n\n【12】Vanity Unfair\n\n【13】Taken together, these findings suggest that the low-self-esteem theory is wrong. But none involves what social psychologists regard as the most convincing form of evidence: controlled laboratory experiments. When we conducted our initial review of the literature, we uncovered no lab studies that probed the link between self-esteem and aggression. Our next step, therefore, was to conduct some. Brad J. Bushman of Iowa State University took the lead.\n\n【14】The first challenge was to obtain reliable data on the self-concepts of participants. We used two different measures of self-esteem, so that if we failed to find anything, we could have some confidence that the null result was not simply an artifact.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 80, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Another backbone-research project, called Abilene, began in 1998, and it was to serve a university consortium called Internet2.\n\n【1】Abilene now reaches more than 170 American research universities. If the only goal of Internet2 were to offer a high level of bandwidth (that is, a large number of bits per second), then the mere existence of Abilene and related resources would be sufficient. But Internet2 research\n\n【2】tion called Advanced Network and Services, which housed and administered the engineering office for Internet2. He used the term “tele-immersion” to conjure an ideal “driver” application and asked me to take the assignment as lead scientist for a National Tele-Immersion Initiative to create it. I was delighted, as this was the logical extension of my previous work in shared virtual worlds.\n\n【3】Although many components, such\n\n【4】targeted additional goals, among them the development of new protocols for handling applications that demand very high bandwidth and very low, controlled latencies (delays imposed by processing signals en route).\n\n【5】Internet2 had a peculiar problem: no existing applications required the anticipated level of performance. Computer science has traditionally been driven by an educated guess that there will always be good uses for faster and more capacious digital tools, even if we don’t always know in advance what those uses will be. In the case of advanced network-research, however, this faith wasn’t enough. The new ideas would have to be tested on something.\n\n【6】Allan H.

It might not be immediately apparent why this problem is different from videoconferencing.\n\n【8】### Beyond the Camera as We Know It\n**THE KEY IS THAT** in tele-immersion, each participant must have a personal viewpoint of remote scenes—in fact, two of them, because each eye must see from its own perspective to preserve a sense of depth. Furthermore, participants should be free to move about, so each person’s perspective will be in constant motion.\n\n【9】Tele-immersion demands that each scene be sensed in a manner that is not bi-|删除段之间换行-4|【10】ased toward any particular viewpoint (a camera, in contrast, is locked into portraying a scene from its own position). Each place, and the people and things in it, has to be sensed from all directions at once and conveyed as if it were an animated three-dimensional sculpture. Each remote site receives information describing the whole moving sculpture and renders viewpoints as needed locally. The scanning process has to be accomplished fast enough to take place in real time— at most within a small fraction of a second. The sculpture representing a person can then be updated quickly enough to achieve the illusion of continuous motion. This illusion starts to appear at about 12.5 frames per second (fps) but becomes robust at about 25 fps and better still at faster rates.\n\n【11】Measuring the moving three-dimensional contours of the inhabitants of a room and its other contents can be accomplished in a variety of ways. As early\n\n【12】as 1993, Henry Fuchs of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had proposed one method, known as the “sea of cameras” approach, in which the views of many cameras are compared. In typical scenes in a human environment, there will tend to be visual features, such as a fold in a sweater, that are visible to more than one camera. By comparing the angle at which these features are seen by different cameras, algorithms can piece together a three-dimensional model of the scene.\n\n【13】This technique had been explored in non-real-time configurations, notably in Takeo Kanade’s work, which later culminated in the “Virtualized Reality” demonstration at Carnegie Mellon University, reported in 1995. That setup consisted of 51 inward-looking cameras mounted on a geodesic dome.

Will GM crops pollinate nearby plants, casting their genes into the wild to create superweeds that grow unchecked? What are the odds that the genetically engineered traits will lose their ability to protect against insects and invasive weeds, leaving GM plants suddenly vulnerable?\n\n【1】### At What Cost to Wildlife?\n\n【2】**In 1998 a Swiss study** provoked widespread worry that Bt plants can inadvertently harm unlucky creatures. In this laboratory experiment, green lacewing caterpillars proved more likely to die after eating European corn-borer caterpillars that had fed on Bt corn instead of regular corn. The flames of fear erupted again a year later, when Cornell University entomologist John Losey and his colleagues reported that they had fed milkweed leaves dusted with Bt corn pollen to monarch butterfly larvae in the lab and that those larvae, too, had died.\n\n【3】“That was the straw that broke the camel's back,” says David Pimentel, an entomologist at Cornell. Suddenly, all eyes turned to the organisms munching GM plant leaves, nipping modified pollen or wriggling around in the soil beneath the plants—organisms that play vital roles in sustaining plant populations. Another alarming study relating to monarch butterflies appeared last August.\n\n【4】But the lab bench is not a farm field, and many scientists question the usefulness of these early experiments. The lab insects, they note, consumed far higher doses of Bt toxin than they would outside, in the real world. So researchers have headed into nature themselves, measuring the toxin in pollen from plots of GM corn, estimating how much of it drifts onto plants such as milkweed and, finally, determining the exposure of butterfly and moth larvae to the protein. Much of that work, done during the 2000 growing season, is slated to be reported to the EPA shortly.\n\n【5】According to the agency, however, preliminary studies evaluating the two most common Bt corn plants (from Novartis and Monsanto) already indicate that monarch larvae encounter Bt corn pollen on milkweed plants—but at levels too low to be toxic. What is toxic? The EPA estimates that the insects face no observable harm when consuming milkweed leaves laden with up to 150 corn pollen grains per square centimeter of leaf surface. Recent studies of milkweed plants in and around the cornfields of Maryland, Nebraska and Ontario report far lower levels of Bt pollen, ranging from just six to 78 grains of Bt corn pollen per square centimeter of milkweed leaf surface. “The weight of the evidence suggests Bt corn pollen in the field does not pose a hazard to monarch larvae,” concludes EPA scientist Zigfridas Vaituzis, who heads the agency's team studying the ecological effects of Bt crops.\n\n【6】But the jury is still out. “There's not much evidence either way,” notes Jane Rissler of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This issue of nontarget effects is just a black hole, and EPA has very little good data at this point to conclude whether the monarch butterfly problem is real, particularly in the long term.”\n\n【7】In an EPA meeting on GM crops last fall, Vaituzis acknowledged the lack of long-term data on Bt crops and insect populations. Such studies “require more time than has been available since the registration of Bt crops,” Vaituzis remarked. The EPA,\n\n【8】### The weight of evidence suggests that pollen from insect-resistant corn plants in the field does not pose a hazard to the larvae of monarch butterflies. But the jury is still out.\n\n【9】---\n\n【10】### Three Worries\n\n| 1 INNOCENT CREATURES WILL BE HURT by insecticides built into many GM crops. | 2 SUPERWEEDS WILL ARISE as genes that give crops the ability to kill insect pests or to withstand herbicides find their way into weeds. | 3 GM CROPS WILL SUDDENLY FAIL because insect pests will evolve tolerance to built-in insecticides and because weeds will evolve immunity to herbicides spread over fields of herbicide-tolerant GM plants. |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **What the research says:** Laboratory studies indicate that nontarget insects, such as monarch butterflies, could be harmed, but field studies suggest that the risk is small. | **What the research says:** Studies have found no superweeds, but anecdotal reports have surfaced.

Small farmers can see results in a demonstration plot and, if they want, try it themselves on a portion of their farm. If it works for them, they can expand or repeat it the next year. We have programs like this in Mexico, India and parts of Africa. By the third or fourth year, if it’s working, the farmers will have made enough money from the experimentation phase to be able to run essentially on their own.\n\n【1】And what about profits for Monsanto?\nWe sell the seeds and the herbicide at market prices, and we subsidize the learning, the testing and the development of distribution channels so that we don’t actually make a profit in the first several years. Only if the project is successful enough to become self-sustaining will we start making a profit. At this point, we haven’t gotten that far with any of these programs.\n\n【2】Let’s turn to the environmental effects of GM crops. What do you consider the most important benefits of the technology?\nLower use of pesticides is the environmental benefit that people relate to immediately, and it’s huge for a product like Bt cotton. \n*[Editors’ note: Bt crops have been genetically modified to produce a bacterial protein that kills certain insect pests.]* According to a recent report, 2.7 million pounds of pesticides have not been used in the past four years, and many more won’t be used in the future as biotech expands in acreage and in more kinds of plants.\n\n【3】Beyond that there are also yield benefits. The Bt cotton we have today doesn’t displace a whole lot of insecticides, but what it does do is displace a big share of the spraying. It depends on the year and on the region, but the increase in yield can range from 5 to 15 percent. If you think about it, that leverages land use, water use, fertilizer use and all the pesticides that go into growing corn. You get a 10 percent per corn harvest with the same resources that you were going to use anyway. You’re getting more out of your resources.\n\n【4】Getting more from really good farmland, then setting aside land that is of marginal quality and returning it to habitat for wildlife is very beneficial to the environment. We can’t continue to indefinitely expand our old practices—of chemical use, of water diversion, of plowing wild lands and converting them to farms, of nonagricultural sprawl and of the production of industrial waste.\n\n【5】One of the benefits of biotech that we first heard about was nutritionally enhanced foods. But despite promises of healthier broccoli, we have Bt corn. The famous “golden rice” is not available to consumers yet and is still in very early stages of testing. Will we ever have nutritionally enhanced foods?\nWe’re seeing progress across industry, academia and the nonprofit community. For example, we are collaborating with a nonprofit group, TERI [Tata Energy Research Institute] in India, on development of a product related to golden rice—golden mustard oil—that, like golden rice, is high in beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. This may help alleviate vitamin A deficiencies in places where mustard oil is a staple in the local diet.\n\n【6】While making improvements to food for the industrial world is not a priority for Monsanto, other companies and university researchers are working hard in this area. For example, Du Pont has developed a modified oil with an increased amount of the fatty acid oleic acid. This product has reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and is more stable upon storage. Efforts are under way to modify other fatty acids to make oils more healthy for consumers. Also, there is research ongoing elsewhere to increase the amount of vitamin D in soybean oil.\n\n【7】Monsanto and other scientists have also been involved in research that may help reduce the likelihood of allergic responses to foods. We have been able to take a protein that is currently an allergen and modify specific amino acids in the protein to dramatically reduce the allergenic nature of the protein. Other scientists are using this and other methods to reduce the allergenic nature of some foods, such as peanuts and soybeans, which cause allergic reactions in a significant number of people.\n\n【8】Monsanto has been one of the most criticized, even despised, corporations because of its role in the development of genetically modified foods. Has it ever been hard to tell people you’re an employee of Monsanto?\nI’ve had a few people react negatively, but my experience is that when they hear you speak as a person, rather than as a faceless entity that they are commenting on or the “large, multinational company.”\n\n【9】I think the company is making an effort to address people’s concerns about GM foods more openly. We’ve recognized that some genetic modifications are particularly bothersome. Among vegetarians, for instance, the idea of eating a vegetable that has an animal gene in it might raise questions. For certain ethnic or religious groups, there could be similar concerns. So we decided it was better to avoid using animal genes in food crops.\n\n【10】I don’t think it serves anybody’s interest—including Monsanto’s—to discount the potential risks of biotechnology. But for where we are today, and for what I see in the pipeline for the next few years, I really don’t see a measurable risk from the GM products we are selling or developing. There have been numerous national and international scientific organizations that have reached this same conclusion, including the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization and many others.\n\n【11】We at Monsanto have recently pledged to listen better to and engage in dialogue with concerned groups, to be more transparent in the methods we use and the data we have about safety, to respect the cultural and ethical concerns of others, to share our technology with developing countries, and to make sure we deliver real benefits to our customers and to the environment. I think this new attitude and new set of commitments will help improve both our company’s image and the acceptance of this new technology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 45, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

I hadn't moved the modem at all (it was still sitting on my office desk), so I wondered what was causing the variation in transmission rates. The technical experts at Wireless WebConnect speculated that the most likely cause was radio interference from devices such as cordless phones that use the same band of the spectrum as Ricochet. But the folks at Metricom said the real culprit was heavier usage of the network during peak times, which reduces everyone's transmission rate. After learning about my problem, Metricom upgraded my modem's software by sending a few therapeutic wireless signals over the network. My data rates became less variable, ranging from 120 to 188 kbps. The company said I'd get even better speeds if I had a Universal Serial Bus on my laptop.\n\n【1】Now I was ready to give Ricochet a road test. I tucked the laptop under my arm, left the office and hailed a taxi. The modem is designed to work in cars and trains moving up to 70 miles per hour, but this was impossible to confirm in New York traffic. Traveling at half that speed through Manhattan's Upper West Side, I got a connection of 86 kbps. I have to admit, it was exhilarating to be checking stock quotes while cruising down Columbus Avenue. I scrolled through a financial news Web site and learned that the Nasdaq index was falling again. I read an article about the woes of the semiconductor industry, then hopped over to a stock-trading Web site. But then I asked myself, What good is this? Am I really going to start trading stocks from the backseat of a cab? Who am I kidding?\n\n【2】Ultimately, the value of a wireless connection depends on how much you use it. If you want nonstop Internet access for buying stocks, sending e-mail, reading the news or booking airline reservations, then Ricochet may be for you. The modem may also come in handy if you travel frequently. But if you're a homebody and a schlemiel like me, you may not find the system very useful.\n\n【3】*Mark Alpert is a member of Scientific American's board of editors.*\n\n【4】---|删除段之间换行-4|【5】**Learn Another Language on Your Own!**\n\n【6】Learn to speak a foreign language fluently on your own and at your own pace with what are considered the finest in-depth courses available.

Having one contract with three labs cut some of the red tape that usually discourages companies from seeking such collaborations. Later Intel brought in other chip manufacturers, including competitors AMD, Motorola, Micron and Infineon—and lithography equipment suppliers ASML and SVG.\n\n【2】In 1997, at the beginning of Intel’s stepped-up involvement, looming technical difficulties caused EUV to be called a “build it and they will come” technology—if the apparatus was constructed, its worthiness as a chip maker would soon be evident. Although it bears some similarities to existing methods, EUV is different enough to make the average fabrication-line manager quake. Conventional photolithography equipment projects ultraviolet light (usually at 248 or 193 nanometers) through a mask—a sheet of glass on which are traced a chip’s circuit patterns. A series of lenses reduces the image to a quarter of its size. The image projected through the lenses is exposed in a chemical on the wafer. Another chemical treatment then etches away either the exposed or unexposed areas of the image, carving the circuit elements into the chip surface.\n\n【3】Things change at 13 nanometers, where extreme ultraviolet lithography earns its name. The mask and lenses, transparent at longer wavelengths, would absorb this radiation. So EUV uses mirrors for both the mask and the lenses. A laser trained on a jet of xenon gas creates a plasma that emits 13-nanometer radiation, which is focused onto a mask. The mask reflects the circuit pattern onto a series of curved mirrors that reduce the size of the image and focus it onto the wafer. The 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum that make up the mirrors and the mask have to be smoothed to single-atom tolerances. The entire circuit-printing process, moreover, has to be done in a vacuum because air itself absorbs radiation at this wavelength. And the mask will distort the image if it contains more than a handful of defects measuring even 50 nanometers, about 2,000 times narrower than the width of a human hair. The development team sometimes muses on ways to describe to the outside world the relative size of a 50-nanometer defect, comparing it to a search for a golf ball in a state the size of Maryland, a basketball in the state of Texas or a hair on a football field.\n\n【4】Physicists and engineers who designed and engineered nuclear weapons technology had to solve these challenges. Unlike AT&T, which conducted all development work on EUV at Bell Labs with only about 30 employees, Intel has only five full-time employees at VNL’s main facility at the Sandia laboratory in Livermore (although more than 10 others labor on developing proprietary mask designs and other EUV-related technology at several Intel facilities). “They’re using us as an advanced development and research lab,” says Richard H. Stulen, the virtual laboratory’s chief operating officer.\n\n【5】The company kept a close eye on how decisions were made at the labs. If alternative methods were proposed for making lenses, Intel would press the research team to pick one, instead of testing the merits of both. “Nothing got spent that they didn’t think would work,” Freeman says. “They didn’t do it Bell Labs style.” Intel also implemented the same detailed risk-management system that the company uses internally—essentially a rating system of things that could go wrong. This flagged a list of about 200 problems, some of which the 150 national laboratories researchers who worked in the VNL might otherwise have downplayed. At one meeting, the VNL staff mentioned that it would need to increase the power of the laser by a factor of 40, which raised a red flag for suppliers. “The chip equipment manufacturers rated this at a much\n\n【6】***", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 20, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

KLINE directs the division of pediatric hematology/oncology and blood and bone marrow transplantation at Atlantic Children's Medical Center in New Jersey, where he has been since 1998. Previously he directed the umbilical cord blood transplantation program at the University of Louisville and the blood and marrow transplantation program at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville. He received both his undergraduate degree and his M.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles. Kline has been a vocal advocate of the use of animals in research. In 1989 he wrote an essay for Newsweek magazine entitled \"I Am the Enemy,\" in which he took the animal-rights movement to task for having little compassion for human suffering.\n\n【1】In 1997 Gluckman and her colleagues found evidence that umbilical cord blood transplantation—even between an unrelated donor and recipient—is safer than bone marrow transplantation. Her group studied 143 patients who had received umbilical cord blood transplants either fully matched to two-thirds mismatched, the incidence of life-threatening (grade III or IV) graft-versus-host disease was just 5 percent in the related group and 20 percent in the unrelated group. It caused the death of only 1 percent of the related group and 6 percent of the unrelated group. In comparison, large studies using fully matched, unrelated bone marrow donors have shown a 47 percent incidence of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease, with 70 percent of those patients (33 percent of the total) eventually dying from the disease.\n\n【2】Umbilical cord blood transplantation has many other potential advantages over standard bone marrow transplants. The size of the potential donor pool is much larger for cord blood than for bone marrow, for example. The National Marrow Donor Program has required more than a decade to accumulate a pool of four million individuals who have been typed for potential bone marrow donation (the other 2.5 million donors are registered in other countries). But there are four million births in the U.S. annually, each of which is a potential opportunity to collect cord blood. The New York Blood Center has been able to provide suitable donors for 85 percent of its requests using a pool of only 13,000 stored cord blood samples. The pool represents just over a single day's births in the U.S.\n\n【3】Cord blood also has advantages in speed. Identifying a suitable unrelated bone marrow donor is a time-consuming process that takes an average of four months. During this period, potential donors are asked to go to donor centers to have blood drawn for tissue typing and testing for viruses such as the ones that cause AIDS and hepatitis. After a donor is selected, that individual must return, pass a physical examination, give his or her informed consent and then schedule a time for the bone marrow to be harvested from the hipbone using a needle.\n\n【4】In contrast, cord blood is readily available from a bank's freezer and has already undergone viral testing and tissue typing. An umbilical cord blood that can be...\n\n【5】One day an infant born with a genetic defect of the bone marrow or blood may be able to have his or her umbilical cord blood harvested at birth, repaired by genetic engineering and then reinfused.\n\n【6】A sample of frozen cord blood banked at the New York Blood Center.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 32, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Advances in understanding the molecular biology of cancer and the development of targeted therapies have revolutionized patient care. However, challenges remain in effectively managing the disease and minimizing side effects.\n\n【3】### Mechanisms of Chemoresistance\n\n【4】Chemoresistance is a major hurdle in the treatment of cancer. Understanding the mechanisms behind this resistance is crucial for developing more effective therapies. Several factors contribute to chemoresistance, including:\n\n【5】- **Genetic mutations**: Alterations in genes responsible for drug metabolism and DNA repair can reduce the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.\n- **Efflux pumps**: Overexpression of efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein leads to decreased intracellular drug accumulation.\n- **Tumor microenvironment**: The interaction between cancer cells and their surrounding stromal cells can create a protective niche, enhancing resistance to therapy.\n\n【6】### Current Strategies and Future Directions\n\n【7】To overcome chemoresistance, several strategies are being explored:\n\n【8】1. **Combination therapy**: Using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action to target cancer cells more effectively.\n2. **Targeted therapy**: Developing drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities driving cancer growth.\n3. **Immunotherapy**: Harnessing the patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells.\n\n【9】### Clinical Implications\n\n【10】The clinical implications of these strategies are profound.

Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\n\n【3】Was this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\n\n【4】Selectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation. One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offer to collect and store a baby's cord blood—for a hefty fee—in case he or she might need it later.\n\n【5】Such companies market cord blood collection as \"biological insurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n\n【6】ViaCord, a cord blood-preserving company in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed to use their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n\n【7】The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n\n【8】Questions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n【9】Sugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\n\n【10】Of more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks. What happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\n\n【11】Most public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\"\n\n【12】#### Born of Good Research\n\n【13】Umbilical cord blood transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that performs as well as or better than bone marrow for some types of procedures.\n\n【14】Its potential was first recognized by Edward A. Boyse of the University of Rochester and Judith Bard of Northwestern University, who found in 1974 that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow. In the early 1980s, Boyse recognized that umbilical cord blood could be used as a source of blood-forming stem cells, and his team initiated the first trials. In 1989 Boyse and E. Donnall Thomas of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle demonstrated that cord blood preserved with a cryoprotectant could be frozen for extended periods. The same year, Arlene Burkett-Blackman at the University of Miami and Robertson Parkman at the University of California at Los Angeles confirmed that cord blood cells could develop normally in animals. By 1992 it was clear that umbilical cord blood taken from a newborn could be used to generate all three major types of blood cells in an adult.\n\n【15】What's Bred in the Bone\n\n【16】Umbilical cord blood transplantation is based on selective use of stem cells determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\n\n【17】There are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each—one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\n\n【18】The genetic blueprints for making HLA proteins are found on chromosome 6. The rules of genetics dictate that the probability that two siblings will inherit the same maternal and paternal chromosome 6—and will therefore be good tissue-type matches—is only 25 percent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 30, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Usually, two MAP cycles are recommended as neoadjuvant treatment before surgery of primary tumor. It is relevant to synchronize the surgery after recovery of blood count (usually 3-4 weeks after the last ChTcyle) and to synchronize the starting of adjuvant therapy when recovery of surgical wound (usually after 2-3 weeks) (Bielack et al., 删除13:<u>2015, 2004</u>; Carafe and Bielack, 2006; Ferrari et al., 2005; Goorin et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2007; Marina et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2008; Whelan et al., 2015; Whelan and Davis, 19).

Re-resection should be considered in case of unplanned/inadequate surgery [IV, B]. If R1 resection was performed without option for reoperation, adjuvant RT could be considered after discussion in the MDTB [IV, B].

In 1994 the slow-softening FlavrSavr tomato became the first GM food to be planted for sale in the U.S. Since then, the land area devoted to GM crops has soared. James has tracked the changes annually since 1996.\n\n【5】In the year 2000, he says, the planted area continued to rise—by 11 percent (equal to 4.3 million hectares, or 10.6 million acres)—so that GM crops covered 44.2 million hectares, an area almost twice the size of the U.K.\n\n【6】Last year's increase was smaller than before, however, mostly because of reduced planting by U.S. corn growers. Among the reasons for their pullback were less need for the pest control provided by some GM varieties and worry that markets for GM corn were declining.\n\n【7】#### GLOBAL AREA OF GM CROPS\n\n| YEAR | INDUSTRIAL NATIONS | DEVELOPING NATIONS | TOTAL |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996 |  |  |  |\n| 1997 |  |  |  |\n| 1998 |  |  |  |\n| 1999 |  |  |  |\n| 2000 | 33.5 | 10.7 | 44.2 |\n\n【9】#### THE MOST COMMON GM CROPS\n\n| CROP | TOTAL AREA (MILLIONS OF HECTARES) | GM | NON-GM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SOYBEANS | 140 | 72 (36%) |  |\n| CORN | 34 | 25 (7%) |  |\n| COTTON | 25 | 16 (16%) |  |\n| CANOLA | 2.7 | 3 (11%) |  |\n\n【11】#### ...

In this case, a supercomputer will have to be fast enough to compensate for the extra delay caused by the travel time to and from its location.\n\n【1】Bandwidth is a crucial concern. Our demand for bandwidth varies with the scene and application; a more complex scene requires more bandwidth. We can assume that much of the scene, particularly the background walls and such, is unchanging and does not need to be resent with each frame. Conveying a single person at a desk, without the surrounding room, at a slow frame rate of about two frames per second has proved to require around 20 megabits per second but with up to 80-megabit-per-second spikes as elaborate gestural techniques become established. Each site must receive the transmission from all the others, so in a three-way conversation the bandwidth requirement must be multiplied accordingly. The “last mile” of network connection that runs into most computer science departments currently tends to be an OC3 line, which can carry 155 megabits per second—just about right for sustaining a three-way conversation at a slow frame rate. But an OC3 line is approximately 100 times more capacious than what is usually considered a broadband connection now, and it is correspondingly more expensive.\n\n【2】I am hopeful that in the coming years we will see a version of tele-immersion that does not require users to wear special glasses or any other devices. Ken Perlin of New York University has developed a prototype of an autostereoscopic display that might make this possible.\n\n【3】Roughly speaking, tele-immersion is about 100 times too expensive to compete with other communications technologies right now and needs more polishing besides. My best guess is that it will be good enough and cheap enough for limited introduction in approximately five years and for widespread use in around 10 years.\n\n【4】## Prospects\nWhen **tele-immersion** becomes commonplace, it will probably enable a wide variety of important applications. Teams of engineers might collaborate at great distances on computerized designs for new machines that can be tinkered with as though they were real models on a shared workbench. Archaeologists from around the world might experience being present during a crucial dig. Rarefied experts in building inspection or engine repair might be able to visit locations without losing time to air travel.\n\n【5】In fact, tele-immersion might come to be seen as real competition for air travel—unlike videoconferencing. Although few would claim that tele-immersion will be absolutely as good as “being there” in the near term, it might be good enough for business meetings, professional consultations and the like. Business travel might be replaced to a significant degree by tele-immersion in 10 years. This is not only because tele-immersion will become better and cheaper but because air travel will face limits to growth because of safety, land use and environmental concerns.\n\n【6】Tele-immersion might have surprising effects on human relationships and roles. For instance, those who worry about how artists, musicians and authors will make a living as copyrights become harder and harder to enforce (as a result of widespread file copying on the Internet) have often suggested that paid personal appearances are a solution, because personal interaction has more value in the moment than could be reproduced afterward from a file or recording. Tele-immersion could make aesthetic interactions practical and cheap enough to provide a different basis for commerce in the arts. It is worth remembering that before the 20th century, all the arts were interactive. Musicians interacted directly with audience members, as did actors on a stage and poets in a garden. Tele-immersive forms of all these art forms that reemphasize immediacy, intimacy and personal interaction could be developed with tele-immersion.\n\n【7】Undoubtedly, tele-immersion will pose new challenges as well. Some early users have expressed a concern that tele-immersion exposes too much, that telephones and videoconferencing tools make it easier for participants to control their exposure—to put the phone down or move offscreen. I am hopeful that with experience we will discover both user interface designs (such as the virtual mirror depicted in the illustration on pages 72 and 73) and conventions of behavior that address such potential problems.\n\n【8】I am often asked if it is frightening to work on new technologies that are likely to have a profound impact on society without being able to know what that impact will be. My answer is that because tele-immersion is fundamentally a tool to help people connect better, the question is really about how optimistic one should be about human nature. I believe that communications technologies increase the opportunities for empathy and thus for moral behavior. Consequently, I am optimistic that whatever role tele-immersion ultimately takes on, it will mostly be for the good.\n\n【9】---\n\n【10】## Tele-immersion Team Members\n\n【11】* **University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill**: Henry Fuchs, Herman Towles, Greg Welch, Wei-Chao Chen, Ruigang Yang, Sung-Uok Kum, Andrew Nashel, Shirah's Kumar 删除1:<u>\n  www.cs.unc.edu/Research/stc/teleimmersion/</u>\n* **University of Pennsylvania**: Ruzena Bajcsy, Kostas Daniilidis, Jane Mulligan, Ibrahim Vulkan Isler 删除1:<u>\n  www.cis.upenn.edu/~sequence/teleim.html</u>\n* **Brown University**: Andries van Dam, Loring Holden, Robert C.

Treatment strategy is similar to that of osteosarcoma with wide surgical margins including any soft tissue component in combination with CT. This group of tumors is considered chemo-sensitive. CT regimes based on doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and/or platinum are generally recommended [IV, B] 删除19:<u>(Bramwell et al., 1999)</u>. The role of HDMTX in these tumors remains unclear. The added value of platinum compounds in this context is also unknown [IV, C] 删除19:<u>(Nooij et al., 2005)</u>. RT may be considered for inoperable lesions. Adjuvant RT may be considered for lesions which have been operated (R1) or in case of local relapse [IV, C].\n\n【2】1.4.4. Chondrosarcoma\n\n【3】Most chondrosarcoma are grade 1: when located on the limbs, the gold standard cartilage tumors management should be used in grade 1 chondrosarcoma for tumors at other locations (trunk and head and neck) 删除19:<u>(Bovee et al., 2002)</u>. Assessing the grade in chondrosarcoma can be difficult and will require an expert pathology review [IV, A] 删除19:<u>(van Maldegem et al., 2014)</u>. Other mesenchymal, myxoid, and clear cell chondrosarcomas are high-grade tumors. The therapeutic approach for chondrosarcoma is mainly surgical. Complete resection is the treatment of choice for the majority of chondrosarcomas and any tumors with an undifferentiated component [IV, B] 删除19:<u>(Puri et al., 2016)</u>. IDH mutation analysis may be considered as an option when a diagnosis of chondrosarcoma is suggested by radiological imaging [III, C] 删除19:<u>(Lu et al., 2013)</u>.\n\n【4】1.4.4.1. Treatment. Atypical cartilaginous tumors/grade 1 chondrosarcoma of long bones should be treated with intralesional extended curettage or enbloc cortical window, high-speed burr with or without local adjuvant therapy, such as phenol, cryotherapy and reconstruction with bone graft or bone graft [IV, A] 删除19:<u>(Chen et al., 2012; Leerapun et al., 2007)</u>. Pelvic grade 1 chondrosarcomas should be completely resected, with enbloc resection, or if this is not feasible, with intralesional resection [IV, A]. Grade 2 and 3 chondrosarcomas are high-grade sarcomas, irrespective of grade, if are located in pelvis or axial skeleton should be surgically excised with wide margins [IV, A] 删除19:<u>(Fiorenza et al., 2002)</u>. In pelvic chondrosarcoma, every effort should be made to offer limb-sparing bone resection (internal hemipelvectomy) whenever feasible. In inoperably, locally advanced high-grade chondrosarcomas, RT with proton beam or carbon ion therapy can be proposed [II, A] 删除19:<u>(Noël et al., 2004)</u>. Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is a very aggressive entity and can be treated as a high-grade bone sarcoma, with chemotherapy adapted to patient age. When wide margins are not foreseen with limb salvage, amputation should be considered in the high-grade chondrosarcoma context [IV, B] 删除19:<u>(Bielack et al., 2009; Grimer et al., 2007)</u>. Other options include cisplatin, ifosfamide, doxorubicin-based CT, or drugs such as doxetaxel [IV, C] 删除19:<u>(Fox et al., 2012; Italiano et al., 2013)</u>. On the initial resected variety of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma should be considered for adjuvant or neoadjuvant CT with a Ewing-type regimen [IV, B] 删除19:<u>(Dantonello et al., 2008; Frezza et al., 2015)</u>.\n\n【5】1.4.5. Giant cell tumor of bone\n\n【6】Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a benign, locally aggressive tumor with H3F3A gene mutations in most of the cases and low probability of metastatic spread 删除19:<u>(Amelio et al., 2016; Behjati et al., 2013; Liede et al., 2014)</u>. GCT of bone may suffer malignant transformation and can metastasize even in the absence of malignant transformation.\n\n【7】1.4.5.1. Treatment. Treatment options include wide surgical resection and intralesional extended curettage with adjuvant therapy, such as phenol, cement, and cryotherapy in carefully selected cases [IV, A] 删除19:<u>(van der Heijden et al., 2020)</u>. Some authors advocate that preferential treatment is intralesional extended curettage and high-speed drilling with local adjuvants including phenol, alcohol, or liquid nitrogen and cavity filling with bone graft and/or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) [IV, A].\n\n【8】Denosumab should be considered for unresectable or metastatic GCT [III, A]. The role of neo-adjuvant denosumab in operable GCT of bone is limited to selected cases in which difficult resection bone formation and periarticular ossification can render an easier surgical procedure, for example those tumors with a large soft tissue component [IV, A] 删除19:<u>(Rutkowski et al., 2018; van der Heijden et al., 2017)</u>. Side effects of denosumab, including osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures, should be monitored. Co-administration of calcium and vitamin D is recommended during denosumab administration. The duration of treatment is connected to the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) [II, A]. It is not yet defined the most convenient schedule, or duration for denosumab treatment in the context of unresectable GCT. The decision on the duration of treatment should take into account that ONJ risk increases over time in a dose-dependent manner 删除19:<u>(Chawla et al., 2019)</u>. The role of RT is limited due to the risk of malignant transformation [IV, B], while enrosumab is not seem to increase malignancy risk in GCT of bone [III, B].", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 4, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2022】全科室最全临床指南+专家共识（最全版）/2022全科室临床指南/肿瘤科/SELNET：骨肉瘤临床实践指南（2022）.pdf"}}

When the pressure increases, as occurred during the Bastille Day storm, the dayside magnetopause is pushed closer to the earth, sometimes by as much as 26,000 kilometers.\n\n【1】Just as the passage of a supersonic jet through the atmosphere produces a shock wave, the encounter of the solar wind with the magnetosphere forms a shock wave—known as the bow shock—some 13,000 kilometers upstream (that is, closer to the sun) from the dayside magnetopause. The region of solar-wind plasma between the bow shock and the magnetopause is known as the magnetosheath. Because of its passage through the shock, the magnetosheath plasma is slower, hotter and more turbulent than the plasma farther upstream.\n\n【2】Satellite detectors have indicated that the charged particles surrounding the earth are a mix of plasma from the magnetosheath (mostly protons) and plasma that flows out of the upper atmosphere above the North and South poles (mostly protons and oxygen ions). The proportions of this mix vary according to whether the magnetosphere is in a quiet or a disturbed state. During geomagnetic storms, charged particles bombard the earth at high latitudes. The resulting electric currents heat the upper atmosphere, pumping increased amounts of protons and oxygen ions into the magnetosphere. This plasma is stored, together with the solar-wind plasma that has gained entry into the magnetosphere, in a great reservoir known as the plasma sheet, which extends for tens of thousands of kilometers on the earth’s nightside.\n\n【3】At the heart of the study of space weather is a question:\n\n【4】---|删除段之间换行-4|【5】**A Space Storm in Action**\n\n【6】**First warning of the Bastille Day storm** was a solar flare on July 删除13:<u>14, 2000</u>.

At about the same time, SOHO's coronagraph observed a coronal mass ejection *(CME)* that soon deluged the spacecraft with high-speed protons, temporarily blinding its instruments *(middle)*. The shock wave and CME slammed into the earth's magnetic field the next day, triggering auroras observed by the IMAGE spacecraft's Wideband Imaging Camera *(bottom)* and a sharp drop in geomagnetic field strength at the planet's surface *(opposite page, middle)*. In this graph, called the disturbance storm time index, zero represents the normal surface field strength.

On one hand, the graft can fail if even a tiny amount of the recipient’s own immune cells survive to generate an immune response that deems the transplanted cells foreign and kills them. This graft failure essentially leaves the patient without a functioning immune system and extremely vulnerable to infection. Conversely, the transplanted cells can attack the recipient’s body as foreign in a dire phenomenon called graft-versus-host disease. Graft-versus-host disease can manifest itself as a blistering and ulcerating skin rash, liver damage that progresses to liver failure or severe gastrointestinal bleeding; it can quickly lead to death.\n\n【1】To minimize such serious complications in people who cannot obtain a bone marrow transplant from a well-matched sibling, in 1987 a coalition of national blood bank organizations persuaded the U.S. federal government to establish the National Marrow Donor Program to find the best matches for patients among a pool of registered potential bone marrow donors. The program—together with other, similar, international registries—lists 6.5 million names. But because there is only a 1 in 400 chance that an individual will be a match for someone who is not a relative, those in need typically have just a 60 percent chance of finding a potentially lifesaving donor. The odds are even worse for patients who are members of a minority group, because matches are more likely to occur between people of the same race and the registries do not have enough minority volunteers.\n\n【2】Even those who do find a suitable donor from one of the registries still face an alarming 80 percent risk of moderate to severe (grade II to IV) graft-versus-host disease. Scientists think this is because the matching process does not consider the many unknown minor HLA proteins. Although these proteins are not actively matched in sibling transplants either, the close genetic relationship of siblings ensures that many of them will be matched simply by chance. A good sibling pairing, however, still carries a 20 percent risk of graft-versus-host disease.\n\n【3】One way to slash this incidence would be to attempt to match all known HLA proteins, but that would drastically reduce the chances of finding any potential donor for a recipient. Umbilical cord blood transplantation offers a better alternative. Because of differences in the newborn’s immune system, immune cells in umbilical cord blood are much less likely than those in an older child’s or an adult’s bone marrow to recognize a patient’s cells as foreign and mount an attack. Umbilical cord blood cells also do not attack a patient’s body as aggressively as mature marrow cells do.\n\n【4】For-profit companies will preserve a newborn’s cord blood for possible use by the family later. Is that right when the chance a child will ever need his or her cord blood ranges from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 200,000?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 31, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Miller enclosed methane, ammonia and other gases thought to be components of the early atmosphere in a glass flask partially filled with water. When he subjected the gas to electric sparks to imitate a prehistoric lightning storm, the clear water turned pink and then brown as it became enriched with amino acids and other essential organic molecules. With this simple yet elegant procedure, Miller transformed origins-of-life research from a speculative philosophical game to an exacting experimental science. The popular press sensationalized the findings by suggesting that synthetic bugs might soon be crawling out of test tubes. The scientific community was more restrained, but many workers sensed that the major obstacle to creating life in the laboratory had been solved.\n\n【1】It did not take long to disabuse researchers of that notion. Miller may have discovered a way to make many of life’s building blocks out of the earth’s early supply of water and gas, but he had not discovered how or where these simple units would have linked into the complex molecular structures—such as proteins and DNA—that are intrinsic to life.\n\n【2】To answer that riddle, Miller and other origins scientists began proposing rocks as props. They speculated that organic molecules, floating in seawater, might have splashed into tidal pools along rocky coastlines. These molecules would have become increasingly concentrated through repeated cycles of evaporation, like soup thickening in a heated pot.\n\n【3】In recent years, however, researchers have envisioned that life’s ingredients might have accumulated in much smaller containers. Some rocks, like gray volcanic pumice, are laced with air pockets created when gases expanded inside the rock while it was still molten. Many common minerals, such as feldspar, develop microscopic pits during weathering. Each tiny chamber in each nook on the earthly landscape would have hosted a separate experiment in molecular self-organization. Given enough time and enough chambers, serendipity might have produced a combination of molecules that would eventually deserve to be called “living.”\n\n【4】Underlying much of this speculation was the sense that life was so fragile that it depended on rocks for survival. But in 1977 a startling discovery challenged conventional wisdom about life’s fragility and, perhaps, its origins. Until then, most scientists had assumed that life spawned at or near the benign ocean surface as a result of chemistry powered by sunlight. That view began to change when deep-ocean explorers first encountered diverse ecosystems thriving at the superheated mouths of volcanic vents on the seafloor. These extreme environments manage to support elaborate communities of living creatures in isolation from the sun. In these dark realms, much of the energy that organisms need comes not from light but from the earth’s internal heat. With this knowledge in mind, a few investigators began to wonder whether organic reactions relevant to the origins of life might occur in the intense heat and pressure of these so-called hydrothermal vents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 61, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Researchers produced the ion image using data from the satellite’s High Energy Neutral Atom Imager (the instrument is on the side of the spacecraft opposite from the Medium Energy Neutral Atom Imager). IMAGE’s Radio Plasma Imager charts the clouds of charged particles by sending pulses of radio waves from two 10-meter-long axial antennas and four 250-meter-long radial antennas. Although the spacecraft’s body is only 2.25 meters wide, the antennas make IMAGE one of the biggest sensors ever flown in space.\n\n【2】## The Perfect Space Storm\n\n【3】IMAGE’s instruments are designed to observe the magnetosphere’s plasmas, but they do so in different ways. The craft contains three Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imagers that indirectly measure ion flows. When a fast-moving ion (such as an oxygen ion) collides with one of the neutral hydrogen atoms in the magnetosphere, it sometimes strips away the hydrogen atom’s lone electron and becomes an energetic neutral atom. Because this atom no longer carries a charge, it does not have to move along the geomagnetic field lines. Instead it travels in a straight path from where it was created. The ENA imagers record the number and energies of the neutral atoms coming from a particular region, and researchers can deduce from those data the mass, speed, direction and density of the ions in that region.\n\n【4】The satellite also carries several instruments that monitor emissions in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imager measures the density of singly ionized helium atoms in the plasmasphere—a doughnut-shaped region of the inner magnetosphere containing low-energy plasma—by detecting the solar ultraviolet light that they absorb and then reradiate. The Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging system has two instruments for viewing auroras—the Wideband Imaging Camera and the Spectrographic Imager—as well as the Geocorona Photometers for detecting emissions from neutral hydrogen atoms. Last, the Radio Plasma Imager sends out pulses of radio waves that bounce off clouds of charged particles. It works like a state trooper’s radar gun: the returning radio signals convey information about the direction, speed and density of the plasma clouds.\n\n【5】During the Bastille Day event, IMAGE began recording the storm’s effects less than two minutes after the CME-driven shock wave hit the earth’s magnetic field on July 15. The Wideband Imaging Camera saw the stunning photographs of the aurora borealis triggered by the compression of the field. A movie created from the images shows a sudden dramatic brightening of a ring above the Arctic region—the auroral oval—with brilliant emissions racing like brushfires toward the North Pole. The aurora quieted less than an hour after the storm began but flared up again when a second shock hit at about 17:00 UT.

She explains her concerns about the effects of GM foods on human health and the environment.\n\n【2】### How did you become interested in genetically modified foods?\nI became aware of genetic engineering while running a program on toxic chemicals at the Environmental Law Institute in the 1980s. I was initially more positively disposed toward biotechnology than I came to be over the years. Like a lot of folks, I wasn’t very critical. But the more I knew about the technology and the deeper the questions I asked about it, the less likely I was to accept at face value the extravagant promises made on its behalf.\n\n【3】I should also say, however, that my colleagues and I at the Union of Concerned Scientists are not opposed to biotechnology. We think its use in drug manufacture, for example, makes a lot of sense. The therapeutic benefits of the new drugs outweigh the risks, and often there aren’t any alternatives. But in agriculture, it’s different. So far, at least, there are only modest benefits associated with biotechnology products, and it has yet to be shown that the benefits outweigh the risks. And there are exciting alternatives to solving agricultural problems that we are simply ignoring.\n\n【4】Agriculture isn’t like medicine. We in the U.S. produce far more food than we need. And we are so wealthy that whatever we can’t produce we can buy from somebody else. As a result, there are about 300,000 food products on our grocery shelves and 10,000 new ones added every year. The notion that consumers in the U.S. fundamentally need new biotechnology foods isn’t persuasive.\n\n【5】### But, of course, many scientists and policy experts argue that we do need biotechnology to feed the world, especially the developing world.\nThat is an important question to ask because so many people—about 800 million—are undernourished or hungry. But is genetic engineering the best or only solution? We have sufficient food now, but it doesn’t get to those who need it. Most hungry people simply can’t afford to buy what’s already out there even though commodity prices are at all-time lows. How does genetic engineering address the problems of income disparity?\n\n【6】The real tragedy is that the debate about biotechnology is diverting attention from solving the problem of world hunger. I’d like to see people seriously asking the question, “What can we do to help the world’s hungry feed themselves?” and then make a list of answers.

Inflammation of the entire spinal cord has mostly been observed in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD cases 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>, occasionally occurs in MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>, and is not seen in MS.

After severe and/or recurrent myelitis attacks, MRI may also show (longitudinally extensive) spinal cord atrophy in NMOSD (but also in MOG-EM and in long-standing MS). The mean upper cervical cord area may be reduced (AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD > MOG-EM/MOGAD) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[25]</u></u>. Involvement of the lumbar spinal cord and the conus is less common in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and MS, so its presence favors MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[36]</u></u>.\nSpinal MRI should, whenever applicable, include sagittal and axial images of the whole spinal cord, the latter especially for detailed assessment of T1 and T2 lesions. Central axial lesions occur frequently in NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD (more often than in MS), most frequently in the central portion of the spinal cord (with a preserved peripheral dark rim), whereas MS lesions are mostly located in the peripheral portion 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>99, 161</u>]</u>, often involving the lateral and dorsal columns. Sometimes, only the gray matter is affected, resulting in H-shaped T2 hyperintensity on axial images, termed the “H-sign” 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[33]</u></u>; however, this occurs more frequently in MOG-EM/MOGAD and is virtually absent in MS. In contrast, lesions in MS often appear cigar-shaped/cylindrical on sagittal images and wedge-shaped on axial images and are typically sharply demarcated 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[38]</u></u>.\nSpinal MRI should also be examined for swelling, gadolinium enhancement, cavitations, and bright spotty lesions (BSL). Spinal cord swelling during acute myelitis attacks is common in NMOSD, but may also be present in MOG-EM 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u> and MS. In severe cases of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, T1-hypointense spinal cord lesions and cavitations may occur 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>99, 161</u>]</u>.

Moreover, by increasing the sensitivity of MRI for detecting active lesions, it may be helpful in improving the discrimination of true relapses and pseudorelapses when relapses cannot be adjudicated based on clinical presentation or T2 imaging alone. This said, it should be taken into account as a limitation, however, that Gd enhancement may persist for more than 1 month after an attack in some patients with NMOSD (but Gd enhancement persisting for more than 3 months should be considered a red flag prompting search for alternative causes 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[227]</u></u>) and true myelitis attacks with no new Gd-enhancing lesions may occasionally occur 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[33]</u></u>.\nSpinal cord remission MRI scans, if available, should be examined for new subclinical lesions. While clinically silent spinal cord lesions may be present in all three conditions during acute attacks, an accumulation of silent spinal cord lesions on T2-weighted imaging/fluid-attenuated inverse recovery MRI performed during remission (i.e., outside of a relapse and at least 3 months from the last attack), a characteristic feature used in the diagnosis of MS 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[207]</u></u>, was mostly absent in NMOSD (4%) in a large, mixed adult and pediatric AQP4-IgG-positive cohort in the UK 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>, as well as in MOG-EM/MOGAD (8%) in the same study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>. New spinal cord lesions that arise during follow-up may indicate a relapse and are a red flag raising differential diagnostic considerations, as previously mentioned.\nAs a caveat, it should be noted that Gd-enhancing spinal cord lesions may be more commonly present during remission. In the N-Momentum trial, contrast-enhancing lesions occurred independent of clinical disease activity in 15% of patients, probably representing blood–brain barrier damage or subclinical attacks, and were associated with a significantly increased risk of domain-specific attacks in the following year 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>30, 159</u>]</u>. Moreover, follow-up spinal cord imaging after acute attacks may be justified to assess the efficacy of attack treatment and the presence or absence of spinal cord atrophy.\nSpinal nerve root enhancement or myeloradiculitis has been observed in a few patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>47, 101, 102, 204, 211</u>]</u>, but was recently reported also in MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>176, 202, 206, 217</u>]</u> and even in individual patients with (pediatric) MS 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[206]</u></u>.

By moving the schedule, Intel has attempted to rally the industry around EUV and to eliminate electron projection lithography (EPL). \"We fervently believe that there are not enough resources in the industry to develop both technologies,\" he says.\n\n【1】Silverman is also ready to blast ahead by placing an order with ASML for a $30-million EUV prototype machine, forcing the equipment manufacturer to commit to a delivery schedule. It behooves Intel to push. Although AMD, Motorola, Infineon and Micron are partners, Intel negotiated contract terms that let it get the first machines produced and, because it is the largest investor in the $250-million program, the greatest number of tools.\n\n【2】Suppliers have to implement fully two crushingly difficult generations of technology before they finish making an investment of perhaps $750 million to start producing EUV machines. Getting them to buy into the breakneck schedule set by Intel may be a bigger challenge than creating angstrom-smooth mirrors. Even ASML, which dropped its involvement with EPL, is cautious, saying existing optical technologies may last longer than the industry expects. \"It's too early to decide whether EUV will happen in the time frame Intel is pushing,\" says Jos Benschop, research manager at ASML.\n\n【3】Intel would also like to bring Nikon, its other main supplier, into the fold. But the industry's largest equipment manufacturer, which is researching EUV outside of the U.S. consortium, is not ready to commit to a single technology—and it continues work on EPL with IBM. Other chipmakers, such as Motorola and Texas Instruments, have voiced support for the EUV competitor. \"It's still a horse race between EPL and EUV,\" says Gilbert L. Varnell, president and chief operating officer of Nikon Research Corporation of America. \"Intel has taken the position that there's only one technology and they want to get rid of the competition. I'm not convinced that's the best approach for the industry. What if [EUV] fails? We're a toolmaker and they're a chipmaker, and there's a lot of other things we have to consider, such as manufacturing ability of the lithography equipment and profitability.\" Adds Lloyd R. Harriott, a former Bell Labs employee who headed the EPL program and worked on the early EUV program: \"I think a lot of progress has been made with EUV. But they've got a really long way to go. There's a lot of marketing hype about how this is a done deal.\"\n\n【4】Varnell also believes that the current schedule—making commercial chips with EUV in 2005—is unrealistic, citing the nine years it took Nikon to develop the laser used in the current generation of lithography, a much less ambitious project. Says Varnell: \"You're going from a ramp up to full-up production system by 2005, and it is going to come from the national labs. I've been around the toolmaking business for a long time. I don't believe that's going to happen.\"\n\n【5】Along the way, another hurdle Intel and company have faced is convincing Washington to let a foreign company, the Dutch supplier ASML, enter the consortium. Four years ago the only major American tool supplier in the consortium was SVG. Ultratech Stepper, an early U.S. partner in EUV research, had to settle grudgingly for a minor role when it was viewed as lacking the necessary financial resources to develop an EUV product line. ASML, moreover, has subsequently bought SVG, which would leave ASML as the primary beneficiary of this technology transfer. Intel has \"done everything in their power to give the technology on a silver platter to ASML,\" says David A. Markle, chief technology officer of Ultratech Stepper, adding that \"Intel has approached this situation with the attitude that what's good for Intel is good for America.\"\n\n【6】The collaborative structure of the EUV program may serve as a model for how the semiconductor industry conducts future research.\n\n【7】Despite the trail of bruised egos, the EUV experience may serve as a case study for future research. It is one of the most successful collaborations between industrial and national laboratories. The project illustrates a model for the creation of virtual laboratories that can undertake major projects on an as-needed basis without the huge overhead of a central research facility.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 21, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet’s surface for another half a billion years. And yet, within a few hundred million years of that hellish age, microscopic life appeared in abundance. Sometime in the interim, the first living entity must have been crafted from air, water and rock.\n\n【1】Of those raw materials, the atmosphere and oceans have long enjoyed the starring roles in origins-of-life scenarios. But rocks, and the minerals of which they are made, have been called on only as bit players or simply as props. Scientists are now realizing that such limited casting is a mistake. Indeed, a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is revealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemical reactions from which life must have arisen.\n\n【2】The first act of life’s origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves. Achieving even this nascent step in evolution entailed a sequence of chemical transformations, each of which added a level of structure and complexity to a group of organic molecules. The most abundant carbon-based compounds available on the ancient earth were gases with only one atom of carbon per molecule, namely, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. But the essential building blocks of living organisms—energy-rich sugars, membrane-forming lipids and complex amino acids—may include more than a dozen carbon atoms per molecule. Many of these molecules, in turn, must bond together to form chainlike polymers and other molecular arrays in order to accomplish life’s chemical tasks. Linking small molecules into these complex, extended structures must have been especially difficult in the harsh conditions of the early earth, where intense ultraviolet radiation tended to break down clusters of molecules as quickly as they could form.\n\n【3】Carbon-based molecules needed protection and assistance to enact this drama. It turns out that minerals could have served at least five significant functions, from passive props to active players, in life-inducing chemical reactions. Tiny compartments in mineral structures can shelter simple molecules, while mineral surfaces can provide the scaffolding on which those molecules assemble and grow. Beyond these sheltering and supportive functions, crystal faces of certain minerals can actively select particular molecules resembling those that were destined to become biologically important. The metallic ions in other minerals can jumpstart meaningful reactions like those that must have converted simple molecules into self-replicating entities. Most surprising, perhaps, are the recent indications that elements of dissolved minerals can be incorporated into biological molecules. In other words, minerals may not have merely helped biological molecules come together, they might have become part of life itself.\n\n【4】Protection from the Elements\n\n【5】For the better part of a century, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, a parade of scientists speculated on life’s chemical origins. Some even had the foresight to mention rocks and minerals in their inventive scenarios. But experimental evidence only sporadically buttressed these speculations.\n\n【6】One of the most famous experiments took place at the University of Chicago in 1953. That year chemist Harold C.

NMOSD were originally considered subvariants of multiple sclerosis (MS) but are now widely recognized as disorders in their own right that are distinct from MS with regard to immunopathogenesis, clinical presentation, outcome, treatment, and prognosis. In part I of this two-part article series, which ties in with our 2014 recommendations, the Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) gives updated recommendations on the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of NMOSD. A key focus is on differentiating NMOSD from MS and from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated encephalomyelitis (MOG-EM; also termed MOG antibody-associated disease, MOGAD), which shares significant similarity with NMOSD with regard to clinical and, partly, radiological presentation, but is a pathogenetically distinct disease. In part 2, we provide updated recommendations on the treatment of NMOSD, covering all newly approved drugs as well as established treatment options.\n\n【5】## Keywords\n\n【6】Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) · Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) · Optic neuritis · Myelitis · Diagnostic criteria · Diagnosis · Differential diagnosis · MOG antibody-associated encephalomyelitis (MOG-EM) · MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) · Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) · Serology · Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) · Optic coherence tomography (OCT) · Clinical presentation · Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) · Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) · Autoantibodies\n\n【7】## Abbreviations\n\n疑似页脚| Abbreviation | Definition |\n| --- | --- |\n| ACE | Angiotensin-converting enzyme |\n| ADEM | Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |\n| APS | Area postrema syndrome |\n| AQP4 | Aquaporin-4 |\n| CADASIL | Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy |\n| CBA | Cell-based assay |\n| CHI3L1 | Chitinase 3-like 1 protein |\n| CLIPPERS | Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement |\n| CNS | Central nervous system |\n| CSF | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| CTD | Connective tissue disorder |\n| ELISA | Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay |\n| ETDRS | Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 0, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 NEMOS建议：视神经脊髓炎谱系疾病的诊断与治疗（更新版）—第1部分：诊断及鉴别诊断.pdf"}}

He championed a space shuttle experiment that would have pumped 100,000 watts from an electron gun into the upper atmosphere to create the first artificial aurora (the project was accepted, but the Challenger accident intervened). He led a quasisecret operation that translated vaginal contractions, the impetus of human conception, into text, music, phonetic speech and ultimately into radio signals beamed from M.I.T.'s Millstone radar to several nearby starsystems (the air force shut down transmissions after 20 minutes). He drew up plans for channeling a lightning bolt into a laser powerful enough to create visible spots on the moon (an idea still awaiting a sponsor).\n\n【1】And then, about 15 years ago, Davis realized that genetic engineering offered a rich new medium for art—life itself. He convinced two microbiologists at Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley to teach him how to synthesize DNA and insert it into the genomes of living microorganisms, then set about creating what he calls “an infogene, a gene to be translated by the machinery of human beings into meaning and not by the machinery of cells into protein.” His idea was to create a message in a bottle for extraterrestrials: to encode a sign of human intelligence into the genome of bacteria, which could then be grown by the ton and flung out across the heavens.\n\n【2】For his bottle, Davis chose E. coli, a bacterium of the human gut that might well carry DNA intact for aeons in deep space. For his message, he designed Microvenus, a simple symbol—like a Y and an I superimposed—that represents both a Germanic rune for life and an outline of the external female genitalia, which was censored from the pictures of humans on the Pioneer and Voyager space probes.\n\n【3】Digitized and translated into a string of 28 DNA nucleotides, Microvenus first slipped between the genes of E. coli in 1987. The bacteria quickly multiplied in its beakers into trillions of cells. “I'm probably the most successful publisher in history,” Davis says with a laugh.\n\n【4】Yet it was not until last September that the icon, explanations of the encoding, and cultures of the transgenic bacteria itself were finally put on public display in a biological containment facility erected at the Ars Electronica exhibition in Linz, Austria. There, also for the first time, Davis displayed some of his other biological artworks. There was synthetic DNA containing a coded text message—“I am the riddle of life; know me and you will know yourself”—and an audio microscope he built from borrowed and salvaged parts so that visitors could eavesdrop on the lives of single-celled animals.\n\n【5】And in a keynote lecture, he described his current artwork, the most ambitious yet: the genetic insertion of an infogene into Milky Way in a mouse's ear, an idea inspired by a children’s story written 30 years ago by a girlfriend. To encode such a large amount of binary information in DNA, he spent years figuring out a general method for archiving computer databases in biological form, a “supercode” that guarantees the infogene will be biochemically stable yet and prevents the host from translating it into protein.\n\n【6】Despite his professional recognition, Davis remains utterly dependent on donations of equipment and expertise from scientists. “Fortunately, Joe’s always been a good Tom Sawyer of people,” observes David Gessel, an engineer with Nebucon who has aided Davis on several projects. “It helps that he is consistently rigorous in his intellectual approach” and that he isn’t in it for money. Indeed, because he sells his conventional sculptures at cost and cannot sell his transgenic art at all, Davis skirts homelessness—many of his belongings are jammed into a decrepit Volvo he obtained for a self-assembling clock.\n\n【7】As I leave Davis, smoking in the cold, I walk past the M.I.T. Media Lab, where so many millions of dollars have chased so many questionable attempts to weave technology into a cultural fabric. How perverse, it seems, that the same society offers so little support for art that does not merely comment passively on the transformations and ethical dilemmas that science forces on society but that actively enacts and illustrates them, co-opting the tools and media of science itself.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 25, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

The collection of umbilical cord blood from as many donors as possible would also increase the likelihood that people from minority groups would be able to find a match. According to the National Marrow Donor Program, African-Americans have only a 57 percent chance of finding a bone marrow donor. Pacific Islanders and Asians have a higher match rate of 74 percent; Hispanics have a 78 percent chance; and American Indians and Alaska Natives have an 84 percent likelihood of finding a donor. Caucasians have odds of 87 percent.\n\n【1】Cord blood will also be virtually free of a virus that in the past has been responsible for 10 percent of deaths following bone marrow transplants: cytomegalovirus (CMV). More than half of the adult U.S. population carries CMV, which continues to live in the white blood cells of the host after initial infection. Although CMV generally causes an innocuous viral syndrome in a healthy person, it can kill someone who is immunosuppressed after a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow donors are tested for CMV, but patients often receive CMV-positive marrow if it is the best match. Because fewer than 1 percent of infants contract CMV in the womb, umbilical cord blood could be much safer than bone marrow.\n\n【2】### The Downside\nCord blood transplantation is not without risks, however. One is the chance that the stem cells in a cord blood sample might harbor genetic mistakes that could cause disease in a recipient. Such disorders—which could include congenital anemias or immunodeficiencies—might not become apparent in the donor for months or years, by which time the cord blood might have already been transplanted into another recipient.\n\n【3】Umbilical cord blood banks could largely avoid this risk by quarantining the blood for six to 12 months and then contacting the family at that time to ensure that the donor is healthy. A long-term identification link between a donor and his or her unit of cord blood would be necessary, a prospect that has aroused privacy concerns among medical ethicists.\n\n【4】Currently the New York Blood Center asks potential donor parents to complete detailed questionnaires that emphasize their family histories of diseases as well as their sexual histories. If responses to the questionnaire generate medical reservations, the center does not collect or store the cord blood. The center maintains only a short-term link with the donor until viral testing is complete; when the cord blood becomes anonymous.\n\n【5】Another limitation of umbilical cord blood is the relatively small number of stem cells contained within a single sample. Although cord blood can be used for transplantation in adults, studies by Pablo Rubinstein have demonstrated that because of the limited number of stem cells in cord blood, larger (that is, older) patients benefit less than smaller (younger) patients. Researchers are now working to devise ways to increase the number of stem cells in cord blood samples using nutrients and growth factors. They are also genetically engineering stem cells to correct genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency. In such a case, physicians would collect a patient’s own cord blood, insert normal genes into the stem cells of the cord blood and reinfuse the cells into the patient.\n\n【6】All of this portends even more exciting uses for cord blood. One day an infant born with a genetic defect of the bone marrow or blood may be able to have his umbilical cord blood harvested at birth, repaired by genetic engineering and then reinfused, so that he need never suffer the negative effects of his genetic inheritance. Alternatively, such a child could be cured by the infusion of stem cells from an unrelated—but perfectly matched—sample of umbilical cord blood from a donor bank. These scenarios will soon move from the realm of science fiction to science, as advances in biotechnology expand the potential of umbilical cord blood to cure diseases that once were fatal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 33, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

(The correct answer is neither: you use the paper clip holding together your orientation materials.)\n\n【1】But seriously, for a moment anyway, M.I.T. recognized the fact that it was sending some students out into the world who were apparently more comfortable crossing a Wheatstone bridge than crossing to the other side of a room to introduce themselves. They were more at ease asking for a Dewar flask than asking, \"Do you want to dance?\" They could insert a gene better than they could insert themselves into a conversation. Before I search for a geology reference, you get the idea. So in early February, M.I.T. invited any and all students to voluntarily attend its eighth annual charm school.\n\n【2】\"We used to refer to it as 'Degeekifying M.I.T.,'\" says Katherine O'Dair, charm school coordinator and assistant dean for student life programs. \"But we got rid of any references to geeks. No one wants to be thought of that way.\" (So, O'Dair must have been thrilled with the New York Times. The headline of its charm school coverage included the phrase \"Geeks at M.I.T.\") It's not clear how many students showed up thinking it was a symposium on quarks, but about 800 did wind up attending—about 8 percent of the student body.\n\n【3】I was particularly interested in the M.I.T. event because of psychic etiquette wounds I experienced in my own scientific education. At the institution where I attended graduate school, the chemistry department rewarded the students with a weekly treat. Every Wednesday at 4:30 P.M. a big bag of bagels was delivered to the student lounge in an exercise that became known as \"bagel minute.\" Not since buzz bombs rained down on London have people raced to a common destination with a greater sense of urgency. Bagel minute was nasty, brutish and short. If you showed up at 4:31, all that was left were some stray schmears of cream cheese and the guilty faces of the survivors.\n\n【4】M.I.T.'s charm school attempts, in a day, to at least expose students to the many guidelines of behavior that will help them move gracefully into the polite society that their postgraduate lives should include. Classes in table manners will most likely do away with any bagel-minute-like escapades. Dress-for-success instruction will come in particularly handy for the young man who showed up wearing a cap on which was written, simply, \"PIMP.\"\n\n【5】Students were also free to sit at the feet of experts in both business and cell phone etiquette. Unfortunately, many more seemed interested in the former than the latter, a situation that needs quick remedy if my train trip from New York City was any indication: half a dozen loud cell phone conversations took place in my car all the way to Boston.\n\n【6】Perhaps the highlight of M.I.T.'s charm school was the half-hour class on flirting, which ran repeatedly during the day. (One might think that teaching college kids how to flirt would be as necessary as teaching a nightingale to sing, but one might be wrong.) In each session, the mentors separated the men from the women and asked members in each group how they could tell if someone they had just met at a party liked them. The two reasons the men thought a woman might be interested was that she made eye contact and seemed genuinely engaged in the conversation. The top two reasons the women thought a man might be into them was that \"they stare at me and they turn red.\" And so I was reminded that our tree-swinging origins still beckon.

Gosling 在《地球物理研究杂志》中的文章提出并挑战了“太阳耀斑神话”。Gosling 设想，快速移动的地冠质量喷射（CME）对磁层产生的扰动可形成足够主动的力触发磁暴。科学家仍不了解这些注入的粒子为何会引起太阳耀斑。虽然 CME 带有时常扰动，但并非每次都导致磁暴。\n\n【8】并非所有 CME 都造成磁暴。大约六次中只有一次是“几何有效”的，能够触发磁暴。 CME 的速度相对于太阳风的速度是一个重要因素。只有快速 CME 是几何有效的。为什么？当快速 CME 穿过较慢的太阳风时，它在冲击波前紧密压缩和加剧了磁场，这是由于快速 CME 提高了太阳风的速度和磁场强度，从而更容易在南向方向促成重联。\n\n【9】太阳黑子周期衰退期间，较弱的磁暴发生较多。扰动继续积累，并由太阳的 27 天旋转周期再次触发。太阳风从光冠洞或附近发出的快速太阳风与太阳慢速风相互作用。这些 CME 并非主要原因，但它们可能对此有所贡献。\n\n疑似页脚【10】去年 IMAGE 卫星发射后，研究人员终于有能力通过分钟追踪大规模磁暴的全球视图。卫星运行", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 74, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

SMALL\n\n【2】**THE APE AND THE SUSHI MASTER: CULTURAL REFLECTIONS OF A PRIMATOLOGIST**  \nby Frans de Waal  \nBasic Books, New York, 2001 ($26)\n\n【3】Science, and the tried-and-true scientific method, is supposed to be free of bias. But as primatologist Frans de Waal explains in *The Ape and the Sushi Master*, science, like all human endeavors, is warped by cultural ideology. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the field of animal behavior and particularly in discussions of whether animals have culture. “We cannot discuss animal culture without seriously reflecting on our own culture and the possible blind spots it creates,” de Waal writes.\n\n【4】He approaches this conundrum by taking us with him on a journey around the world, to watch primates and to talk with other scientists, engaging the reader in a conversation about where our biases come from and how they have influenced the history of animal behavior.\n\n【5】De Waal is the director of the Living Links Center for the study of ape and human behavior at Emory University; he has written extensively about his findings in both scientific journals and the popular press. But unlike his previous popular books on chimpanzee politics and reconciliation in primates, this time de Waal is not so much presenting a theory and providing data as stepping back from the entire field of animal behavior to take a broader look.\n\n【6】*The Ape and the Sushi Master* is a philosopher’s tale—and one that could have a major impact on the future study of animal behavior. It questions the very way behaviorists go about their work and in the process undermines some comfortably held theories. In the West, for example, behaviorists embrace the idea that individuals act exclusively in self-serving ways in order to pass on their genes. But de Waal, a Dutch-born zoologist who has lived in the U.S. for two decades and has traveled extensively, has enough cultural distance to see that this view is intimately connected to the Western, especially American, ideology of individualism. Natural selection, he points out, can also produce cooperative behaviors, acts of kindness, and gentle creatures. And de Waal has the experience—27 years of observing apes in captivity—to question the accepted notion that only humans learn. The book’s title refers to the way sushi-making skills are passed down from master to apprentice: like the apprentice, young apes also watch their elders and imitate their behavior.\n\n【7】De Waal begins by laying out the reasons that we Westerners have such an uncomfortable relationship with animals, especially primates. By historical and religious tradition, Europeans and Americans embrace the idea that humans are different from—better than—all other animals, establishing a dualism between us and them. “Whenever their abilities are said to approach ours, the reaction is often furious,” de Waal points out.\n\n【8】This kind of dualism also means that Western scientists fear anthropomorphism and revere a disconnection from their subjects; we assume one must maintain separation to gather valid data. But de Waal feels that similarities, especially those among closely related species such as apes and humans, are profound and useful. Therefore, he finds that anthropomorphism is “not only inevitable, it is a powerful tool.\"\n\n【9】Eastern cultures fare better in their observations of animals because they don’t buy the Western dualism of humans versus animals. “It can hardly be coincidence...”\n\n疑似页脚【10】**HAND-CLASP grooming posture spread slowly through a chimpanzee community.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 85, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!\n\n【3】For my money, this is one of the deepest single statements ever made on the nature of science itself, particularly in the understated denouement. If scientific observations are to be of any use, they must be tested against a theory, hypothesis or model. **The facts never just speak for themselves. They must be interpreted through the colored lens of ideas: perceptions need concepts.**\n\n【4】When Louis and Mary Leakey went to Africa in search of our hominid ancestors, they did so not because of any existing data but because of Darwin’s theory of human descent and his argument that we are obviously closely related to the great apes. Because the great apes live in Africa, it is there that the fossil remains of our forebears would most likely be found. In other words, the Leakeys went to Africa because of a concept, not a percept. The data followed and confirmed this theory, the very opposite of how we usually think science works. Science is an exquisite blend of data and theory, facts and hypotheses, observations and views. We can no more sponge ourselves of biases and preferences than we can find a truly objective, Archimedean perspective—a god’s-eye view—of the human condition. We are, after all, humans, not gods.\n\n【5】In the first half of the 20th century, philosophers and historians of science (who were mostly scientists doing philosophy and history on the side) presented science as a progressive march toward a complete understanding of Reality—an asymptotic curve to Truth. It was only a matter of time before physics (and eventually even the social sciences) would round out their equations to the sixth decimal place. Later, professional philosophers and historians took over and, in a paroxysm of postmodern deconstruction, proffered a view of science as a relativistic game played by European white males who, in a reductionistic frenzy of hermeneutic hegemony, were hell-bent on suppressing the masses beneath the thumb of dialectical scientism and technocracy. (Yes, some of them actually talk like that, and one really did call Newton’s *Principia* a “rape manual.”)\n\n【6】Thankfully, intellectual trends, like social movements, have a tendency to push both ends to the middle, and these two extreme views of science are now largely passé. Physics is nowhere near explaining everything to six decimal places, and as for the social sciences, in the words of a friend from New Jersey, “fuhgeddaboudit.” Yet science does progress, and some views really are superior to others, regardless of race, gender or country of origin of the scientist holding that view. Although scientific data are “theory laden,” as philosophers like to say, science is truly different from art, music, religion and other forms of human expression in that it has a self-correcting mechanism built into it. If you don’t catch the flaws in your theory, the data in your bias or the distortion in your preferences, someone else will. The history of science is littered with the debris of downed theories.\n\n【7】Future columns will explore the borderlands of science where theory and data intersect.

Chen equates low-density development with congestion. In fact, congestion results from higher densities and inadequate highways—exactly what smart growth prescribes. A comparison of Texas Transportation Institute traffic data with Census Bureau densities shows a strong correlation between high density and congestion. U.S. Department of Transportation data over time show no correlation between reductions in density and increases in driving. Low densities are the solution to congestion, and people prefer to live in such areas.\n\n【2】Planners in Portland, Ore., admit that their smart-growth policies will reduce per capita driving by less than 5 percent while tripling the time people waste in traffic. Despite huge subsidies, transit-oriented developments in Portland suffer some of the highest vacancies in the region.\n\n【3】RANDAL O'TOOLE\nThoreau Institute\nLeach State University\n\n【4】#### CHEN REPLIES: \nComparisons among these data sets actually show weak correlations, some supporting the opposite of what O'Toole claims. His argument is further weakened by its reliance on averaged densities across metropolitan areas, which lump sprawl with compact communities. Smart growth's traffic benefits are more a function of neighborhood-scale improvements, including design amenities, a diversification of uses (homes, shops, offices) and modest increases in density. A recent analysis of 50 empirical studies found that integrating these improvements in regions that have viable alternatives to driving can reduce vehicle-miles traveled by half.\n\n【5】The contention that Americans prefer to live in low-density areas has been disputed by the industry's leading annual analysis, Emerging Trends in Real Estate. Since 1994 this report has predicted and demonstrated the declining appeal of sprawl for vibrant urban neighborhoods and “suburbs” with good public transportation.

However, none of these markers is yet part of the standard diagnostic workup of patients with suspected NMOSD, and we recommend (in the absence of gold standard assays and/or generally accepted cut-offs) that these markers should currently be used mainly in the context of scientific studies.\n\n【3】### Unmet needs and outlook\n\n【4】The 2015 IPND diagnostic criteria for “NMOSD without AQP4-IgG” or “NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG serostatus” are based mainly on clinical and MRI features typically found in AQP4-IgG-positive NMO. This is useful in enabling a diagnosis of NMOSD also in patients with a false-negative AQP4-IgG test result and in AQP4-IgG-positive patients in whom AQP4-IgG testing has not yet been performed or who do not have access to AQP4-IgG testing. However, patients with genuinely negative AQP4-IgG serostatus may also meet these criteria, which renders the subgroup heterogeneous. Revised criteria should thus stress the need for strictly distinguishing “NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG serostatus” and “NMOSD without AQP4-IgG” as different diagnostic categories and should define strategies aimed at identifying patients with potentially false-negative AQP4-IgG results who may be included in the latter category. Moreover, more studies addressing the pathogenesis of seronegative NMOSD and the question of potential pathogenic, prognostic and/or therapeutic heterogeneity within that category are highly desirable. Demonstration of such heterogeneity might have important implications for nosology and future diagnostic criteria, as it might bring about a need for further diagnostic stratification. Most importantly, the GCPP guideline committee, which currently only covers MOG-EM/MOGAD, should explicitly exclude patients with MOG-EM/MOGAD from the category of “NMOSD without AQP4-IgG”, and, accordingly, should make MOG-IgG testing mandatory before a diagnosis of “NMOSD without AQP4-IgG” can be assigned.\n\n【5】Although OCT is of differential diagnostic value in general (and may, according to recent studies 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>24, 155</u>]</u>, help discriminate MOG-EM/MOGAD and MS after a first ON attack), its utility for reliably distinguishing NMOSD from MOG-EM/MOGAD and MS is still limited. Combined scores taking into account structural OCT/OCT angiography parameters (such as, e.g., peripapillary RNFL, combined GCIPL thickness, and retinal vessel density), spatial distribution of OCT alterations, and functional parameters such as high- and low-contract VA and the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms may have the potential to increase the discriminatory power of OCT in the future 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>100, 164</u>]</u>. However, inclusion of OCT in future criteria will be hampered by the limited availability of this technique in many parts of the world. The same is true for the implementation of 7 T MRI, novel advanced MRI sequences, or extended CSF analysis (including MRZ testing). Revised future criteria may yet well exploit these new developments by providing a list of (weighted) supportive criteria, which could help to increase diagnostic certainty.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 14, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 NEMOS建议：视神经脊髓炎谱系疾病的诊断与治疗（更新版）—第1部分：诊断及鉴别诊断.pdf"}}

In our case, we try to replicate the bone-crushing pressures and scalding temperatures typical of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Most of our experiments test the interactions among ingredients enclosed in welded gold capsules, which are roughly the size of a daily vitamin pill. We place as many as six capsules into Yoder’s “bomb”—a massive steel pressure chamber that squeezes the tiny capsules to pressures approaching 2,000 atmospheres and heats them to about 250 degrees C.\n\n【1】One of our primary goals in these experiments has been to study Fisher-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, the process by which petroleum is extracted from coal and natural gas. Experiments going back nearly 75 years to F. Fischer and H. Tropsch showed that the combination of heat, pressure and hydrogen can convert carbon monoxide into a variety of hydrocarbons, such as methane gas and longer, more complex petroleum chains. In the 1930s German scientists used the process to make synthetic motor oil out of coal, and similar techniques have been employed to turn natural gas into commercial fuel.\n\n【2】We wondered, Could F-T synthesis have been an important mechanism for the origin of life? Since 1996 we have run over 400 hydrothermal experiments. Our studies show that in less than one day nearly 60 percent of the carbon molecules fixed by F-T syntheses are larger than methanol. One of our molecules contained as many as eight carbon atoms. This may seem trivial compared with photosynthesis, the vastly more efficient reaction responsible for organic compounds that sustains all life today. But we calculate that even the simple F-T production could multiply concentrations of primordial organic matter 10,000 times at the thin interface between the ocean vent’s mineral-rich hydrothermal fluid and the ocean water.\n\n【3】Over the past five years, we have harnessed this reaction to manufacture molecules with virtually any desired number of carbon atoms. Our first organic-synthesis experiments in 1996, and much more extensive research by Thomas McCollom of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, demonstrate that F-T reactions can build molecules with 30 or more carbon atoms under some hydrothermal-vent conditions in less than a day. If this process manufactures large organic molecules from simple inorganic chemicals throughout the earth’s hydrothermal zones today, then it very likely did so in the planet’s prebiological past.\n\n【4】When we conduct experiments using iron or nickel sulfides, we see that certain minerals speed up the carbonylation—the insertion of a carbon and oxygen molecule, or carbonyl group. Carbonyl groups readily attach themselves to nickel or cobalt atoms, but not so strongly that they cannot link to other molecules and jump ship to form larger molecules. In one series of experiments, we observed the lengthening of the nine-carbon molecule nonyl thiol to form 10-carbon decanoic acid, a compound similar to the acids that drive metabolic reactions in living cells. What is more, all the reactants in this experiment—a thiol, carbon monoxide and water—are readily available near sulfide-rich hydrothermal vents. By repeating these simple kinds of reactions—adding a carbonyl group here or a hydroxide group there—we can synthesize a rich variety of complex organic molecules.\n\n【5】Our 1,500 hydrothermal organic synthesis experiments at Carnegie have done more than supplement the catalogue of interesting molecules that must have been produced on the early earth. These efforts reveal another, more complex behavior of minerals that may have significant consequences for the chemistry of life. Most previous origins-of-life studies have treated minerals as solid and unchanging—stable platforms where organic molecules could assemble. But we are finding that in the presence of hot water at high pressure, minerals start to dissolve. In the process, the liberated atoms and molecules from the minerals can become crucial reactants in the primordial soup.\n\n【6】### The Heart of the Matter\n\n【7】**OUR FIRST DISCOVERY of minerals as reactants was an unexpected result of our recent catalysis experiments led by Cody. As expected, carbonylation reactions produced 10-carbon decanoic acid.

It is impossible to make eye contact properly, for instance, in today’s videoconferencing systems, because the camera and the display screen cannot be in the same spot. This usually leads to a deadened and formal affect in interactions, eye contact being a nearly ubiquitous subconscious method of affirming trust. Furthermore, participants aren’t able to establish a sense of position relative to one another and therefore have no clear way to direct attention, approval or disapproval.\n\n【1】Tele-immersion, a new medium for human interaction enabled by digital technologies, approximates the illusion that a user is in the same physical space as other people, even though the other participants might in fact be hundreds of thousands of miles away. It combines the display and interaction techniques of virtual reality with new vision technologies that transcend the traditional limitations of a camera. Rather than merely observing people and their immediate environment from one vantage point, tele-immersion stations convey them as “moving sculptures,” without favoring a single point of view. The result is that all the participants, however distant, can share and explore a life-size space.\n\n【2】Beyond improving on videoconferencing, tele-immersion was conceived as an ideal application for driving network-engineering research, specifically for Internet2, the primary research consortium for advanced network studies in the U.S. If a computer network can support tele-immersion, it can probably support any other application. This is because tele-immersion demands as little delay as possible from flows of information (and as little inconsistency in the delay), in addition to the more common demands for very large and reliable flows.\n\n【3】### Virtual Reality and Networks\n\n【4】Because **TELE-IMMERSION** sits at the crossroads of research in virtual reality and networking, as well as computer vision and user-interface research, a little background in these various fields of research is in order.\n\n【5】In 1965 Ivan Sutherland, who is widely regarded as the father of computer graphics, proposed what he called the “Ultimate Display.” This display would allow the user to experience an entirely computer-rendered space as if it were real. Sutherland termed such a space a “Virtual World,” invoking a term from the philosophy of aesthetics, particularly the writings of Suzanne K. Langer. In 1968 Sutherland realized a virtual world for the first time by means of a device called a head-mounted display. This was a helmet with a pair of display screens positioned in front of the eyes to give the wearer a sense of immersion in a stereoscopic, three-dimensional space. When the user moved his or her head, a computer would quickly recompute the images in front of each eye to maintain the illusion that the computer-rendered world remained stationary as the user explored it.\n\n【6】### Overview / Tele-immersion\n\n【7】- **This new telecommunications medium, which combines aspects of virtual reality with videoconferencing, aims to allow people separated by great distances to interact naturally, as though they were in the same room.**\n- **Tele-immersion is being developed as a prototype application for the new Internet2 research consortium. It involves monumental improvements in a host of computing and communications technologies, developments that could eventually lead to a variety of spin-off inventions.**\n- **The author suggests that within 10 years, tele-immersion could substitute for many types of business travel.**\n\n【8】In the course of the 1980s I unintentionally ended up at the helm of the first company to sell general-purpose tools for making and experiencing virtual worlds — in large part because of this magazine, Scientific American devoted its September 1984 issue to emerging digital technologies and chose to use one of my visual-programming experiments as an illustration for the cover.\n\n【9】At one point I received a somewhat panicked phone call from an editor who noticed that there was no affiliation listed for me. I explained that at the time I had no affiliation and neither did the work being described. “Sir,” he informed me, “at **Scientific American** we have a strict rule that states that an affiliation must be indicated after a contributor’s name.” I blurted out “VPL Research” (for Visual Programming Language, or", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 50, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Relatively few independent studies have been published, but manufacturers have conducted extensive analyses, because they are legally required to ensure that the foods they sell meet federal safety standards. In the past, the companies have submitted test results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voluntarily in advance of sale. But an FDA rule proposed in January should make such reviews mandatory.\n\n【1】The manufacturers’ studies typically begin by comparing the GM version under consideration with conventionally bred plants of the same variety, to see whether the addition of a foreign gene significantly alters the GM plant’s chemical makeup and nutritional value. If the proteins made from the inserted genes are the only discernible differences, those proteins are checked for toxicity by feeding them to animals in quantities thousands of times higher than humans would ever consume. If the genetic modification leads to more extensive changes, toxicity testers may feed the complete GM food to lab animals.\n\n【2】To assess the allergy-inducing potential, scientists check the chemical makeup of each novel protein produced by the genetically altered plant against those of 500 or so known allergens; having a similar chemistry would raise a red flag. Proteins are also treated with acid to mimic the environment they will encounter in the stomach; most known allergens are quite stable and survive such treatment unscathed. Finally, investigators consider the original source of the protein. “There is no way that a peanut gene will ever be allowed into a strawberry,” observes T. J. Higgins of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia: too many people are allergic to proteins in peanuts.\n\n【3】Arguably, the testing system has worked well so far. It showed that the protein in StarLink corn might be allergenic (hence the animal-feed-only approval) and led other products—such as soybeans that contained a protein from Brazil nuts—to be abandoned before they had a chance to hit grocery shelves. “I don’t know of any evidence that any product on the market is unsafe,” says Peter Day, director of the Institute of Biomolecular Research at Rutgers University.\n\n【4】The safety tests are not necessarily foolproof, though. For example, GM plants often cannot make enough of the foreign protein for use in feeding studies. So researchers have bacteria churn out the proteins. But a protein made by plants, the form people would consume, might be slightly different from the one made by microbes—a difference that might theoretically affect the safety assessment of that protein. And studies using whole GM foods are limited by the amount of any food that can be introduced into an animal’s diet without generating nutritional imbalances that can confound the test results. This effect is one reason that scientists have criticized a controversial 1999 study claiming that the foreign DNA in GM potatoes led to abnormalities in the intestinal lining in rats.\n\n【5】Beyond the acute safety considerations, some critics fear that GM foods will do harm more insidiously, by hastening the spread of antibiotic resistance in disease-causing bacteria. When food designers genetically alter a plant, they couple the selected genetic material with a “marker” gene that reveals which plants have taken up foreign genes. Often the marker genes render plant cells resistant to antibiotics that typically kill them. An issue is the possibility that resistance genes might somehow jump from GM foods to bacteria in a consumer’s gut, thereby aggravating the already troubling rise of antibiotic resistance among disease-causing bacteria.\n\n【6】The chances of such transfer are reportedly remote—“less likely than winning a national lottery three times in a row,” notes Hans Günter Gassen of the Institute of Biochemistry at the University of Technology in Darmstadt, Germany. Even so, to allay public concern, the use of antibiotic resistance genes will probably be phased out in the next five years.\n\n【7】Meanwhile many consumers remain disturbed that most safety tests are performed by the very corporations that produce GM foods. Steve L. Taylor, head of the department of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska, admits that some may view the practice as unseemly. But, he asks, who else should shoulder the burden—and the expense? “I’d rather see the companies spend the money than have the government use my tax dollars,” he adds. “I don’t care if we’re talking about bicycles or GM corn, it’s their obligation to prove that their products are safe.” No doubt concerned scientists and citizens will continue watching to see that they do so.\n\n【8】Karen Hopkin is a science writer based in Somerville, Mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 43, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

The computer generates dolphinish whistles and clicks. The park's dolphins touch images with their rostrums (noses). When a dolphin mimics the computer sound for \"up\" and then swims upward, a bit of language is born. The dolphins get no food rewards, only recorded sounds and video they find intellectually stimulating.\n\n【2】> TOUCH TV Bill Colwell, an engineer at Elo TouchSystems, developed the first touch screen in 1972.

The outer surface is covered with a scratch-resistant coating. Electrodes around the panel's edge distribute a low-voltage field uniformly across the outer conductive layer. [The inner layer provides shielding and noise reduction.] When a finger touches the screen, it causes a capacitive coupling with the voltage field and draws a minute current. The electrodes measure the current flow from the corners, and a controller determines the finger's coordinates.\n\n【4】## SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE (AND INFRARED)\nThe screen is an uncoated glass panel. Transducers in the corners convert a signal from a controller into ultrasonic waves on the glass surface. Reflectors on the edges create a standing wave pattern. When a soft stylus touches the screen, it absorbs part of the wave. The transducers sense the attenuation, and the controller determines the stylus's coordinates. On infrared screens, tiny light-emitting diodes and phototransistors on the edges set up a standing grid of invisible infrared light; a stylus obstructs the beam.\n\n【5】### Illustration:\n1. **Electrodes**\n2. **Scratch-resistant coating**\n3. **Conductive coating**\n4. **Spacer dots**\n5. **Glass panel**\n6. **CRT/LCD**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 84, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

So how could rocks—or the minerals that constitute them—have assisted the emergence of life? The answer is chemistry. Minerals grow from simple molecules into an ordered structure because of chemical reactions. By the same token, all living organisms—from bacteria to bats—owe their ability to grow and function to the hundreds of chemical reactions that take place inside cells.\n\n【2】Four billion years ago the earth had no life; chemistry, not biology, altered the planet's surface. In that ancient time minerals—together with the oceans and atmosphere—were the only materials from which the first living entity could have arisen. Chemical reactions, then, must have been the first steps in the origins of life. A sequence of chemical transformations could have reconfigured the simplest components of air, water and rock into primitive collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves.\n\n【3】New experiments are revealing that the critical transformations might not have been possible without the help of minerals acting as containers, scaffolds, templates, catalysts and reactants.\n\n【4】**CONTAINERS**—Microscopic pits appear in abundance on the weathered surfaces of feldspar and other common minerals. These tiny chambers could have sheltered life's precursor molecules from deadly radiation.\n\n【5】**CATALYSTS**—Magnetite, an iron oxide mineral, can trigger the recombination of nitrogen and hydrogen gases into ammonia, the essential compound from which living cells acquire nitrogen.\n\n【6】**SCAFFOLDS**—Layered minerals such as clays can trap stray organic molecules between their rigid sheets of atoms. Held close to one another, simple molecules can react to form more complex compounds.\n\n【7】**TEMPLATES**—The mineral calcite tends to attract left- and right-handed amino acids to different crystal faces. Such a sorting process could explain why life makes use of only the left-handed variety.\n\n【8】**REACTANTS**—Iron and sulfur, the elements that form the active center of certain biological enzymes such as aconitase, can be dissolved from iron sulfide minerals under extreme heat and pressure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 62, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Computers are the engines of the global economy. Three of the biggest international controversies are over the use of genetically modified crops, the prevention of global warming, and the feasibility of antimissile defenses. Some people even look to physics and cosmology for clues to the nature of God.\n\n【2】For readers of *Scientific American*, this is not news. This magazine has always been a must-read for the inexhaustibly curious, the ones who passionately want to understand what makes the world tick and who recognize that—especially in a technology-driven society—the only way to that enlightenment is through scientific discovery. For 155 years SA has been where they could turn for answers.\n\n【3】So why tamper with success? Why rethink the look and content of a magazine that is the best at what it does? Precisely because the magazine’s mission hasn’t changed but the readers’ world has. The pace of discovery and innovation has quickened. Time for reading has become more precious. This magazine’s methods and coverage therefore need to shift just so that it can continue to provide the same service.\n\n【4】Don’t worry. This magazine will always be a forum where great minds (authors and readers alike) can gather to share insights and inspiration. Longtime fans of SA will continue to find the in-depth, authoritative feature articles by leading researchers and other experts that have been its hallmark. Top journalists and commentators will also continue to complement those articles with perspectives on new developments and their significance. The finest artists and photographers will elegantly illustrate the articles in these pages, as they have in the past. As editors, we remain committed to informing you of the facts clearly and fairly, to opening doors for further exploration—and maybe every once in a while to offering a provocative viewpoint as a challenge to your own thinking.\n\n【5】New departments will further enrich the SA experience. “News Scan” provides brief reports and observations to keep readers up-to-date. “Innovations” takes an informative look at how industries have managed new technologies. “Staking Claims” considers the intellectual-property controversies that now exert such a powerful influence on the shape of research, development and commerce in the digital/DNA era. “Technicalities” muses on the experience of test-driving new inventions, some fresh to the market, others still on the lab bench. It will alternate with “Voyages,” debuting in the May issue, which will describe science-oriented destinations for travelers.\n\n【6】Science historian Michael Shermer will use his “Skeptic” column to weigh in on ideas that hover on the edge between breakthroughs and bunk. Dennis E. Shasha, of “Dr. Ecco” fame, carries on our tradition of mathematical recreations with “Puzzling Adventures.”\n\n【7】These days SA is literally more than can fit between magazine covers删除1:<u>.

In many ways, a condensate containing a million atoms is not like a collection of a million particles but rather like a wave made a million times stronger.\nWhat expands during cooling is each atom's wave function, meaning that the atom is effectively smeared out over a region of space. The nucleus and electrons of each atom still form a structure of the usual size, but the location of that structure, the atom, is made large and fuzzy, or uncertain.\nThe quantum states of the overlapping rubidium condensates relate to the arrangement of the electrons in each atom. Imagine that each marble in the article's opening analogy is covered with paint and that half are red and half are blue. Each group of atoms would form its own condensate, and, being very dilute gases, they can coexist in the same region, somewhat like the oxygen and nitrogen in the air around us. With lasers, the experimenters can change any number of atoms back and forth from “red” to “blue,” altering the number of atoms in each condensate. Which particular atoms change from red to blue at any time? Impossible to say, and meaningless to try to say.\n\n【3】**ERRATUM** A paper cited in “Muscling DNA,” by Diane Martindale (News Bytes, News and Analysis), appeared in the October 13 issue of Science, not Nature, as was stated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

According to the first detailed returns of the official 1950 Census count, our population rose by over 19 million during the decade. This large increase was not anticipated: the 1950 total of 150,697,361 was about seven million above the highest prediction made by population experts a decade ago. Wartime prosperity lifted the birth rate and produced the largest crop of babies ever. Concurrently the death rate has fallen to a new low. Immigration, although a relatively negligible factor, also added about one million, including refugees and displaced persons.”\n\n【3】#### DDT SHORTAGE\n“The World Health Organization last month reported a developing shortage of DDT so serious that it threatens the breakdown of the campaign against insect-borne disease, which since the end of the war has wiped out malaria in many parts of the world. The shortage is due to increasing use of the insecticide by farmers and by the armed forces for the defense program, and shortages of the ingredients. Roberto Caceres Bustamente, Under Secretary of Public Health in El Salvador, declared: ‘DDT is for us a problem of living or dying. In a population of 2,500,000 there are more than 200,000 cases of malaria.’”\n\n【4】### APRIL 1901\n\n【5】#### RABIES FEAR\n“The committee reporting to the American Public Health Association says that rabies in the United States is becoming more common. Fatal as the disease is in man, the committee finds its greatest cause for alarm not in the dreadful nature of the disease, nor yet in the difficulties attending its control by sanitary measure, but in the existence in the United States of numerous societies with the title ‘antivivisection.’ These societies take every possible means within their influence and advertising and in the circulation of literature calculated to deceive the people as to the existence of this disease, and to develop obstacles to the health officers in their efforts to eradicate it. It has been frequently asserted that there has not been a single well-established case of either rabies or hydrophobia in the great City of New York for the past thirty years, and yet the records of the American Veterinary College show an average of seven cases a year for twenty-five years.”\n\n【6】#### X-RAYS\n“Five years have elapsed since Prof. Roentgen startled the world by the announcement of his discovery of the rays which are now quite commonly called by his name. We must admit that no more is known today as to the essence of the rays than was contained in Prof. Roentgen’s original paper. They do not behave like any other radiation known to science; yet scientific men are generally of the opinion that they belong in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, perhaps having the shortest known rays of any known radiation—so short that it is impossible to deviate them from their course by any known form of lens or refracting substance.”\n\n【7】### APRIL 1851\n\n【8】#### FOSSIL EGG\n“Recently arrived in France, from the island of Madagascar, are three enormous fossil eggs, with some bones of a gigantic bird, which is not doubted to have hatched them, or been hatched from one of them. M. Isidor Geoffroy St. Hilaire pronounces these extraordinary remains to be those of a bird which he has named Epiornis. It is classed along with the gigantic fossil birds of New Zealand.”\n\n【9】#### THE RAILWAY ENGINE\n“The locomotive is the most perfect of machines. It approaches nearer to the spiritual and physical combination of the human machine than any other. In it we behold the steam engine ‘unchained to the rock, and unfettered to the soil.’ The accompanying engraving is a side elevation of an American wood-burning locomotive, the kind which is in general use in our country. The engine is of 162 horse power, and is capable of drawing 225 tons at the rate of about thirty miles per hour.”", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

As the parents share their joy and begin to count 10 perfect little fingers and 10 adorable tiny toes, they scarcely pay attention to birth's Act Two: the delivery of the placenta, or afterbirth.\n\n【1】After the ordeal of labor, most new mothers are happy they need to push only once more for their physician to scoop up the roughly one-pound, pancakelike organ that nourished their baby through the umbilical cord for nine months. After cutting the cord and checking the afterbirth for gaps and tears that might indicate that a piece still remains inside the mother's uterus—where it could cause a potentially fatal infection—the doctor usually tosses it into a stainless-steel bucket with the rest of the medical waste bound for incineration.\n\n【2】But more and more physicians and parents are realizing the value of what they used to regard as merely birth's byproduct. Since 1988 hundreds of lives have been saved by the three ounces of blood contained in a typical placenta and umbilical cord. That blood is now known to be a rich source of so-called hematopoietic stem cells, the precursors of everything in the blood from infection-fighting white blood cells to the red blood cells that carry oxygen to the platelets that facilitate blood clotting after an injury.\n\n【3】The stem cells from a single placenta are sufficient to rebuild the blood and immune system of a child with leukemia, whose own white blood cells are abnormally dividing and must be killed by chemotherapy. In the past, physicians had to seek a living donor to provide such children with transplants of bone marrow, which also contains stem cells that produce blood and immune cells. Unfortunately, many people have died during the long search for a donor with a matching tissue type or from complications if the donated marrow did not match well. Cord blood, which can be stored, is more likely to provide a suitable match and less likely to cause complications, because its stem cells are immunologically different from and more tolerant than those in adult bone marrow.\n\n【4】The benefits of umbilical cord blood transplantation have been demonstrated most conclusively in leukemia, but the process has other uses. The stem cells in cord blood can help to restore normal red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia and to reconstitute the immune system of infants born with severe combined immunodeficiency. Cord blood can also be used to treat fatal inherited enzyme deficiencies, such as Hurler's syndrome, which results in progressive neurological degeneration and death. In such cases, the stem cells in cord blood can give rise not only to normal red and white blood cells but also to supporting cells in the brain called microglia that can provide the crucial missing enzyme there.\n\n【5】Recognizing the apparent advantages of umbilical cord blood transplantation, a number of medical centers have established banks so that a mother can donate her baby's cord blood for use by a stranger in need. The New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Program, pioneered by Pablo Rubinstein, now has 13,000 banked donations and is the nation's largest public cord blood bank. The University of California at Los Angeles and Duke University also have umbilical cord blood storage programs, which are federally funded.\n\n【6】But like many new scientific discoveries, umbilical cord blood transplantation brings with it a set of ethical questions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 29, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

However, some risk factors have been identified. NMOSD has been shown to predominantly affect females, to be more common in some non-Caucasian populations, and to start in adulthood in the majority of cases.\n\n【3】The incidence showed a peak in middle-aged adults in most studies (e.g., ~40 years among AQP4-IgG-positive and 38.5 years among AQP4-IgG-negative patients in a large European cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>). However, a diagnosis of NMOSD must be given serious consideration also in the elderly and in children.

This compares to a median age at clinical disease onset of around ~30 years in multiple sclerosis (MS) and adult MOG-EM/MOGAD.\n\n【4】While NMOSD must be considered in both sexes, there is a strong female preponderance in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, and up to 3:1 in seronegative patients 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>16, 84, 87</u>]</u>.

This change may possibly result from the recent rise in awareness regarding MOG-EM/MOGAD and the increasing availability of serological tests for MOG-IgG.\n\n【7】Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types are associated with an increased risk of developing AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (e.g., HLA-DRB1*03 in Europe, Brazil, and India [odds ratio 1.79–9.23]) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[2]</u></u>; HLA-DPB1*0501 in southern Han Chinese; HLA-DPB1*0501 and HLA-DRB1*16:02 in Japanese 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>88, 144, 161</u>]</u>.

In contrast to MS, no convincing evidence for an increase in incidence with increasing latitude has been observed in NMOSD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>19, 208, 210, 232</u>]</u>.\n\n【8】### When to consider NMOSD?—Clinical characteristics\n\n【9】NMOSD must be considered as a differential diagnosis in all patients presenting with acute attacks of transverse myelitis and/or (unilateral or, less frequently, bilateral) acute ON, the two clinical hallmarks of NMOSD, but also in patients presenting with suspected encephalitis or brainstem encephalitis. Myelitis and ON may occur either simultaneously or, far more often, successively.

Moreover, pain should be assessed, ideally using structured questionnaires in addition to clinical examination. Pain, as an immediate or long-term sequela of myelitis, is highly prevalent in both AQP4-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD patients and, to a lesser degree, in MOG-EM/MOGAD patients.

Following the discovery of AQP4- IgG, the clinical spectrum was found to be much broader than initially thought and to include, although more rarely, supratentorial and brainstem encephalitis. The latter often affects the dorsal medulla oblongata, causing intractable acute or subacute nausea, vomiting and/or hiccups (either alone or simultaneous with ON and myelitis), which has been shown to represent a sensitive and specific sign of NMOSD in 85-95% of patients and is rare in MS as well as in other differential diagnoses for these syndromes (so far termed area postrema syndrome, APS). The revised diagnostic criteria accordingly define brainstem symptoms of NMOSD as mainly an association of APS, but in some cases without NMO-typical ON or myelitis. APS is less common in AQP4-IgG-negative patients with NMOSD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u> and in MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>62, 84</u>]</u>. The diagnosis should be made according to the criteria proposed by Shosha et al. 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[197]</u></u>. These require persistence of symptoms for at least 48 h if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows no evidence of acute area postrema involvement (considering both the rarity of APS as a cause of vomiting and hiccups in the general population and the broad spectrum of differential diagnoses), whereas shorter duration is deemed sufficient if MRI shows such involvement. Moreover, demonstration of a lack of complete resolution after symptomatic therapy (antiemetics, IV fluid, hiccup treatments) and exclusion of other etiologies (gastrointestinal/mediastinal, metabolic [e.g., liver or kidney dysfunction, hyponatremia], CNS tumor, stroke, migraine, psychiatric eating disorders, etc.) is required. Symptom severity may be quantified using the recently proposed APS severity scale 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[197]</u></u>. However, a broad spectrum of brainstem symptoms other than APS (oculomotor disturbances, facial palsy/numbness, ataxia, etc.) has also been described in patients with NMOSD, and all patients should be thoroughly examined for possible brainstem involvement 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>87, 117</u>]</u>. It should also be taken into account that NMOSD rarely causes diencephalic lesions that may cause hypersomnolence/narcolepsy or a syndrome of inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Patients should also be screened for signs of depression, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, and, if these are found, neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric consultation should be considered 删除12:<u>[9, 删除13:<u>23, 60, 149</u>]</u>. Cerebral manifestations may also include headache, and, very rarely, epileptic seizures (with the latter being more frequent in MOG-EM/MOGAD than in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD) 删除12:<u>[8, 删除13:<u>62, 152</u>]</u>. Extra-opticospinal symptoms are relatively rare at onset both in AQP4-IgG-positive and in AQP4-IgG-negative patients (e.g., 4% in a German cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u> and 9% in a Chinese study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[127]</u></u>), but many patients develop one of them at least once over the course of disease.\n\n【3】NMOSD takes a relapsing course in virtually all AQP4-IgG-positive patients but may be monophasic in AQP4-IgG- negative patients 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>. A diagnosis of monophasic NMOSD should be made with caution, however, since the interval between the first and the second attack varies widely, ranging from just 1 month to more than a decade (median 9 months in a large European cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>). Patients positive for AQP4-IgG should be considered to be at risk of relapse indefinitely.\n\n【4】Accrual of disability in NMOSD is driven mostly by acute clinical attacks. Although ON and myelitis attacks tend to be less severe in MS than in NMOSD on average (at least in AQP4-IgG-positive cases), mild attack-related symptoms and sequelae (e.g., in the MS) taken as evidence of less severe damage in MS should be interpreted with caution in NMOSD. Attacks of NMOSD often lead to severe disability in terms of permanently impaired visual acuity, limited mobility due to spinal cord lesions, and bladder dysfunction, but clinical deficits may also (partly) persist despite sufficient regression after an acute attack (e.g., ON leading to blurred vision, visual deficiency detectable only by means of low-contrast charts) to extremely severe (e.g., blindness, tetraparesis, respiratory insufficiency). Severe visual deficiency (Snellen score <20/200 for high-contrast visual acuity) during acute attacks is frequent in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and (MOG-EM/MOGAD) but rare in MS. Whereas persistent severe motor impairment after acute myelitis is more suggestive of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD than of MOG-EM/MOGAD, persisting sphincter disturbance/ sexual dysfunction is more commonly seen in MOG-EM/ MOGAD, as the latter disorder more often affects the conus than does NMOSD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[36]</u></u>. While significant chronic progressive deterioration of symptoms independent of or in addition to clinical relapses frequently occurs in MS, such a course of disease is highly atypical and should be considered a red flag in NMOSD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[231]</u></u> (as well as MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>). However, growing evidence from electrophysiological, radiological, optical coherence tomography (OCT), histopathological, and laboratory studies suggests a role for at least subtle relapse-independent CNS (including retinal) damage in NMOSD (best shown for AQP4-IgG-positive patients) 删除12:<u>[1, 3, 删除13:<u>50, 57, 94, 148, 178, 218</u>]</u>.\n\n【5】Even after a single attack severe, permanent disability can remain, especially if the attack is not treated immediately and properly 删除9:<u>(see Part 2 of this article series for details)</u> 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[112]</u></u>.

Neither did they feel a need to avoid topics such as animal mental life and culture.”\n\n【1】The issue of culture, in particular, as de Waal explains, has had a much more rocky history in the West. For decades, anthropologists and others have come up with various traits that separate humans from chimpanzees in an effort to define what is uniquely human. But chimpanzees keep nudging into our territory: tool use, complex social relationships, empathy and sympathy, sophisticated communication—they seem to have bits of it all. And now it seems they have culture, the last bastion of separation.\n\n【2】In a recent analysis of seven long-term chimpanzee sites, researchers were able to identify 39 behaviors that were learned from others. If culture can be defined as behavior that is socially transmitted, chimpanzees, and other animals, are cultural beings, de Waal argues. “What is the least common denominator of all things called cultural?” he asks. “In my view, this can only be the nonspecific spreading of habits and information. The rest is nothing else than embellishment.” Cultural anthropologists might not like it, but the chimps are playing on our side now.\n\n【3】de Waal ends with a section on how we see ourselves. And we emerge as an unpleasantly self-important species. We pretend that a struggle for social power, which is a common behavior pattern among other primates, is “self-esteem” and therefore that it is found only in humans. We assume that humans are the only ones whose behavior is influenced by learning and experience and that we are the only ones who are altruistic, caring beings—such kindness exhibited by other animals is misguided pathology.\n\n【4】de Waal takes a different tack: “Instead of being tied to how we are unlike any animal, human identity should be built around how we are animals that have taken certain capacities a significant step farther. We and other animals are both similar and different, and the former is the only sensible framework within which to flesh out the latter.”\n\n【5】Sensible, yes, but ideology dies hard.

A heated, humidified, O₂ therapy has been proposed. By generating significant distending pressure, HFNC can benefit the airway milieu. HFNC can be considered if standard subnasal supplemental O₂ fails in hypoxic infants and should not be used as a primary treatment modality.\n\n【3】In a systematic review and meta-analysis, authors reported that HFNC as respiratory support for children up to 24 months of age with acute bronchiolitis is superior in avoiding treatment failure compared to the standard O₂ therapy. A faster improvement in Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI), respiratory rate, and O₂ saturation than standard dry O₂ therapy has been reported over time.\n\n【4】In general, the hypoxaemia is treated with low-flow administered via nasal prongs at ceiling rates of up to 2–3 L/min or face mask at ceiling rates of up to 15 L/min.\n\n【5】It has been reported that an initial high-flow rate of nearly 2 L/kg/min meets patients' flow demands and improves respiratory mechanics and breathing effort. A prospective, observational and analytical study showed that an initial flow of 15 L/min is associated with a faster improvement of respiratory rate and a lower treatment failure rate.\n\n【6】O₂ therapy might be discontinued for babies with O₂ saturation levels equal to or greater than 93-94% in room", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/儿科/2022 意大利指南：婴幼儿细支气管炎的管理（更新版）.pdf"}}

After the issue's publication, investors came calling, and a company came to exist in reality. In the mid-1980s VPL began selling virtual-world tools and was well known for its introduction of gloves devices, which were featured on another Scientific American cover, in October 1987.\n\n【1】VPL performed the first experiments in what I decided to call “virtual reality” in the mid- to late 1980s. Virtual reality combines the idea of virtual worlds with networking, placing multiple participants in a virtual space using head-mounted displays. In 1989 VPL introduced a product called RB2, for “Reality Built for Two,” that allowed two participants to share a virtual world. One intriguing implication of virtual reality is that partici- pants must be able to see representations of one another, often known as avatars. Although the computer power of the day limited our early avatars to extremely simple, cartoonish computer graphics that only roughly approximated the faces of users, they nonetheless translated the motions of their hosts faithfully and thereby conveyed a sense of presence, emotion and locus of interest.\n\n【2】At first our virtual worlds were shared across only short physical distances, but we also performed some experiments with long-distance applications. We were able to set up virtual-reality sessions with participants in Japan and California and in Germany and California. These demon- strations did not strain the network, because only the participants' motions needed to be sent, not the entire surface of each person, as is the case with tele-immersion. Computer-networking research start- ed in the same era as research into virtual worlds. The original network, the Arpanet, was conceived in the late 1960s. Other networks were inspired by it, and in the 1980s all of them merged into the Internet. As the Internet grew, various “backbones” were built. A backbone is a network within a network that lets information travel over exceptionally powerful, widely shared connections to go long distances more quickly. Some notable backbones designed to support research were the NSFnet in the late 1980s and the vBNS in the mid-1990s. Each of these played a part in inspiring new applications for the Internet, such as the|删除段之间换行-4|【3】**TELE-COLLABORATORS** hundreds of miles apart consider a computer-generated medical model, which both of them can manipulate as though it were a real object.

In the future,\nthe headpiece should be unnecessary.\n\n【4】\n**THE AUTHOR**\nJaron Lanier is a computer scientist often described as “the father of virtual reality.” In addition to that field, his primary areas of study have been visual programming, simulation, and the high-performance networking applications.

As the aging of population and changes in modern working practices all over the world, the morbidity of cervical spondylosis is high and age of onset tends to be younger. Since the disease can lead to paralysis and even death in the later stage, early diagnosis and treatment are particularly important. At present, the treatment of cervical spondylosis mainly focuses on surgical treatment and comprehensive treatment of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), both of which have advantages and disadvantages. If a consensus can be formed on the treatment of the disease with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine, it can be more conducive to the diagnosis and treatment of cervical spondylosis. This consensus synthesizes the opinions of experts in related fields of TCM and western medicine and forms the consensus opinions on the diagnosis and treatment of cervical spondylosis with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine, which is expected to provide references for the clinical work of physicians in this field.\n\n【10】**Keywords** Cervical spondylosis；Integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine; Expert consensus\n\n【11】**中图分类号:** R274   **文献标识码:** A   **doi:** 10.3969/j. issn. 1673－删除13:<u>7202. 2023</u>. 删除17:<u>07.003</u>\n\n【12】颈椎病是因颈椎椎间盘退行性改变，导致颈部(颈)椎组织(骨)性椎体曲度力学失调，弹、产生椎间盘的变性,椎问的钙化和椎体间质的增生等病理变化，从而刺激或压迫颈神经根,交感神经,脊髓和值管而出现一系列症状和体征的综合征。根据不同组织结构受累而出现不同的临床表现，本病主要分为椎型颈椎病，神经根型颈椎病,椎动脉型颈椎病，脊髓型颈椎病以及交感型颈椎病删除11:<u>(1)</u>。近年,颈椎病的发病率逐年上升，已经呈现出低龄化趋势，给个人,家庭及社会带来了巨大的经济和精神负担删除11:<u>(2)</u>。寻于预防颈椎病的有效诊疗方法，已成为当前临床神经内科科学研究的亟的重要使命问题。中医学认为颈椎病病位在脊骨，病因多为气药伤颈，损及肝肾，外邪侵袭，气滞血瘀所致。现代中医药学则主要从“出纳力失衡为先，静力失衡为主”的颈椎病病机学说，扩展了中医学对致病机制的因病认识删除11:<u>(3)</u>。\n\n【13】目前对于中重度的颈椎病患者,手术为其主要治疗方式,但是手术带不果并发并发症。而中西医结颈椎病的康复及辅助治疗上具有独特优势，因此，中西医结合是颈椎病治疗的来向，“中西医结合，中西医并用”治疗颈椎病成为中国东南的一大特色和趋向。为明确中西医结合在颈椎病诊疗中的作用，提高中西医结合诊疗水平，根据近年颈椎病最新诊疗共展,参考国内外指南和最新循证医学证据，结合临床经验,经过专家多次讨论由推荐意见，制定本共识。\n\n疑似页脚【14】本共识证充分考虑专家临床经验的基础上，遵循循证医案,对初期病及临床-实践随各总结的同一效经验。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 0, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/骨科/共识/颈椎病中西医结合诊疗专家共识(1).pdf"}}

For the third time, I check the address: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, building 68, room 604D. Here it is, locked and looking nothing like a studio for avant-garde art. \"SEVERE EYE DAMAGE,\" cautions a sign on the door, referring to a laser inside. There are bins marked \"RADIOACTIVE WASTE,\" refrigerated vaults containing cells in stasis, ultracentrifuges the size of washing machines, but no paints, no sculpting tools.\n\n【3】I wander downstairs to the office of Alexander Rich, the biophysicist who famously discovered \"left-handed\" DNA (the normal stuff twists to the right), who worked out the structure of transfer RNA and who invited Davis into his laboratory in 1992 as a \"research affiliate,\" which grants the artist a space to work and access to the lab's expensive tools but no direct financial support. There is still no sign of Davis, until I press my nose against the window of a door to a small white room.\n\n【4】The room is warm: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. There, on shelves next to flasks in which swim strains of human gastrointestinal bacteria, sit a few mason jars. Each jar is labeled \"SELF-ASSEMBLING CLOCK\" and holds the jumbled parts of a timepiece. I recognize this as an element of Davis's \"experiment\" to see whether, given the right conditions and enough time, the components of machines can self-assemble into working devices, just as life supposedly arose spontaneously from delicious precursory biochemicals billions of years ago. That theory suddenly seems less plausible and yet more profound.\n\n【5】*Tick tick*. I turn to see Davis walking down the hall, his self-made peg leg clacking, steel on tile. The tube stopper plugging its end has worn down. Ask him how he lost the limb, as someone does at his 50th birthday party the next day, and he smiles, inhales deeply and recites one of his poems, a frightening, erotic poem of slithering asps, black waters and an embrace with the long, luscious lips of an alligator.\n\n【6】Ask his friends, and they say he lost the leg in a motorcycle crash some 20 years ago, when he was still a sculptor and bike mechanic in Mississippi. That is where he was reared until problems at school got him sent up to the grandparents and to a psychiatric evaluation at age 13. In his report, Dr. J. F. Jastak urged that Davis should \"apply his artistic abilities to his scientific ventures,\" maybe even as a scientific artist.

He has produced dozens of wildlife documentaries for cable’s *Animal Planet*. His wild-man persona even dominates a Federal Express commercial and the trailers for Eddie Murphy’s upcoming *Dr. Dolittle* film sequel. So is this guy just an entertainer with a brazen attitude around wild animals, or is he a committed wildlife conservationist? I went to Queensland, Australia, to ask the Crocodile Hunter himself.\n\n【3】**Q: Why do you think you’re so popular?**\n\n【4】**A:** You know what I reckon it is? My belief is that what comes across on the television is my enthusiasm and my passion for wildlife. My mum and dad were very passionate about that, and I was lucky enough to go along. The first crocodile I ever caught was at nine years of age, and it was a rescue. So now what happens is the cameras follow me around and capture exactly what I’ve been doing since I was a boy. When I’m talking to the camera, I’m talking to you, in your living room.\n\n【5】**Q: Is that zany approach an advantage for you or for your viewers?**\n\n【6】**A:** It excites them, which helps me to educate. That’s the main aim in our lives, to promote education about wildlife and wilderness areas, save habitats, save endangered species. So if we can get people excited about animals, then by crikey, it makes it a heck of a lot easier to save them.\n\n【7】Take the crocodile, for example—my favorite animal. My tactic with conservation of predators is to take people to where they live. But I sincerely and vehemently oppose “sustainable use,” where people think they can *farm* crocodiles and kill them and turn them into boots, bags and belts. Killing any wild animal will never save it.\n\n【8】**Q: What do you see as Australia’s biggest environmental issue?**\n\n【9】**A:** I believe our biggest issue is the same biggest issue that the whole world is facing, and that’s habitat destruction.\n\n【10】**Q: How would you balance development and conservation, then?**\n\n【11】**A:** We’ve got a koala conservation area—2,000 acres. We’ve got koalas and cows in the same paddock, and I’ll demonstrate how it can be done. The problem that a lot of Third World nations have [with wildlife conservation] is currently incurable.

But lately it seems that the strangest celestial bodies come in a medium size. Presenting: the midsize black hole.\n\n【16】The textbooks say that black holes fall into two categories: ones with the mass of a star, formed when a dying star implodes, and ones with the mass of a billion or so stars, formed no one knows quite how. Over the past several years, however, astronomers have built up a case for holes with a mass of 100 to 10,000 suns. “They might be a bridge between the ones we know about—the stellar-mass objects—and the ones we think we know about,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 12, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

A micrometeorite impact, a snag, a wayward tool or even a misstep can spell doom for an astronaut. As the station takes shape, however, construction and repair will demand more of these extravehicular activities (EVAs). One remedy: let the android do it. At least that's the plan of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists working on Robonaut.\n\n【4】The idea of maintenance robots originated after a 1990 study concluded that an orbital station would require 75 percent more space-walking time than originally planned. Keeping the station operational \"would take more time than we had astronauts,\" explains Chris Culbert, chief of the robotics systems technology branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center. So they set on a path of finding robotic ways to do the maintenance.\n\n【5】The first stop for NASA's robocreads was DART, or Dexterous Anthropomorphic Robotic Testbed. \"It had two arms and two hands,\" Culbert says, \"but it was built using commercial, off-the-shelf products.\" The engineers controlled DART through \"telepresence\": an operator would don virtual-reality helmet and gloves, and the robot would mimic the operator's motions.\n\n【6】But it was too bulky ever to fly into space. So three years ago the robotics crew began to build Robonaut, designed to be the size of a suited astronaut and to be just as dexterous. \"The biggest problem is that the operator has no sense of touch,\" comments Chris Lovchik, a NASA senior engineer working on the hands. \"To some degree, it's like operating on Novocain, but at the same time the tools fit into your hands as you would expect them to. Visual feedback helps quite a bit.\"\n\n【7】\"It can pick up an object and manipulate something on that object,\" adds Robert Ambrose, Robonaut project leader at the Johnson Center. \"It can use a pistol-grip drill designed for a human, and it can articulate the trigger. That's very unusual for a robot.\" Engineers plan to have Robonaut function beyond telepresence, operating on voice command.\n\n【8】Then, too, some Robonaut technology might come in handy down here on Earth. In Manchester, England, scientists have developed a robot that incorporates the brain of the primitive sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. When fed information through light sensors, the brain sends signals to the robot's motors, telling it how to respond. Such technology could allow prosthetics to be controlled directly from the brain. Developing prosthetics from Robonaut, however, is not in NASA's immediate future. \"It is not impossible,\" Culbert explains. \"But to interface it to the human nervous system—we don't have that capability.\"\n\n【9】In fact, only late last year did the NASA team install Robonaut's left hand and torso. The best prediction is that it will be two years before the robot is ready for launch. The slow pace stems in large part from the project's minimal funding. \"A lot of the attitude will change as the station becomes more and more of a burden on the astronauts,\" Lovchik says. \"Systems like this will look much, much better.\"\n\n【10】Phil Scott is a technology writer based in New York City.\n\n【11】## **ROBONAUT'S VITAL STATISTICS**\n\n【12】- Has more than **47 degrees of freedom**, 14 in each hand alone; human hands have 22\n- Has half the grip strength of a human, and **arm can lift only 21 pounds**—still strong enough for space work\n- Incorporates various sensors, including **thermal, positional, tactile, force and torque instrumentation**; each arm has more than 150 sensors\n- Relies on software written in **C** and **C++**\n- Why Robonaut resembles bounty hunter Boba Fett from Star Wars: \"The face had to meet a couple of characteristics: it had to support the camera—the eyes—and have room for additional cameras, small ones pointing down through the chin. It just happened to look like a character out of Star Wars.\"—Chris Culbert, NASA", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 14, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

Besides basic examinations of blood (differential blood count, serum chemistry, and coagulation) and urine, this should include serological examinations for CTD (e.g., ANA, ENA, anti-ds-DNA-antibodies, c/pANCA, cardiolipin antibodies). Further assessments should be considered to exclude hypovitaminoses, other metabolic disorders, infections, autoimmune encephalitis, and neoplastic and paraneoplastic disorders (e.g., anti-collapsin response mediator protein-5 [CRMP5/CV2] antibody-associated optic neuropathy and myelopathy or anti-Ma-associated diencephalic syndrome) 删除9:<u>(see Box 3 for details)</u>.\n\n【2】### Practical recommendations on imaging—MRI\n\n【3】MRI serves as an important baseline examination and shall cover both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI is also essential for distinguishing NMOSD from other CNS conditions.\n\n【4】If available, (fat-suppressed) MRI of the orbits is highly recommended, since it allows more precise depiction of the optic nerve than routine brain MR imaging. It may be required in patients with negative or unknown serostatus if making a diagnosis of NMOSD depends on the presence of longitudinally extensive optic neuritis (LEON) or an optic nerve lesion involving the optic chiasm 删除9:<u>(see Box 2)</u> and conventional brain MRI does not allow reliable assessment of lesion extension. Particular notice should be paid to lesion location and extension, the presence or absence of optic head swelling, perineural gadolinium (Gd) enhancement, chiasmal lesions, and lesions of the optic tracts. While NMOSD more often affects the posterior (intracranial) part of the optic nerve, lesions in MS and MOG-EM/MOGAD are more frequently located in the anterior portion 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[196]</u></u>. Swelling of the optic nerve or disk/head on orbital MRI is typically seen in MOG-EM/MOGAD, may infrequently occur in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, and is very rare in MS 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[171]</u></u>, which typically manifests with retrobulbar ON. LEON is frequent in both NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD but typically absent in MS 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>140, 171</u>]</u>. The optic chiasm and, more rarely, the optic tracts (often bilaterally 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[171]</u></u>) may be affected as well in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD, whereas these structures are mostly spared in MS 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[171]</u></u>; according to recent data, chiasmal lesions are also not uncommon in MOG-EM/MOGAD and then often extend from the anterior part of the optic nerve to the chiasm 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>84, 203</u>]</u>. Simultaneous bilateral optic nerve involvement is rather infrequent at onset in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD (~ 15% in a European cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>) but may occur later in the disease course. It is more common in seronegative NMOSD and in MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>84, 87</u>]</u> and relatively rare in MS. Gd-enhanced imaging of the optic nerve is recommended for differential diagnostic purposes. Enhancement of the perineural optic nerve sheath strongly favors a diagnosis of MOG-EM/MOGAD over NMOSD or MS. Demonstration of optic nerve Gd enhancement may also facilitate the discrimination between true relapses and pseudorelapses (defined as worsening or re-occurrence of pre-existing neurological symptoms caused by systemic metabolic changes rather than immune-mediated mechanisms) by providing supportive information 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[199]</u></u>. Of note, recent studies found Gd-enhancing lesions of the optic nerve in 20–50% of inter-attack NMOSD, i.e., in asymptomatic new lesions as detected by Gd-enhanced imaging at sites not previously affected were very rare 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[193]</u></u>. Asymptomatic lesions were significantly shorter in length (in mm) than attack-related lesions and were not associated with an increased risk for site-specific attacks in the following year in another study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[159]</u></u>.\n\n【5】Spinal MRI should, whenever possible, cover the entire spinal cord, including the conus, since lesion site and longitudinal lesion extension can be diagnostically informative. While myelitis is typically longitudinally extensive—extending over three or more complete vertebral segments—in both AQP4-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-negative NMOSD (and MOG-EM/MOGAD), as mentioned above, long lesions are extremely rare in MS and, if present, usually result from the coalescence of adjacent lesions. A finding of exclusively new short lesions during an acute attack of myelitis is more common in MOG-EM/MOGAD (being found at least once in up to 50% of cases over the course of disease in a European cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>) than in NMOSD (10–15% 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>41, 87</u>]</u>). Short lesions may be present also in combination with LETM lesions 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>. When assessing lesion length, it must be taken into account that lesion extension depends to some extent on timing, with short lesions sometimes representing still evolving or already resolving (if MRI is performed late) LETM.

Rather we must work from the assumption that it was a gradual sequence of more modest events, each of which added a degree of order and complexity to the world of prebiological molecules. The first step must have been the synthesis of the basic building blocks. Half a century of research reveals that the molecules of life were manufactured in abundance—in the nebula that formed our solar system, at the ocean’s surface, and near hydrothermal vents. The ancient earth suffered an embarrassment of riches—a far greater diversity of molecules than life could possibly employ.\n\n【2】Minerals helped to impose order on this chaos. First by confining and concentrating molecules, then by selecting and arranging those molecules, minerals may have jump-started the first self-replicating molecular systems. Such a system would not have constituted life as we know it, but it could have, for the first time, displayed a key property of life. In this scenario, a self-replicating molecular system began to use up the resources of its environment. As mutations led to slightly different variants, competition for limited resources initiated and drove the process of molecular natural selection. Self-replicating molecular systems began to evolve, inevitably becoming more efficient and more complex.\n\n【3】A long-term objective for our work at the Carnegie Institution is to demonstrate simple chemical steps that could lead to a self-replicating system—perhaps one related to the metabolic cycles common to all living cells. Scientists are far from creating life in the laboratory, and it may never be possible to prove exactly what chemical transformations gave rise to life on earth. What we can say for sure is that minerals played a much more complex and integral part in the origin of life than most scientists ever suspected. By being willing to cast minerals in starring roles in experiments that address life's beginnings, researchers may come closer to answering one of science's oldest questions.\n\n【4】Quantities of elemental sulfur, organic sulfides, methyl thiol and other sulfur compounds appeared as well. The sulfur in all these products must have been liberated from the iron sulfide mineral.\n\n【5】Even more striking was the liberation of iron, which brilliantly colored the water-based solutions inside the capsules. As the mineral dissolved, the iron formed bright red and orange organometallic complexes in which iron atoms are surrounded by various organic molecules. We are now investigating the extent to which these potentially reactive complexes might act as enzymes that promote the synthesis of molecular structures.\n\n【6】The role of minerals as essential chemical ingredients of life is not entirely unexpected. Hydrothermal fluids are well known to dissolve and concentrate mineral matter. At deep-sea vents, spectacular pillars of sulfide grow dozens of feet tall as plumes of hot, mineral-laden water rise from below the seafloor, contact the frigid water of the deep ocean and deposit new layers of minerals on the growing pillar. But the role of these dissolved minerals has not yet figured significantly in origin scenarios. Whatever their behavior, dissolved minerals seem to make the story of life’s emergence much more interesting.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 67, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

The program consumed hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures by both IBM and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency—and some industry observers estimate that the sum exceeded $1 billion. Moreover, in recent months two major semiconductor equipment manufacturers—ASML and Applied Materials—dropped plans to develop electron projection lithography, which uses parallel beams of electrons to print circuit patterns, another contender for the next-generation lithography that had been under development for years inside AT&T Bell Laboratories.\n\n【2】Despite its role as lead sponsor for EUV, Intel cannot claim credit for inventing it. In the late 1980s AT&T Bell Laboratories (now part of Lucent Technologies) and NTT Communications established separate papers on soft x-ray projection lithography. Two national laboratories—Sandia and Lawrence Livermore—expanded on this work using technologies from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Sandia fashioned an early lithography prototype using radiation from a laser-generated plasma, which had been involved before in testing the response of different materials to the high-energy pulses that satellites might sustain in scenarios postulated by “Star Wars” planners.\n\n【3】It has been understood for decades that the billion-dollar expense and overwhelming difficulties of producing chips with nanoscale circuitry would require that chipmakers such as IBM, Intel or (at one time) AT&T fund the early research of their equipment manufacturers. Bell Labs, which oversaw parallel efforts in five separate lithography technologies during the early 1990s, was enticed by the idea of short-wavelength radiation that did not require a synchrotron, the giant x-ray generators found in high-energy physics laboratories. The technical difficulties that beset x-ray lithography at the time led the Bell Labs researchers to change the name from soft x-rays to extreme ultraviolet lithography. Intel had joined AT&T and others in a cooperative research program with the national laboratories. But the actual day-to-day research was concentrated at Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Bell Laboratories.\n\n【4】When Congress eliminated the program in 1996, pegging it as a form of corporate welfare, AT&T decided to get out. Intel then stepped in to salvage and carry on the work. “Intel came to the realization [that] if they didn’t put money into a couple of key technologies that would come into play in the 2000s, they were going to be in big trouble,” says Richard R. Freeman, a professor of applied science at the University of California at Davis, who headed lithography development at AT&T Bell Labs and later the EUV program at the national laboratories during the mid-1990s.\n\n【5】On paper, EUV was attractive. With a wavelength of 13 nanometers—almost one twentieth the wavelength being readied for use in commercial chipmaking five years ago—EUV could be extended until the physical challenges of making atomic-scale chips rendered existing semiconductor technologies unworkable. And the technology used a machine tool that bears some resemblance to those deployed in existing fabrication facilities. Insiders at Intel were suspicious, though. “People start\n\n【6】---\n\n【7】### EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET LITHOGRAPHY\n\n【8】1. **Laser trains infrared light onto a xenon beam, creating a plasma that generates radiation at a wavelength of 13 nanometers.**\n\n【9】2. **Condenser focuses and reflects a selected wavelength toward the mask.**\n\n【10】3. **Chip image is scanned off mask toward a series of mirrors that serve as lenses that reduce the image to one quarter its original size before scanning it across a chip on a wafer.**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 19, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

As subclinical ON damage has been observed in patients with clinical myelitis, brainstem encephalitis, or encephalitis, VA should be assessed irrespective of a patient’s clinical presentation. VA assessment should be performed in a standardized manner by an experienced examiner, ideally by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Especially if VA appears normal using standard Snellen charts, low-contrast VA, which is exclusively altered in some patients, should be tested in addition, e.g., with the Pelli-Robson chart. VA should be also assessed in all patients if VA should be assessed at presentation, shortly after attack treatment (to inform about the need for potential treatment escalation; see Part 2), and before discharge and should be documented in the discharge letter. VA should be assessed also at all follow-up visits.\n\n【2】OCT is a non-invasive technique to generate high-resolution 2D and 3D images of the neural and vascular components of the retina 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>46, 151</u>]</u>. OCT is an optional procedure not formally needed to reach a diagnosis of NMOSD. However, as it can provide useful supportive information of differential diagnostic relevance, its use is recommended. If OCT is carried out, a high-resolution macular volume scan should be performed to allow analysis of all macular layers and semiautomatic segmentation of all layers. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness should be assessed as the most informative parameter by performing a ring scan around the optic nerve. In addition, the combined ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness, the presence or absence of microcystic macular edema (MME) in the inner nuclear layer (INL), the size and shape of the fovea, and the retinal vessel density (using OCT angiography) may be assessed. All scans must be checked for sufficient quality and for segmentation errors before analysis 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[184]</u></u>.\n\n【3】In NMOSD, most studies have consistently shown thinning of the RNFL and the GCIPL after ON attacks that is, on average, more severe in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD than in MS 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>12, 150, 172, 186, 216</u>]</u>. Based on retrospective analysis of 11 studies (not all of which distinguished between AQP4-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-negative patients), OCT shows average RNFL thinning after ON to 55–83 μm in NMOSD and 74–95 μm in MS, compared to an average RNFL thickness of 93–108 μm in healthy individuals without a history of ON 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[12]</u></u>; more profound RNFL atrophy (especially in non-temporal quadrants) than in MS has also been demonstrated in MOGAD in a recent pediatric cohort after the first ON attack 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[155]</u></u>. A correlation between RNFL thinning and atrophy of the visual pericalcarine cortex has been found in an almost exclusively AQP4-IgG-positive cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[221]</u></u>. OCT may be used as a supportive diagnostic tool already early in the disease course. Notably, 88% of NMOSD eyes displayed RNFL thickness <60 μm even after just one episode of ON in a mixed AQP4-IgG-positive and -negative cohort 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[216]</u></u>.\n\n【4】Looking into cross-sectional images in more detail, up to 26% of eyes after ON featured MME in the INL in mixed AQP4-IgG-positive and negative NMOSD cohorts. INLMME rarely appears after MS-ON (5–6%) and is not observed in healthy controls 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>12, 186</u>]</u>. Moreover, foveal morphology revealed a wider and flatter fovea in AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD than in MS and healthy controls 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[144]</u></u>.\n\n【5】Fundoscopy may facilitate the differential diagnosis of NMOSD as stated in Part 1. Demonstration of prominent optic disc edema has been found in about 40% of eyes with NMOSD-ON versus just 14% of eyes with MS-ON . Another study found confirmed optic disc edema upon first attack in up to 50–74% of NMOSD-ON patients, compared to 0–23% of MS-ON patients.

Although the scientific community has underlined the importance of avoiding unnecessary and futile diagnostic procedures and therapies, this advice has been ignored frequently. Currently, there is no unequivocal agreement regarding the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, risk factors for severe disease, hospital admission criteria, treatment, and discharge criteria 删除12:<u>[126–128]</u>. Aiming to clarify and assist clinicians in decision-making for the management of children with viral bronchiolitis, we updated the national guidelines after carefully considering the best evidence available.\n\n【2】- Since the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is based on clinical history and physical examination alone, further instrumental investigations are not routinely recommended. Most children with acute bronchiolitis may be adequately managed in the outpatient setting by primary care paediatricians, parents or caregivers able to provide assistance and monitoring.\n- The decision to admit to the hospital should be based on clinical conditions suggesting a moderate to severe bronchiolitis 删除9:<u>(Table 3)</u>. $O_2$ saturation levels persistently lower than 92%, ability to maintain adequate hydration, and uncertainty over the diagnosis of bronchiolitis 删除9:<u>(Table 6)</u>.\n- Since a specific etiological treatment is not available, bronchiolitis therapy includes general supportive management and pharmacological treatment to control pulmonary and systemic clinical symptoms. Gentle nasal aspiration, $O_2$ therapy, adequate feeding and hydration remain the cornerstones for the management of bronchiolitis. Deep nasal aspiration, chest physiotherapy, inhaled bronchodilators, nebulized adrenaline, nebulized and systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and other therapies are not routinely recommended in treating bronchiolitis.\n- When supplementary $O_2$ is indicated, HFNC should not be used as a primary treatment modality but considered if standard subnasal supplemental $O_2$ fails in hypoxic infants. If respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support (CPAP), apnea with desaturation, and severe impairment of general conditions occur, the baby affected by acute bronchiolitis must be referred to the ICU.\n- Since there is no vaccine against RSV (i.e., the main aetiologic agent of bronchiolitis), environmental prophylaxis is crucial in preventing and limiting bronchiolitis spreading. Pharmacological immunoprophylaxis (Palivizumab) has proven beneficial to populations at increased risk for RSV infection–related complications.\n- Globally, evidence suggests that less treatment is better and promotes supportive rather than interventional therapy. Nevertheless, universal de-implementation of unnecessary care did not occur and remained a major challenge. Issuing bronchiolitis guidelines is not enough to obtain adherence and clinically significant changes in clinical practice 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>126, 127</u>]</u>.\n- Well-prepared implementation strategies to standardize care and improve the quality of care are needed, such as educational interventions and audit cycles for clinicians (working in hospitals, primary care paediatricians) and nursing staff, to promote adherence to guidelines and discourage avoiding treatment and nonadherence to guidelines 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[128]</u></u>.\n- In the future, taking advantage of the use of electronic medical records, it may be reasonable to promote the adoption of a “warning signal” when a prescribed therapy might not be appropriate for a patient diagnosed with bronchiolitis.\n- In parallel, educating parents with a “wait and see” approach could allow symptoms to improve spontaneously and reduce patient pressure, contributing to inappropriate prescriptions. In this regard, the publication and diffusion of educational materials could implement choosing wisely recommendations and change non-evidence-based clinical practice. Moreover, it would increase the awareness that the inappropriate prescription of drugs is not only useless but also potentially harmful, as associated with bacterial resistance and risk of severe patient status, lower $O_2$ saturation, fever, and tachycardia induced by inhaled salbutamol 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>96, 129</u>–131]</u>.\n- Similarly to monitoring RSV circulation and activity in the community, creating a system able to reflect, in near real-time, the timing and the community-based intensity of RSV circulation could be helpful.

The diagram below presents a highly simplified version of how insect-resistant corn might be made. Insect-protected GM plants are typically engineered to carry a gene from the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (*Bt*). This gene instructs plant cells to produce a protein that is toxic to some insects, such as caterpillars, but benign to most other creatures.\n\n【2】1. **From the bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis*, isolate the gene that directs cells to produce a protein toxic to certain insects**\n2. **Try to insert into plant cells the *Bt* gene and a \"marker\" gene, able to flag cells that have taken up the *Bt* gene. Common markers shield cells from being killed by an antibiotic or an herbicide**\n3. **Identify the cells that have taken up the genes, such as by exposing them to an antibiotic; only cells containing the newly inserted genes will survive the exposure**\n4. **Allow the genetically altered cells to grow into plants. Those plants—and crops derived from their seeds—produce the *Bt* toxin in their cells. As insect pests susceptible to the toxins dine on the plants, they die instead of destroying the crop**\n\n【3】---\n\n【4】### Seeding Superweeds?\n\n【5】**Worries about the flow of genes from the original plant to others also surround GM crops. Unwitting insects or the right wind might carry GM crop pollen to weeds or relatives, fertilizing them. And if that happens, the newly endowed plants could break ecological rank, becoming \"super-weeds\" that are unintentionally resilient to eradication by natural predators or pesticides. Scientists have stopped asking if such gene flow is possible. \"In many cases,\" says Cornell ecologist Allison Power, \"we know gene flow will occur. The question now is, What will the consequences be?\"**\n\n【6】So far no scientific studies have found evidence of GM crops causing superweeds, and a 10-year study reported in *Nature* in February found no weedlike behavior by GM potatoes, beets, corn or canola planted in England. But worrisome anecdotes have appeared. Canadian farmers, in particular, have described GM canola escaping from farm fields and invading wheat crops like a weed. This canola also resisted pesticide sprays.\n\n【7】Power's studies of gene flow from virus-resistant GM plants give further reason for precaution. For now, virus-resistant crops stake a small share of the GM landscape, but they are likely to become more prevalent, particularly in the developing world. Power investigates gene flow in cultivated grains—oat, wheat, barley and oats—engineered to contain genes that make the plants resistant to the barley yellow dwarf virus (which damages some 100 grass species). These GM grain crops could be on the market within the next decade.\n\n【8】Power's work, carried out in the laboratory, indicates that wild oats—a weedy relative of cultivated oats—can \"catch\" the genes conferring resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus. If that happened in the field, she says, wild oats might run amok in the western U.S., outcompeting native grasses with kudzu-like intensity. Every GM crop, Power cautions, brings its own environmental personality and its own risks.\n\n【9】In the U.S., at least, landscape logistics make it rather unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotech genes to weeds. That's because the GM crops sown in this country have no close relatives in the regions where they grow; most plants can pollinate other only if the recipients and the donors have certain features in common, such as the same chromosome number, life cycle or preferred habitat. A known exception to the \"no relatives\" rule in the U.S. is wild cotton growing in Hawaii and southern Florida, which, by virtue of its unusual similarity to GM cotton, can accept the GM pollen. To separate the wild and biotech plants from each other, the EPA has ordered companies not to sell GM cotton south of Florida's Interstate 60 or in Hawaii.\n\n【10】But it may prove harder to avoid creating superweeds outside North America, where weedy relatives of cultivated crops are common. Wild cotton, for instance, creeps past the Florida Keys, across the Gulf of Mexico and into Mexico. In South America, a weedy corn relative, teosinte, dresses the edges of domesticated cornfields.

Starting in 1994, she worked with colleagues at Chapel Hill and Carnegie Mellon on small-scale “puddles” of two or three cameras to gather real-world data for virtual-reality applications.\n\n【1】Bajcsy and her colleague Kostas Daniilidis took on the assignment of creating the first real-time sea of cameras—one that was, moreover, scalable and modular so that it could be adapted to a variety of rooms and uses. They worked closely with the Chapel Hill team, which was responsible for taking the “animated sculpture” data and using computer graphics techniques to turn it into a realistic scene for each user.\n\n【2】Of course, simple images of wall calendars only went so far. What we want for tele-immersion was the ability to capture spontaneous interaction, not just physical settings. Cameras looking at a clean face wall. Because there are no surface features, the cameras have no information on which to build a sculptural model. A person can look at a white wall without being confused. Humans don’t worry that a wall might actually be a passage to an infinitely deep white chasm, because we don’t rely on geometric cues alone—we also have a model of a room in our minds that can rein in errant mental interpretations. Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras, a person’s forehead or T-shirt can present the same challenge as a white wall, and today’s software isn’t smart enough to undo the confusion that results.\n\n【3】Researchers at Chapel Hill came up with a novel method that has shown promise for overcoming this obstacle, called “imperceptible structured light,” or ISL. Conventional lightbulbs flicker 50 or 60 times a second, fast enough for the flickering to be generally invisible to the human eye. Similarly, ISL appears to the human eye as a continuous source of white light, like an ordinary lightbulb, but in fact is filled with quickly changing patterns invisible only to specialized, carefully synchronized cameras. These patterns fill in voids such as white walls with imposed features that allow a sea of cameras to complete the measurements.\n\n【4】## The Eureka Moment\n\n【5】We were able to demonstrate tele-immersion for the first time on May 9, 2000, virtually bringing together three locations. About a dozen dignitaries were physically at the telecubicle in Chapel Hill. There we and they took turns sitting down in the simulated office of tomorrow. As fascinating as the three years of research leading up to this demonstration had been for me, the delight of experiencing tele-immersion was unanticipated and incomparable. Seen through a pair of polarizing glasses, two walls of the cubicle dissolved into windows, revealing other offices with other people who were looking back at me. (The glasses helped to direct a slightly different view of the scenes to each eye, creating the stereo vision effect.) Through one wall I greeted Russian Bajcsy, and on another side was Jena Mulligan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n【6】Unlike the cartoonish virtual worlds I had worked with for many years, the remote people and places I was seeing were clearly derived from reality. They were not perfect by any means. There was “noise” in the system that looked something like confetti being dropped in the other people’s cubicles. The frame rate was low (2 to 3 fps), there was as much as one second of delay, and only one side of the conversation had access to a tele-immersive display. Nevertheless, here was a virtual world that was not a simplistic artistic representation of the real world but rather an authentic measurement-based rendition of it.\n\n【7】In a later demo 删除19:<u>(in October 2000)</u> most of the confetti was gone and the overall quality and speed of the system had increased, but the most important improvement came from researchers at Brown University led by Andries van Dam. They arrived in a tele-immersive session bearing virtual objects not derived from the physical scene. I sat across the table from Robert C. Zeleznik of Brown, who was physically at my lab in Armonk. He presented a simulated miniature office interior (about two feet wide) resting on the desk between us, and we used simulated laser pointers and other devices to modify walls and furniture in it collaboratively while we talked. This was a remarkable blending of the experience of using simulations associated with virtual reality and simply being with another person.\n\n【8】## When Can I Use It?\n\n【9】Beyond the scene-capture system, the principal components of a tele-immersion setup are the computers, the network services, and the display and interaction devices. The computing power has been advanced in the use of tele-immersion and must advance further. Tele-immersion is a voracious consumer of computer resources.

These characteristics were significant differentiating features between functional tics and typical tic groups. These criteria are similar to the ESSTS 2022 criteria except for the inclusion of sex, family history, premonitory urge, the emphasis on a single comorbidity (anxiety) and suppressibility. A previous case series and on-going research has found no differences in Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) scores between young adult patients with FTLB compared to TS and we have found suppressibility to be highly variable between subjects. Furthermore, we found evidence of more widespread neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental symptoms in FTLB patients, of which the most common in the international registry were ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and depression.\n\n【2】Distinguishing FTLB from primary tics is important due to the distinct treatment paths required for these two conditions. Both clinical experience and prospective studies of patients with FTLB suggest that the pharmacological treatments used for tics (such as clonidine or aripiprazole) have limited impact on FTLB symptoms. What appears most important for symptom improvement and resolution is the identification of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms, and appropriate treatment for these comorbidities, including cognitive behavioural therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We expect further research evidence to emerge on treatment strategies, including appropriate modifications to habit reversal therapies (HRT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP) used in patients with tics or patients with FTLB. In cases where FTLB and TS symptoms overlap, management seems best directed toward the manifestation currently causing the most clinically relevant problem.\n\n【3】The major limitation of the ESSTS 2022 clinical criteria for FTLB is that they lack prospective testing of their sensitivity and specificity. The criteria are based on the collective clinical experience and published research of clinicians based in North America, Europe and Australia; our panel did not include representatives from South America, Africa or Asia and to our knowledge no case series on FTLB during the pandemic period have been published from these regions. Testing of these clinical criteria in patients with suspected FTLB and TS are planned to determine their ability to differentiate patients correctly with clinical diagnoses of FTLB, TS, and TS plus FTLB. Research on epidemiology, long-term outcomes, treatment responses and sex and gender in patients with FTLBs is on-going to inform patient-centered care planning and delivery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 ESSTS国际共识：功能性抽动样行为(FTLBs)的诊断标准(1).pdf"}}

Did the sauropod dinosaurs continue to grow throughout their lives, as some reptiles and fish do?\n— **Alexandra Chang, Miami, Fla.**\n\n【1】**Gregory S. Paul, freelance scientist, artist, and editor of the Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs, offers this explanation:**\n\n【2】Gigantism has been a common feature of land animals since the beginning of the Jurassic period, more than 200 million years ago. The first true giants of the land were small-headed, long-necked, sauropod dinosaurs. Toward the end of the Jurassic many sauropods reached 10 to 20 metric tons, some weighed as much as 50 metric tons, and a few may have exceeded 100 metric tons and 150 feet in length, rivaling the largest modern whales.\n\n【3】Why do animals become gigantic? Some reasons are simple. The bigger an animal is, the safer it is from predators and the better it is able to kill prey. Antelope are easy prey for lions, hyenas and hunting dogs, but adult elephants and rhinos are nearly immune—and their young benefit from the protection of their huge parents. For herbivores, being gigantic means being taller and therefore able to access higher foliage. Giraffes and elephants can reach over 18 feet high, and elephants can use their great bulk to push over even taller trees.\n\n【4】Other reasons for being gargantuan, though important, are less obvious. The cost of locomotion decreases with increasing size; thus, it is much cheaper for a five-metric-ton elephant to walk a mile than it is for a five-metric-ton herd of gazelle to move the same distance. Metabolic rate also decreases with increasing size. A shrew must therefore frantically eat more than its own weight each day. The elephant, on the other hand, needs to take in only 5 percent of its own weight. Also, as size increases, great bulk acts as a form of mass insulation, and so large animals are less affected by temperature extremes.\n\n【5】But there are disadvantages to being big. Because big animals eat more, there cannot be as many of them. Before human hunting, the population of elephants and rhinos in Africa was in the low millions, compared with the billions of antelope in the countless billions. Nor can giants do a lot of things that smaller creatures can do, such as burrow into the ground, climb trees or fly.\n\n【6】On land only dinosaurs and mammals have become gigantic; reptiles have never done so (the biggest tortoises and lizards have only weighed one metric ton). One reason may be the rate of growth. Land reptiles cannot grow rapidly. It takes many years for an alligator to reach 1,000 pounds, whereas an ostrich does so in less than a year.\n\n删除1:<u>【7】**For the complete text of this answer, and answers to many other questions, visit Ask the Experts 删除20:<u>(www.sciam.com/askexpert)</u>.**</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 92, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

His direct impressions simply didn’t match what he had been taught. He saw his violent clients as egotists with a grandiose sense of personal superiority and entitlement, but his textbooks told him that these young toughs actually suffered from low self-esteem. He and his staff decided they couldn’t go against decades of research, regardless of what they had observed, and so they tried their best to boost the young men’s opinions of themselves, even though this produced no discernible reduction in their antisocial tendencies.\n\n【1】The view that aggression stems from low self-esteem has long been common knowledge. Counselors, social workers and teachers all over the country have been persuaded that improving the self-esteem of young people is the key to curbing violent behavior and to encouraging social and academic success. Many schools have students make lists of reasons why they are wonderful people or sing songs of self-celebration. Many parents and teachers are afraid to criticize kids, lest it cause serious psychological damage and turn some promising youngster into a dangerous thug or pathetic loser. In some sports leagues, everyone gets a trophy.\n\n【2】A number of people have questioned whether these feel-good exercises are really the best way to build self-esteem. But what about the underlying assumption? When my colleagues and I began looking into the matter in the early 1990s, we found article after article citing the “well-known fact” that low self-esteem causes violence. Yet we were unable to find any book or paper that offered a formal statement of that theory, let alone empirical evidence to support it. Everybody knew it, but nobody had ever proved it.\n\n【3】Unfortunately for the low self-esteem theory, researchers have gradually built up a composite image of what it is like to have low self-esteem, and that image does not mesh well with what we know about aggressive perpetrators. People who have a negative view of themselves are typically muddling through life, trying to avoid embarrassment, giving no sign of a desperate need to prove their superiority. Aggressive attack is risky; people with low self-esteem tend to avoid risks. When people with low self-esteem fail, they usually blame themselves, not others.\n\n【4】Faced with these incongruities, we cast about for an alternative theory. A crucial influence on our thinking was the seemingly lofty self-regard of prominent violent people. Saddam Hussein is not known as a modest, cautious, self-doubting individual. Adolf Hitler’s exaltation of the “master race” was hardly a slogan of low self-esteem. These examples suggest that self-esteem is indeed an important cause of aggression—high, that is, not low self-esteem.\n\n【5】We eventually formulated our hypothesis in terms of threatened egotism. Not all people who think highly of themselves are prone to violence. That favorable opinion must be combined with some external threat to the opinion. Somebody must question it, dispute it, undermine it. People like to think well of themselves, and so they are loath to make downward revisions in their self-esteem. When someone suggests such a revision, many individuals—those with inflated, tenuous and unstable forms of high self-esteem—prefer to shoot the messenger.\n\n【6】### Pride Comes before a Fall\n\n【7】It would be foolish to assert that aggression always stems from threatened egotism or that threatened egotism always results in aggression. Human behavior is caused and shaped by various factors. Plenty of aggression has little or nothing to do with how people evaluate themselves. But if our hypothesis is right, inflated self-esteem increases the odds of aggression substantially. For those aggressive acts that do involve the perpetrators’ self-regard, we believe that threatened egotism is crucial. Obviously, this new theory could have implications for designing effective methods to reduce violence.\n\n【8】So how does a social psychologist establish whether low or high self-esteem leads to violence? Because there is no perfect, general method for understanding complex questions about human beings, social scientists typically operate by conducting multiple studies with different methods. A single study can be challenged, especially if competing views exist. But when a consistent pattern emerges, the conclusions become hard to ignore.\n\n【9】Researchers measure self-esteem by asking a standardized series of questions, such as “How well do you get along with other people?” and “Are you generally successful in your work or studies?” The individual chooses from a range of responses,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 79, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf"}}

However, several other rare autoimmune, paraneoplastic, neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, and vascular diseases that can mimic NMOSD have to be taken into consideration as well . In all patients with double-negative NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis should be considered, especially (but not exclusively) in those presenting with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[40]</u></u>. Myelitis in NMOSD may also mimic spinal cancer or lymphoma and vice versa; whenever possible, AQP4-IgG (and MOG-IgG) should be tested and NMOSD excluded before a decision is made to perform spinal cord biopsy—a procedure that can leave patients severely disabled—for suspected spinal neoplasia 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[180]</u></u>. For a comprehensive overview of relevant differential diagnoses, see also 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>105, 110, 116, 214</u>]</u>.\n\n【4】Of note, coexistence of NMOSD with any of these differential diagnoses may rarely occur and has to be taken into consideration, both in AQP4-IgG-positive and AQP4-IgG-negative patients. Most importantly, coexisting connective tissue disorders (CTD) and other rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Sjögren’s syndrome, or Sharp syndrome, are not uncommon in patients with (usually AQP4-IgG-positive 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>) NMOSD, suggesting a shared autoimmune predisposition, and must per se not be taken as sufficient reason to reject the diagnosis of NMOSD 删除12:<u>[7, 删除13:<u>65, 74, 87, 167, 208</u>]</u>. AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD has also been reported in association with other autoimmune disorders such as myasthenia gravis (MG) 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>80, 97, 123, 138</u>]</u>, celiac disease 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>13, 73</u>]</u>, and autoimmune thyroid disease. An interdisciplinary approach is recommended in such cases. Co-existing MG should be considered not only in patients with limb paresis that becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity but also in patients with ocular weakness, respiratory insufficiency, dysphagia, dysarthria, or dysphonia. Overall, signs of co-existing autoimmunity have been reported in 25–40% of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD in some cohorts 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>74, 167, 208</u>]</u>.\n\n【5】Although a number of patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD and co-existing cancer (with AQP4 expression within the tumor tissue in some) have been reported 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[166]</u></u>, the disorder is not tumor-associated in the vast majority of cases 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>87, 192</u>]</u>. While tumor screening may in fact be indicated in individual patients, depending on the presence of risk factors or symptoms suggestive of an underlying or co-existing tumor, general screening of all patients with newly diagnosed AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD for cancer—especially by means of invasive or otherwise potentially harmful methods—is currently not recommended. Male sex, age > 45 years, and presentation with nausea and vomiting have been identified as risk factors for tumor association in European AQP4-IgG-positive patients 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[192]</u></u>.\n\n【6】All patients with suspected NMOSD attacks should be examined for signs and symptoms of infection. However, it should be taken into account that the onset of NMOSD (and MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[85]</u></u>) is not uncommonly preceded by a common cold or other infection 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>. This can lead to false suspicion of CNS infection. Very rarely, NMOSD (as well as MOG-EM/MOGAD 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>67, 85</u>]</u>) first occurs following vaccinations 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[4, 53]</u></u>. It is unclear whether infection or vaccination induces a de-novo autoimmune reaction in these patients (e.g., by molecular mimicry) or rather acts as a non-specific inflammatory trigger causing clinical exacerbation in patients with pre-existing but previously clinically latent NMOSD. Infections also frequently precede relapses in both NMOSD and MOG-EM/MOGAD; taking into account both the first attack and subsequent attacks, NMOSD attacks were preceded by infections in around 30% of AQP4-IgG-positive and 20% of AQP4-IgG-negative cases in a large European study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[87]</u></u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/神经科/共识/2023 NEMOS建议：视神经脊髓炎谱系疾病的诊断与治疗（更新版）—第1部分：诊断及鉴别诊断.pdf"}}

It was about the size of a shoe box, with a short antenna hanging from it like a loose shoestring. The streets of midtown Manhattan are full of strange things, but for some reason this one caught my eye. I soon learned that the gray box is one of 3,000 transceivers that Metricom, a company based in San Jose, Calif., had recently installed on streetlights and utility poles across New York City. The transceivers, which relay low-power radio waves above the heads of unsuspecting pedestrians, are part of a high-speed wireless network called Ricochet.\n\n【3】Wireless networks allow users to connect to the Internet while they're away from the office or home—in a coffee shop, say, or barreling down the street in a taxi. Unfortunately, most of the wireless gadgets now being sold have serious drawbacks. Have you ever tried typing a Web address on the keypad of a cellular phone? Your fingers cramp from repeatedly pushing the buttons, and your eyes get rheumy from staring at the tiny screen. Web-connected handheld computers such as the Palm VII have bigger screens and better interfaces, but their transmission rates are glacial compared with those of desktop computers.\n\n【4】The Ricochet network raises the wireless speed limit with the help of a technology known as frequency hopping. The network divides each digital signal into packets of data and transmits them at many different radio frequencies instead of a single channel. When you connect to the Internet using a Ricochet modem, the device sends a barrage of data packets to the nearest transceiver, which then directs the packets to another transceiver connected to a high-speed landline. The first Ricochet networks, launched in 1995, delivered data to users at 28.8 kilobits per second (kbps). The newest networks—operating in New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area and about a dozen other U.S. cities—promise a transmission rate of 128 kbps, or more than twice the rate of a typical desktop modem (56 kbps), at least 80 percent of the time.\n\n【5】The palm-size Ricochet modem is designed to work with laptop computers; Velcro strips on the device allow you to attach it to the back of your laptop's screen. You can buy the modem for as little as $99, but the wireless service costs about $75 a month. Is it worth the money? To find out, I decided to try the device myself删除1:<u>. The first step was to go to Ricochet's Web site 删除20:<u>(www.metricom.com/getricochet.htm)</u>, where you can determine whether your area is covered by one of the networks. The site also lists the authorized service providers (although Metricom built the networks, other companies sell the modems and service).
