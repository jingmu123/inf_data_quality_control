Within this cohort, 83 patients received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone and 22 patients received an allogenic\nHCT. There was no significant difference in EFS between these two groups (66% ± 6% vs. 80% ± 9%; P = .45). Results indicate that MRD can be useful to further risk stratify patients with intermediate risk of relapse to the appropriate treatment regimen. However, the study acknowledges that\nMRD cutoff values are regimen dependent as indicated by the divergence from the earlier ALL R3 trial. While the earlier trial advocated for the use of MRD to stratify patients for HCT, a higher threshold for MRD level was used , a difference that may reflect the more intensive induction regimen.Therefore, MRD levels may influence treatment decisions, but the application of this prognostic factor must be carefully evaluated on a regimen-by-regimen basis.\n\n【1】Approximately 20% of children treated with intensive therapies for ALL will ultimately experience disease relapse.MRD assessment may play a prognostic role in the treatment of patients in the relapsed setting.  In patients (n = 35) who experienced a second remission (morphologic CR) after reinduction treatment, MRD (measured by flow cytometry with sensitivity level <0.01%) after reinduction (day 36) was significantly associated with risks for relapse; the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 70% among patients with MRD of ≥0.01% versus 28% among those with MRD <0.01% (P = .008).In addition, in the subgroup of patients who experienced first relapse after cessation of treatment, the 2-year cumulative incidence of second relapse was 49% in patients with\nMRD of ≥0.01% versus 0% for those with MRD <0.01% (P = .014). Both the presence of MRD at day 36 of reinduction therapy and at first relapse occurring during therapy were significant independent predictors of second relapse based on multivariate analysis.In another study, MRD (PCR sensitivity level <0.01%) was evaluated in children with high-risk ALL (n = 60) who experienced first relapse within 30 months from the time of Network\n\n【2】##Nccn Guidelines Version 4Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n\n【3】chemotherapy cycle (3–5 weeks after initiation of reinduction treatment) included MRD negative (undetectable MRD), MRD positive but unquantifiable (levels <0.01%), and MRD of ≥0.01%. The 3-year EFS rates based on these MRD categories were 73%, 45%, and 19%, respectively (P < .05).Thus, MRD assessment can identify patients with a high probability of second relapse, which may offer an opportunity for risk-adapted second-line treatment strategies.\n\n【4】Several studies suggest early assessment of MRD during induction treatment (eg, day 15 from initiation of treatment) may be highly predictive of subsequent relapse in children with ALL.  This raises the possibility of identifying patients with high-risk disease who may potentially benefit from earlier intensification or tailoring of treatment regimens, or for potentially allowing less-intensive treatments to be administered in patients at low risk for relapse based on early MRD measurements. Large trials are warranted to address these possibilities, although serial MRD measurements may likely be needed to monitor leukemic cell kinetics during the long course of treatment.\n\n【5】##Mrd Assessment In Adult All\n\n【6】Studies in adults with ALL have shown the strong correlation between\nMRD and risk for relapse, and the prognostic significance of MRD measurements during and after initial induction therapy.  In an analysis of postinduction MRD (flow cytometry sensitivity level <0.05%) in adult patients with ALL (n = 87), median RFS was significantly longer among patients with MRD <0.05% at day 35 compared with those with\nMRD of ≥0.05% (42 vs. 16 months; P = .001).A similar pattern emerged when only the subgroup of patients who achieved morphologic CR at day 35 was included in the MRD evaluation. Although patient numbers were limited, 90% of patients with MRD <0.03% at an earlier time point (day 14 during induction therapy) remained relapse-free at 5 years.MRD after", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nNCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "block_text_old": " NCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "raw_context": [{"text": "NCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "bbox": [0.0, 1.0, 751.0, 17.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [0.0, 0.0, 750.0, 16.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n chemotherapy (n = 109).

Six related references to the identified article were supplemented by hand search. After de-duplication, we screened 870 studies by titles and abstracts, and 77 records were eligible for full-text review. Of these reviews, 17 studies were excluded because they were not SRs, RCTs, or quasiexperimental studies. Three studies were excluded because the populations were not mainly PWD.\nFour studies were excluded because the interventions were not non-pharmacological interventions.\nThree studies involved physiological dysphagia were also excluded. Additionally, 16 studies were excluded because the outcomes measured in the studies were not about feeding and eating disorders, the full text of 2 studies cannot be retrieved, and 1 study was not peer-reviewed.\nThe 28 included studies were published from the year 2016 to 2021. The studies were from\nEurope , North America , Australia , and East Asia . Of the 28 included studies, 1were systematic reviews, were RCTs, and 10 were quasi-experimental studies. No guidelines and best practice sheets were obtained and included in our evidence summary. The study participants lived at home, in the nursing home, in the hospital, in the day care center, etc. The sample size of PWD in each intervention group of RCTs and quasi-experimental studies ranged from 12 to 2PWD. The age of the included sample was reported to be as young as 58 years, and the rest of the patients were concentrated in the age range of 65-90 years, thus indicating that the dementia patients with feeding and eating disorders were mainly older adults.

The standard process for the development of WHO vaccine recommendations was used as the basis for developing the malaria vaccine recommendation. The process employed by the Strategic\nGroup of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, described here , complies with the principles and requirements of the standard\nGRC process which is described above and used for the development of the WHO Guidelines for malaria.

Please refer to that document for additional information on prior to their appointment in advance of each meeting. Review of DOI forms revealed no relevant conflicts and all members participated in all discussions. Support for the closed sessions of the SAGE/MPAG Working Group's full evidence review was provided by a restricted WHO Secretariat - known as the SAGE/\nMPAG Working Group Secretariat - composed of the IVB and GMP Directors, and other staff who were not involved in the generation or synthesis of evidence being reviewed by the MVIP\nProgramme Advisory Group .\n\n【8】The SAGE/MPAG Working Group performed the following functions: developed relevant and answerable question(s) in PICO format, reviewed and interpreted the evidence, with explicit consideration of the overall balance of benefits and harms; examined and provided input to the GRADE evidence profiles developed by the Cochrane Response; and formulated the proposed recommendations for SAGE/MPAG in alignment with the 2019 RTS,S Framework for WHO recommendation ( unpublished evidence ), taking into account benefits, harms, values and preferences, feasibility, equity, acceptability, resource requirements and other factors, as appropriate.\n\n【9】SAGE and MPAG were jointly convened on 6 October 2021 to review the work of the SAGE/MPAG Working Group, to consider the malaria vaccine evidence and to reach consensus on their vaccine recommendations to the Director-General of WHO .\n\n【10】Following the Director General's endorsement of the SAGE/MPAG recommendations, the evidence and deliberations that informed the WHO malaria vaccine position paper were put into the format required for the Weekly Epidemiological Record by the WHO\nSecretariat and reviewed by the a WHO Editorial Board as per the standard SAGE process. The draft was subject to broad peer review. Reviewers included members of SAGE, WHO Regional\nOffices, external subject matter experts, selected national immunization and malaria control programme managers, other interested parties (who had not been involved in the process to that point) and industry. Request for peer review from industry was coordinated through the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and the Developing\nCountry Vaccine Manufacturer Network.\n\n【11】The final recommendation, GRADE and evidence-todecision frameworks, and other relevant components were included in the WHO Guidelines for malaria and submitted for GRC review in parallel with the development of the WHO position paper in the Weekly Epidemiologic Record . contained here.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " procedures and summarized at the beginning of each meeting to all participants.

The combined survival curves made up the overall population of people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma after 2 or more systemic therapies.\n\nThe company indicated that all mixture cure models fit well to ZUMA-1 overall survival data and selected a log-logistic model based on statistical fit. The ERG generally agreed with the company approach and explained that the updated 60-month ZUMA-1 data reduced uncertainty in the estimated cure fraction. However, the ERG highlighted that all extrapolations using mixture cure and spline models were higher than ZUMA-1 Kaplan–Meier data from 50 months onwards. It argued that this was potentially overestimating long-term survival. Clinical experts thought the company extrapolations fitted well with their experience of how CAR T-cell therapies perform in clinical practice. They explained that CAR T-cell therapies are expected to provide a durable response in a minority of people, and the plateau present in the extrapolations seemed reasonable.

Clinicians should assess the degree of recent weight loss because medical complications (e.g., refeeding syndrome) are predicted by both the rapidity and total magnitude of weight loss (Garber et al. 2019; Whitelaw et al. 2018). Asking the patient about the weight that would be most comfortable for them can help align treatment-planning goals and provide additional useful information about the patient's degree of insight (e.g., if they select a desired weight that is significantly below the normal range). The clinician should also document any changes in adult height because this may reflect bone loss resulting from chronic nutritional deficiency (Misra et al. 2016).\nFor children and adolescents, obtaining historical height and weight percentiles through growth curves or charts (either documented directly or obtained from the patient's pediatrician or family physician) may help to identify growth retardation associated with AN and is extremely important for characterizing changes in the patient's weight and height trajectory (Marion et al. 2020; Modan- Moses et al. 2003, 2021; Swenne and Thurfjell 2003). It can also be helpful to take a developmental history of feeding and eating, as described below for ARFID.\nA thorough assessment of food and eating patterns, and any changes to patterns of eating behavior, is critical for evaluation of a possible eating disorder. Food repertoire changes (as reflected by typical daily diet habits) may include choosing foods with different (often lower) caloric density, changing to a specific type of diet (e.g., vegan/vegetarian, high protein/paleo, gluten free), reducing the variety of foods eaten, avoiding entire food groups (e.g., dairy) or macronutrients (e.g., fat, carbohydrates), or developing food intolerances, phobias, or aversions. Consequently, it is important to determine whether food ingestion is sufficient to sustain healthy growth and development, whether patterns of food restriction or avoidance may contribute to possible nutritional deficiencies, and whether significant changes in food preferences represent onset of health conditions other than eating disorders. It can also be helpful to ask about ways in which patients find eating behaviors to be helpful to them, including their motivations for food restriction or avoidance. Such inquiries can help patients feel understood and can identify gaps in coping strategies that may warrant attention in treatment.\nIndividuals with eating disorders, particularly individuals with AN (Gianini et al. 2015), may exhibit abnormal mealtime behaviors, such as excessively tearing or cutting up foods, chewing each bite a certain number of times, delaying onset of eating, or avoiding particular combinations of foods. Other eating disorder-related behaviors may include chewing and spitting, rumination, or concern about gastrointestinal (GI) effects of eating (e.g., fullness, bloating, abdominal pain). Individuals with an eating disorder may also avoid social situations because of heightened sensory experiences of others' food, feelings of disgust at watching others eat, or self-consciousness about others commenting on their food choices.\nClinicians should inquire about the presence of binge eating, during which the individual experiences a sense of loss of control over eating and consumes an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances (American Psychiatric Association 2013). It is helpful to learn what occurs during a patient's typical binge, because their subjective description may provide additional insights into their eating behaviors.

ISFN has been reported in patients with prior FL or concurrent FL (at other sites), as well as in individuals with no known history of FL and the prevalence of ISFN in the general population has been reported to be 2%.  Although uncommon (5%—6%), the development of or progression to overt lymphoma has been reported in patients reported to have ISFN.  The significance or potential for malignancy of ISFN in patients without known\nFL remains unclear. These instances may potentially represent the tissue counterpart of circulating B-cells with t(14;18), or may represent a very early lesion with t(14;18) but without other genetic abnormalities that lead to overt lymphoma.  The WHO classification recommends that a diagnosis of FL not be made in such instances, but that the report should suggest evaluation for the presence of FL elsewhere, and possibly close follow-up.\n\n【1】FL of the gastrointestinal tract (primary intestinal FL) is a recently described entity. It is most commonly diagnosed in the small intestine and the vast majority of incidences are in the duodenum. The morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic features are similar to those of nodal FL.\nHowever, most patients present with clinically indolent and localized disease. Survival appears to be excellent even without treatment. In many of the other extranodal sites, the morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic features are similar to those of nodal FL.

Results were confined to the following article types:\nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV;\nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic\nReviews; and Validation Studies.\n\n【6】The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel's review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion.\n\n【7】##Diagnosis\n\n【8】Immunophenotyping using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or flow cytometry for cell surface marker analysis is required to establish a diagnosis. FL has a characteristic immunophenotype, which includes CD20+, CD10+, BCL2+, CD23+/-, CD43-, CD5-, CCND1-, and BCL6+.\n\n【9】Occasionally, FL may be CD10- or BCL2-. The diagnosis is easily established on histologic grounds, but immunophenotyping is encouraged to distinguish FL from a nodular mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Molecular genetic analysis to detect BCL2 rearrangement; karyotype or FISH to identify t(14;18) and BCL6, 1p36, and IRF4/MUM1 gene rearrangements; and IHC for Ki-67 and IRF4/MUM1 for FL grade 3, cyclin D1 may be useful under certain circumstances. Low-grade FL with a high proliferation index (Ki-67 ≥30% as determined by immunostaining) has been shown to be associated with an aggressive clinical behavior.  There is no evidence, however, that high Ki-67 should guide the selection of therapy.\n\n【10】The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) is a prognostic scoring system that divides patients into three distinct", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nNCCN", "block_text_old": " NCCN", "raw_context": [{"text": "NCCN", "bbox": [0.0, 1.0, 751.0, 16.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [0.0, 0.0, 750.0, 15.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n t(14;18) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). 15-17 ISFN has been reported in patients with prior FL or concurrent FL (at other sites), as well as in individuals with no known history of FL and the prevalence of ISFN in the general population has been reported to be 2%. 15,16 ,18 Although uncommon (5%—6%), the development of or progression to overt lymphoma has been reported in patients reported to have ISFN. 19,20 The significance or potential for malignancy of ISFN in patients without known\nFL remains unclear.

Image guidance may be required to facilitate target definition. Preliminary results from single-institution studies have shown that significant dose reduction to organs at risk (OARs; eg, lungs, heart, breasts, kidneys, spinal cord, esophagus, carotid artery, bone marrow, stomach, muscle, soft tissue and salivary glands) can be achieved with advanced RT planning and delivery techniques such as 4D-CT simulation, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), image-guided RT, respiratory gating, or deep inspiration breath hold. \nThese techniques offer significant and clinically relevant advantages in specific instances to spare OARs and reduce the risk of late complications from normal tissue damage. This is especially important for patients being treated with curative intent or who have long life expectancies following therapy.  In mediastinal lymphoma, the use of 4D-CT simulation and the adoption of strategies to deal with respiratory motion such as inspiration breath-hold techniques, and image-guided RT during treatment delivery is also important.\n\n【1】Randomized prospective studies to test these concepts are unlikely to be done since these techniques are designed to decrease late effects, which usually develop 10 or more years after completion of treatment. Therefore, the guidelines recommend that RT delivery techniques that are found to best reduce the doses to the OAR in a clinically meaningful manner without compromising target coverage should be considered.\n\n【2】Involved-site RT (ISRT) is recommended as the appropriate field for NHL as it limits the radiation exposure to adjacent uninvolved organs (such as lungs, bone, muscle, or kidney) when lymphadenopathy regresses following chemotherapy, thus minimizing the potential long-term complications.  ISRT targets the initially involved nodal and extranodal sites detectable at presentation.Larger RT fields should be considered for limited-stage indolent NHL, often treated with RT alone. 46\n\n【3】##Comprehensive Nccn Guidelines Version 1B-Cell Lymphomas\nNetwork\n\n【4】Treatment planning for ISRT requires the use of CT-based simulation. The incorporation of additional imaging techniques such as PET and MRI often enhances the treatment planning. The OARs should be outlined for optimizing treatment plan decisions. The treatment plan is designed using conventional, 3D conformal, or IMRT techniques using clinical treatment planning considerations of coverage and dose reductions for OAR.The principles of ISRT are similar for both nodal and extranodal disease.\nThe gross tumor volume (GTV) defined by radiologic imaging prior to biopsy, chemotherapy, or surgery provides the basis for determining the clinical target volume (CTV).Possible movement of the target by respiration as determined by 4D-CT or fluoroscopy should also influence the final CTV. The presence of suspected subclinical disease and uncertainties in original imaging accuracy or localization may lead to the expansion of the CTV. The planning treatment volume (PTV) is an additional expansion of the CTV that accounts only for setup variations.\n\n【5】In the case of extranodal disease, particularly for indolent lymphoma, in most circumstances the whole organ comprises the CTV (eg, stomach, salivary gland, thyroid). For other organs, including orbit, breast, lung, bone, localized skin, and in certain circumstances when RT is consolidation after chemotherapy, partial organ RT may be appropriate.\nNo radiation is required for uninvolved lymph nodes for most NHL subtypes.\n\n【6】The general dose guidelines for individual subtypes of NHL are outlined in the Principles of Radiation Therapy section of the algorithm.\nRecommendations for normal tissue dose constraints can be found in the Principles of Radiation Therapy section of the NCCN Guidelines for Hodgkin Lymphoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nNCCN  授权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:29在医脉通平台下载 , 仅供个人使用 , 戸禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "block_text_old": " NCCN  授权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:29在医脉通平台下载 , 仅供个人使用 , 戸禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "raw_context": [{"text": "NCCN  授权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:29在医脉通平台下载 , 仅供个人使用 , 戸禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "bbox": [0.0, 2.0, 751.0, 17.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [0.0, 1.0, 750.0, 16.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n careful monitoring to avoid the risk of missing geographic location of the tumor and subsequent decrease in tumor control.

In a meta-analysis of 61 prospective cohort studies comprised of 1 million subjects with or without risk factors, but free from CV diseases, both\nCHD and stroke mortality appeared to increase at around 115/75 mmHg, without any J-curve phenomenon above these levels.In a cohort of 1.25 million subjects, initially free from CV disease, the lowest risk for CV disease was in people with SBP of 90-114 mmHg and DBP of 60- 74 mmHg, without any evidence of J-curve phenomenon above these levels.Based on 1.3 million adults in a general outpatient population from Kaiser Permanente\nNorthern California, the composite CV endpoints were lowest at SBP of 110 mmHg and at DBP of 62 mmHg, after adjustment of age and other covariates.Among 1,235,246 individuals who participated in routine medical examinations in Korea, the hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for potential confounders. During 22.7 million person-years of follow-up, an increase in SBP was directly related to an increase in vascular mortality at SBP above 100 mmHg. SBP < 90 mmHg may portend death from vascular causes, particularly from ischemic heart disease.These data suggested that SBP can be safely reduced to a level of 100-110 mmHg, while a DBP around 60 mmHg seemed to be safe.\nAmong RCTs, it is also uncommon to find any J-curve phenomenon if CV endpoints were evaluated prospectively, though the BP levels obtained in RCTs were generally higher than what we have mentioned in the epi- demiological studies. In the three most important RCTs in isolated systolic hypertension (SHEP, Syst-Eur, Syst- China), the risk of stroke was significantly decreased while myocardial infarction was also reduced in the treatment group compared to the placebo group.  No\nJ-curve phenomenon was observed. In fact, the DBP in the treatment group in the SHEP trial was only 68 mmHg, and the risk of myocardial infarction was still significantly/ reduced by 33%.In the final report of the SPRINT trial, comprised of 9,361 patients at a mean age of 67.9 years and pre-treatment SBP of 139.7 mmHg, an intensive treatment target (SBP < 120 mmHg) versus a standard treatment target (SBP < 140 mmHg) reduced composite\nCV endpoints (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.63-0.86, p value <  and all-cause death (HR: 0.75, 95% Cl: 0.61-0.92, p = 0.006), 8 , The final achieved SBP was 120.0 mmHg versus 133.9 mmHg and DBP 68.7 mmHg versus 76.3 mmHg, 8.258 with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction (HR: 0.72, 95% Cl: 0.56-0.93, p = 0.01).These evidence suggested that SBP and DBP could be safely reduced to 120 mmHg and 70 mmHg, respectively.\nMost of the data claiming a J-curve phenomenon came from post-hoc analyses of RCTs in patients with pre-existing CVD or high CV risk.  For example, in the post-hoc analysis of the ONTARGET trial, the achieved SBP < 130 mmHg had higher CV event rates compared with those who achieved SBP > 150 mmHg.

However, pancreatic stent placement for a normal pancreas has been reported to cause pancreatic duct\nTherefore, the duration of stent placement stenosis. 125 should be kept as short as possible.In addition, it has been reported that APC cauterization during EP did not increase the incidence of papillary stenosis.\n\n【2】##Statement 5–3:\n\n【3】In cases of post-EP late AEs, such as papillary stenosis and biliary duct stones, endoscopic transpapillary treatment should be considered.\n\n【4】##Commentary:\n\n【5】Acute pancreatitis and acute cholangitis, which are potential post-EP late AEs, should be treated following the disease guidelines.If AEs are caused by papillary stenosis, endoscopic treatment is recommended.EST/EPST for the stenosis site is often performed.Moreover, balloon dilatation, 59 stent placement, 97,99,116,122 and a combination of these procedures may be performed.Surgical papilloplasty has been performed in cases of failed endoscopic treatment due to severe papillary stenosis.No therapeutic strategies for papillary stenosis have been established.\nFor biliary stones, endoscopic stone extraction is recommended. 121\n\n【6】##References\n\n【7】Kojimahara N, Nakayama T, Morizane T et al.

Among the 6,356 subjects on candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, those with a mean on-treatment SBP of 160 mmHg or more had a 2.61% per year rate of the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, rescue from cardiac arrest, heart failure, or revascularization. This was more than three-fold higher than the 0.75% per year rate in patients with an on-treatment SBP of 120-140 mmHg. The composite event rate was also significantly higher in those with a mean ontreatment SBP of 140-160 mmHg, at 1.4% per year. The event rate in patients with an on-treatment SBP below 120 mmHg was identical to that of patients with a value of 120-140 mmHg. Only among patients with an ontreatment DBP of 90 mmHg or more was the composite event rate significantly greater than in those with a DBP of 70-80 mmHg, who had the lowest event rate by a margin of 1.89% versus 0.75% per year. In this landmark trial, optimal outcomes were seen with an achieved, ontreatment SBP of 130-140 mmHg and a DBP of 75-80 mmHg, by ROBP.\n\n【1】##10.2 Meta-Analysis\n\n【2】The most informative data come from a recently published meta-analysis. This meta-analysis was conducted by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration in individual participant-level data from 48 randomized trials of BP lowering medications versus placebo or other classes of BP-lowering medications, or between more versus less intensive treatment regimens.Data were pooled to investigate the stratified effects of BP-lowering treatment in participants with and without prevalent CV disease overall and across seven SBP categories (ranging from < 120 to ≥ 170 mmHg).\nMean pre-randomization SBP/DBP were 157/89 mmHg in participants without previous CVD (54%). There was substantial spread in BP at baseline, with 8.0% of individuals without CVD having a SBP of < 130 mmHg, and 19% without CVD having a DBP < 80 mmHg in primary setting. The relative effects of BP-lowering treatment were proportional to the intensity of SBP reduction. At 4.15 years of follow-up, those without previous CVD at baseline, the incidence rate for developing a MACE per 1,000 person-years was 31.9 (95% Cl: 31.3-32.5) in the comparator group and 25.9 (95% CI: 25.4-26.4) in the intervention group. Hazard ratios associated with a reduc- tion of SBP by 5 mmHg for a major CV event were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) for participants without previous\nCVD. That is comparable for participants with previous\nCVD. These findings do not substantiate concerns about a J-shaped association between BP and CV outcomes in post-hoc analyses of several RCTs . In this large-scale analysis of RCTs, a 5 mmHg reduction of SBP reduced the risk of MACE by about 10%, irrespec -/ tive of primary or secondary prevention, and even at normal or elevated BP levels.\n\n【3】##11. Patients With Diabetes Mellitus\n\n【4】##Recommendations/Keypoints\n\n【5】•For patients with diabetes mellitus, a BP target of <\nVAX 130/80 mmHg, based on HBPM or standardized office s :  BP, are recommended (COR I, LOE B).\n\n【6】Guidelines vary with target BP of < 130/80 mmHg to < 140/90 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus. Evidence supports lower mortality when achieving SBP ≤ 135 mmHg and DBP ≤ 80 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Diabetic patients were excluded from the SPRINT trial, so we do not have information about the optimal\nBP targets by AOBP measurement. After the ACCORD trial, there are many debates regarding the traditional office BP targets for diabetes.There are several limitations in the design of the ACCORD trial: 1) patients aged > 80 years were excluded, 2) patients with dyslipidemia were excluded, and 3) patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL were excluded.The number of enrollment in the ACCORD trial was too low to have enough power to show difference of intensive (SBP < 120 ). mmHg) and conventional (SBP < 140 mmHg) strategies in the composite CV endpoints. Despite this, the annual rates of stroke, a pre-specified secondary outcome, were decreased by 41% in the intensive treatment group .More importantly, in the standard glycemic control group, the intensive BP treatment group had a lower 5-year CV events compared with the standard BP treatment group (6.9% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.05).In a recent analysis combining the ACCORD trial and the SPRINT trial, 465 the primary CV endpoints, stroke, and heart failure all favored the intensive treatment group, without significant heterogeneity between the 2 trials. 465", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " 1", "block_text_old": " 1  ", "raw_context": [{"text": "1  ", "bbox": [22.0, 41.0, 132.0, 90.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [21.0, 40.0, 131.0, 89.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n between mean in-trial BP as recorded in many measurements and vascular outcomes.

(Expert opinion) Small PSP without signs of immediate severity . The presence of signs of severity in a small PSP should prompt the clinician to consider another diagnosis such as SSP. A small PSP itself cannot cause respiratory or hemodynamic failure. Relevant signs of poor tolerance to be investigated and to guide the management are rest dyspnea or pain unresponding to non-opioid analgesics.\nNo study focused specifically on small PSP, only among PSP managed conservatively .\nThe group recommends conservative management for patients with small PSP without signs of poor tolerance.

No study has compared air removal from the pleural cavity using NA or CTD with and without local anesthesia. Conducting such a study nowadays seems unethical.\nAlthough the intensity of pain caused by pleural puncture, placement of a small-bore chest tube using the Seldinger technique, or placement of a large-bore CTD is not similar, these painful procedures can be completely prevented by local lidocaine anesthesia of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and intercostal muscles. As for any invasive procedure, it seems legitimate to advocate an analgesic management (at least a correctly performed local anesthesia  ).\nMost RCTs of NA and CTD have used local anesthesia .\nThe sufficient dose of lidocaine is generally of 2 mg kg − 1 (injected into the chest wall), with a maximal dose of 4–5 mg kg − 1 . Needle insertion should target the upper edge of the rib in order to avoid injury to the neurovascular bundle, and to ensure that there is no blood reflux into the syringe through gentle aspiration before injecting.\nThe group recommends performing local anesthesia of the chest wall before air removal from the pleural cavity through NA or CTD. (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence).\n</u>\n\n【4】参考删除-3:<u>Analgesia. No study investigated pain management in PSP treated conservatively, with NA or with CTD. Only one RCT  reported a transient and partial efficacy of intrapleural injection of 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine every 8 h to reduce pain related to the CTD, within 60 min after the injection, but not at 4 or 8 h, and no effect on morphine use. A RCT in patients who underwent thoracic surgery reported the decrease in pain related to cough or mobilization following 20 min application of ice on chest tube insertion site . No study performed in patients drained for a PSP allows a conclusion.\nThe group recommends to base pain management on multimodal analgesia in patients medically treated for PSP (NA, CTD, conservative management). (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence) Analgesia during chest tube removal. Chest tube removal is a most painful procedure  . Analgesic management during chest tube removal is justified.\nRCT assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions on tube removal-related pain were performed for larger-bore chest tubes ( ≥ 16 Fr) after cardiothoracic surgery.\nThe use of morphine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) before removal seems equivalent . The addition of local anesthesia with topical lidocaine-prilocaine or subcutaneous lidocaine may improve pain upon chest tube removal, especially in the absence of multimodal systemic analgesia  .\nThe main non-pharmacological technique is cold application on and around the chest tube insertion site 15–20 min before its removal. Many studies explore this technique and a meta-analysis has shown a beneficial effect of cold application. Although this gain in pain scores may appear modest, this technique is recommended, especially for large-bore chest tubes .\nThe group recommends a multimodal analgesia including cold application to reduce pain associated with large-bore chest tube removal ( ≥ 16 Fr). (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence).\nThe group proposes to use analgesia during small-bore chest tube removal, but further studies are needed to determine the preferred method of analgesia (Expert opinion)\n</u>\n\n【5】##Specific Cases\n\n【6】Simultaneous (or synchronous) bilateral PSP.

Changes in the treatment recommendations and the increasing available evidence have justified the implementation of new recommendations since last Belgian consensus in 1998 . Several non- H. pylori Helicobacter species (NH. PYLORI-H ), colonizing the stomach of domestic animals, also have the ability to cause gastric disease in humans, although to a lesser extent. These zoonotic NH. PYLORIH are not the subject of the current recommendations.\n\n【5】##Methods\n\n【6】The Belgian Helicobacter pylori and Microbiota Study Group (BHMSG) commissioned these recommendations and appointed a coordinator (RG-D) who invited the listed authors to the project development. The key questions were prepared by the coordinator and then approved by the other members. The coordinator formed task force subgroups, each with its own leaders, who were assigned key questions. Each task force performed a systematic review of the scientific evidence and developed a series of recommendations that were subjected to a process of iterative voting. All members of the BHMSG were invited to participate, including gastroenterologists, microbiologists, pathologists, and paediatricians. The team members were instructed to scrutinize the literature for relevant articles pertaining to their fields of expertise. For bibliographic research, priority was given to identifying systematic reviews and other critical synthesis documents of the scientific literature. In a second phase, a search for individual studies, randomized clinical trials and observational studies was carried out, as well as a review of the bibliographic references of the included papers up\n\n【7】##To August 2022.\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>The team leaders initially developed the recommendations and various web meetings were held to discuss and resolve issues. The recommendations resulting from the online voting were discussed and approved during a face-to-face meeting, which took place in Brussels in May 2022. After each vote, the coordinator reviewed the recommendations according to the comments and votes received, integrating the suggestions to maximize the agreement. They were then subjected to anonymous voting interaction process using the Delphi method. For each recommendation, participants rated their level of agreement on a 6-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree; 2: disagree; 3: somewhat disagree; 4: somewhat agree; 5: agree; 6: strongly agree). Any rating lower than 6 obliged the coordinators to review each of the sections of the recommendation (wording, degree of evidence, strength of the recommendation and justification) and make suggestions for improvement. A recommendation was endorsed if more than 80% of the participants agreed (score 4-6 on the Likert scale). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) system was used to classify the scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendations . The GRADE system is a structured and explicit grading process that is being widely adopted at the inter- national level, with the advantage of overcoming the limitations of previous systems and homogenizing the recommendation formulation system for all institutions . Each recommendation is accompanied by the grade of recommendation (GR; strong or weak), the quality of evidence (QE; high, moderate, low or very Correspondence to: Rodrigo Garcés-Duran, Cliniques de l'Europe, avenue de Fré 206, 1180, Uccle.

In contrast, chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy shows decreased ventricular wall motion, myocardial inflammation persisting for at least 30 days, and fibrosis accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, but presents no cardiomyocyte necrosis at the time of diagnosis.\nA case of ventricular remodeling progressing to present dilated cardiomyopathy-like features, despite improvement in findings of active inflammation due to myocarditis, is termed post-myocarditis cardiomyopathy.It has become apparent that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy include a relatively large proportion of those with histopathologically persistent myocardial inflammation, and this condition is sometimes called inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy. Conceptually, it is understood that inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy is included in chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy.\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " 8", "block_text_old": " 8", "raw_context": [{"text": "8", "bbox": [66.0, 26.0, 78.0, 39.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [65.0, 25.0, 77.0, 38.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n| Term | Society Guidelines\\n20091 | \\nstatement\\n20133 | Society Guidelines\\nDocument\\n2023\\n20202 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Acute\\nmyocarditis | Myocarditis <3 months\\n(∼several months) after onset\\ncardiomyocytes) | Myocarditis <3 months\\nafter onset\\n•  Histologically characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration\\n•   Cardiomyocyte injury (degeneration/necrosis accompanied by encroachment of inflammatory cells at the perimeter of | \\nMyocarditis <30 days after onset |\n| Chronic active\\nmyocarditis | \\nNot defined\\n(Conceptually included in\\nchronic myocarditis) | \\nNot defined | •   Myocarditis >30 days after\\nonset\\n•   Histologically characterized\\nby inflammatory cell\\ninfiltration\\n•   Cardiomyocyte injury\\nNot defined\\n(degeneration/necrosis\\naccompanied by\\nencroachment of\\ninflammatory cells at the\\nperimeter of\\ncardiomyocytes) |\n| Chronic\\nmyocarditis | Myocarditis >3 months\\n(∼several months) after onset\\n•   Histologically characterized\\nby mononuclear cell\\ninfiltration (not defined by\\nimmunohistochemistry)/\\naggregation (≥5 cells/HPF)\\n•   Cardiomyocyte injury\\n(degeneration/necrosis\\naccompanied by\\nencroachment of\\ninflammatory cells at the\\nperimeter of\\ncardiomyocytes) | Myocarditis >3 months\\nafter onset\\n•   Histologically, fibrosis\\naccompanied by\\ncardiomyocyte\\nabnormality (variation in\\ncardiomyocyte size, etc.)\\nand inflammatory cell\\ninfiltration (leukocytes in\\nmyocardial tissue\\n≥14/mm2 with\\nCD3-positive T cells\\n≥7/mm2)\\n•   Not described regarding\\ncardiomyocyte injury | Myocarditis >30 days after\\nNot described\\nonset\\n•   Histologically characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration\\n•   No cardiomyocyte injury (degeneration/necrosis\\naccompanied by encroachment of inflammatory cells at\\nthe perimeter of cardiomyocytes)\\n•   Transitional phase between acute myocarditis and\\nchronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy |\n| Chronic\\ninflammatory\\ncardiomyopathy | \\nNot defined | \\nNot defined\\n(Conceptually included in\\nchronic myocarditis as\\ninflammatory\\ncardiomyopathy) | Myocardial inflammation persisting for ≥30 days after onset\\n•  Decreased ventricular wall motion\\n•   Histologically, there is fibrosis accompanied by\\ncardiomyocyte abnormality (variation in cardiomyocyte\\nsize, etc.) and inflammatory cell infiltration (leukocytes in\\nmyocardial tissue ≥14/mm2 with CD3-positive T cells\\n≥7/mm2)\\n•   No cardiomyocyte injury (degeneration/necrosis\\naccompanied by encroachment of inflammatory cells at\\nthe perimeter of cardiomyocytes) |\n| Inflammatory\\ndilated\\ncardiomyopathy | \\nNot defined |  | •  Subgroup of dilated cardiomyopathy\\n•   Histologically characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration\\n•   No cardiomyocyte injury (degeneration/necrosis\\naccompanied by encroachment of inflammatory cells at\\nthe perimeter of cardiomyocytes)\\n•   Conceptually included in chronic inflammatory\\ncardiomyopathy |\n| HPF, high-power field.

{"seq_id": "6f67604d-ed57-431c-8e61-28c7eb79a2a0", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:86\nComprehensive Guidelines Version 2Ovarian Network  associated with longer operating times, more blood loss and transfusions, and longer hospital stays.More recently, a large randomized trial (LION, NCT00712218) found that in patients with stage IIB–IV ovarian cancer who had macroscopically complete resection and normal nodes both before and during surgery, lymphadenectomy did not improve PFS or OS, and was associated with increased rates of serious postoperative complications and mortality within 60 days after surgery.However, meta-analyses that included data from retrospective and observational studies have found that systematic lymphadenectomy improves OS in patients with advanced disease, even though PFS is not improved. 706,707,718-720\n\n【1】Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with disease confined to affected ovaries or to the pelvis, and for those with more extensive disease who have tumor nodules outside the pelvis that are 2 cm or less (presumed stage IIIB). Para-aortic lymph node dissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena cava and the aorta bilaterally to at least the level of the inferior mesenteric artery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels. The preferred method of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is removal of lymph nodes overlying and anterolateral to the common iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the external iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric vessels, and from the obturator fossa at a minimum anterior to the obturator nerve.For those with more extensive disease outside of the pelvis (nodules >2 cm), suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible.  Systematic lymph node dissection and resection of clinically negative nodes is not required for these patients because results will not change staging and the procedure does not appear to impact OS, based on results from randomized trials (described above).  Some surgeons classify debulking based on the number of procedures.\nProcedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include: bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.Extensive resection of upper abdominal metastases is recommended as part of debulking for patients who can tolerate this surgery, as it is associated with improved RFS and OS.  Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for stage II or III invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential candidates for IP therapy.In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of an IP catheter with initial surgery. 588\n\n【2】##Surgical Considerations For Mucinous Tumors\n\n【3】Since primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon, it is important to establish the primary site in patients with these tumors. Thus, the upper and lower GI tract should be carefully evaluated to rule out an occult GI primary with ovarian metastases, and an appendectomy need only be performed in patients with a suspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal.

J\n\n【6】##Thrombophilia Testing In Relation To Pregnancy\n\n【7】Pregnancy is an acquired hypercoagulable state. The incidence of VTE in pregnancy or the puerperium is around 1 in 1000, 143–145 a 5- to 10-fold increase in relation to an agematched non-pregnant female population. This rises further in the first 6 weeks postpartum to a 20- to 80-fold increase in risk.  Venous thrombosis remains the leading direct the UK and Ireland.Arterial thrombosis in pregnancy is rare with an incidence quoted as 1 per 4000 pregnancies.Nevertheless, it is more common than in age-matched non-pregnant controls.\n\n【8】- Prior to testing for thrombophilia, women should be counselled regarding the implications for themselves, and family members, of a positive or negative result. When testing is performed, it is preferable that this is done before pregnancy.\nAs in other settings, testing should only be considered if it is going to influence management. Therefore, in women who have had a previous unprovoked or oestrogen provoked (oral contraceptive pill, in vitro fertilisation, or pregnancy)\nVTE, routine thrombophilia testing is not indicated as they will require thromboprophylaxis throughout pregnancy and the puerperium.\nThere is no evidence to support screening of asymptomatic women with a family history of thrombosis in the absence of a known heritable thrombophilia. In women with a first degree relative with PC, PS or AT deficiency identification of these abnormalities may affect management.\nHowever, these are rare and universal screening for these deficiencies is not justified by current evidence. Testing for AT is required when there is evidence of heparin resistance where individuals fail to achieve a specified anticoagulation level despite the use of what is considered to be an adequate dose of heparin based on weight and renal function.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis 151 estimated the absolute risks of a first episode of VTE in pregnancy with different heritable thrombophilias. The authors concluded that based on having a higher absolute risk of VTE, women with AT, PC or PS deficiency or with homozygous FVL should be considered for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy and the puerperium. Women with heterozygous FVL , heterozygous F2 G20210A, or heterozygosity for both FVL and F2 G20210A should generally not be prescribed thromboprophylaxis on the basis of thrombophilia and family history alone. Other than for heterozygous FVL , the data were insufficient to allow further estimation of risk during the antenatal and postpartum periods separately in the presence or absence of a family history, and confidence intervals were wide. The greatest absolute risk was seen with antithrombin deficiency, and a subsequent large retrospective cohort study of women with type I antithrombin deficiency similarly found a high risk even in the absence of a family history.Arterial thrombosis is rare in pregnancy but given the association of APS with both arterial and venous thrombotic events in this demographic, testing for antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered, ideally prior to pregnancy. It is possible to have a marked variation in the level of antiphospholipid antibodies during pregnancy and if aPL testing is performed during the pregnancy, results should be interpreted with caution as negative or positive agnosis of APS.

Repeat thrombolysis has been used on occasion, although it is noted that recurrent pump thrombosis is a significant risk for future thrombosis.Features that were associated with greater likelihood of successful thrombolytic therapy include lesser degree of power elevation on logfile (consistent with lower intrapump thrombosis burden), and somewhat paradoxically a more gradual increase in the power.The thrombolysis regimen used varies with institutions, but systemic alteplase 50 mg infusion over 24 hours is commonly used, with continuation of intravenous heparin.Other strategies might be administering 2 initial boluses of mg alteplase, followed by an infusion of 50 to 70 mg alteplase over several hours.\nThe frequency of intracranial hemorrhage complicating thrombolysis varies between 0% and 21%.A review of the patient's history and prethrombolysis brain computed tomography (CT) scan is recommended to help predict hemorrhagic risk.

Its causes, include a distal thrombus in the outflow graft, kinking or, more commonly, external compression exerted on the outflow graft by fibrin and clots. During HVAD implantation the pump is de-aired by inserting a venting needle in the outflow graft. Material can subsequently leak between the outflow graft and the graft covering sleeve, leading to compression of the graft. In the setting of outflow obstruction, pump parameters demonstrate a\n##The Journal Of Thoracic And Cardiovascular Surgery\n• 2022\n\n【4】progressive decrease in flow and power. Hemolysis markers might be normal or only slightly elevated. Patients might be asymptomatic or experience HF recurrence. If outflow graft obstruction is suspected, a chest\nCT angiogram with 3D reconstruction should be obtained to visualize the location and severity of the obstruction.\nImmediate treatment depends on the cause of the obstruction and can include heparin infusion, graft covering sleeve excision, or stent placement.

The tool included a conversational agent, Gabby, who provided culturally sensitive and empathetic prepregnancy risk assessment and increased the proportion of individuals engaged in behavior change through person-centered decision making and goal setting. Social marketing campaigns through media outlets have shown promise in increasing awareness of the importance of prepregnancy health and existing maternal health outcomes disparities.  Further adaptation of evidence-based mobile health lifestyle interventions promoting ideal CVH 107 113 to focus on prepregnancy health should also be studied.\n\n【3】##Community-Engaged Design And Implementation Of Prepregnancy Cvh Interventions\n\n【4】To achieve health equity among birthing individuals, attentive design of community-based interventions is crucial and will require community-centered engagement at every stage of the research process. This is especially imperative for populations with an increased frequency of unfavorable CVH, including people of underrepresented races and ethnicities who have intersecting barriers to optimal health attributable to social determinants of health before, during, and after pregnancy.Innovative strategies that are culturally cognizant and recognize sociocultural and environmental contexts to optimize CVH are needed. For example, Black women are significantly more likely than White women to have unfavorable CVH with multiple prepregnancy cardiovascular risk factors (eg, obesity, diabetes), and risk is higher among individuals within lower economic strata.Hispanic women, in particular those from certain subgroups (eg, Puerto Rican women), may experience a disproportionate burden of adverse social determinants of health such as poor health care access and quality and language barriers that contribute to disparate risk of APOs and CVD.In the limited data that are available from birthing individuals from Asian subgroups,\nAsian Indian compared with White pregnant individuals have a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Thus, consideration of sociocultural context of individuals from various backgrounds, including consideration of nativity and acculturation along with experience of structural barriers (eg, racism, built environment, health care access), is of key importance in the design of interventions. Specifically, tailoring and adaption through user-centered and participatory approaches can bolster the effectiveness and relevance of interventions.\nEffectiveness and relevance can also be optimized through engagement with community steering committees or advisory boards with key stakeholders and participants from the target population.  This will also facilitate the design of interventions that maximize strengths and resources present within communities to promote an asset-based approach that empowers disenfranchised communities. For example, the harnessing of civic engagement and community advocacy as a means to collectively address health disparities has resulted in improved cardiovascular risk factors (eg, blood pressure, physical activity) in Black women.  There is also evidence to support integration of similar models fostering volunteerism to promote favorable CVH among Hispanic females.Such interventions can incorporate peer leaders (such as community health workers, or promotoras) who serve as role models and provide social support to promote CVH.  Meeting women in the community by embedding place-based interventions within their neighborhoods—at venues such as hair salons, churches, public housing, college campuses, and workplaces—is another potential strategy to promote CVH.  Further investigation is needed to understand how incorporating interpersonal relationships and social support through partners, friends, and community may also optimize interventions.\n\n【5】##Addressing Structural Determinants Of Cvh With Policy- Level Interventions\n\n【6】To substantially improve prepregnancy CVH and downstream maternal and offspring outcomes, the wider influence of multifaceted structural and social determinants of health must be acknowledged and addressed.

Both mutations result in activation of the tyrosine kinase domain, and both are associated with sensitivity to the small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and osimertinib .Because these EGFR mutations are sensitive to the EGFR TKIs, they were previously referred to as sensitizing EGFR mutations; however, the specific mutations are now described. These common EGFR mutations are found in approximately 10% of white patients with NSCLC and up to 50% of Asian patients.Other less common mutations (approximately 10%), which are also sensitive to EGFR TKIs, include exon 20 p.S768I, exon 21 p.L861Q, and/or exon 18 p.G719X .  Data suggest that patients harboring tumors without these specific EGFR mutations should not be treated with EGFR TKIs in any line of therapy, although there are exceptions.\n\n【6】Most patients with the common EGFR mutations have adenocarcinoma histology and either have never smoked cigarettes or previously lightly smoked. Data suggest that EGFR mutations can occur in patients with adenosquamous carcinoma, which is harder to discriminate from squamous cell carcinoma in small specimens.Patients with pure squamous cell carcinoma are less likely to have the common EGFR mutations; those with adenosquamous carcinoma may have mutations.  However, smoking status, ethnicity, and histology should not be used in selecting patients for testing.

Furthermore, superiority of golimumab over no treatment was not detected regarding efficacy or safety outcomes. Indeed, when comparing golimumab to placebo, the RRs for clinical remission and mucosal healing were 3.01 (95% CI, 0.60–15.1) and 2.27 (95% CI, 0.96–5.38), respectively. Golimumab and placebo posed similar risks of AEs (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95–1.35) and SAEs (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.21–2.43).\nPanel comment beyond GRADE: The failure to recommend golimumab as maintenance therapy resulted from the strict critical outcomes used to assess efficacy.

Setting 5: optimization strategies and de-escalation of anti-TNF-based treatments Statement 16: For adults with moderate to severe UC,\nIG-IBD makes no recommendation on using an anti-TNF agent plus an immunosuppressant vs. anti-TNF monotherapy as maintenance treatment . ( No recommendation; very low-quality evidence for infliximab; knowledge gap for adalimumab and golimumab – Agreement rate: 86%) Statement 17: For adults with moderate to severe UC\nIG-IBD makes no recommendation on using an anti-TNF agent plus an immunosuppressant vs. immunosuppressant monotherapy as maintenance treatment. ( No recommendation; knowledge gap – Agreement rate: 82%) The panel makes no recommendation on using an anti-TNF agent (infliximab, adalimumab or golimumab) plus an immunosuppressant vs. anti-TNF monotherapy as maintenance treatment in adults with UC in remission (PICOs 51, 52, and 53). Only limited evidence comes from a single open-label, prospective, oneyear, randomized controlled trial that compared a combination therapy (infliximab plus azathioprine) to infliximab monotherapy in a mixed population of IBD patients. In this study, no significant difference between treatments was observed in terms of clinical remission (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.87–1.62). The quality of evidence is very low, and data were insufficient to explore differences in terms of mucosal healing, AEs or SAEs. Furthermore, no studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with adalimumab or golimumab plus an immunosuppressant versus the corresponding biologic monotherapy as maintenance treatment in UC patients. Finally, it is unknown how combination therapy with any anti-TNF agent (infliximab, adalimumab or golimumab) plus an immunosuppressant compares to immunosuppressant monotherapy as maintenance treatment (PICOs 54, 55, and 56).\n\n【3】Statement 18: For adults with UC who lost the response to anti-TNF agents, IG-IBD makes no recommendation on using therapeutic drug monitoring or a standard symptombased approach of dose optimization. ( No recommendation: knowledge gap – Agreement rate: 86%) Statement 19: For adults with UC who lost the response to anti-TNF agents and do not respond to dose escalation,\nIG-IBD makes no recommendation on using an anti-TNF agent plus an immunosuppressant or making a therapeutic change. ( No recommendation; knowledge gap – Agreement rate: 82%) IG-IBD makes no recommendation on using therapeutic drug monitoring or a standard symptom-based approach of dose optimization in patients who lost the response to anti-TNF agents (PICO 57). It also makes no recommendation on the choice between an anti-TNF agent plus immunosuppressant or a therapeutic change in patients who lost the response to anti-TNFs despite dose escalation (PICO 58).\nPanel comment beyond GRADE: Although the evidence is insufficient to formulate recommendations, therapeutic drug monitoring, when available, can be considered a useful tool to drive therapeutic choices in case of non-response or loss of response with anti-TNF agents, as also suggested by a recent consensus statement .\n\n【4】Statement 20: For adults with UC who achieved long-term deep remission, IG-IBD makes no recommendation about the withdrawal of anti-TNF treatment. (No recommendation; very low-quality evidence – ʿ Agreement rate: 100%) The panel makes no recommendation about the withdrawal , of anti-TNF treatment in adults with UC who achieved long-term deep remission. The only study that addressed this issue was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted on 92 Japanese patients who achieved deep remission with infliximab (defined as corticosteroid-free remission for more than 6 months and a Mayo Endoscopic Subscore of 0 or 1). The study found that continuing anti-TNF treatment was marginally superior to withdrawing the drug in terms of maintaining clinical remission (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.91). It is noteworthy that neither the patients nor the health care providers were masked to the randomization, which introduced a serious risk of bias. The study also sought evidence for other efficacy outcomes, such as maintenance of clinical response and mucosal healing, but the data were insufficient to draw any conclusion. No differences were observed between the infliximab-continued and infliximab-discontinued groups in terms of AEs (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.29–2.04).\nPanel comment beyond GRADE: The possibility of withdrawing treatment with an anti-TNF agent when long-term deep remission has been achieved should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and discussed with the patient. In case of withdrawal, remission can be maintained with 5-aminosalicylates or thiopurines .\nHowever, the higher rate of clinical remission in patients who continue anti-TNF treatment and the risk of relapse in cases of discontinuation should always be considered.\n\n【5】##3. Conclusions\n\n【6】Taken together, these 20 statements try to be a benchmark for clinicians dealing with ulcerative colitis ( Table 3 ). The overall indication for clinical practice, however, should not arise only from the statement itself, but the statement should be integrated by the panel comment - where present - and by the agreement rate.

In this study, patients were primarily risk-stratified based on treatment response; patients were treated according to risk-adjusted intensive chemotherapy, with the incorporation of MRD evaluation during induction (day 19) to determine the need for additional doses of asparaginase.  The 5-year EFS rate for the AYA population (aged 15–18 years; n = 45) was 86% (95% CI, 72%–94%), which was not significantly different from the 87% EFS rate (95% CI, 84%–90%; P = .61) observed for the younger patients (n = 448). The 5- year OS rates for the AYA patients and younger patients were 88% and 94%, respectively ( P = .13).  The favorable EFS and OS outcomes in AYA patients in this study were attributed in part to the use of intensive dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase, in addition to early IT therapy (ie, triple IT chemotherapy with MTX, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) for CNS-directed therapy. In addition, the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation was safely omitted in this study; the 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse and any CNS relapse was 3% and 4%, respectively, for the entire study population (n = 498).Moreover, all 11 patients with isolated CNS relapse were children <12 years of age. This study showed that, with intensive risk-adjusted therapy and effective CNS- directed IT regimens, AYA patients can obtain long-term EFS without the need for cranial irradiation or routine allogeneic HCT.\n\n【1】##Nccn Recommendations For Evaluation And Treatment Of\nExtramedullary Involvement\n\n【2】CNS involvement should be evaluated with lumbar puncture at timing in accordance with the specific treatment protocol used for each patient.\nPediatric-inspired treatment regimens typically include lumbar puncture at diagnostic workup. The panel recommends that lumbar puncture, if performed, be conducted concomitantly with initial IT therapy. Throughout Network\n\n【3】##Nccn Guidelines Version 2Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n\n【4】maintenance phases of treatment, all patients should receive adequate\nCNS prophylaxis with IT therapy and/or systemic therapy that incorporates\nMTX.\n\n【5】In general, the use of cranial irradiation for pediatric patients with ALL and CNS-3 involvement at diagnosis varies according to the treatment protocol. If cranial irradiation is done, the recommended dose is 18 Gy (at 1.5–1.8 Gy/fraction). The timing of cranial irradiation is less clear for patients with T-ALL, though it is recommended that a specific treatment protocol is followed in its entirety. TBI is recommended for select patients at high risk receiving HCT. In patients who require cranial irradiation and TBI, cranial irradiation should be given as a boost before or after TBI . The entire brain and posterior half of the globe should be included in the radiation field. The inferior border should include C2.\nNotably, areas of the brain targeted by the radiation field in the treatment of pediatric patients with ALL are different from those targeted for brain metastases of solid tumors.\n\n【6】Adequate systemic therapy should also be given in the treatment of patients with isolated CNS relapse. Although the timing is dependent on the treatment protocol, cranial irradiation at a dose of 18 Gy is recommended. All patients receiving cranial irradiation should be monitored for neurocognitive deficits and academic delays, neuroendocrine deficits, secondary malignancies, cataracts, and other late effects.

Furthermore, surgical practice can vary depending on locoregional expertise and sociocultural factors.\nMethods: The Asia Pacific Society of Sexual Medicine (APSSM) panel of experts reviewed contemporary evidence regarding penile reconstructive and prosthetic surgery with an emphasis on key issues relevant to the Asia-Pacific (AP) region and developed a consensus statement and set of clinical practice recommendations on behalf of the APSSM. The Medline and EMBASE databases were searched using the following terms: 'penile prosthesis implant,\" \"Peyronie's disease,\" \"penile lengthening,\" \"penile augmentation,\" \"penile enlargement,\" \" \"buried penis,\" 'penile dependent of the search and the search of the perioding for the sense of the perioding and the perioding o undertaken, and the panel evaluated, agreed, and provided consensus statements on clinically relevant penile reconstructive and prosthetic surgery, namely  penile prosthesis implantation,  Peyronie's disease,  penile trauma,  gender-affirming (phalloplasty) surgery, and  penile esthetic (length and/or girth enlargement) surgery.\nMain outcome measures: Outcomes were specific statements and clinical recommendations according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine, and if clinical evidence is lacking, a consensus agreement is adopted. The panel provided statements on clinical aspects of surgical management in penile reconstructive and prosthetic surgery.\nResults: There is a variation in surgical algorithms in patients based on sociocultural characteristics and the availability of local resources.\nPerforming preoperative counseling and obtaining adequate informed consent are paramount and should be conducted to discuss various treatment options, including the pros and cons of each surgical intervention. Patients should be provided with information regarding potential complications related to surgery, and strict adherence to safe surgical principles, preoperative optimization of medical comorbidities and stringent postoperative care are important to improve patient satisfaction rates. For complex patients, surgical intervention should ideally be referred and performed by expert high-volume surgeons to maximize clinical outcomes.\nClinical implications: Due to the uneven distribution of surgical access and expertise across the AP region, development of relevant comprehensive surgical protocols and regular training programs is desirable.\n\n【4】Received: October 3, 2022.

The panel reviewed 2,714 abstracts and selected 17 studies for review ( e-Tables 8a -8c ). Salivary secretion management included anticholinergic agents, BT therapy, and RT ( Table 4 ). For most salivary secretion management options, the balance of risks, including treatment-specific adverse events, and benefits, such as improvement in symptoms, was considered to favorprobably to favor the intervention. Exceptions were or anticholinergics, where the balance was neutral because some patients feel symptomatic relief, whereas others do not tolerate them well, and RT, where it is not clear ( e-Appendix 4 ). Specifically, the harm may outweigh the benefits for RT in some patients. However, patients with significant debility resulting from sialorrhea can obtain achieve long-term permanent relief from this intervention. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low for all interventions.\n\n【1】##Table 4 J\n\n| Therapy\\nAnticholinergic\\nmedications\\nBotulinum toxin (Botox\\ntherapy to salivary\\nglands\\nSalivary gland RT | \\n) | Suggestions\\n(cid:2) An initial trial of an inexpensive oral anticholin-\\nergic is suggested.\\n(cid:2) Continue to use if the beneﬁts are greater than\\nthe side effects.\\n(cid:2) More expensive and potentially longer-acting\\nanticholinergic patch medication also can be\\nconsidered.\\n(cid:2) Limited data, doses are not deﬁned.\\n(cid:2) See individual studies for doses in the\\nsupplement .\\n(cid:2) Limited data, doses not deﬁned.\\n(cid:2) See individual studies for doses in the\\nsupplement. | Remarks\\n(cid:2) Relatively inexpensive and readily\\navailable.\\n(cid:2) Individual patient beneﬁts and adverse\\nevents can be assessed easily.\\n(cid:2) Inexpensive, lasting beneﬁcial effects\\non salivary function.\\n(cid:2) May need to be repeated.

Optimal timing of non-IRA intervention may be based on individual patient condition.\n\n【1】##Revascularization Strategy For Non-Culprit Lesions In Acute Myocardial Infarction With Cardiogenic Shock\n\n【2】Summary of the major guidelines and recent publications The ESC guidelines recommend that routine revascularization of non-IRA lesions should not be performed during primary PCI for patients with CS.Results from the Culprit Lesion Only PCI Versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) trial found that the 30-day risk of a composite of death or severe renal failure leading to renal replacement therapy was lower in those who initially underwent PCI of the IRA-only than in those who underwent immediate multivessel PCI. 62 )\n\n【3】##Evidence From Korea\n\n【4】Analyses of data from the KAMIR and Korean Working Group in Myocardial Infarction (KorMI) registries showed that in-hospital mortality rates in patients with CS did not differ in those who underwent non-IRA and IRA-only PCI (31.7% vs. 24.5%; p=0.247).Findings from the KAMIR-NIH registry showed that the risks of all-cause death and non-IRA repeat revascularization were significantly lower in the multivessel PCI group than in the IRA-only PCI group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43–0.82; p=0.001; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17–0.90; p=0.028).Patients undergoing non-IRA PCI during the index hospitalization were included in the multivessel PCI group, which showed favorable long-term clinical outcomes. In the CULPRIT-SHOCK study, however, 17.7% of patients in the IRA-only PCI group underwent staged multivessel revascularization. In the assessments of long-term outcomes, data from the KAMIR-NIH registry showed that the 3-year risks of recurrent MI  and non-IRA repeat revascularization  were significantly lower in patients who underwent multivessel than IRA-only PCI.In addition, the 1-year risk of repeat revascularization in the CULPRIT- SHOCK study was significantly lower in the multivessel than in the IRA-only PCI group.Recommendation\n•In AMI patients with CS, emergent PCI of the culprit lesion is recommended, whereas routine immediate revascularization of non-IRA is not recommended. Staged multivessel PCI may be considered.\n\n【5】##Part 4. Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices In Acute Myocardial Infarction Complicated By Cardiogenic Shock\n\n【6】##Summary Of The Major Guidelines And Recent Publications\n\n【7】Despite advances in knowledge and treatment techniques, AMI, complicated by CS, remains a leading cause of death worldwide and a challenge for interventional cardiologists.Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices have been widely used as they can provide hemodynamic cardiopulmonary support until cardiac function recovers in patients with CS refractory to conventional medical therapy, such as fluid or vasopressive agents.

The ATV/r plus RAL regimen switch was associated with higher rates of virologic failure and treatment discontinuation than the switch to ATV/r plus TDF/FTC.A regimen consisting of ATV/r plus RAL cannot currently be recommended (AI).\n\n【5】##Maraviroc Plus Boosted Protease Inhibitor\n\n【6】In a randomized controlled trial, patients with virologic suppression who were on a regimen of two NRTIs plus a boosted PI and who had only CCR5-tropic HIV (as detected by proviral DNA testing) were randomized to continue their current regimen or to switch to MVC plus two NRTIs or to MVC plus a boosted PI. The boosted PI plus MVC regimen switch was associated with higher rates of virologic failure and treatment discontinuation than the other two regimens. Based on these results, a regimen consisting of a boosted PI and MVC cannot be recommended (AI). 60\n\n【7】##Maraviroc Plus Raltegravir /\n\n【8】In a nonrandomized pilot study, patients with virologic suppression were switched from their prescribed regimen to MVC plus RAL.

The Introduction in ISO 7029  includes the statement: \"Hearing thresholds presented in this document are generally lower at high frequencies than those in the previous editions of this document. The 4 kHz dip observed in males has become negligibly small. The source data of the previous editions might not have been screened rigorously in terms of hearing abnormalities.\nProblems related to instrumentation might also have affected measurement data\". The section headed \"Scope\" in ISO 7029  includes the statement: ''The data are applicable for' estimating the amount of hearing loss caused by a specific agent in a population. Such a comparison is valid if the population under study consists of persons who are otologically normal except for the effect of the specific agent. Noise exposure is an example of a specific agent\". These two statements provide good reasons for not using earlier versions of the standard and for not using the tabulated values in oles et  al. , which in any case contain several erroneous entries.\nThe equations given in ISO 7029  can be used to calculate HL values for any desired age (up to 80 years) and percentile. This can sometimes change the outcome of the bulge analysis. Table 2 shows a bulge analysis based on the same case as for Table 1, but using HL values taken from ISO 7029  for a man aged 50 years at the 9 th percentile. The measured HTL at 1 kHz is 1.9 dhigher than the HL value, while the HTL at 8 kHz is 1.4 dlower than the HL value. When the HL values from ISO 7029  are used, the R3(a)\nLrequirement is met; the estimated NIHL at 4 kHz is 11 d.\nIt should be noted, as acknowledged by oles et al. , that the NIHL estimated using the Lmethod for diagnosis underestimates the true/ extent of the NIHL, because the noise exposure often affects the HTLs at the anchor points (Passchier-Vermeer, 1974; Smoorenburg, 1992). Hence, as stated by the authors, the Lmethod should not be used to quantify NIHL.\nFor cases of exposure to broadband steady noise, we recommend use of a modified version of the Lmethod. The requirements of the modified version, denoted (mod), are as follows:\n</u>\n\n【3】R1(mod). single measurement of the HTL at 3, 4 or 6 kHz should be at least 10 dgreater than the HTL at 1 kHz or 2 kHz. This is actually the same as R1.\nR2(mod). There should be evidence for an NIL of 90 d or more. The reasons for this lower NIL were given earlier in this paper.\nR3(mod). There should be a downward notch or bulge in the audiogram in the range 3–6 kHz. notchl is c defined as present when the HTL at 3 and/or 4 and/or 6 kHz is at least", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " give higher HTLs) based on the data presented in Lutman and\nDavis (1994).

Also, the tables give AAHL values only for the 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentiles and only for ages up to 70 years at five-year intervals, so the values are quite coarsely quan - tized. The misfi t values are interpolated across frequency on a logarithmic frequency scale (line D) and used to give adjusted AAHL values (the sum of rows C and D). These adjusted AAHL values are set equal to the measured HTL when they are greater (worse) than the measured HTL, since noise exposure is generally accepted not to improve\nHTLs. The differences between the adjusted AAHL values and the measured HTLs are shown in the bottom line of the table; these correspond to the estimated NIHL. Any value exceeding 10 dB at 3, 4, or 6 kHz qualifies as a bulge. In this case, R3(a) is not satisfied; the largest estimated\nNIHL is 8 dB at 4 kHz.\nIt should be noted that although the CLB diagnostic method is currently the most widely used method in the UK, there have not, to our knowledge, been any published studies of its sensitivity in diagnosing NIHL produced by exposure to steady broadband noise. One reason for this is that there is no generally accepted \"gold standard\" for deciding whether or not a diagnosis of NIHL is correct.

HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients treated with alemtuzumab, ibrutinib, and idelalisib. HBV carriers have a high risk of HBV reactivation. Fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death associated with HBV reactivation have occurred in patients receiving anti-CD20 mAb-containing regimens, including rituximab, obinutuzumab, or ofatumumab.Patients receiving IVIG may be HBcAb positive as a consequence of IVIG therapy.Antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring is recommended in high-risk patients receiving anti-CD20 mAb, alemtuzumab, purine analogs, ibrutinib, and idelalisib. Prophylactic antiviral therapy with entecavir is recommended for patients who are HBsAg positive and undergoing anti-lymphoma therapy.\nEntecavir is more effective than lamivudine in preventing rituximab-associated HBV reactivation.Lamivudine prophylaxis should be avoided due to the risks for the development of resistance. The appropriate duration of prophylaxis remains undefined, but the panel recommended that surveillance and antiviral prophylaxis should be continued for up to 12 months after the completion of treatment. 285\n\n【4】##Cytomegalovirus Reactivation\n\n【5】Clinicians should be aware of the high risk of CMV reactivation in patients receiving fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy, idelalisib, or alemtuzumab. Monitoring for the presence of CMV viremia using quantitative PCR (at least 2–3 weeks) is an effective approach to the management of CMV reactivation.Current practices include the use of prophylactic ganciclovir if CMV viremia is present or the use of ganciclovir if the viral load is found to be increasing during therapy.Consultation Venion 3, 2023  2023 Comprehensive Canoer Network (NCCN), All rights reserved. NCCN Guidelines'' and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the\n##Autoimmune Cytopenias\n\n【6】Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]), and PRCA are the most frequent autoimmune cytopenias in patients with CLL.  Bone marrow evaluation is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of autoimmune cytopenias.\n\n【7】Although the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was used for the diagnosis of AIHA, most patients with AIHA have a negative DAT; additional markers such as low haptoglobin and elevated reticulocyte and LDH are required to confirm the diagnosis of AIHA.Patients with advanced disease, unmutated IGHV , increased serum beta-2 microglobulin level, and high expression of ZAP-70 are also at a higher risk of developing AIHA. \nPurine analog-based therapy was associated with AIHA. Recent studies reported higher incidence of AIHA in patients treated with fludarabine or chlorambucil compared to those who received fludarabine-based combination regimens.AIHA should not preclude the use of combination therapy containing fludarabine. However, patients should be observed carefully and fludarabine therapy should be avoided in those where a history of fludarabine-associated AIHA is suspected.\nITP in patients with CLL is associated with poorer survival independent of common clinical prognostic variables.High white blood cell (WBC) count, unmutated IGHV , positive DAT, and ZAP-70 positivity are associated with the development of ITP in patients with CLL.AIHA and ITP can be managed with corticosteroids in most cases. IVIG, cyclosporine, 297 and splenectomy should be used in steroid-refractory cases. Rituximab was also effective for the treatment of patients with autoimmune cytopenias.  Eltrombopag and romiplostim are\nFDA-approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP that is refractory to steroids, IVIG, and splenectomy and have also been", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nNational", "block_text_old": " National", "raw_context": [{"text": "National", "bbox": [107.0, 25.0, 184.0, 41.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [106.0, 24.0, 183.0, 40.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n# National Comprehensive Nccn Guidelines Version 3.2023\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma\nCancer\n", "block_text_old": "# National Comprehensive Nccn Guidelines Version 3.2023 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma Cancer\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "National Comprehensive NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2023", "bbox": [107.0, 34.0, 633.0, 56.0]}, {"text": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma", "bbox": [246.0, 58.0, 988.0, 86.0]}, {"text": "Cancer", "bbox": [106.0, 63.0, 175.0, 77.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [106.0, 33.0, 987.0, 85.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nNetwork®", "block_text_old": " Network®", "raw_context": [{"text": "Network®", "bbox": [106.0, 80.0, 191.0, 95.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [105.0, 79.0, 190.0, 94.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n their risk. 278 See NCCN: Cancer and COVID-19 Vaccination for additional updated general information.", "block_text_old": " their risk. 278 See NCCN: Cancer and COVID-19 Vaccination for additional updated general information.", "raw_context": [{"text": "their risk. 278 See NCCN: Cancer and COVID-19 Vaccination for additional", "bbox": [28.0, 117.0, 510.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "updated general information.", "bbox": [29.0, 138.0, 219.0, 153.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [27.0, 116.0, 509.0, 153.0], "position": 4, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation", "bbox": [29.0, 172.0, 248.0, 189.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [28.0, 171.0, 247.0, 188.0], "position": 5, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nHBV reactivation has been reported in patients treated with chemotherapy ± immunotherapy agents. 279,280 HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients treated with alemtuzumab, ibrutinib, and idelalisib.

Of these, LCEA was used to define BDDH in 28 studies, and one used LCEA combined with Sharp angle and ACEA; 14 studies reported the LCEA range of 20° to 25°, 10 reported 18° to 25°, and four reported < 25°.\nAdditionally, 18% of hip dysplasias showed a change in pelvic tilt of > 10° on radiographs from supine to standing.\n\n【1】To unify understanding and promote application, it is recommended that the LCEA (the line connecting the center of the femoral head parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body and the line connecting the center of the femoral head to the bony outer edge of the acetabulum) should be measured on standing (weight-bearing) anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. The reference points of the outer edge of the acetabulum should refer to Wiberg's method, that is, the lateral bony edge of the acetabulum.\n\n【2】The LCEA between 20° and 25° is classified as BDDH, while symptomatic BDDH is defined as an angle between 20° and 25° as well as the presence of hip pain and limited joint mobility.\n\n【3】##Diagnosis Of Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【4】The diagnosis of symptomatic BDDH includes clinical history, main symptoms, and physical and imaging examinations. There are two definitions of \"instability\" and \"microinstability\" for hip instability about BDDH. It is recommended that to use the term \"hip instability\" to describe joint instability in symptomatic BDDH. Clinical history should be expanded to clarify the presence of trauma, performing dance or other athletic sports, and previous diagnosis and treatment. The main symptoms include hip pain, limited mobility, and limp, mostly caused by mechanical injury and/or hip instability.\nPhysical examinations should include general orthopedic examination and specific tests for hip instability, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) impingement, and generalized ligamentous laxity. Imaging examinations should include X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scan and 3D reconstruction, and musculoskeletal ultrasound to assess joint stability, osseous structural abnormalities, soft tissue injury, articular cartilage injury, and OA.\n\n【5】##Non-Surgical Treatment Of Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【6】The purpose of non-surgical treatment is to relieve pain and improve joint function and dynamic stability of joint muscle tissue. Patients with an initial diagnosis of symptomatic BDDH, no obvious joint instability, and no standardized conservative treatment should receive systematic conservative treatment. Patients with symptomatic BDDH with extra-articular disease and complex symptoms should be recommended for conservative treatment. Treatment options include changes to lifestyle and exercise, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and protective cartilage supplements, and enhancing perihip function through physical therapy. The treatment time is 3 to 6 months. Stretching and muscle flexibility exercise could improve the strength and balance of the perihip muscle group, but should be used with caution for BDDH with hip instability.\n\n【7】##Surgical Procedure Of Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【8】Hip arthroscopy and PAO are currently common surgical procedures for symptomatic BDDH. The selection of optimal treatment for symptomatic BDDH lacks clinical guidelines or expert consensus. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that preferred arthroscopy or PAO or arthroscopy combined with PAO produces better clinical outcomes, but the cause of symptoms (mechanical injury and/or hip instability), surgical risk factors, indications, and contraindications should be given priority when formulating surgical plans. 17 ,\n\n【9】##Risk Factors Of Arthroscopy For Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Age ≥ 42 years was a risk factor for arthroscopic surgery of BDDH. Obese patients with hip pain were 5.6 times more likely to have a conversion to total hip arthroplasty after arthroscopy. Body mass index (BMI) was positively correlated with preoperative visual analog scale score and negatively correlated with postoperative hip outcome score-sports subscale of BDDH patients. Beighton score ≥ 4 indicates that the hip joint has a larger range of internal and external rotation, flexion, and abduction, leading to instability. The risk factors for arthroscopy treatment for symptomatic BDDH include: demographic factors (age ≥ 42 years and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ), symptoms and signs (severe pain when standing or walking straight, and abductor fatigue or physical examination showing hip instability), soft tissue structure (ligamentum teres tear ≥ 50% and joint capsule and surrounding tissue injury) or generalized ligamentous laxity (Beighton score ≥ 4), osseous structure (Tönnis angle > 15°), OA (Tönnis grade 1), local mild cartilage damage, and psychological factors (severe anxiety, depression, or high expectations).\n</u>\n\n【11】##Indications Of Arthroscopy For Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【12】Non-surgical treatment of BDDH has no significant improvement in symptoms, and arthroscopy is the preferred treatment for pathological changes within the acetabular labrum as well as articular cartilage injury.\nThe incidence of BDDH combined with Cam-type FAI is 40% to 93%. It is recommended that clinical symptoms and signs should be attributed mainly to acetabular labral injury, FAI, or AIIS impingement, and symptomatic\nBDDH without significant improvement after conservative treatment, which are indicated for arthroscopy.\n\n【13】##Contraindications Of Arthroscopy For Symptomatic Bddh\n\n【14】In BDDH patients, excessive femoral anteversion increases the load of static and dynamic stabilizers in front of the joint (iliopsoas, hip extensor, and/or hip external rotation), which aggravates anterior instability and/or posterior impingement.  Femoral neck shaft (FNS) angle cartilage, which is closely related to the degree of cartilage injury of the acetabulum and femoral head and is prone to poor prognosis after arthroscopy.

Risk factors for gastric cancer in Lynch syndrome include male sex, older age, MLH1 (cumulative lifetime risk of diagnosis through age 80 is 5%–7%) or MSH2 (cumulative lifetime risk of diagnosis through age 80 is up to 9%) pathogenic variants, a first-degree relative with gastric cancer, Asian ethnicity, or residing in, or immigrant from countries with high background incidence of gastric cancer, chronic autoimmune gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and gastric adenomas.  Cumulative lifetime risk of diagnosis of small bowel adenocarcinoma through age 80 is elevated for carriers of MLH1 and MSH2/EPCAM P/LP variants (0.4%–11%) and slightly elevated for carriers of an MSH6 P/LP variant (<1%—4%).  Studies specific to Lynch syndrome have not reported cumulative small bowel cancer risk higher than 0.1% for PMS2. 82 However, the panel did not interpret these data as suggesting risk for a Lynch syndrome carrier would be lower than for the general population. There are data demonstrating that upper GI surveillance in Lynch syndrome detects upper GI cancers at early stages.  Upper GI surveillance also identifies pre-neoplastic lesions of the upper GI tract in Lynch syndrome.  At this time, it remains uncertain whether upper GI surveillance reduces upper GI cancer mortality in Lynch syndrome. For individuals with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or EPCAM P/LP variants, upper GI surveillance with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) starting at age 30–40 years and repeated every 2–4 years, preferably performed in conjunction with colonoscopy, is recommended.  Age of initiation prior to 30 years and/or surveillance interval less than 2 years may be considered based on family history of upper GI cancers or highrisk endoscopic findings (such as incomplete or extensive GIM, gastric or duodenal adenomas, or Barrett esophagus with dysplasia).

Over the years, the lymphatic basin concept has been investigated, especially in relation to early gastric cancer, focussing on ICG fl uorescence lymphatic mapping aiming to customise surgical lymphadenectomy according to tumour T stage, patient condition and risk profile .\nA total of 553 records were identified. Following screening for eligibility and according to inclusion/exclusion criteria established, 7 articles were included in the final analysis: 1 RCT, 4 prospective and 2 retrospective studies .\nAll studies evaluated ICG fl uorescence lymphatic mapping for gastric cancer: in four studies, including the RCT, lymphography was performed in laparoscopic gastrectomy (both distal and D2 total gastrectomies), while in the other three prospective studies, surgical procedures were robotics. ICG injection in the peritumoral area was performed endoscopically in the submucosal layer in all studies, either intraoperatively or the day before surgery. The main outcome analysed was the number of removed lymph nodes; 5 studies, including the RCT conducted on 260 patients, demonstrated that ICG lymphatic mapping could noticeably improve lymphadenectomy (higher number of lymph nodes retrieved compared to white light standard imaging technique). No significant differences in post-operative complications were reported between the two techniques.

No studies were identified on the use of specific antihypertensives for cardiovascular prevention in patients with\nAPS.

In patients with SLE /or APS, hyperlipidaemia treatment should follow recommendations used in the general population. (LoE: 5, GoR: D)\nHigher levels of total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been associated with a higher risk of MI stroke in SLE. 74 78 83 One study using national administrative data found that patients with SLE treated with lipid-lowering agents had a significantly lower risk of coronary artery disease during follow-up (mean 8.4 years) than those not treated, while short-duration or long-duration statin use were both associated with a lower risk of stroke.Several other observational studies included statin use as a covariate in prediction of cardiovascular events, identified statin use as a risk factor for events, likely representing confounding by indication. 71 85 -88 Diagnosis of SLE is not sufficient per se for prescribing lipid-lowering treatment for primary cardiovascular prevention.In APS, no study was identified that examined the effect of lipid-lowering agents on cardiovascular events. The task force judged that hyperlipidaemia treatment should follow the recommendations used in the general population. 8 4A. Patients with SLE may be cidates for preventive strategies as in the general population, including low-dose aspirin, based on their individual CVR profile. (LoE: 2b, GoR: D) 4B. In asymptomatic aPL carriers with a high-risk profile with or without traditional risk factors, prophylactic treatment with low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) is recommended. (LoE: 2 a, GoR: B) In patients with SLE no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications, prophylactic treatment, with low-dose aspirin is recommended for those with a high-risk aPL profile (LoE: 2a, GoR: B) may be considered for those with a Jow risk APL profile. (LoE: 2b; GoR: C)\nThe panel agreed to include the corresponding statements (LoE GoR) about the prophylactic use of antiplatelets in SLE APS from the recent EULAR recommendations for the management of SLE 90 APS, 91 respectively. The LoA from our task force group is shown in table 1 . Use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prevention in patients with SLE or APS should be individualised (particularly in the presence of a high-risk aPL profile) according to EULAR recommendations.\n\n【1】Interventions targeting disease-related CVR factors 5. In patients with SLE, low disease activity should be maintained to also reduce CVR. (LoE: 2b, GoR: B)\nSLE activity has often been reported as a predictor of cardiovascular events. With the exception of two studies, 86 92 higher time-integrated SLEDAI levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, 69 77 79 93 more so than baseline or single measurements. 78 94 95 In three studies, 71 96 97 baseline\nSLEDAI was found to be higher in patients with cardiovascular events, although it was not carried to multivariable analysis.\nAssociations of SLEDAI with cardiovascular events was found to be stronger when considering categories of activity compared with per-unit increases, 69 suggesting a non-linear association of disease activity with cardiovascular events.\nMany studies did not consider simultaneously the associfor current prednisone dose, a 1-point increase in SLEDAI was 7 . marginally associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11).Available evidence indicates that higher disease activity may be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Thus, in addition to its importance in general patient management, 90 a low-disease activity state may also have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health. 1 6. In patients with SLE, treatment with the lowest possible glucocorticoid dose is recommended to minimise any potential cardiovascular harm. (LoE: 2b, GoR: C)\nMean dosage, cumulative exposure duration of glucocorticoid treatment have all been investigated with reference to cardio 2 . vascular events in SLE. Higher current glucocorticoid dose was? associated with a higher risk of atherothrombotic events, ischaemic' heart disease, /or stroke in two studies, 69 98 but was protective in one study 79 not associated with stroke in the SLICC inception cohort.Higher mean daily doses, greater cumulative doses, ever-use of prednisone 30 mg/day or more were more consistently associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events in both çohort case-control studies, 71 92 100 101 although glucocorticoid use was not significantly associated with cardiovascular events in two analyses of the Toronto cohort.Not all studies adjusted for SLE activity. A retrospective study that adjusted for SLE activity 98 found that higher daily doses (prednisone > 10 mg) administered continuously were significantly associated with both MI stroke. In a retrospective non-romised study, patients treated at clinics following a glucocorticoid dose-minimisation strategy had lower prednisone exposures markedly lower risks of cardiovascular damage by the SLICC measure, particularly for ', stroke.Most evidence suggests that higher glucocorticoid exposure (cumulative mean daily dose) increases CVR in SLE. The task force recommended treatment with the lowest possible corticosteroid dose to minimise risks of cardiovascular harm.\n\n【2】7. In patients with SLE, no specific immunosuppressive medication can be recommended for the purpose of lowering the risk of cardiovascular events. (LoE: 2b, GoR: C)\nUse of immunosuppressants as a class in SLE have had largely null or conflicting associations with cardiovascular events. 79 99 103\nThree studies from the Toronto lupus cohort reported either a protective 96 or null association, 93 97 while one study found that patients treated with immunosuppressants vs those not treated were more likely to develop a cardiovascular event in univariate but not multivariate analyses.Immunosuppressive therapy was also associated to higher odds of ischaemic heart disease cardiovascular events in the LUMINA 104 Hopkins lupus cohort.Studies of individual medications suggest that use of methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, or rituximab had neutral associations with cardiovascular events. 88 92 105 Conflicting results have been reported for cyclophosphamide 71 106 azathioprine. 71 88 106\nA common limitation in many studies was the examination of ever use vs never use of immunosuppressants, which may be too crude an exposure. No studies considered issues of confounding by indication, positive associations with cardiovascular disease may reflect risks due to associated disease activity or severity, or concomitant glucocorticoid use. Based on current evidence, the task force concluded that no specific immunosuppressive medication can be recommended for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.

To further investigate these findings, the CCG-1961 trial randomized patients (n = 2056; aged 1–21 years) to postinduction intensification treatment with intermittent dose scheduling of dexamethasone (10 mg/m 2 daily on days 0–6 and days 14– 20) versus continuous doses of dexamethasone (10 mg/m 2 daily on days 0–20).Among children and adolescents ≥10 years of age who experienced a rapid response to induction, use of intermittent dexamethasone during the intensification phase was associated with significantly decreased incidence of osteonecrosis compared with the standard continuous dose of dexamethasone (9% vs. 17%; P = .0005).\nThe difference was particularly pronounced among adolescents ≥ 16 years of age (11% vs. 37.5%, respectively; P = .0003). This randomized trial suggested that the use of intermittent (alternative week) dexamethasone during intensification phases may reduce the risks of osteonecrosis in adolescents.To monitor patients for risks of developing symptomatic osteonecrosis, routine measurements for vitamin D and calcium levels should be obtained, and periodic radiographic evaluation (using plain films or MRI) should be considered. In severe avascular necrosis cases, consider withholding steroids from therapy.\n\n【1】When patients are treated with InO, liver enzymes— especially bilirubin— should be closely monitored because SOS may occur.Ursodiol may be considered for SOS prophylaxis.Defibrotide may be considered for patients who develop SOS related to InO toxicity.If InO is being given as a bridge to allogeneic HCT, double alkylator conditioning is strongly discouraged.Patients treated with blinatumomab and tisagenlecleucel should be monitored for CRS and neurologic toxicity.

During the first month after tisagenlecleucel infusion, prophylaxis with anti-seizure medication may be considered.A retrospective study investigating the safety of administering IT chemotherapy during blinatumomab infusion in patients with ALL and found no statistically significant difference in incidence of neurotoxicity between patients treated or not treated with IT chemotherapy during blinatumomab infusion (18.4% vs. 27.2%, respectively; P = 0.37).For additional information regarding guidelines for immunotherapy-related toxicities, see NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities .\n\n【4】Asparaginase is also a core component of ALL regimens, most often given during induction and consolidation for Ph-negative disease and should only be used in specialized centers. In this context, patients should also be closely monitored in the period during and after infusion for allergic response. Three different formulations of the enzyme are in clinical use: 1) pegaspargase (PEG) 2) calaspargase pegol-mknl (cal-PEG) (in patients ≤ 21 years); and 3) asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn (ERW-rywn).These formulations differ in their pharmacologic properties, and may also differ in terms of immunogenicity.  Asparaginase products are associated with potentially severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) due to anti-asparaginase or anti-PEG antibodies.  PEG seems to be associated with a lower incidence of neutralizing antibodies compared with native asparaginase.However, cross-reactivity between neutralizing antibodies against native E. coli asparaginase and pegaspargase has", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nNCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "block_text_old": " NCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "raw_context": [{"text": "NCCN  搜权医脉通提供NCON指南全文下载。6079925于2024/02/22,17:43在医脉通平台下载，仅供个人使用，严禁分发。2022  美国国家综合癌症网络版权所有。", "bbox": [0.0, 1.0, 752.0, 16.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [0.0, 0.0, 751.0, 15.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n doses, may be associated with increased risks for osteonecrosis in children who are older and adolescents.

The first reported study in a paediatric EoE population using SFED On meta-analysis, 123 the SFED was shown to have a histological response rate of 72.1%, with results consistent across both adults and children. Elemental diets had a response rate of 90.8% and allergy-test directed diets of 45.5%. However the quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis was not assessed and many were observational with no randomised controlled trials. A further meta-regression of the SFED 124 showed histological remission in 69% and symptom improvement in 87.3%. Again, the quality of the studies was not assessed. SFEDs are difficult to introduce into routine clinical practice due to the high level of commitment required by patients and the need for multiple follow-up endoscopies, as well as the fact that on reintroduction the majority of responders to the SFED diet actually have only one or two foods that trigger their symptoms. Therefore, simpler dietary elimination strategies such as four-food elimination diet and two-food elimination diet (FFED and TFED) have been developed and shown to be effective in 40%–50% of the patients. Most patients with an identified dietary trigger respond to cow's milk and wheat elimination.\nIn a retrospective study of 337 children from Europe, the most common causative allergens identified were milk (42%), egg (21.5%), wheat (10.9%), peanut (9.9%) and soy (8.4%). The most successful two-food combinations were assigned to milk and wheat in 37%, or milk and egg in 33%.A one or two food elimination diet stepping up to a more restrictive four food elimination has been proposed as a clinically effective strategy for dietary management of EoE. Subsequent prospective observational studies have concluded that elimination diets are effective. 120The GDG recommends that if dietary treatments are considered for EoE, they should only be carried out under the supervision of an experienced dietitian, and commenced with a TFED, stepping up to more restrictive diets, with appropriate endoscopic and histological assessments between 8 and 12 weeks later,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nEosinophilic oesophagitis management algorithm in adults and children.
