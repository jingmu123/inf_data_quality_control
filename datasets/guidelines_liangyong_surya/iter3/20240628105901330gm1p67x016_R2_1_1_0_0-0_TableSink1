Visual feedback helps quite a bit.\" \"It can pick up an object and manipulate something on that object,\" adds Robert Ambrose, Robonaut project leader at the Johnson center. \"It can use a pistol-grip drill designed for a human, and it can articulate the trigger.\nThat's very unusual for a robot.\" Engineers plan to have Robonaut function beyond telepresence, operating on voice command.\nThen, too, some Robonaut technology might come in handy down here on Earth. In\nSomerset, England, scientists have developed a robot that incorporates the brain of the primitive sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus .\nWhen fed information through light sensors, the brain sends signals to the robot's motors, telling it how to respond. Such technology could allow prosthetics to be controlled directly from the brain. Developing prosthetics from Robonaut, however, is not in NASA's immediate future. \"It is not impossible,\" Culbert explains.\n\n\"But to interface it to the human nervous system—we don't have that capability.\"\nIn fact, only late last year did the NASA team install Robonaut's left hand and torso. The best prediction is that it will be two years before the robot is ready for launch. The slow pace stems in large part from the project's minimal funding. \"A lot of the attitude will change as the station becomes more and more of a burden on the astronauts,\" Lovchik says. \"Systems like this will look much, much better.\"\n\nPhil Scott is a technology writer based in\nNew York City .\n\n## Robonaut\"S\n\nHas more than 47 degrees of freedom, 14 in each hand alone; human hands have 22\n\nHas half the grip strength of a human, and arm can lift only 21 pounds—still strong enough for space work\n\nIncorporates various sensors, including thermal, positional, tactile, force and torque instrumentation; each arm has more than 150 sensors\n\nRelies on software written in C and C++\n\nWhy Robonaut resembles bounty hunter Boba Fett from\nStar Wars: \"The face had to meet a couple of characteristics: it had to support the cameras— the eyes—and have room for additional cameras, small ones pointing down through the chin.

Available at www.rsc.ca\n\nInformation generally favorable to agricultural biotechnology, and extensive links, can be found at the Agbioworld Web site at www.agbioworld.org/\nInformation generally skeptical of agricultural biotechnology, and extensive links, can be found at the Union of Concerned Scientists Web site at www.ucsusa.org/food/Obiotechnology.html\n\nAfter five years of commercial Bt crop use, no reports of insect resistance to the crops have emerged, according to Monsanto.\nThe company contends that roughly 90 percent of Bt corn and cotton growers comply with refuge requirements.\nBut some environmentalists question that rosy scenario and also argue that non-Bt refuges are either too small or too poorly designed to keep insect resistance at bay for long. \"At the EPA meeting last fall, scientists seemed to agree that bigger, better refuges were the way to go but that cotton farmers would never agree to big refuges,\" says Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit organization based in\nNew York City. More broadly, Goldburg questions how much\nGM crops really do for the environment. \"In however many years,\" she says, \"we'll lose Bt as an effective control against insects, and then we'll be on to another chemical control. Many of us view this current generation of biotech crops as a kind of diversion, rather than a substantive gain for agriculture.\" She favors sustainable agriculture alternatives, including careful crop rotation and organic farming methods, over pesticides sprayed on or engineered into plants.\n\n Virus-resistant GM crops have escaped widespread public concern, but they, too, pose some of the same risks as other GM crops. Some scientists worry that viruses will pick up resistance traits from virus-fighting GM crops and evolve into hard-tobeat strains that infect a newly expanded repertoire of plants.\nSome critics also question the ecological safety of emerging crops designed to resist drought, tolerate salt or deliver an extra nutritional punch. For example, Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that salt-tolerant rice could potentially behave like a disruptive weed if it found its way into vulnerable wetlands.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair to say that every single GM crop is going to be a problem,\" Rissler remarks. \"But we need to devote the research to risks now, rather than deal with repercussions later.\"\nStill, some farmers are confident that GM technology can revolutionize agriculture for the better. For 30 years, Ryland\nUtlaut of Grand Pass, Mo., has been sowing and reaping 3,500 acres along the Missouri River. Last year, for the first time, he planted only herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans across his entire, soil-friendly, no-till farm. As a result, he claims, he sprayed the crops half as often as he did before and got bigger yields. \"If even the strongest environmentalist could see my farming practices now, I think they'd understand the benefits,\" Utlaut says. \"I'm a fervent believer in this technology.\" Now he has to wait and see whether science confirms that belief.\n\na\n\nKathryn Brown is a science writer based in Alexandria , Va.","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\" accept the pollen from a GM relative.

HORSCH, vice president of product and technology cooperation at Monsanto Company, received the 1998 National\nMedal of Technology for his pioneering experiments in the genetic modification of plant cells. He talks about the promise of GM crops.\n\nTwo leading figures in the debate over genetic engineering defēnd their stances\nInterviews by Sasha Nemecek\n\nHow did you become interested in the genetic modification of plants?\nI started in this field with a strong interest in plants but with what you might call an academic interest in agriculture. I had this vague, naive notion that if we could genetically improve plants with the new tools of molecular biology, we would find a way to make biotechnology relevant to agriculture.\nThat has now happened. Biotechnology is a great tool that will allow us to produce more food on less land and with less depletion or damage to water resources and biodiversity. I am convinced that biotechnology is not just relevant but imperative for helping us meet the rapidly\n\n growing demand for food and other agricultural products. The combination of more people and rising incomes will increase the demand for food by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years.\n\nBut critics of genetically modified foods point out that companies are not going to start giving products away. Can a corporation like Monsanto make biotechnology affordable for farmers in the developing world?\nCultivating commercial markets and applying technology to help the developing world are not mutually exclusive at all. One approach that works very well is to segment the market into three different areas. One is the pure commercial market. It makes economic sense, as a forprofit company, for us to invest in products and market developments in places where we can sell our products and where we think we can make a profit.\nThe other end of the spectrum is noncommercial technology transfer, which is largely focused on public-sector collaboration. Take, for example, our collaboration to put virus-resistance genes in the sweet potato. We will never have a commercial business in the sweet potato because it's just not a market economy crop. But by sharing our intellectual property and our technical knowledge with scientists from Kenya, we have helped them develop sweet potatoes that show resistance to the most serious sweet potato disease in Africa, which can cause the loss of 20 to 80 percent of the crop.\nThen there's a third area, what I call a transitional market, where we have less experience related to biotechnology but that in the long run\nI think may be more powerful and beneficial for development efforts. We have used this approach with our older, nonbiotech products,\n\n PHOTOGRAPHS BY TOM WOLFF","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"# Gm Foot | 0 & A\\n\",\"block_text_old\":\"# Gm Foot | 0 & A\\n\",\"raw_context\":[{\"text\":\"GM FOOT | 0 & A\",\"bbox\":[59.0,40.0,212.0,84.0]}],\"block_type\":\"Title\",\"full_blocks\":[58.0,39.0,211.0,83.0],\"position\":0,\"table_info\":{}},{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n## Does The World Need Gm Foods?\\n\",\"block_text_old\":\"\\n## Does The World Need Gm Foods?\\n\",\"raw_context\":[{\"text\":\"Does the World Need GM Foods?\",\"bbox\":[37.0,239.0,728.0,296.0]}],\"block_type\":\"Section-header\",\"full_blocks\":[36.0,238.0,727.0,295.0],\"position\":2,\"table_info\":{}},{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n ROBERT B.

Liquids are important because, once substances . are dissolved, their molecules can readily come together to react. But many substances prove to be hard, if not impossible, to dissolve.\nNow a growing number of chemists believe they have discovered the correct solution—ionic liquids, peculiar combinations of salts that are liquid at room temperature. These new solvents can be tailor-made to dissolve a variety of substances, including coal, crude oil, inks, plastics, DNA and even some rocks.\n\nKenneth R. Seddon, chair of inorganic chemistry at Queen's University Belfast in\nNorthern Ireland, estimates that there are, in theory, more than a trillion different ionic liquids, millions of which are extremely stable (they remain liquid over a range of about 300 degrees Celsius) and nonvolatile (they can be used over and over). They may replace toxic, flammable and polluting volatile organic solvents, such as toluene, hexane and dichloromethane, for which the worldwide annual market is about $6 billion.\nChemists make ionic liquids by combining large organic positive ions—with unfriendly names such as 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium [emim]+—and smaller inorganic negative ions, like aluminum tetrachloride.\nThis combination of large and small ions is very different from most ionic salts, such as table salt (NaCl).\nTable salt is a solid at room temperature because positively charged sodium clings to negatively charged chlorine; thus stuck, the ions stack up to form a regular lattice. But in ionic liquids, the positive charge is less focused: because the positive ions are large, the total charge is smeared out across several atoms. In addition, the big, irregular shapes don't form crystal structures at room temperature. \"It's like trying to stack bananas instead of oranges. Bananas just don't stack well,\" comments chemist James H. Davis, Jr., of the University of South Alabama. Unable to crystallize, the substance remains a liquid.\nServing as a new kind of solvent, however, may be just the start. \"This feels like a revolution in the making,\" says Robert B. Morland, an organic chemist at BP Amoco Chemicals in Naperville, Ill. He predicts that ionic liquids will revolutionize the use of catalysts\n\n HOLBREY AND KENNETH R. SEDDON Queen's University Belfast\n\n in industrial chemistry. This is because, for a particular reaction, chemists can make an ionic liquid with the right positive and negative charge combination to dissolve the catalyst and the chemicals involved in a reaction; the liquid, however, does not affect the product of the reaction. The catalyst stays in the ionic liquid to be reused, and the product may even rise to the surface, where it can be skimmed off, he says. The\nFrench Petroleum Institute is getting ready to license for commercial use a dimer manufacturing process that exploits these very properties, according to Davis.\nDespite chemists' enthusiasm  ,  \" for industry to adopt ionic liquids there will have to be a unique advantage. It's not enough to be a bit more green,\" cautions Robin D. Rogers, director of the\nCenter for Green Manufacturing at the University of Alabama. Expense is a major hurdle: right now a pound of ionic liquid costs about $4,000 to $5,000. The amount could drop to about $200 a pound, depending on composition and quantity, Morland says. But it is still pricey compared with organic solvents—per pound, acetone sells for about $0.15 and toluene about $0.10. Of course, because ionic liquids can be recycled, a few tons would replace many tons of organic solvent.\nToxicity and environmental tests also need to be conducted, Seddon says. Initial animal test results look good, but the generous bounty of possible ionic liquids creates a catch-22 situation, points out Albert Robertson, a senior chemist with specialty chemical maker Cytec Canada. Toxicity tests cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so manufacturers are playing a waiting game, unwilling to start testing until they are certain they have the right ionic liquid. But proponents say the hurdles will just slow down the inevitable.\nSeddon and Rogers believe that major applications are some seven to 10 years away. A small-scale industrial application could emerge much sooner, in less than three years.\n\nRebecca Renner is a geologist turned science writer based in Williamsport, Pa.\n\n IONIC CRYSTAL called 1-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, as seen through polarizing filters.

In contrast, ionic solids, which consist of positively and negatively charged ions, dissolve readily in water. Ionic liquids break the solution rules: they manage to dissolve organic covalent molecules.

Grossman\n\nONDON —For the past couple of years, everyone has assumed that the next big technological thing would be wireless data services. WAP, the wireless application protocol put together by a huge group of companies, permits Web surfing over mobile phones. It's going to really come into its own, the firms insist, when third-generation, highspeed mobile telephony rolls out, perhaps as soon as year's end. Simultaneously,\nBluetooth, a standard developed by a different huge set of companies, is expected to enable all kinds of personal networking—for instance, writing with a pen that can later transmit the data to your PC.\nYet neither WAP nor Bluetooth has taken over the world; in fact, there's a chance that neither will, considering the rise of a dark-horse challenger: the cryptically named 802.11b. The standard, developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), was embraced first by Apple Computer in 1999, in the form of its\nAirPort base station. The \"b\" indicates that this second version of 802.11, originally ratified in 1997, is faster than the first: 802.11b transmits data at up to 11 megabits per second. It is, in other words, wireless broadband, and it operates in a part of the spectrum (roughly, near microwaves) that, unlike thirdgeneration, or 3G, mobile telephony, requires no license.\nMany compatible products are available.\nSet up one of those flying-saucer-like AirPort devices and a card in your desktop or laptop, and you have a local-area network without all those wires. Stick the saucer in your window, and you can go work in a nearby café. This year's Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference placed an 802.11b access point in its\nInternet room. \"What I love about it,\" says\nDan O'Brien, editor of the U.K.'s satirical ezine Need to Know (Now) , \"is that it makes the Net into what it should be: something that's all around you all the time, and you can just tap into it.\"\nSuch enthusiasm is making 802.11b one of the fastest-growing wireless standards. Local scuttlebutt has it that the entire Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology campus will be outfitted with 802.11b within the next year. The\n\n commercial service MobileStar is setting up wireless Internet access nodes in airports and hotel chains. For $2.95 for the first 15 minutes and $0.20 a minute thereafter, you can sit in the American Airlines terminal at JFK and browse the Net at broadband speeds on your laptop. Now. Today. No squinting at mobilephone screens. The securities brokerage company Nomura stated in March that it views 802.11b as a serious threat to 3G mobile telephony's hopes to make serious money out of wireless data services.\nThe London-based hacker group Consume.net is trying to line up enough publicspirited folks to paint the town wireless. So far it's in just a few spots, but the dream is that if everyone sticks a base station in the window, anyone will be able to access the Net from anywhere in town. Moreover, 802.11b enables machines to communicate directly. \"It puts control into the hands of the public,\" observes James Stevens, one of the group's leaders. \"It's not just about wireless. It's the broader idea that you can share what you've got.\"\nIf, he says, you're sending local e-mail, why not do it locally? On the Internet, e-mail for your next-door neighbor might go via Auckland and Singapore.\nIt's hard to tell how far 802.11b and its successors (with different letters and higher speeds, such as 802.11g) can go. Critics argue that such systems can't hand off connections the way mobile networks transfer calls. But that feature is pointless to many Web surfers: unlike talking, clicking on links and scrolling are hard to do while you're walking. Bluetooth may be a lot cheaper—manufacturers expect to embed the technology on a chip costing less than $5—but at 722 kilobits per second, it moves data comparatively slowly.\nWhat 802.11b has is momentum that these other standards can only dream of. Given a ubiquitous broadband wireless connection, anything, from voice calls to large chunks of data, can be transmitted. At the moment, 802.11b is still a geek thing, requiring fiddling, configuring and tolerance for imperfections.\nBut in 1990, so was the Internet.\n\n Wendy M.

Sterling, J. Salmon, D. J. Becker and D. F. Savarese. MIT Press, 1999.\nMore information about Beowulf computing can be found at the following Web sites: stonesoup.esd.ornl.gov/ extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/ www.beowulf.org/ www.cacr.caltech.edu/research/beowulf/ beowulf-underground.org/\n\nMoreover, the Stone SouperComputer was able to show how the ecoregions in the U.S. would shift if there were nationwide changes in environmental conditions as a result of global warming. Using two projected climate scenarios developed by other research groups, we compared the current ecoregion map with the maps predicted for the year 2099. According to these projections, by the end of this century the environment in Pittsburgh will be more like that of present-day Atlanta, and conditions in\nMinneapolis will resemble those in present-day St. Louis.\n\n## The Future Of Clusters\n\n THE TRADITIONAL MEASURE OF SU- percomputer performance is benchmark speed: how fast the system runs a standard program. As scientists, however, we prefer to focus on how well the system can handle practical applications. To evaluate the Stone SouperComputer, we fed the same ecoregion mapping problem to\nORNL's Intel Paragon supercomputer shortly before it was retired. At one time, this machine was the laboratory's fastest, with a peak performance of 150 gigaflops.\nOn a per-processor basis, the run time on the Paragon was essentially the same as that on the Stone SouperComputer. We have never officially clocked our cluster (we are loath to steal computing cycles from real work), but the system has a theoretical peak performance of about 1.2 gigaflops. Ingenuity in parallel algorithm design is more important than raw speed or capacity: in this young science, David and Goliath (or Beowulf and Grendel!) still compete on a level playing field.\nThe Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone SouperComputer.\nNew clusters with exotic names—Grendel, Naegling, Megalon, Brahma, Avalon,\nMedusa and theHive, to mention just a few—have steadily raised the performance curve by delivering higher speeds at lower costs. As of last November, 28 clusters of PCs, workstations or servers were on the list of the world's 500 fastest computers. The LosLobos cluster at the University of New Mexico has 512 Intel Pen-\n\n tium III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world, with a performance of 237 gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at\nSandia National Laboratories has 580\nCompaq Alpha processors and is ranked 84th. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more advanced clusters that could operate in the teraflops range (one trillion floating-point operations per second), rivaling the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\nBeowulf systems are also muscling their way into the corporate world. Major computer vendors are now selling clusters to businesses with large computational needs. IBM, for instance, is building a cluster of 1,250 servers for NuTec\nSciences, a biotechnology firm that plans to use the system to identify disease-causing genes. An equally important trend is the development of networks of PCs that contribute their processing power to a collective task. An example is SETI@home, a project launched by researchers at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley who are analyzing deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than three million PCs, which process the radio-signal data in their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into a \"computational grid\" that will work like a power grid: users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily as they now get electricity.\nAbove all, the Beowulf concept is an empowering force. It wrests high-level computing away from the privileged few and makes low-cost parallel-processing systems available to those with modest resources. Research groups, high schools, colleges or small businesses can build or buy their own Beowulf clusters, realizing the promise of a supercomputer in every basement. Should you decide to join the parallel-processing proletariat, please contact us through our Web site (http:// extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/) and tell us about your Beowulf-building experiences.

Slow, steady and balanced seems to win the race when it comes to weight control.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't what most people want to hear. The four pounds per week and up to 15 pounds in the first two weeks that Atkins promises sounds much more impressive.\n\nThere are two things you really need to know about rapid weight loss:\n\n (1) What kind of weight was lost? How much of it was body fat and how much was water, glycogen and lean tissue?\n\n (2) Are you going to you keep the weight off for good?\n\nMost low carbers won't keep the weight off for more than a year, and many will fall off the wagon long before that.\n\nKeith Ayoob, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, said in an official\nADA statement about the 2003 NEJM studies: \"Twelve months is an equalizer; you hit a wall. Your lifestyle starts to be affected and you get bored. A high dropout rate is a sign that extreme diets can be difficult to maintain.\n\nTruth is, despite Dr. Atkin's claims and the new research apparently supporting them, we still don't know what will happen in the long run. Based on the results of the recent three, six, and twelve month studies, researchers have begun to organize longer trials. One of them will be five years in length.\n\n What I believe you will see in long term studies is that Atkins and other low carb diets, while effective for weight loss in the short term, will be found no more effective for long term fat loss than any other restrictive diet (and that's NOT very effective).\n\n## Lie #5: Calories Don’T Count And You Can Eat As Much As You Want While On The Atkins Diet.\n\nDr. Atkins proposed that calories don't count and he advised his clients to eat as much as they want while on his program.

Lung function testing in mild persistent asthma will demonstrate FEV 1 and peak flow values greater than or equal to 80% of predicted, and peak flow variability between 20 and 30% from prior personal best values.\n\nAll patients with asthma (of any severity) should be prescribed inhaled, \"quick-relief\" bronchodilator therapy to be used when and if symptoms develop, on an asneeded basis. A short-acting, inhaled β 2 agonist is the recommended quick-relief agent for older children and adults. Very young children and infants might instead be placed on a short-acting β 2 agonist medication taken by mouth (orally) in liquid or syrup form as an alternative, especially if inhalation of medication is unfeasible.\n\n \"Step 2\" medical therapy is advocated in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. \"Step 2\" requires the use of daily \"controller\" medication prescribed in addition to the quick-relief, short-acting β 2 agonist medication used as needed. Inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids are the preferred daily \"controller\" medicine in mild per¬ sistent asthma. A number of alternate \"controller\" maintenance medicines can be prescribed for daily use in \"Step 2\" therapy and considered on an individual basis.

I have found it very useful to watch my patient's MDI technique during an office visit. A well-placed \"pointer\" can make a world of difference.

Why Does My Doctor Say I Should Rinse My Mouth After Using My Metereddose Inhaler (Mdi)?\n\nYour doctor has likely requested that you rinse your mouth after using your inhaler in order to gently wash away any medicine particles that were not inhaled into the lungs and may have remained behind in the throat.\nIn particular, it is important to always rinse your mouth after using any inhaled corticosteroid preparation, whether administered by MDI, DPI, or jet nebulizer.

We include different molar distalizers, how to provide anchorage or how to close spaces; in this manner, multiple treatment options are shown for an identical problem, orthodontic or orthopedic in nature.\n\nOur book consists of ten chapters, which we will describe briefly:\n\nChapter 1. Action and reaction. In an informative and straightforward approach we:\n\n .\n\nDescribe how and why teeth move orthodontically, and the effects at bone and dental levels.\nThe three laws of Newton and their clinical application during orthodontic treatment.\nA simple and easy description on how to understand the physics laws that we utilize in an orthodontic treatment. The use of forces, resultant forces, coplanar forces, center of resistance, center of rotation, moment, types of dental movements and their physiology, dental equilibrium and first, second and third order bends are clearly explained.\n\n .\n\n .\n\nChapter 2. Anchorage. In this chapter we examine the different types of anchorage utilized during orthodontic treatment, such as when to use minimal, moderate, maximum or absolute anchorage, their advantages, disadvantages and recommendations for each one.\n\nChapter 3. Space closure in orthodontics. We present a whole array of different modalities for dental space closure, from the classical elastic chain to the use of coils, wire bends and retroligatures. We also describe the forces produced by each of these additions, in the case they can be used, the advantages, disadvantages and recommendations of each one.\n\nChapter 4. Deep bite. Description of the different types of deep bites and their etiology, and the possible treatment plans for correction. We mention here why and how to use a bite plane, the use of bite ramps, bypass, why should braces be bonded near the incisal edge to help correct this problem, when to use an intrusion bend or a Tip back, how to use and how can reverse curves help us to correct a deep bite, the use of in-block intrusion arch wires like the intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiroz, the utility arch wire, the CIA and intrusive arches with loops. All these additions have advantages, disadvantages and recommendations, which are clearly explained.\n\nChapter 5. Open bite. This is one of the most difficult types of malocclusions to treat because it has a high relapse rate. As in the deep bite chapter, we describe the different causes and the different types of open bite, and their possible treatments. We discuss how we use in block extrusion bends or in an individual manner, the benefits of palatal plates and the advantages of using reverse curves on the maxilla and a curve on the mandible in order to close an anterior open bite; why brace bonding near the gingival margin helps us, cases in which we can use an individual or In block By-pass, the use of an inverted","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\" ' he book 1,001 Tips For Orthodontics and its Secrets has been written in a simple and didactic way for easy reading and understanding, ideal for the dental student, orthodontic resident or specialist.

With the use of intermaxillary elastics we can force an over eruption of the posterior teeth, this way we can level the Spee curve, increase the height of the inferior third of the face and we can lessen the depth of the anterior bite. It is important to make these procedures with rectangular wires in the braces in order to avoid brace rotation around the wire, which can happen with round wires, because this rotation may lingually incline the premolars.\n\nThe results obtained with this technique are generally very stable, the facial height and the depth of the bite are usually well maintained.

The bite opens rapidly because the arches exert 300 to 400 g continuously.\nThe intrusion of the anterior segment is slow, so the patient experiences no pain\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n 1. Distal molar angulation.\n\nPossible TMJ alterations due to molar contact points.\nPositive torque effect in the anterior and posterior segments.\nPosterior anchorage diminishes.\nIncisor proclination.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n 1. Use as anchorage an upper transpalatine arch and a lower lingual arch. This will decrease molar positive torque and distal inclination.\nWe can place the anterior braces 0.5 mm toward the incisal edge; this will accelerate the intrusion of the anterior segment.\nIn case the patient does not have a deep Spee curve, lace the posterior segment with 0.010\"or 0.012\" stainless steel wire.\n\n## The Intrusion Arch Of Quirós\n\nIn deep bite cases due to anterior teeth over-eruption, anterior bite planes are not recommended because they produce mandibular rotation and an increase of the lower third of the face; the intrusion of the upper incisors would be the best option. To achieve this we can use reverse curves, intrusive bends and arches with intrusive loops.\n\nThe presence of deep bites is one of the problems that we encounter frequently, to which we apply all our knowledge, but sometimes the resources we posses are inefficient. Not many arches with loops can help us achieve an effective intrusion of the anterior teeth, and the existing ones gener¬ ally wear off before achieving their objective. The intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiros is an excellent option for anterior segment intrusion.\n\nFor its fabrication, preform stainless steel 0.017\" x 0.025\" rectangular arches or 0.016\" x 0.022\" TMA rectangular arches can be used. We recommend a tweed plier or a plier that does not mark acute bends. (13)\n\nThe arch is made with the anterior segment placed more gingivally than the posterior segment of the arch, this will make the intrusion of the anterior teeth possible; the difference in levels will be established by the amount of intrusion needed, 3 mm is an acceptable measure. Due to its design it acts like a very elastic spring that will physiologically intrude the anterior teeth, painlessly and without adverse effects upon teeth and support tissue.

These alloys have high memory and a low load-deflection ratio that translates into less wire activation appointments. (10)\n\nThe Connecticut Intrusion Arch (CIA) is more commonly used for intrusion of the anterior teeth, but it has other uses, including molar tip back for Class II correction, for anchorage preparation of the posterior segment, correc¬ tion of minor anterior open bites, occlusal plane leveling and detailing.\n\n The CIA is manufactured and distributed by Orto Orga¬ nizers and made out of NiTi wire.

In the anterior segment, a sectional rectangular arch is placed in the slots from lateral to lateral.\n\nFig. 60. Passive CIA with sectional anterior arch.\n\nOver this wire the anterior segment of the CIA arch wire is ligated to the sectional wire. This is the reason why the use of triple tubes in the upper molars and the use of double tubes in the lower molars are recommended. (10.23)\n\nFig. 61. Active CIA with a sectional stabilization wire and a sectional anterior wire.\n\n The CIA exerts an intrusive force of 40 g to 60 g due to the \"V\" bend placed mesial to the molar tube.

Overbite has great impact upon treatment and retention of the teeth evolved in the cross bite.\nWhen an anterior cross bite presents a deep anterior overbite, a posterior bite plane will be needed so the upper incisor can move forward without any occlusal interference from the lower incisors. Once this is cor¬ rected, the stability of the retention will depend upon the presence of an adequate overbite. So, patients with incisor cross bite, associated with little or no overbite, are more difficult to treat and to retain. (5.12)\n\nFig. 16. Upper laterals slightly extruded and in cross bite, the bite must be lifted in order to uncross the lateral incisors.\n\nIf the horizontal overbite is -2 mm to -3 mm and only one tooth is involved, the tongue can be used to correct the anterior cross bite when the patient is in the primary or mixed dentition, only if there is enough space for the tooth. Once this has been corrected, the occlusion itself will prevent the relapse of the cross bite. (10)\n\n 3. Anterior arch length. A crossed upper incisor must have enough space to be moved. If there is not enough available arch length, we must create the sufficient space before trying to uncross it. In straight wire mechanics, open coils are regularly used to create enough arch length to move the tooth to its appropri¬ ate position.

Insufficient upper arch length to accommodate the crossed upper lateral.\n\n 4. Upper incisor root torque. Many upper incisors that are crossed have their root in a palatal position. At the moment in which the crown is moved forward, the long axis of the tooth remains with an increased buc¬ cal inclination. After the tooth has been uncrossed, a buccally inclined tooth is prone to go back again. This is the reason why we should give negative torque to the root to move buccally. To accomplish this move¬ ment we can bond an inverted brace (180°) and place 0.018\" x 0.025\" or 0.019\" x 0.025\" stainless steel wires.\nAnother way to apply negative torque is to make a third order bend in the arch wire.

The condyle on the side of the cross bite is deviated to the posterosuperior side, meanwhile the condyle on the normal side places itself in the anteroinferior side of the temporal glenoid cavity.\n\no\nIf these deviations are corrected at an early age, we will obtain adequate eruption of the permanent teeth.\nThe skeletal relation of the osseous bases is improved.\n\no\nIt provides mouth closure without deviations.\n\no\n\nThe treatment for posterior cross bite must commence as soon as the malocclusion is diagnosed, being conditioned to the maturity and cooperation degree of the patient.\nThe most indicated treatment for the correction of skeletal type cross bite is through maxillary disjunction.\n\n## Disjunction\n\nWe usually require palatal expansion for the correction of skeletal transversal discrepancies with the combina¬ tion of orthodontic and orthopedic movements. ( 17 ) Rapid maxillary expansion (disjunction) is done to increase the transversal dimension to correct skeletal cross bites, and at the same time, to increase dental arch length. For this purpose we utilize expanders that produce intense trans¬ versal forces on the lateral dentoalveolar sectors of the upper dental arch. (13)\n\nInitially, the transverse forces will buccaly incline the lateral segments, and if the forces are strong enough, the disjunc¬ tion of the mid palatal suture can occur (disjunction), the same happens with all the suture complex of the maxilla.\nRapid maxillary expansion (RME), is indicated when the expansion necessities are greater than 4 mm or 5 mm and when the origin of the discrepancy is skeletal. (13.17)\n\nThe objective of RME is to reduce orthodontic movements and undesired inclinations. RME requires activations and generates heavy forces that range between 2kg to 5kg per activation, in contrast with slow expansion that generates forces that range between 450 g and 900 g that may be insufficient to separate a mature midpalatal suture. (17)\n\nSome authors recommend slow expansion (0.5 mm to 1 mm per week), because they say that a physiologic suture adjustment occurs. (17) But other studies indicate that if the expansion is slow, all that we are going to obtain is a dental\n\n expansion (teeth in a buccal position) rather than a basal expansion. Those who support RME have as theoretical fundament that applying a rapid force to the posterior teeth, these teeth would not have enough time to incline and that the force will transfer to the suture and the suture will open, meanwhile the teeth will minimally move. We can obtain 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm per day with inter molar length increment of up to 8 mm. (30)\n\nRME is obtained in 10 to 30 days, but the expander must remain in the mouth during six months to allow new bone to form in the suture. (30) The goal of palatal disjunction is to maximize skeletal movement and to minimize dental movement, meanwhile the physiologic midpalatal suture adjustment takes place.\n\n## Effects Of Disjunction\n\n 1. Effects on the maxillary complex. When the forces applied to the teeth and the maxillary alveolar pro¬ cesses exceed the necessary limits for orthodontic dental movement, a disjunction is produced. (301 The pressure that orthopedic force exerts, is going to act upon the midpalatal suture splitting it. A compres¬ sion of the periodontal ligament that will incline the alveolar processes and a gradual aperture of the mid palatal suture will occur. From the frontal point of view, the separation occurs in a pyramid form, the base is located toward the anterior dental sector and the fulcrum is on the Nasion point. Occlusally, the expansion is greater in the anterosuperior sector at the incisor level (fan aperture) than at the posterior edge of the suture at the molar level, where the transversal dimension is maintained by the pterygoid processes that, being of endochondral origin, have structures that are hardly modifiable with this therapy. All this provokes a descent and forward position of the \"A\" point of approximately 1mm to 2 mm, (6.19.25.30.34.35)\n\nII.\n\nEffects on the alveolar processes. Because the bone is resilient, the inclination of the alveolar processes occurs early during disjunction. The majority of the forces applied tend to dissipate within 5 to 6 months and once the stabilization is terminated, any residual force can provoke a rebound effect, which makes overcorrection necessary. The slower we make the expansion, the more dental expansion effect and less basal expansion we will have. When an osseous or basal expansion is done, a force that produces hyalini¬ zation anchors the teeth to the bone and the aperture","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\nIn cases of functional cross bites, these show a lat¬ o eral mandibular shift due to the presence of occlusal interferences with condyle position alterations.

This disjunction consists in surgically disarticulat¬ ing the upper maxilla with a series of osteotomies; after this is preformed a Hyrax expansion screw is placed.

The performance of PCI has been associated with favorable outcomes in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and it is reasonable to include cardiac catheterization in standardized post–cardiac arrest protocols as part of an overall strategy to improve neurologically intact survival in this patient group. In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF, emergent angiography with prompt revascularization of the infarct-related artery is recommended. The ECG may be insensitive or misleading following cardiac arrest, and coronary angiography after ROSC in subjects with arrest of presumed ischemic cardiac etiology may be reasonable, even in the absence of a clearly defined STEMI. Clinical findings of coma in patients before PCI are common following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and should not be a contraindication to consideration of immediate angiography and PCI.\n\n## Adult Stroke\n\nPart 11 emphasizes the early management of acute ischemic stroke in adult patients. It summarizes out-of-hospital care through the first hours of therapy. Approximately 795 000 people suffer a new or repeat stroke each year, and stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United States. By integrating public education, 911 dispatch, prehospital detection and triage, hospital stroke system development, and stroke unit management, significant improvements in stroke care have been made. Important components of the stroke system of care are summarized in Part 11.\nAs with STEMI patients, prearrival hospital notification by\n\n the transporting EMS unit has been found to significantly increase the percentage of patients with acute stroke who receive fibrinolytic therapy. The 2010 AHA Guidelines for\nCPR and ECC recommend that every hospital with an ED have a written plan that is communicated to EMS systems describing how patients with acute stroke are to be managed in that institution. Triage of patients with acute stroke directly to designated stroke centers is a new Class I recommendation, which has been added to the Stroke Algorithm. Another new Class I recommendation is admission of the stroke patient to a dedicated stroke unit managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in stroke care.\nSince publication of the 2005 AHA Guidelines for CPR and\nECC , additional data have emerged extending the time window for administration of IV rtPA to select patients with acute ischemic stroke. These guidelines now recommend IV rtPA for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) or the Third European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS-3) if rtPA is administered by physicians in the setting of a clearly defined protocol with a knowledgeable\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n team and institutional commitment. However, it is important to emphasize the continued time-dependent reperfusion window and that earlier treatment is better and is associated with improved outcome. Patients ineligible for standard IV fibrinolytic therapy may be considered for intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy or mechanical revascularization at selected centers with specialized capabilities.\nFinally these guidelines recommend admission to a stroke unit within 3 hours of presentation to the ED. Recent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards, and positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the beneficial effects achieved with IV rtPA.\nOverall stroke care has progressed dramatically since it was first incorporated into the ECC mission. Improvements in education, prehospital management, hospital system development, and acute treatments have lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes.\n\n## Special Situations\n\nCardiac arrest in special situations may require special treatments or procedures beyond those provided during standard BLS or ACLS. Because of difficulty in conducting randomized clinical trials in these areas or their infrequent occurrence, these unique situations call for an experienced provider to go \"beyond basics,\" using clinical consensus and extrapolation from typical circumstances. The topics covered in the 2005 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC have been reviewed, updated, and expanded to 15 specific cardiac arrest situations. These guidelines emphasize the \"above and beyond\" knowledge required as well as the anticipatory clinical acumen to provide timely care and unique interventions.\nTopics include significant periarrest features that may be important to prevent cardiac arrest or that require special post–cardiac arrest care and intervention beyond the usual care defined in these guidelines. Topics with these potentially unique features include asthma, anaphylaxis, pregnancy, morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism, electrolyte imbalance, ingestion of toxic substances, trauma, accidental hypothermia, avalanche, drowning, electric shock/lightning strikes, and special procedural situations affecting the heart, including PCI, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac surgery.\n\n## Pediatric Basic Life Support\n\nThe majority of pediatric cardiac arrests are asphyxial, with only approximately 5% to 15% attributable to VF. 8,9,27,162,163\nAnimal studies 164–166 have shown that resuscitation from asphyxial arrest is best accomplished by a combination of ventilations and chest compressions. This has recently been confirmed in a large community pediatric study, 27 which not only showed that the best resuscitation results from asphyxial arrest were from a combination of ventilations and chest compressions but also that the small number of children with asphyxial arrest who received compression-only CPR had no better results than those who received no bystander CPR.\nAlthough animal studies and pediatric series support the importance of ventilation for asphyxial arrest, data in adults suggest that chest compressions are critical for resuscitation from VF arrest, with ventilations being less important.

In light of this uncertainty, all pediatric and adult patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital setting should have resuscitative attempts initiated unless the patient has a valid\nDNAR order or has objective signs of irreversible death (eg, dependent lividity).\n\n## Dnar Orders In Ihca\n\nUnlike other medical interventions, CPR is initiated without a physician's order, based on implied consent for emergency treatment. A licensed physician's order is necessary to withhold\nCPR in the hospital setting. Physicians should initiate a discussion about the use of CPR with all patients admitted for medical and surgical care or with their surrogates. Terminally ill patients may fear abandonment and pain more than death, so physicians should also reassure the patient and family that control of pain and other symptoms as well as other aspects of support will continue even if resuscitation is withheld.\nThe attending physician should write the DNAR order in accordance with local policy in the patient's chart, with a note explaining the rationale for the DNAR order, other specific limitations of care, and documenting discussions with the patient, surrogate, and family. Oral DNAR orders are not acceptable. The limitation-of-treatment order should provide explicit instructions for specific emergency interventions that may arise, including the use of vasopressor agents, mechanical ventilation, blood products, or antibiotics. The scope of a DNAR order should specify which interventions are to be withheld.\nIt is important to emphasize that all other care should be administered without delay and as appropriate for all patients. A\nDNAR order does not automatically preclude interventions such as administration of parenteral fluids, nutrition, oxygen, analgesia, sedation, antiarrhythmics, or vasopressors, unless these are included in the order. Some patients may choose to accept defibrillation and chest compressions but not intubation and mechanical ventilation. DNAR orders carry no implications about other forms of treatment, and other aspects of the treatment plan should be documented separately and communicated to members of the healthcare team. DNAR orders should be reviewed periodically as per local protocol, particularly if the patient's condition changes. 42 DNAR orders should also be reviewed before surgery by the anesthesiologist, attending surgeon, and patient or surrogate to determine their applicability in the operating suite and during the immediate postoperative recovery period. 43\n\n## Terminating Resuscitative Efforts In Ihca\n\n## Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In Neonatal Ihca\n\nNoninitiation of resuscitation and discontinuation of lifesustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent, and clinicians should not hesitate to withdraw support when functional survival is highly unlikely. 44 The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes. 45\nIn a newly bom infant with no detectable heart rate, it is appropriate to consider stopping resuscitation if the heart rate remains undetectable for 10 minutes (Class IIb, LOE C 46 – 48 ).\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\nThe decision to continue resuscitative efforts beyond 10 minutes with no heart rate should take into consideration factors such as presumed etiology of arrest, gestational age, presence or absence of complications, and the parents' previous expressed feelings about the acceptable risk of morbidity.\nIn the absence of clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitation in the neonatal patient, the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the newborn will not respond to further advanced life support.\n\n## Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In Pediatric Ihca\n\nNo predictors of pediatric (infant or child) resuscitative success or failure have been established. 49 -51 No validated clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitative efforts in pediatric cardiac arrest have been reported, and the decision to stop resuscitation may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\nIn the absence of clinical decision rules, the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the patient will not respond to further pediatric advanced life support. Arrest characteristics to be considered by physicians making decisions may include duration of CPR, witnessed event, number of doses of epinephrine, etiology of arrest, first and subsequent rhythm, and age. 49 , 52 -- 56\nProlonged efforts are typically made for infants and children with recurring or refractory VF or VT, those who demonstrate some ROSC, those with drug toxicity, or those experiencing an event causing primary hypothermia. Prolonged efforts are also indicated when a decision to employ extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) has been made (see Part 14: \"Pediatric Advanced Life\nSupport\").\n\n## Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In\n\n Adult IHCA\nIn the hospital the decision to terminate resuscitative efforts rests with the treating physician and is based on consideration of many factors, including witnessed versus unwitnessed arrest, time to CPR, initial arrest rhythm, time to defibrillation, comorbid disease, prearrest state, and whether there is ROSC at some point during the resuscitative efforts. Clinical decision rules for in-hospital termination of resuscitation may be helpful in reducing variability in decision making 57 ; however, the evidence for their reliability is limited, and rules should be prospectively validated before adoption.\n\n## Providing Emotional Support To The Family\n\n## Providing Emotional Support To The Family\nDuring Resuscitative Efforts In Cardiac Arrest\n\nIn the past, family members have often been excluded from being present during the attempted resuscitation of a child or other relative. Surveys suggest that healthcare providers hold a range of opinions about the presence of family members during resuscitative attempts. 58– 69 One theoretical concern is the potential for family members to become disruptive, interfere with resuscitative procedures, or develop syncope, and another is the possibility of increased exposure to legal liability; however, these are not reported in the literature.\nSeveral surveys suggested that most family members wish to be present during a resuscitative attempt. 62–66 Family members","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n## Criteria For Not Starting Cpr In Pediatric And Adult Ihca\\n\",\"block_text_old\":\"\\n## Criteria For Not Starting Cpr In Pediatric And Adult Ihca\\n\",\"raw_context\":[{\"text\":\"Criteria for Not Starting CPR in Pediatric and\",\"bbox\":[60.0,84.0,352.0,100.0]},{\"text\":\"Adult IHCA\",\"bbox\":[60.0,100.0,139.0,113.0]}],\"block_type\":\"Section-header\",\"full_blocks\":[59.0,83.0,351.0,112.0],\"position\":3,\"table_info\":{}},{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n\\nFew criteria can accurately predict the futility of continued resuscitation.

False-positive readings (ie, CO 2 is detected but the tube is located in the esophagus) have been observed in animals after ingestion of large amounts of carbonated liquids before the arrest; however, the waveform does not continue during subsequent breaths. 96\nFalse-negative readings (defined in this context as failure to detect CO 2 despite tube placement in the trachea) may be present during cardiac arrest for several reasons. The most common is that blood flow and delivery of CO 2 to the lungs is low. False-negative results also have been reported in association with pulmonary embolus because pulmonary blood flow and delivery of CO 2 to the lungs are reduced. If the detector is contaminated with gastric contents or acidic drugs (eg, endotracheally administered epinephrine), a colorimetric device may display a constant color rather than breath-to-breath color change. In addition, elimination and detection of CO 2 can be drastically reduced with severe airway obstruction (eg, status asthmaticus) and pulmonary edema. 93,97.98 For these reasons, if CO 2 is not detected, we recommend that a second method be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement, such as direct visualization or the esophageal detector device.\nUse of CO 2 -detecting devices to determine the correct placement of other advanced airways (eg, Combitube, laryngeal mask airway) has not been studied; their utility will depend on airway design. However, effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in capnograph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.\nEsophageal Detector Devices.  The EDD consists of a bulb\n\n that is compressed and attached to the endotracheal tube. If the tube is in the esophagus (positive result for an EDD), the suction created by the EDD will collapse the lumen of the esophagus or pull the esophageal tissue against the tip of the tube, and the bulb will not re-expand. The EDD may also consist of a syringe that is attached to the endotracheal tube; the provider attempts to pull the barrel of the syringe. If the tube is in the esophagus, it will not be possible to pull the barrel (aspirate air) with the syringe.\nHowever, studies of the syringe aspiration EDD79.99 and the self-inflating bulb EDD 78 –80 indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest. Given the simplicity of the EDD, it can be used as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in addition to clinical assessment in the victim of cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE\nB).\n\nThe EDD may yield misleading results in patients with\n\n morbid obesity, late pregnancy, or status asthmaticus, or when there are copious endotracheal secretions, 100,101 because the trachea tends to collapse in the presence of these conditions. There is no evidence that the EDD is accurate for the continued monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.\n\nThoracic Impedance. Transthoracic impedance is slightly but significantly higher during inspiration than during exhalation. 102 Air is a poor electric conductor. Preliminary studies suggest that changes in thoracic impedance, as measured\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n through standard defibrillation pads, may distinguish tracheal from esophageal intubations. 103 – 105\nThere are 2 published reports involving 6 patients where ventilation-induced changes in thoracic impedance disappeared after esophageal intubation. 106 , 107 There is little evidence for the use of thoracic impedance in diagnosing adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  Treatment decisions should not be based solely on thoracic impedance measurements until further study has confirmed its utility and accuracy in this population.\n\nPostintubation Airway Management\nAfter inserting and confirming correct placement of an endotracheal tube, the provider should record the depth of the tube as marked at the front teeth or gums and secure it.\nThere is significant potential for endotracheal tube movement with head flexion and extension 108 –110 and when the patient is moved from one location to another. 111,112\nContinuous monitoring of endotracheal tube placement with waveform capnography is recommended as discussed above. The endotracheal tube should be secured with tape or a commercial device (Class I, LOE C). Devices and tape should be applied in a manner that avoids compression of the front and sides of the neck, which may impair venous return from the brain.\nOne out-of-hospital study 113 and 2 studies in an intensivecare setting 114 , 115 indicate that backboards, commercial devices for securing the endotracheal tube, and other strategies provide equivalent methods for preventing inadvertent tube displacement when compared with traditional methods of securing the tube (tape). These devices may be considered during patient transport (Class IIb, LOE C). After tube confirmation and fixation, obtain a chest x-ray (when feasible) to confirm that the end of the endotracheal tube is properly positioned above the carina.\n\n## Ventilation After Advanced Airway Placement\n\nExcept for respiratory rate, it is unknown whether monitoring ventilatory parameters (eg, minute ventilation, peak pressure) during CPR will influence outcome. However, positivepressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and may reduce venous return and cardiac output, especially in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive airway disease. Ventilation at high respiratory rates (> 25 breaths per minute) is common during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 116,117 In animal models, slower ventilation rates (6 to 12 breaths per minute) are associated with improved hemodynamic parameters and short-term survival. 116,118–124\nBecause cardiac output is lower than normal during cardiac arrest, the need for ventilation is reduced. Following placement of an advanced airway, the provider delivering ventilations should perform 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute) without pausing in applying chest compressions (unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused) (Class IIb, LOE\nC). Monitoring respiratory rate coupled with real-time feedback during CPR may result in better compliance with ventilation guidelines. 125","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\" position in the trachea.

Thrombus formation on catheter material in patients on fondaparinux, however, required the addition of\nUFH during PCI. 324\nTwo large randomized clinical trials resulted in less bleeding and a short- and long-term reduction in cardiac events and overall mortality with bivalirudin compared to\nUFH plus a glycoprotein inhibitor in patients with STEMI and PPCI. 344 , 345\nFor patients with STEMI undergoing contemporary PCI\n\n (ie, additional broad use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and a thienopyridine) enoxaparin may be considered a safe and effective alternative to UFH (Class IIb, LOE B). Patients initially treated with enoxaparin should not be switched to\nUFH and vice versa to avoid increased risk of bleeding.\nFondaparinux may be considered as an alternative to UFH, however, there is an increased risk of catheter thrombi with fondaparinux alone. Additional UFH (50 to 100 U/kg bolus) may help to avoid this complication (Class IIb, LOE B), but using these two agents is not recommended over UFH alone.\nFor fondaparinux and enoxaparin it is necessary to adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment. Bivalirudin may be considered as an alternative to UFH and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Class IIb, LOE A).\n\n## Calcium Channel Blockers\n\nThere is little evidence that calcium channel blocking agents can be safely used as an alternative or additional therapy to b -blockers when the later are contraindicated or their maximum dose has been achieved.\nCalcium channel blocking agents have not been shown to reduce mortality after acute MI, and in certain patients with cardiovascular disease there are data to suggest that they are harmful. β -blockers have been used much more broadly, have a much safer profile, and appear to be a more appropriate choice for patients presenting with myocardial infarction compared to calcium channel blockers.\n\n## Ace Inhibitor Therapy\n\nACE Inhibitors and ARBs in the Hospital\nACE inhibitor therapy has improved survival rates in patients with AMI, particularly when started early after the initial hospitalization. 183 , 346 – 349 Evidence from 7 large clinical trials, 183,346–351 2 meta-analyses, 352,353 and 10 minor trials 348 , 351 , 354 – 362 documents consistent improvement in mortality when oral ACE inhibitors are administered in the hospital setting to patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy. In these studies ACE inhibitors were not administered in the presence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline). The beneficial effects are most pronounced in patients with anterior infarction, pulmonary congestion, or LV ejection fraction <40%.\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\nAdministration of an oral ACE inhibitor is recommended within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms in STEMI patients with pulmonary congestion or LV ejection fraction < 40%, in the absence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline) (Class I, LOE A). Oral ACE inhibitor therapy can also be useful for all other patients with\nAMI with or without early reperfusion therapy (Class IIa, LOE B). IV administration of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in the first 24 hours because of risk of hypotension (Class III, LOE C).\n\nACE Inhibitors in the Prehospital Setting\nDespite multiple studies that have shown a benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with a myocardial infarction when therapy is started during the first 24 hours of the index hospitalization, no trial specifically evaluates patients in the\nED or prehospital settings. An older randomized trial showed a reduction in mortality with an increased risk of hypotension in patients treated soon after presentation in the inpatient setting. 183 Several trials showed a reduction in the rate of heart failure and mortality in patients treated soon after fibrinolysis, 363–365 and several others showed no benefit with the early or prehospital use of angiotensin converting enzyme. 364,366,367\nIn conclusion, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce long-term risk of mortality in patients suffering an AMI, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine initiation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the prehospital or ED setting (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n## Hmg Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\n\nA variety of studies documented consistent reduction in indicators of inflammation and complications such as reinfarction, recurrent angina, and arrhythmias when statin treatment is administered within a few days after onset of an\nACS. 368–371 There is little data to suggest that this therapy should be initiated within the ED; however, early initiation (within 24 hours of presentation) of statin therapy is recommended in patients with an ACS or AMI (Class I, LOE C). If patients are already on statin therapy, continue the therapy (Class IIb, LOE C).\nAn increase in short-term mortality and incidence of major\n\n adverse cardiac events have been reported with discontinuation of statin treatment in ACS patients at hospital admission.\nStatins should not be discontinued during the index hospitalization unless contraindicated (Class III, LOE C). 372 – 381\nPretreatment with statins in patients undergoing elective percutaneous angioplasty for stable angina or hemodynamicaly stable ACS has been shown to significantly reduce biomarkers of myocardial necrosis or inflammation compared to placebo when given between 3 and 7 days prior to the procedure. 382 , 383\nFurthermore, pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg 12\n\n hours before and an additional 40 mg immediately before PCI for NSTEMI or documented ischemia has been shown to significantly decrease the 30 day composite of death, MI, and unplanned revascularization compared to placebo in a prospective randomized trial.

{"seq_id":204,"global_id":"test-mdeical__20240426__0__204","text":"## Primary Therapy\n\nOxygen\nOxygen should be provided to all patients with severe asthma, even those with normal oxygenation. As noted above, successful treatment with β 2 -agonists may cause an initial decrease in oxygen saturation because the resultant bronchodilation can initially increase the ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n\n## Inhaled Β 2 -Agonists\n\nShort-acting β -agonists provide rapid, dose-dependent bronchodilation with minimal side effects. Because the dose delivered depends on the patient's lung volume and inspiratory flow rate, the same dose can be used in most patients regardless of age or size. Studies have shown no difference in the effects of continuous versus intermittent administration of nebulized albuterol 8.9 ; however, continuous administration was more effective in a subset of patients with severe exacerbations of asthma. 8 A\nCochrane meta-analysis showed no overall difference between the effects of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler spacer or nebulizer. 10 If prior use of a metered-dose inhaler has not been effective, use of a nebulizer is reasonable.\nAlthough albuterol is sometimes administered intravenously (IV) in severe asthma, a systematic review of 15 clinical trials found that IV β 2 -agonists, administered by either bolus or infusion, did not lead to significant improvements in any clinical outcome measure. 9\nLevalbuterol is the R-isomer of albuterol. Comparisons with\n\n albuterol have produced mixed results, with some studies showing a slightly improved bronchodilator effect in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED. 11 There is no evidence that levalbuterol should be favored over albuterol.\nOne of the most common adjuncts used with β -agonist treatment, particularly in the first hours of treatment, include anticholinergic agents (see \"Adjunctive Therapies\" below for more detail). When combined with short-acting β -agonists, anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium can produce a clinically modest improvement in lung function compared with short-acting β -agonists alone. 12,13\n\n## Corticosteroids\n\nSystemic corticosteroids are the only treatment for the inflammatory component of asthma proven to be effective for acute asthma exacerbations. Because the antiinflammatory effects after administration may not be apparent for 6 to 12 hours, corticosteroids should be administered early. The early use of systemic steroids hastens the resolution of airflow obstruction and may reduce admission to the hospital. 14 Although there may be no difference in clinical effects between oral and IV formulations of corticosteroids, 15. 16 the IV route is preferable in patients with severe asthma. In adults a typical initial dose of methylprednisolone is 125 mg (dose range: 40 mg to 250 mg); a typical dose of dexamethasone is 10 mg.\n\n## Adjunctive Therapies\n\n## Anticholinergics\n\nIpratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator pharmacologically related to atropine. The nebulizer dose is 500 mcg. 15.16 Ipratropium bromide has a slow onset of action (approximately 20 minutes), with peak effectiveness at 60 to 90\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n minutes and no systemic side effects. The drug is typically given only once because of its prolonged onset of action, but some studies have shown that repeat doses of 250 mcg or 500 mcg every 20 minutes may be beneficial. 17 A recent meta-analysis indicated a reduced number of hospital admissions associated with treatment with ipratropium bromide, particularly in patients with severe exacerbations. 18\n\n## Magnesium Sulfate\n\nWhen combined with nebulized β -adrenergic agents and corticosteroids, IV magnesium sulfate can moderately improve pulmonary function in patients with asthma. 19 Magnesium causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle independent of serum magnesium level, with only minor side effects (flushing, lightheadedness). A Cochrane meta-analysis of 7 studies concluded that IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function and reduces hospital admissions, particularly for patients with the most severe exacerbations of asthma. 20 The use of nebulized magnesium sulfate as an adjunct to nebulized β -adrenergic agents has been reported in a small case series to improve FEV1 and Spo 2 , 21 although a prior meta-analysis demonstrated only a trend toward improved pulmonary function with nebulized magnesium. 22 For those with severe refractory asthma, providers may consider IV magnesium at the standard adult dose of 2 g administered over 20 minutes.\n\n## Epinephrine Or Terbutaline\n\nEpinephrine and terbutaline are adrenergic agents that can be given subcutaneously to patients with acute severe asthma. The dose of subcutaneous epinephrine (concentration 1:1000) is 0.01 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses of approximately 0.3 mg administered at 20-minute intervals. Although the nonselective adrenergic properties of epinephrine may cause an increase in heart rate, myocardial irritability, and increased oxygen demand, its use is well-tolerated, even in patients > 35 years of age. 23 Terbutaline is given in a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 3 doses. There is no evidence that subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline has advantages over inhaled β 2 -agonists. Epinephrine has been administered IV (initiated at 0.25 mcg/min to 1 mcg/min continuous infusion) in severe asthma; however, 1 retrospective investigation indicated a 4% incidence of serious side effects. There is no evidence of improved outcomes with IV epinephrine compared with selective inhaled β 2 -agonists. 24\n\n## Ketamine\n\nKetamine is a parenteral, dissociative anesthetic with bronchodilatory properties that also can stimulate copious bronchial secretions. One case series 25 suggested substantial efficacy, whereas 2 published randomized trials in children 26 . 27 found no benefit of ketamine when compared with standard care. Ketamine has sedative and analgesic properties that may be useful if intubation is planned.\n\n## Heliox\n\nHeliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen (usually a 70:30 helium to oxygen ratio mix) that is less viscous than ambient air.\nHeliox has been shown to improve the delivery and deposition of nebulized albuterol 28 ; however, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials did not support its use as initial treatment for","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n## Primary Therapy\\n\",\"block_text_old\":\"\\n## Primary Therapy\\n\",\"raw_context\":[{\"text\":\"Primary Therapy\",\"bbox\":[60.0,84.0,169.0,100.0]}],\"block_type\":\"Section-header\",\"full_blocks\":[59.0,83.0,168.0,99.0],\"position\":3,\"table_info\":{}},{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n\\nOxygen\\nOxygen should be provided to all patients with severe asthma, even those with normal oxygenation.

Naloxone has no role in the management of cardiac arrest.\nIn the patient with known or suspected opioid overdose with respiratory depression who is not in cardiac arrest, ventilation should be assisted by a bag mask, 232 -238 followed by administration of naloxone and placement of an advanced airway if there is no response to naloxone (Class I, LOE A).\nAdministration of naloxone can produce fulminate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals, leading to agitation, hypertension, and violent behavior. For this reason, naloxone administration should begin with a low dose (0.04 to 0.4 mg), with repeat dosing or dose escalation to 2  mg if the initial response is inadequate. 239 Some patients may require much higher doses to reverse intoxication with atypical opioids, such as propoxyphene, or following massive overdose ingestions. 240,241 Naloxone can be given IV. 235,236,242,243 IM 232,235,236 intranasally, 232 , 242 and into the trachea. 244\nThe duration of action of naloxone is approximately 45 to 70 minutes, but respiratory depression caused by ingestion of a long-acting opioid (eg, methadone) may last longer. Thus, the clinical effects of naloxone may not last as long as those of the opioid, and repeat doses of naloxone may be needed.\nPatients with life-threatening central nervous system or respiratory depression reversed by naloxone administration should be observed for resedation. Although a brief period of observation may be appropriate for patients with morphine or heroin overdose, 245 a longer period of observation may be required to safely discharge a patient with life-threatening overdose of a longacting or sustained-release opioid. 239,246\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n## Benzodiazepines\n\nThere are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to benzodiazepine overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and\nACLS algorithms.\n\nFlumazenil is a potent antagonist of the binding of benzodiazepines to their central nervous system receptors. Administration of flumazenil can reverse central nervous system and respiratory depression caused by benzodiazepine overdose.\nFlumazenil has no role in the management of cardiac arrest.\nThe administration of flumazenil to patients with undifferentiated coma confers risk and is not recommended (Class III, LOE\nB). Flumazenil administration can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent patients and has been associated with seizures, arrhythmia, and hypotension in patients with coingestion of certain medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants. 247,248 However, flumazenil may be used safely to reverse excessive sedation known to be due to the use of benzodiazepines in a patient without known contraindications (eg, procedural sedation). 249\n\n## Β -Blockers\n\nThere are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to β -blocker overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms.\n\n β -Blocker medication overdose may cause such severe inhibition of β -adrenergic receptors that high-dose vasopressors cannot effectively restore blood pressure, cardiac output, or perfusion. Therapeutic options in the treatment of refractory hemodynamic instability due to β -blocker overdose include administration of glucagon, high-dose insulin, or IV calcium salts.\n\n## Glucagon\n\nAdministration of glucagon may be helpful for severe cardiovascular instability associated with β -blocker toxicity that is refractory to standard measures, including vasopressors. The recommended dose of glucagon is a bolus of 3 to 10 mg, administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, followed by an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h (0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.05 to 0.10 mg/kg per hour) (Class IIb, LOE C). 250–262 The infusion rate is titrated to achieve an adequate hemodynamic response (appropriate mean arterial pressure and evidence of good perfusion). Because the amount of glucagon required to sustain this therapy may exceed 100 mg in a 24-hour period, plans should be made early to ensure that an adequate supply of glucagon is available. Glucagon commonly causes vomiting. In patients with central nervous system depression, the airway must be protected before glucagon administration. Animal studies have suggested that the concomitant use of dopamine alone or in combination with isoproterenol and milrinone may decrease the effectiveness of glucagon. 263 – 265\n\n## Insulin\n\nAnimal studies suggest that high-dose IV insulin, accompanied by IV dextrose supplementation and electrolyte monitoring, may improve hemodynamic stability and survival in β -blocker overdose by improving myocardial energy utilization. 266,267 A single human case report 268 showed improved hemodynamic stability","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n| Cardiac Signs |\\n|--------|\\n| Tachycardia and/or Bradycardia and/or Cardiac Conduction |\\n|

If CPR is in progress, stop chest compressions briefly, administer the medications, and follow with a flush of at least 5 mL of normal saline and 5 consecutive positive-pressure ventilations. 197 Optimal endotracheal doses of medications are unknown; in general expert consensus recommends doubling or tripling the dose of lidocaine, atropine or naloxone given via the ETT. For epinephrine, a dose ten times the intravenous dose (0.1 mg/kg or 0.1 mL/kg of 1:1000 concentration) is recommended (see\nTable 1).\nThe effectiveness of endotracheal epinephrine during cardiac arrest is controversial. Some studies showed it to be as effective as vascular administration 193 . 198 . 199 while other studies have not found it to be as effective. 194 – 196 , 200 Animal studies 201 – 206 suggested that a higher dose of epinephrine is required for endotracheal than for intravascular administration because the lower epinephrine concentrations achieved\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n when the drug is delivered by the endotracheal route may produce predominant transient peripheral β 2 -adrenergic vasodilating effects. These effects can be detrimental, and cause hypotension, lower coronary artery perfusion pressure and flow, and a reduced potential for ROSC.\nNon-lipid-soluble drugs (eg, sodium bicarbonate and calcium) may injure the airway; they should not be administered via the endotracheal route.\n\n## Emergency Fluids And Medications\n\n## Estimating Weight\n\nIn the out-of-hospital setting, a child's weight is often unknown, and even experienced personnel may not be able to estimate it accurately. 74 Tapes with precalculated doses printed at various patient lengths have been clinically validated 74.77.95 and are more accurate than age-based or observer (parent or provider) estimate-based methods in the prediction of body weight. 70–77 Body habitus may also be an important consideration. 70 , 72 , 78 , 79","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n| Adenosine | 0.1 mg/kg (maximum 6 mg)\\\\nSecond dose: 0.2 mg/kg (maximum 12 mg) | Monitor ECG\\\\nRapid IV/IO bolus with flush |\\n|--------|--------|--------|\\n| Amiodarone | 5 mg/kg IV/IO; may repeat twice up to 15 mg/kg\\\\nMaximum single dose 300 mg | Monitor ECG and blood pressure; adjust administration rate to urgency\\\\n(IV push during cardiac arrest, more slowly–over 20–60 minutes with\\\\nperfusing rhythm).

There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine administration of magnesium during cardiac arrest. 231–233\n\n## Precautions\n\nMagnesium produces vasodilation and may cause hypotension if administered rapidly.\n\n## Procainamide\n\nProcainamide prolongs the refractory period of the atria and ventricles and depresses conduction velocity.\n\nPrecautions\nThere is limited clinical data on using procainamide in infants and children. 234–236 Infuse procainamide very slowly (over 30 to 60 minutes) while monitoring the ECG and blood pressure.\nDecrease the infusion rate if there is prolongation of the QT interval, or heart block; stop the infusion if the QRS widens to > 50% of baseline or hypotension develops. Do not administer together with another drug causing QT prolongation, such as amiodarone, without expert consultation. Prior to using procainamide for a hemodynamically stable patient, expert consultation is strongly recommended.\n\n## Sodium Bicarbonate\n\nRoutine administration of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended in cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE B). 212,237,238 Sodium bicarbonate may be administered for treatment of some toxidromes (see \"Toxicological Emergencies,\" below) or special resuscitation situations such as hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.\n\n## Precautions\n\nDuring cardiac arrest or severe shock, arterial blood gas analysis may not accurately reflect tissue and venous acidosis. 239 . 240 Excessive sodium bicarbonate may impair tissue oxygen delivery; 241 cause hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolality; 242 . 243 decrease the VF threshold; 244 and impair cardiac function.\n\n## Vasopressin\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the routine use of vasopressin during cardiac arrest.\nPediatric 245 – 247 and adult 248 , 249 case series/reports suggested that vasopressin 245 or its long-acting analog, terlipressin, 246 . 247 may be effective in refractory cardiac arrest when standard therapy fails. A large pediatric NRCPR case series, however, suggested that vasopressin is associated with lower\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\nROSC, and a trend toward lower 24-hour and discharge survival. 250 A preponderance of controlled trials in adults do not demonstrate a benefit. 251 – 256\n\nIn the text below, box numbers identify the corresponding step in the algorithm (Figure 1).\n\n • (Step 1) As soon as the child is found to be unresponsive with no breathing, call for help, send for a defibrillator (manual or AED), and start CPR (with supplementary oxygen if available). Attach ECG monitor or AED pads as soon as available. Throughout resuscitation, emphasis should be placed on provision of high-quality CPR (providing chest compressions of adequate rate and depth, allowing complete chest recoil after each compression, minimizing interruptions in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation).\n\nWhile CPR is being given, determine the child's cardiac rhythm from the ECG or, if you are using an AED, the device will tell you whether the rhythm is \"shockable\" (eg,\nVF or rapid VT) or \"not shockable\" (eg, asystole or PEA).\nIt may be necessary to temporarily interrupt chest compressions to determine the child's rhythm. Asystole and bradycardia with a wide QRS are most common in asphyxial arrest. 1 VF and PEA are less common 13 but VF is more likely to be present in older children with sudden witnessed arrest.\n\n## \"Nonshockable Rhythm\": Asystole/Pea (Step 9)\n\nPEA is an organized electric activity—most commonly slow, wide QRS complexes—without palpable pulses. Less frequently there is a sudden impairment of cardiac output with an initially normal rhythm but without pulses and with poor perfusion. This subcategory, formerly known as electromechanical dissociation (EMD), may be more reversible than asystole. For asystole and PEA:\n\n • (Step 10) Continue CPR with as few interruptions in chest compressions as possible.

In reviewing the medical literature, members of the International First Aid Science Advisory Board once again found a paucity of evidence to guide first aid interventions. Very little research is being conducted in first aid, and many of the following recommendations are extrapolated from the experience of healthcare professionals. It is important to recognize the limitations of the evidence that supports many of these guidelines so that research can be undertaken and future guidelines can be based on a larger body of scientific evidence.\n\n## Definition Of First Aid\n\nWe define first aid as the assessments and interventions that can be performed by a bystander (or by the victim) with minimal or no medical equipment. A first aid provider is defined as someone with formal training in first aid, emergency care, or medicine who provides first aid. First aid assessments and interventions should be medically\n\nDownloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011\n\n sound and based on scientific evidence or, in the absence of such evidence, on expert consensus. Administration of first aid must not delay activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or other medical assistance when required. We strongly believe that education in first aid should be universal: everyone can learn first aid and everyone should.\nThe scope of first aid is not purely scientific; it is influenced by both training and regulatory issues. The definition of scope is therefore variable, and should be defined according to circumstances, need, and regulatory requirements.\n\nA first aid provider must be able to recognize when help is needed and how to get it. First aid providers should learn how and when to access the EMS system, how to activate the on-site emergency response plan (ERP), and how to contact the Poison Control Center (see \"Poison Emergencies\" below).\n\n## Positioning The Victim\n\nAs a general rule a victim should not be moved, especially if you suspect, from the victim's position or the nature of the injury, that the victim may have a spinal injury (see \"Spine\nStabilization\" below). There are times, however, when the victim should be moved:\n • If the area is unsafe for the rescuer or the victim, move the victim to a safe location if it is safe to do so.\n\n• If the victim is face down and is unresponsive, turn the victim face up.\n • If the victim has difficulty breathing because of copious secretions or vomiting, or if you are alone and have to leave an unresponsive victim to get help, place the victim in a modified High Arm IN Endangered Spine (HAINES) recovery position: 9.10 Extend one of the victim's arms above the head and roll the body to the side so the victim's head rests on the extended arm. Bend both legs to stabilize\n\n the victim (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n• If a victim shows evidence of shock, have the victim lie supine. If there is no evidence of trauma or injury, raise the feet about 6 to 12 inches (about 30° to 45°) (Class IIb, LOE\nC). Do not raise the feet if the movement or the position causes the victim any pain.\n\nThe evidence for a benefit to raising the feet is extrapolated from leg raising studies on volume expansion; there are no studies on the effect of leg raising as a first aid maneuver for shock. The results of the volume expansion studies are contradictory with some showing an increase in cardiac output, 11–13 while others show no change in cardiac output or mean arterial pressure 14 – 18 with leg raising.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of supplementary oxygen by a first aid provider for victims complaining of chest discomfort 19 . 20 or shortness of breath 21 .\n\n## Calling For Help\n\n## Oxygen","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"en","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n## International First Aid Science Advisory Board\\nTable.\\nMember

Fortunately, he recovered from the condition within a year. However, while recalling his time with the condition; the actor described it as the worst time of his life.\n\nHis schoolmates laughed at and mocked him. It was devastating as his left eye closed and he also faced difficulty eating and drinking properly. He got the nickname 'Frankenstein' during this period because of his face. But his experience with this condition made him stronger.\n\n## Pierce Brosnan\n\nFamous for his dapper good looks and his role in the 'James Bond' film franchise, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan had to battle Bell's palsy as well. He fell victim to the condition in 1984.\n\nFacial paralysis occurred in the dressing room just before his appearance on an\nAmerican show, namely the 'Tonight Show'. He failed to close one of his eyes and felt his face go numb, but the actor recovered from the condition within a few months.\n\n## Sylvester Stallone:\n\nOne of the greatest action stars of all times and best known for portraying\nRocky, Sylvester Stallone is also a sufferer of Bell's palsy since birth. The condition was caused due to birth complications resulting in facial disfigurement and slurred speech. However, Stallone is an inspiration as he not only overcame his adversity, but also achieved greatness.\n\nThe use of forceps at birth had injured his nerve, paralyzing the lower left half of his face.

Biofeedback involves using sensors placed strategically over the human body. These sensors help receive feedback about the body, hence, the term biofeedback. This feedback assists people in making minor changes to their body over time, such as relaxing specific muscles to reduce the intensity of pain.\nIn short, biofeedback allows you to use your thoughts to control certain aspects of your body, such as muscles.\n\nDuring recovery, Bell's palsy patients reach a stage where their face feels incredibly tight. The eye may shut without any indication while eating or talking.\nSome patients also feel that they are making funny faces when smiling. It is the faulty communication system between your face and brain that is letting you down. Biofeedback allows you to learn how to control muscles to display the expression you want.\n\n## What Are The Different Types Of Biofeedback?\n\nThere are three most commonly used forms of biofeedback therapy including:\n\n 1. Electromyography (EMG) used to measure muscle tension.\n\n 2. Thermal biofeedback used to measure skin temperature.\n\n 3. Electroencephalography (EEG) or neuro-feedback used to measure brain wave activity.\n\n## What Happens During Biofeedback Therapy?\n\nA typical biofeedback session will involve attaching tiny electrodes to your skin.\nThese electrodes then send information to a small box that translates the signals your body is giving out.

Philadelphialı seçkin Doktor Silas Weir Mitchell, \"Hayalet uzuv\" tanımlamasını ilk kez İç savaş sırasında kullandı. Bu antibiyotik öncesi günlerde, yaralanmaların yaygın görülen sonuçlarından biri de kangrendi ve binlerce yaralı askerin iltihaplı uzvunu kesen cerrahlar da evlerine hayalet uzuvlar ve bunlara neyin neden olabileceği konusunda düzinelerce yeni açıklamayla döndüler. Silas\nWeir Mitchell bu fenomene çok şaşırmıştı ve ilk makalesini, profesyonel bir tıp dergisinde yayımlayıp arkadaşlarının alaylarına maruz kalmak yerine Lippincott's Journal adlı popüler bir dergide takma isimle yayımladı. Hayaletler, düşündüğünüzde, daha ziyade ürkütücü bir fenomendir.\n\nSilas Weir Mitchell döneminden beri hayalet uzuvlar hakkında çok güzel olanlardan son derece saçma olanlara dek her tür spekülasyon ortaya atılmıştır. Geçenlerde, yirmi yıl kadar önce, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry' de çıkan bir yazı, hayalet uzuvların sadece hüsnükuruntu yüzünden olduğunu belirtti. Yazarlar, hastanın umutsuzca kolunu geri istediğini ve bu yüzden hayalet uzuv deneyimi yaşadığını söylediler – kısa süre önce kaybedilen anne veya babayı rüyada sık görmeye, hatta \"hayalet\"lerini görmeye benzer bir durummuş bu. Böylesi bir sav, ilerde göreceğimiz gibi çok saçmadır.\n\nHayalet uzuvlar için ikinci ve daha popüler bir açıklama, güdükteki (kesilen uzuvdan kalan parça) yıpranıp kıvrılmış sinir uçlarının (nöromalar) ateşlendiği ve harekete geçtiği, böylece kaybedilen uzvun hala oradaymış gibi düşünülmesini sağlayacak şekilde yüksek beyin merkezlerinin aldandığı şeklindedir. Bu harekete geçen sinirler kuramıyla ilgili birçok sorun olmasına rağmen, basit ve uygun bir açıklama oluşu yüzünden çoğu doktor buna sarılmaktadır.\n\nÇoğu doktor gibi, ilk karşılaştığım andan itibaren hayalet uzuvlar dikkatimi çekti ve o andan beri bunlara şaşırıyorum. Ampüteler arasında çok yaygın olan hayalet kol ve bacaklara ek olarak radikal mastektomi sonrası hayalet memeleri olan kadınlar, hatta hayalet apandisiti olan bir hasta gördüm. Ameliyatla çıkarılmasına rağmen tipik spazmodik apandisit ağrısı azalmamıştı, öyle ki hasta, cerrahın onu kesip aldığını kabul etmiyordu! Bir bilim öğrencisi olarak, bu duruma hastalar kadar şaşırmıştım ve başvurduğum kitaplar sadece gizemi daha da derinleştirdi.

[4,9,13-16] .\n\n2.1.1 临床表现与体格检查\n\n 潜隐发病,常有家族史。大多数患者临床表现 为双侧进行性远端肢体肌肉萎缩无力,最初累及双 下肢远端、典型者呈 \" 鹤腿样 \" 表现,部分患者可累及 手与前臂。体格检查可发现,大多数患者伴有足部 畸形 (77%~90% [14 -17 -19 为高弓内翻、足下垂与爪形趾畸 形 ), 部分患者有感觉减退和/或腱反射减弱甚或 消失。 2.1.2 EMG [17- 18,20]\n\n 广义的 EMG 包括常规 EMG、神经传导速度检测 等。对 CMT 分型提供帮助的同时 , 还可与其他疾病 进行鉴别。髓鞘受累为主(如 CMT1,CMT4)时表现 为广泛对称的感觉运动神经传导速度减慢,轴索受 累为主(如 CMT2)时表现为运动神经传导波幅(又称 复合肌肉动作电位 ) 降低 , 针极 EMG 呈神经源性损 害。CMTX 中有时可有不对称的传导速度减慢,以 及明显的波形离散甚至传导阻滞。在实际临床应用 中 , 因为 CMT 患者下肢肌肉萎缩比例高 , 且感觉系统 容易受营养状态(或伴有糖尿病)等因素影响,建议 阅读电生理结果时,主要参考上肢运动神经。 2.1.3 基因检测 [21- 22 ] 可帮助明确诊断 CMT,并进行亚型划分。但就\n\n 全国开展基因检测的现状来看,难以强制要求术前 进行该检查。\n\n 2.1.4 周围神经病理学检查 不作为常规检查,当临床考虑 CMT 而基因检测 阴性时,神经病理检查可明确脱髓鞘和轴突病变的 病理变化,提供相关诊断和鉴别诊断信息。\n\n## 2.2 鉴别诊断\n\n 常见遗传性周围神经病的鉴别 : 狭义的 CMT 患 者感觉运动均受累,近年来将遗传性周围神经病,按 照仅累及运动或感觉/自主神经分为两型,称之为远 端遗传性运动神经病和遗传性感觉自主神经病 ¶ .\n\n前者主要是肌萎缩无力可能伴轻度感觉缺陷 ; 后者 主要是感觉缺陷和/或自主神经紊乱,运动症状很少。 双侧下肢迟缓性瘫痪畸形注意与以下疾病鉴 别 : ① 其他 累及周围神经的 造传性疾病 ( 造传性共 济失调症、线粒体疾病、异染性脑白质营养不良 等);②获得性周围神经病,如慢性炎性脱髓鞘性多 发神经根周围神经病、轴索性中毒、脊髓肿瘤、中枢 神经系创伤及代谢相关周围神经病和多灶运动神经 病,脊柱脊髓发育不良及脊髓栓系综合征等。 单侧下肢迟缓性瘫痪畸形注意与以下疾病鉴 别:脊髓灰质炎、周围神经损伤、脊髓肿瘤、小腿与足 骨筋膜室综合征遗留畸形、远端肌病、运动神经元 病等。\n\n## 3 非手术治疗\n\n 患者发病后,可首先给予非手术治疗。以佩戴 各种矫形辅具为主,通过量身定制的矫形装置帮助 分散足底的承重压力 疗、物理治疗，及渐进式阻力运动锻炼等可以延缓疾 病进展。有证据表明,系统、规范的轻度至中度抗阻 力运动对 CMT 患者是有效和安全的。当前尚无特效 的药物治疗。\n\n## 4 手术治疗\n\n## 4.1 术前评估 [1,19,24]\n\n 了解患者发病与足部畸形发生的时间与进展情 况,家族史与治疗史。 若穿藏支具,要确定全足能否在支具内平整 着地。\n\n 畸形检查 :检查脊柱、髓关节、上下肢与足踝部 有无畸形 , 畸形程度和柔软性。确定畸形是可复的 , 不可复的,还是部分可复。①检查前足有无路屈(高 弓 ) 畸形 : 当第 1、2 麻骨有賄屈畸形时 , 可称为第 1、2 賄骨高弓(或前足部分高弓),当全部賄骨均賄屈畸 形时,可称为前(或全前)足高弓。②中足畸形包括 足底巴陷増加的高弓畸形,及楔骨内翻等多平面畸 形 ; 应仔细甄别 。③检查后足内翻的柔韧性时 ,

随着病情控制，逐渐强化中医药治\n\n 疗力度，重用中药扶正固本，强调从肺脾肾论治，兼 顾理气、清肺、化痰、活血，重視调畅气机，则肺气 调，痰自化，瘀自散，病当除；而哮喘慢性持续期和 缓解期的治疗，则应强调中西并重，贯彻 \"急则治其 标，缓则治其本”“发时治肺兼顾肾，平时治肾兼顾 肺”等理念，灵活应用补肾健脾盆肺和清肺化痰、止 咳平喘等治则治法，或以补为主，或攻补兼施，或以 攻为主。通过大数据挖掘技术等对临床治疗哮喘的高 频药物及常用药对、药组进行分析，发现中医药治疗 哮喘用药规律为祛痰平喘、宣肺疏表、息风解痉、补 盆肺脾腎、祛瘀通络等，此对临床哮喘的辨证组方具 有借鉴意义 [43] 中西医治疗哮喘各有其优势，临床缺一不可，当\n\n 辨清缓急，灵活变通，优化选择，最大程度使患者获 益。当然，作为我国中医药重要组成部分的少数民族 医药在治疗哮喘上也积累了很多经验，取得了很好的 疗效，比如有研究发现 44 , 我国维药罗欧咳祖帕在 控制哮喘发作方面疗效确切。我国中医药具有悠久历 史及大量临床实践的积淀，但由于有关哮喘的临床 研究方法学水平普遍较低，导致关于疗效的展示度不 够，急需更多地开展多中心、大样本的随机对照临床 试验和 ( 或 ) 真实世界研究等，以求获得更加高质量 的循证医学证据，进一步提高中西医结合诊治哮喘的 水平。另外，对确切有效的中医方药进行现代物质基 础和作用机制的研究，同样有利于中西医结合诊治哮\nE\n\n 执笔人: 李克成 ( 复旦大学附属华山医院 ), 李风森（新鐘医科大学附属中医医院 )、张炜（上海 中 医 药 大 学 附 爲 曙 光 医 院 )、 周 林 福 ( 江 苏 省 人 氏 医 院 )、王刚 ( 四川大学华西医院 )、徐卫方 ( 广州中医 药大学深圳医院 )、周贤梅(

基础上而进行的一系列有针对性的改进设计。 CSPO和ISR都是针对极低位直肠癌的保肛手术， 但存在以下区别: ① CSPO不进行广泛括约肌 间沟的分离，最大限度地保护神经和肌肉交织 结构，从而改善肛门功能；② CSPO与ISR的远 端切除线不同，CSPO根据肿瘤的位置，选择斜 行向上的弧形切除线，从而避免了ISR的水平切 线，因而保留了更多的对侧内括约肌和齿状线； ③

产生的电离气体所致烧伤,其不需要机械接触,仅 通过空气介质就可将电流传递到患者身上,同时通 过瞬间的高温电火花灼伤皮肤 [ 9 ]。此外,电流还可 引起衣物或环境着火而致火焰烧伤,其性质与急救 处理可同热力烧伤一致。 推荐意见 14( 中推荐 ) : 对于电接触烧伤 , 不推 荐常规冷疗 , 建议覆盖创面后将患者紧急送往医院 治疗 ( 证据等级为低 ) .\n\n证据与说明:电接触烧伤包括低压电烧伤和高 压电烧伤。低压电烧伤一般发生在家庭用电中,通 常为电接触皮肤处组织的炭化和坏死;高压电烧伤 通常较为严重,损伤范围外小内大,可向深层组织 及周围结构扩散,造成血管、肌肉,甚至骨骼的严重 损伤,不能根据皮肤表面损伤情况来判断烧伤的严 重程度 [7] 。国际创面治疗指南指出,电烧伤创面通 常较深,伤及深层组织,不宜使用冷水冲洗 [7] 。 整 于此,不推荐对电接触烧伤创面行常规冷疗,可用 无菌纱布、保鲜膜或者清洁的床单等布料覆盖创 面,等待专业医疗人员的到来或将患者紧急送往医 院急救处置。此外,无论电烧伤患者看起来有无明 显症状,均应紧急就医行进一步检查。\n\n## 3\n\n 3.1  临床问题 4: II 度烧伤创面的诊断与评估 准确的烧伤创面深度诊断和面积评估是临床 治疗决策的基石。目前主要基于损伤有无累及真 皮网状层将 II

Lancet 上发表的非布司他和别喂吟醇合 理化试验( FAST ), 即使和CARES研究相比使用了更高的剂量, 结果并不支持非布司他増加心血管风险 [ 44 ]。因此，需要进一 步的临床试验阐明这一问题。 在心血管影响方面, 高尿酸血症治疗选择仍然处于没有 明确的结论阶段，2021 年更新版共识提出，更多的研究倾向 于将别喂吟醇作为一线降尿酸治疗，对于非布司他的使用仍、 需进一步的大规模临床试验来证实。 7    治疗和管理策略 :  更新的 5 步建议 2021 年更新版共识在治疗和管理策略部分主要更新了高 尿酸血症患者治疗的 5 步建议，见图 1。 7.1  第一步: 评估血尿酸水平 2欧洲心血管学会和欧洲高血\n\n 检测血尿酸水平: 若≥ 360 μ mol/L 或 300 μ mol/L\n（ 心血管高风险人群 ) ,  被认为血尿酸水平过高\n\n 第一步\n\n| 第二步 |  | \\n停止使用增加血尿酸水平的药物\\n达到治疗目标，其后勿停止治疗，每年应至少监测 |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| 第三步 |  | \\n2\\n次血尿酸水平；特殊情况下考虑联合治疗 |\n| 第四步 | 别嘌呤醇以\\nmg/d\\nμ\\nmol/L\\n最大剂量 | 起始治疗，滴定至\\n100~200 mg/d 300~600\\n，血尿酸水平达到目标水平 μ 或\\n360  mol/L 300\\n（心血管高风险人群），特殊情况考虑使用\\n900 mg/d\\n进行患者教育，使患者了解疾病和生活方式、体育 |\n\nFigure 1\n\nManagement strategy for patients suffering from hiperuricemia\n\n 压学会均推荐将检测血尿酸水平作为心血管疾病和高血压患 者筛查的一部分 [49] 。2021 年更新版共识建议： 血尿酸控制 目标水平为 6 mg/dl ( 360 μ mol/L ) , 应規律监测血尿酸水平 并保持在 6 mg/dl 以下。对于心血管高风险的患者（至少包括 以下两项: 高血压、糖尿病、血脂异常、耙器官损伤或既往 发生过心血管事件 )，应把血尿酸水平控制在 5 mg/dl 以下。 7.2  第二步: 检查合并症并积极治疗, 停止使用影响血尿酸 水平的药物 対高尿酸血症患者, 应制定和实施恰当的治疗 策略，考虑更加严格地控制相关的危险因素，调整使用不直 接影响血尿酸水平的药物，有效地管理影响血尿酸水平的伴 随疾病，如高血压、2 型糖尿病、代谢综合征、CKD 和心血 管疾病 [ 26 , 31 -33 ], 在临床实际中 , 如果潜在益处超过潜在危害 , 就应该考虑可行的改变，特别是以下情况。如果可以替换, 建议将利尿剂 ( 主要包括氢氢嚎嗪 ) 改为其他降压药物 ; 虽 然氣沙坦是唯一能降低血尿酸水平的血管紧张素 II 受体阻滞 剂 ( angiotensin II receptor blockage, ARB ) [ 50 ] , 但并不推荐 从其他 ARB 类药物转为氧沙坦 ; 在心血管疾病的—级预防中 , 应停止使用小剂量阿司匹林或者考虑改为其他药物，但不推 荐在心血管疾病的二级预防中停用小剂量阿司匹林。不推荐 将降胆固醇类药物改为非诺贝特。建立多学科团队制定最优 诊断和治疗策略，必须对高尿酸血症的重要性进行恰当的评 佔，改进对临床实践指南的依从性，提高对高尿酸血症及其 相关共病的认识，并加强监测。 7.3  , 第三步 , 推荐生活方式的改变 2021 年更新版共识与 2018 年版共识一样，强调最有意义的生活方式改变是：限制 喂吟的摄人，包括红肉和海鲜；限制高果糖食物的摄人；限 制伙酒。限酒或者戒酒能降低血尿酸水平达 1.6 mg/dl [sr] ; 肥胖或超重患者应定期锻炼并减肥，增加咖啡、奶制品、樱 桃 [ 50 , 52 ] 和维生素 C 的摄人 [ 53 ] 7.4  第四步: 使用 XOI 作为—线治疗药物，滴定剂量至血尿 酸水平达标 2016 欧洲抗风湿病联盟 (European Alliance of\nAssociations for Rheumatology, EULAR) 循证建议推荐别喂吟 醇作为—线治疗药物，建议患者初始剂量为 100~200 mg/d, 每 2~4 周増加 100 mg/d，最大剂量为 900 mg/d，逐步调整剂 量达到血尿酸控制目标水平 [ 34 ]。CKD 患者，由于肾功能损","title":null,"tags":"{}","lang":"zh","attr":"{\"raw_info\":[{\"block_text\":\"\\n## 论再次提升了高尿酸血症在心血管疾病中的风险地位。 5  评估当前血尿酸碉值预测心血管事件风险\\n\",\"block_text_old\":\"\\n## 论再次提升了高尿酸血症在心血管疾病中的风险地位。 5  评估当前血尿酸碉值预测心血管事件风险\\n\",\"raw_context\":[{\"text\":\"论再次提升了高尿酸血症在心血管疾病中的风险地位。\",\"bbox\":[61.0,104.0,347.0,118.0]},{\"text\":\"5  评估当前血尿酸碉值预测心血管事件风险\",\"bbox\":[61.0,123.0,299.0,137.0]}],\"block_type\":\"Section-header\",\"full_blocks\":[60.0,103.0,346.0,136.0],\"position\":3,\"table_info\":{}},{\"block_text\":\"\\n\\n 2021 年更新版共识增加了血尿酸闽值预测心血管事件风 险的相关研究和分析。其中血尿酸被认为是心血管事件如高 血压 [24] 、代谢综合征 [25-36] 、冠心病 [27] 、糖尿病 [28] 、脑 血管病[ 29 -39 ]、慢性背脏病 ( CKD ) [ 31 ] 和其他心血管疾病[ 32 -33 ] 发生、发展的一个独立因素，并且反过来这些并发症同样增 加了高尿酸血症的发病率 [*]。经过充分验证的大样本量的研 究证实 , 和痛风相比 , 血尿酸对心血管疾病作用的阀值更低 , 主要原因可能氧化应激的产生和黄喂吟氧化酶作用下生成的 血尿酸盐相关产物有关，并且在很大程度上独立于血尿酸沉 积所致的炎症 [ 35 ] . 大量研究证实 , 高尿酸血症导致心血管疾病 , 糖尿病、脂质代谢和肾脏疾病的恶化 [36-38] ; 増高的血尿酸水 平和増高的心血管风险相关 [39–40] , 进一步强调重新定义血尿 酸阀值对于识别高尿酸血症患者合并心血管高风险的重要性。 6    高尿酸血症的治疗选择对于心血管的影响 6.1    别喂吟醇仍是一线降尿酸治疗    LI 等 项指南文献，其中 19 项提供了血尿酸控制目标水平 , 大多 数建议为 6.0 mg/dl ( 360 µ mol/L ) , 除了南非的指南建议为 5.0 mg/dl ( 300 µ mol/L ) 。2019 年波兰高血压指南也推荐血尿 酸控制目标水平为 5.0 mg/dl [42] 。不同临床試验对高尿酸血症 的定义差异很大，使得流行病学报告有些不一致，难以进行比 较。黄喂吟氧化酶抑制剂（XOI），尤其是别喂吟醇，依然是 几乎所有指南的一线推荐。在 FAST ( 痛风患者非布司他和别 喂吟醇长期心血管安全性的比较 多中心、前瞻性、随机、开放、 非劣效性研究 ) 试验发表之后，非布司他被推荐使用 [3-4]\\nFAST 研究结果与 CARES（痛风合并心血管疾病患者使用非 布司他和别喂吟醇的心血管安全性 ) 研究结果 [45] 相异。 6.2  非布司他尚需进一步的临床试验   非布司他是一种非 喂吟类的 XOI , 推荐用于难治性或不耐受别喂吟醇的患者 ,\\nCKD 1~3 期患者不需要调整剂量。非布司他可强效地抑制黄 喂吟氧化酶活性，和常規剂量别嚎吟醇相比，其其有更强的 降尿酸效果 [*] 。然而，一項主要基于大样本量的随机研究比 较非布司他和别喂吟醇的安全性，初步结果认为，非布司他 的心血管事件小幅度增高 [47] 。但是，一项包含 35 项研究的\\nMeta 分析并未显示非布司他和别喂吟醇在心血管事件上有差 异 [ RR =1.69, 95%CI ( 0.54, 5.34 ) , P =0.37 ] [ 48 ] 。欧洲 医 药管理局（EMA）在.

如伴有症状, 则停用他 汀类药物，监测症状和 CK 水平，待症状消失且 CK 恢复正常后可考虑重启他汀类药物，建议换用另外 一种代谢途径的他汀类药物。当 CK > 4 × ULN，建 议停用他汀类药物，并密切监测症状及 CK 水平; 如\nCK > 10 × ULN，则需警惕横纹肌溶解可能，需检测 有无血红蛋白尿及肾功能损伤，并立即停用他汀类 药物并给予水化治疗，连续监测 CK 至正常水平。对 于这类患者建议联合用药或换用非他汀类药物。 长期服用他汀类药物有增加新发糖尿病的风 险，属他汀类效应。使用高强度他汀类药物时，新 发糖尿病发生率高于常规剂量他汀类药物 ( 9% 比 12% ) [149] 。有研究显示匹伐他汀引起新发糖尿病的 概率较低 [159]。他汀类药物对 ASCVD 的总体益处远 大于新增糖尿病风险，无论是糖尿病高危人群还是 糖尿病患者，有他汀类药物治疗适应证者都应坚持\n\n## 服用此类药物。\n\n 胆固醇治疗研究者协作组荟萃分析指出，当纳 人强化降低胆固醇预防脑卒中研究( Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels,\nSPARCL) 及瑞舒伐他汀在心力衰竭患者作用多国对 照试验 ( Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in\nHeart Failure,  CORONA ) 进行荟萃分析，结果显示\nLDL–C 每降低 1 mmol/L，出血性脑卒中风险增加 21% [93] 。其他荟萃分析提示 LDL–C 下降均未显著增 加出血性脑卒中风险 [151-152]。他汀类药物对其他脑 卒中亚型的总体益处大大超过风险 [ 90 , 93 ] , 但仍需探 究哪些人群在他汀类药物治疗过程中容易发生出血 性脑卒中。 他汀类药物的其他不良反应还包括头痛、失眠、 抑郁以及消化不良、腹泻、腹痛、恶心等消化道症状。 另外，荟萃分析结果显示他汀类药物对肾功能无不 良影响 [153] 在应用他汀类药物期间，需关注与其他药物间 的相互作用。因他汀类药物多通过肝脏主要代谢酶 系 – 细胞色素（cytochrome，CY）P450 代谢 ( 包括 CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C6 )。 当通过 CYP3A4 途径代谢的他汀类药物与抗排异药 物( 如环孢菌素等 ) 钙拮抗剂、其他药物(包括胺碘酮、吉非罗齐等 )以 及西柚汁 [154 等联用时，可能增加肌病或肌溶解的 风险，故应避免使用大剂量他汀类药物并监测不良 反应 .\n\n他汀类药物不耐受是指他汀类药物应用后出 现与他汀类药物相关的临床不良反应和 ( 或 ) 实验 室检测指标异常 , 一般是指同时满足以下 4 个条件 : ( 1 )临床表现: 主观症状和( 或 )客观血液检查不正 常 ;( 2 ) 不能耐受 ≥ 2 种他汀类药物，其中—种他汀 类药物的使用剂量为最小剂量;( 3 ) 存在因果关系;

杂、手术持续时间长等特点，相比于常规外科手术，\nDSA复合手术室内仪器设备多，且操作复杂性较高， 手术涉及精密器械与介入耗材等无菌物品众多，因 此复合手术室护理岗位应配备1名以上手术室护士， 以确保术中护理安全。DSA复合手术室应专门配备 放射影像技师，协助完成术中的造影及即时影像学 测评。 (2)复合手术中手术间人员控制。复合手术进行 时应严格控制手术间人数，避免因过多人员进出增加 患者术中感染风险。洁净手术间内的人、物流动是影 响手术室内空气洁净程度的重要媒介，复合手术的实\n\n 施需要多临床科室协作，参与手术的医护人员人数远 超单纯外科手术、介人手术，因此应严格限制手术间 人数，限制进修实习人员进人手术间内参观，尽量减 少人员流动 [5.7–8] 。对于参与复合手术的内科医生、导 管室护士、放射科技师及相关医疗辅助人员应加强培 训，按手术室要求执行手术间人员管理与人流控制， 减少不必要的人员走动及出人，内科医生和外科医生 根据手术进程分批进人DSA复合手术室例 .\n\n2  DSA复合手术室设备配置与仪器管理 2.1 DSA 系统与相关设施的选择 (1)DSA系统的选择。复合手术室DSA系统的选 择应优先考虑血管造影机图像质量与机架灵活性。 根据国家标准《医院洁净手术部建筑技术规范》 (GB50333–2013) [10] 相关规定， I 级洁净手术室应采用 局部集中送凤方式，送凤口设置于手术台上方，因此\nDSA的C型臂应在可使用范围的基础上，尽量远离手 术床，以降低对外科手术操作及手术间空气净化的影 同 [11] .\n\n(2)复合手术床选择。复合手术床应兼顾内科介 人治疗与外科手术操作双方要求，床板X射线透过率 良好且可与C型臂同步调控，应选择并使用整张的碳 纤维床面。在血管造影期间，可允许快速精准移动, 并可架设麻醉头架、腹部牽开器等金属支撑部件 [11] 。 手术床最大承重应> 300 kg，床板长度> 280 cm，宽 度> 45 cm,  纵向移动> 125 cm,  横向移动> 28 cm, 床面水平旋转> 120° ，下降最低高度 < 78 cm，升高 最高高度 > 110 cm，床面头足側、左右側可倾斜角\nR > ± 15°

EC 经病理组织学确诊 ｡ (2) 肿瘤组织中进行免疫组织化 学 (immunohistochemistry, IHC) 染色初篇检测 MMR 蛋白表 达情况 (MLH1,MSH2,MSH6 和 PMS2 这4 种蛋白中存在 1 种或多种蛋白缺失 )或 MSI 检测 。(3)对存在 MMR 蛋白\nMLHI 缺失的患者进行甲基化检测,排除 MLHI 启动子高 度甲基化的患者。(4)在 IHC 初第或 MSI 检测的基础上 , 对 患者血液标本行 MMR 基因胚系突变检测 , 以明确 LS 诊断 。 推荐意见:(1)Lynch 综合征相关性子宫内膜癌由MMR 基因 MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 & EPCAM的致病性胚系突变引 起, 其患 EC 的风险与 MMR 突变基因的类型相关, MSH2突变 是 LS–EC 中 最常见的 MMR 突变类型 , MSH6 突变发生 EC 的终 生风险显著增高,而 PMS2突变发生EC的终生风险相对较 低 ( 但 仍 高 于 普 通 人 群 ) 。 (2) 诊断 LS – EC 的 流 程 : 病 理 学 确 诊的任何类型的子宮内膜癌、肿瘤组织 IHC 初筛染色检测 存在 MMR 蛋白缺失或存在微卫星高度不稳定型(MSI-H)、\nMLH1 甲基化检测以及血液 MMR 基因的致病性胚系突变检 测 .\n\n## 4 Ls–Ec的临床和病理特征\n\n 4.1  临床特征  LS–EC 患者临床特征主要包括:(1)很少 表現出雌激素依赖性肿瘤的临床特征,患者多无雌激素刺 激症状与体征,伴或不伴不规则阴道流血,大多数无肥胖、 多葉卵巢综合征 , 外源性雌激素使用及糖尿病等病史 , 确 诊 EC前多无癌前病变的表现( 如子宮内膜单纯性或复杂性 增生伴不典型增生)。(2)LS–EC 患者发病年龄较年轻,通常 较散发性 EC 患者小 10 岁。在年龄<50 岁的 EC 患者中 , LS 患病率约为 11% […] , 平均发病年龄为 46.4 罗 […] , 而散发性\nEC 平均发病年龄多>50 岁 。此外 , 不同 MMR 基因突变 , 其 EC 发病年龄也存在差异。MSH6基因突变患者诊断为 EC 的年龄晚于 MSH2或 MLHI 基因突变患者。其中 , MLHI 和\nMSH2基因突变患者中EC 发病年龄为 39~49.5 岁 , 而 MSH6 基因突变患者 EC 发病年龄为 50.6~59.5 岁 [15] , 发病年龄的\n\n 不同为制定个体化预防措施提供了依据。(3)LS–EC患者较 散发性EC患者体重指数(body mass index,BMI)偏低。研 究发现 LS–EC 病例的中位 BMI 为 27.6, 明显低于散发性病 例的中位 BMI 37.5  , BMI>30 时预测 LS 的敏感度和特异度 分别为 56% 和 65% [16] .\n\n部分 LS 相关肿瘤患者既不出现 MLH1 启动子高度甲 基化,也没有 MMR 基因的胚系突变,但却出现了 MMR 缺 陷,其临床特征与 LS 相似,这种类似 LS,但又不能归为 LS 的疾病, 称为林奇样综合征 (lynch–like syndrome, LLS) [17] .\n\n4.2  病理特征 (1)LS–EC的肿瘤病变好发于子宮体下段 (lower uterine segment, LUS) [18-19] , 但一般不累及子宮颈内 口。(2)LS–EC 的组织学类型更为多样化,包括子宮内膜样 癌和非子宮内膜样癌组织学类型(如透明细胞癌、浆液性 子宮内膜癌、未分化癌和癌肉瘤 ) [°. ----] , 其中子宮内膜样腺 癌最为常见。但 MSH2基因突变的患者则更多的表现出非 子宮内膜样腺癌的组织学特征,如透明细胞癌、浆液性乳 头状癌或恶性中胚叶混合癌 [ 癌周有密集的淋巴细胞和大量的肿瘤浸润性淋巴细胞(tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, TILs) 。 IHC 染色存在 MMR 蛋 白表达缺失。(3)LS–EC较散发性子宮内膜癌更易发生淋巴 脉管间隙浸润。(4)LS 女性患者中 EC 和卵巢癌可同时出 现,卵巢癌的最常见的病理类型是子宮内膜样腺癌或透明 细胞癌。(5)由于子宮体下段的黏膜较上段黏膜薄,因此,\nLUS对激素刺激的反应较差。LUS受累与无进展生存期或 复发率无关 […], 但 LUS 受累的病例淋巴结转移率较高 […]。 目前尚不能证实 LUS 肿瘤更具有侵袭性的特征。 推荐意见 : Lynch 综合征相关性子宮内膜癌的发病年 龄较散发性子宮内膜癌患者年轻,BMI 偏低,无雌激素相关 刺激症状与体征,更易发生淋巴脉管间隙漫润,病理组织 学表现呈多样化,包括子宫内膜样癌、浆液性癌、透明细胞 癌及其他高度恶性肿瘤,但以子宮内膜样腺癌最为多见。 子宫体下段为癌灶好发部位,但很少累及子宮颈。组织学 上癌细胞皇髓样生长、TILs 増多，IHC染色存在 MMR 蛋白表 达缺失。\n\n## 5 Ls-Ec的筛查建议\n\nLS 中对相关结直肠癌的筛查策略目前已经有了深人 的研究。然而,对 LS–EC 的筛查策略、年龄阀值或成本效 益尚未达成共识,仍存在争议 [**] 。因此,早期识别 LS–EC, 对于预防患者发生其他相关肿瘤,提高患者的生存率具有 重要意义。此外,LS家族成员也可尽早进行基因检测,预 防 LS 相关肿瘤的发生。 5.1  临床筛查标准  LS临床筛查方法系基于个体和家族 癌症史的临床诊断标准,包括阿姆斯特丹(Amsterdam) II 临床标准

年，最长为32年，中位间隔为8~10年 [11]\nBIA-ALCL最常见的临床表现是: ① 植人物 周围积液或持续的血清肿; ② 植人物周围肿块 伴或不伴积液。③ 相关的区域淋巴结受累，通 常是腋窝淋巴结肿大。其他症状包括包膜李缩、 淋巴结肿大、B型症状（发热、淋巴结病变、盗 汗、疲劳） [ 12 -14 ]。对于已行植人物隆乳或乳房 重建的患者，术后若出现上述症状，并持续1年 以上，应高度怀疑BIA-ALCL，需完善相关影像 学检查，提高诊断的精确度，如超声、MRI、正 电子发射CT ( positron emission tomography and CT, PET/CT ) 等。对积液进行细胞学检查也有 利于BIA-ALCL的检出 [15] 。2017年NCCN发布\nBIA-ALCL 诊治指南 , 对于早期BIA-ALCL , 完 全切除植人物和周围纤维囊是最理想的治疗方 法 [16] 。与其他治疗措施相比，完全手术切除可 延长患者总生存期和无事件生存期 [17] 。对于更 晚期的病例，建议个体化的系统治疗 [18] 。推荐 的化疗方案是基于意环类药物的方案（环磷酰 胺、长春新碱、多柔比星和强的松 )，可加或不 加放射治疗 [19] 。早期BIA-ALCL患者的预后较 好，而一旦延迟诊断，患者预后较差，甚至死 亡。因此，虽然目前我国尚无BIA-ALCL报道， 但是临床工作者仍需加强对于此病的识别，从而 改善患者预后。对于BIA-ALCL发病机制，还需 要进一步研究来阐明，从而为疾病的治疗提供 方向。 5.2.2  高危因素 植人物乳房重建的并发症发生和重建失败 率升高除了肿瘤学因素之外，通常与以下因素 相关。 乳房形态因素：乳房容积较大的患者，以对 侧乳房作为参考，置人较大的假体存在局部组织 量不足，不能提供充足的自体组织覆盖假体，行 即刻重建会导致肌肉或皮瓣张力过大，增加皮瓣 坏死、假体暴露及移位等并发症发生率，致手术 失败，因此不建议行即刻假体乳房重建 [ 20 ]。通 常可联合同側背阔肌肌 (皮) 瓣、前锯肌肌瓣等

测中心和各省市临床检测中心) 和国际 (CAP和欧 洲分子基因诊断质量联盟）的室间质评等。 为了保证NGS检测作为辅助诊断的准确性和可 重复性，产品上市前必须经过严谨的性能验证。在 性能验证之前，需要建立完整的验证计划，确定阳 性判断值、敏感度、特异度、检测下限、精密度和 可报告范围等性能指标 .\n\n产品性能验证需要纳入的样本包括标准DNA 或RNA样本、标准细胞系和临床样本等。DNA、\nRNA标准品和标准细胞系可以用来评估不同变异类 型的检测准确性和可重复性，以及每种变异类型的 检测下限。临床样本的选择应根据具体的临床应用 而定, 包括肿瘤组织、血浆、白细胞、骨髓、胸腹水、 脑脊液等。NGS基因检测覆盖几种主要的变异类型 .\n\n单 核 苷 酸 变 异 (single nucleotide variation, SNV), 小片段插入/缺失 (insertion/deletion, Indel)、基因 融合、大片段重排 (large rearrangement, LGR) 以 及拷贝数变异 (copy number alteration, CNA)。常 用来验证SNV和Indel的方法包括Sanger测序、等位 基因特异度PCR等。基因融合一般与FISH或者IHC\n\n 检测进行头对头验证。LGR的验证方法一般采用多 重连接探针扩增技术和多重扩增定量技术。常用的\nCNA验证方法包括定量PCR、FISH和基于阵列的 比较染色体基因杂交等。另外, CNA的检测需要 基于肿瘤细胞含量和测序深度，对检测到的序列 (reads) 进行标准化 , 从而获得实际的CNA状态和 拷贝数量。通过对单核苷酸多态性位点等位基因频 率的分析，可以作为分析CNA的有用指标。\nTMB和微卫星状态是肿瘤免疫治疗的重要预 测指标，也可以通过NGS靶向测序进行评估。目 前认为, 计算TMB的金标准是WES, 而覆盖编码 区域的有效数据量> 0.8 Mb的NGS靶向测序，也 可以用来计算TMB[184]。NGS靶向测序也已经被广 泛用于肿瘤免疫治疗中TMB的计算及疗效预测。\nNGS靶向测序在应用于临床之前，需要与WES进 行头对头验证，评估NGS靶向测序跟WES评估肿 瘤 TMB的一致性。通常要求NGS靶向测序跟WES 评估TMB的相关性达到0.9以上，才能准确反映肿 瘤的TMB水平，并有效预测免疫治疗的疗效。\nMSI-H已经在多个瘤种中被证明是免疫治疗获 益的预测指标。为评估肿瘤的微卫星状态，NGS靶 向测序需要设计针对微卫星位点的探针，并通过标 准品进行算法开发、临界值和检测下限的确认。微 卫星位点的选择通常需要考虑以下几个因素：微卫 星位点的位置、长度、探针覆盖程度，以及每个位 点与样本总体的微卫星状态的相关性。微卫星位点 的数量通常从数十个到数百个不等。最后，覆盖足 够MSI位点的NGS靶向测序需要与PCR检测进行一 致性验证和性能评估。通常要求NGS靶向测序评估 肿瘤组织微卫星状态的敏感度> 90%, 特异度> 95%。有条件的实验室，在接受免疫治疗的临床队 列中, 应对TMB和微卫星状态的疗效预测效力进 行进一步的临床验证。 共识二十一: NGS检测实验室应获得国内外\n\n 权威认证，其开展的检测项目应进行性能验证及临 床评价,并参加国内外权威机构发起的室间顾评(推 荐等级： II 级推荐 ).\n\n## 5 Ngs检测报告呈现\n\n 检测报告是医生和患者接受NGS检测结果的唯

流术的患者越来越少,目前主要限于伴脾静脉血栓患者的 脾切除术 [ 99 ]。虽然有文献报道外科断流术可作为内镜治疗 失败背静脉曲张出血患者的挽救措施,但围手术期死亡率 及术后再出血率仍较高,尤其是肝硬化门脉高压患 者 [1818], 因此仅推荐用于无法开展 TIPS、且相关经验较丰 富的单位开展 [10] .\n\n5. 多学科诊疗模式的价值 : 肝硬化门静脉高压症消化 道静脉曲张出血的诊疗涉及消化内科、普通外科(肝胆膜、 胃肠 ) 、器官移植科 、 放射介入科 、 超声科等多个学科。因 此,多学科团队的参与,可以充分利用各科的优势,结合患 者病情制定出更为合理的个体化治疗方案,使患者利益最 大化。 推荐意见 16: 三腔二囊管可作为 ECI 治疗失敗的胃静 脉曲张出血息者的挽故措施,内微治疗失敗后宜尽快使 用,特患者血流动力学稳定后应尽快启动其他更有效治疗 措施。 (证据质量:中等质量;共识水平:93.3%) 推荐意見 17: TIPS 可作为 ECI 治疗失敗的胃静脉曲 张出血息者的挽赦措施,有条件的单位建议早期应用,治 疗时间时检墓曲张静脉。 (证据质量:高质量;共识水平; 97.8% ) 推荐意见 18: BRTO 可作为 ECI 治疗失敗的胃静脉曲 张出血患者的挽赦措施,适用于伴有胃背或脾背分流遣 睿 (证据质量:中等质量;共识水平:91.1%) 推荐意见 19:在无法开展 TIPS 或 BRTO 的单位 , 对于 Child-pugh A¸B 级島者 , 外科手术干预可作为 ECI 治疗失 败的挽赦措施 ( 证据质量 : 中等质量 ; 共识水平 : 95.6% ) 推荐意見 20: 有条件的单位可开展多学科诊疗模式 为肝硬化门静脉高压潛化道静脉曲张息者制定个体化方 秦。 (证据质量:中等质量;共识水平;100%) 九、组织胶注射治疗的并发症\n\nECI 治疗的并发症包括异位栓塞、注射针滞留曲张静脉 内 ∩ 粘针 ∩ 注射套管堵塞 ∩ 血 ∩ 门静脉血栓 ∩ 感染等 , 其中最 严重的并发症为异位栓塞,常见的为肺栓塞､脑栓塞和脾梗 死 [129-13]。在一些使用碘油做预充剂的研究显示,虽然术后 影像学检查发现较大比例患者肺内可出现少量碘化油,但 绝大多数无症状,真正有症状、需要抗凝治疗的患者极少, 目前最大样本量的—项研究发现 ECI 治疗后异位栓塞率为 0.7% [129] 。发生异位栓塞的危险因素目前尚未完全明确，认 为可能的危险因素包括存在门体分流道、使用碘油做预充 剂、组织胶用量过大等。因此建议行ECI时使用盐水、高渗 糖或聚桂醇作为预充剂,同时控制推注速度;对于非急性出 血患者或急性出血得到控制者,建议完善 CT或磁共振血管 成像明确有无门体分流道的存在,如存在脾肾或胃肾分 流，建议 BRTO 或 EUS引导下弹簧圈+组织胶注射。注射针 滯留曲张静脉内、粘针及注射套管堵塞发生率较低,且与操\n\n 作者水平有关,经验丰富的医师很少出现上述情况。 常见出血包括排胶出血、注射针眼出血,后者多与操作 不当或组织胶用量不足有关。ECI 治疗后,大部分患者在 1~3 个月内开始排胶,平均时间为术后 23 d,并在 6 ~ 12 个 月内基本排完,但亦有少数患者排胶过程长达1~2年。排 胶出血的发生率为 3.1%~14.2% [ 129 . 131 . 133 . 134 ], 发生排胶出血危 险因素尚未完全明确,研究显示 Child-Pugh评分越高、组织 胶剂量越大( 胃静脉曲张直径越粗 ) 生排胶出血的风险越高 […]。而术前借助 CT 等影像学技术 评估曲张静脉容积,个体化设计组织胶用量,术中仔细确认 曲张静脉封闭程度,可能有助于降低排胶出血的发生率。\nEUS可显示曲张静脉固化情况,对于判别排胶出血的原因 有一定价值。 门静脉或脾静脉血栓的发生率极低 .\n\n31.9% 的患者 ECI 治疗后可出现菌血症 . 但多为一过性 [135] .\n\n真正引起症状、需要治疗的感染发生率仅为 1% 左右 [ 129 , 131 ], 且常见于急性出血期患者 [ 89 . 18 . 18 ], 而此类患者即使不发生 感染也会接受抗生素治疗。 十、组织胶注射治疗后的随访策略 本共识主要探讨肖静脉曲张 ECI 治疗后的随访策略。\n\n 宵静脉曲张 ECI 治疗后随访策略 目前尚无统一共识,多数 临床研究中治疗后前半年复查2~3次,半年后每6个月进行 检查,直至确认曲张静脉消除,消除后可进行年度复 查 [129,134] 。 绝大多数指南并未对静脉曲张ECI治疗患者给 出一个明确的随访期限,2021 年美国胃肠病学会的专家共 识建议背静脉曲张ECI治疗后的随访策略参照食管静脉曲 张,每2~4周行胃镜检查,直至曲张静脉消失,确认曲张静 脉消失后应3 ~6个月再次复查,而后可年度复查 [4] 。结合 我国国情,本共识推荐首次治疗后一般2~4周行背镜检查, 评估首次治疗的效果。如胃静脉曲张尚未到达根除或仍有 再出血风险者可再次行组织胶序贯治疗,直到患者胃静脉 曲张消失或无再出血风险。曲张静脉消失或无出血风险 后,至少12个月内観检查1次,以评估曲张静脉复发风险。 经过胃髄治疗的患者,应终生胃髓监测、跟踪序贯胃髓治 疗。EUS可清晰显示曲张静脉闭塞情况及复发的小曲张静 脉 , 有条件的单位可使用 EUS 进行治疗后复查 。 推荐意见 21 : ECI 袖疗术后再出血息者建议行内镜检 查明确出血原因,内镜下发现静脉曲张者可继续采用ECI 治疗。

生活行为方式调查 , 月 经初潮年龄、首次足月产年龄、怀孕次数、流产次数、 哺乳时间总长度、既往疾病史、乳腺癌相关的家族 史 心理情绪方面的相关信息。 3  机会性筛查过程中进行乳腺自查健康宣教 一项包括全球 87 项研究进行的系统分析提示 乳腺癌患者从发现症状到就诊,时间超过 3~6 个月 会严重影响患者预后 [ 8 ], 而我国乳腺癌患者就诊延 误率高达 35% [ 51 , 其中主要原因就是对乳腺癌防治 知识不了解而忽视检查。乳腺自查可以提高体检参 加机会性筛查人员对乳腺健康状况的关注，增加对 自己乳腺结构、触感的了解,如果在两次筛查期间发 生乳腺癌 , 可以及时发现并就诊。通过乳腺自查 , 还 可以监测已经存在分类为 3 类以下的结节，突然变 大时,可以及时就诊,避免延误诊断. 《中国女性乳腺 癌筛查指南(2022 年版)》中强调了乳腺健康宣教的\n\n 重要性,推荐所有女性定期进行乳腺自查 8 . 建议参 加机会性筛查人员每月进行 1 次乳腺自查。绝经前 人员于每次月经结束 1 周内进行，绝经后人员建议 每月固定时间进行。发现新生的乳腺结节或者原有 的结节明显增大应及时就诊。\n\n 4  乳腺癌机会性筛查方案 研究显示乳腺 X 射线筛查的受益人群是低于 70 岁人群 , 对于 70 岁及以上人群 , 尤其是有合并疾 病时,可以采用个体化筛查方案,根据身体情况、有 无合并疾病、乳腺腺体密度等因素选择筛查方法。也 可以考虑只进行乳腺超声检查。有可疑病变时再进 行乳腺 X 射线检查等其他检查 [8] .\n\n(1)40 岁以下高风险女性，建议每月进行乳腺 自查,每年进行乳腺超声检查和乳腺触诊检查。 (2)对 40 岁及以上高风险女性,建议每月进行 乳腺自查, 每年进行 1 次乳腺触诊、乳腺超声检查, 每 1~2

强乳腺自查健康宣教、缩短进行乳腺触诊和乳腺超 声筛查的时间来提高这部分人员的筛查效果。\nO 18 岁开始每月进行乳腺自查。 ② 25 ~ 29 岁 , 每月乳腺自查 , 每 6 个月进行乳腺 触诊检查, 每年进行乳腺超声检查。 ③ 30~39 岁 , 每月乳腺自查 , 每 6 个月进行乳腺 触诊加乳腺超声检查。 ④40 岁开始每月乳腺自查 , 每年乳腺触诊加乳 腺 MRI 检查或者每年触诊加乳腺
