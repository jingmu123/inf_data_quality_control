Two particular problems have emerged since the pre- vious BTS guidelines were published. Firstly, there have been many cases reported recently of atypical mycobacteria causing contamination of bronchoscopes leading to pseudoinfections. Sec-ondly, toxicity from glutaraldehyde has become a significant problem as it has been implicated in cases of occupational asthma among some nurs-ing and technical staV working in endoscopy units (the term “endoscopy unit” is used in these guidelines as most bronchoscopy services are now carried out within such units). The previous BTS bronchoscopy guidelines were brief and were not based on a formal search of published evidence.  \nA Working Group was formed at the request of the BTS with instructions to develop formal evidence-based guidelines for flexible bron-choscopy. The Committee consisted of indi-viduals with a wide range of backgrounds including nurses, a microbiologist, an infection control expert, as well as respiratory physicians including one with a special interest in intensive care medicine. Full details are given in Appendix 1.  \nThe aim of the Committee was to produce evidence-based guidelines for subsequent use by medical, nursing, and technical staV. The areas to be covered were carefully defined and-were primarily to advise on bronchoscopy in adults, although the sections of the guidelines concerned with staV safety and instrument decontamination would also be relevant to paediatric flexible bronchoscopy.  \nThe areas covered by these guidelines are as follows:  \ncomplications, contraindications and pre-cautions;  \nsedation and anaesthesia/analgesia;  \ncleaning and disinfection including glutar-aldehyde usage;  \nstaV safety;  \nbronchoscopy in the intensive care unit;  \ndata collection and staV training;  \npatient satisfaction  ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Genotyping is useful in epide-miological studies and in clinical management for pre-dicting the likelihood of response and determining theoptimal duration of therapy. The hepatitis C virus can beclassi??ed into at least 6 major genotypes (genotypes 1 to6) based on a sequence divergence of 30% among iso-lates.Genotype 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b) is the most com-mon in the U.S., followed by genotypes 2 and 3. Lesscommon genotypes (genotypes 4-6) are beginning to beobserved more frequently because of the growing culturaldiversity within the United States.Several commercialassays are available to determine HCV genotypes usingdirect sequence analysis of the 5 non-coding region, thatinclude Trugene 5 NC HCV Genotyping kit (SiemensHealthcare Diagnostics Division, Tarrytown, NY), re-verse hybridization analysis using genotype speci??c oligo-nucleotide probes located in the 5 non-coding region,INNO-LiPa HCV II, (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium),and Versant HCV Genotyping Assay 2.0 (SiemensHealthcare Diagnostics Division, Tarrytown, NY). In-correct typing among the major genotypes is rare and mixed genotypes occur but are uncommon. Occa-sionally , tested samples cannot be genotyped.This usually results from low viral levels, issues with thePCR ampli??cation step of the assay, or extreme nucleo-tide variability within the HCV genome.  \nDiagnosis of Acute and Chronic HCVInfection and Interpretation of AssaysThe diagnosis of acute or chronic HCV infection gen-erally requires testing of serum for both antibody to HCV(anti-HCV) and for HCV RNA. A sensitive quantitativeHCV RNA assay is recommended for diagnosis because italso provides information on the level of virus which ishelpful in management.  \n\n【2】The differentiation of acute from chronic HCV infec-tion depends on the clinical presentation: namely thepresence of symptoms or jaundice, and whether or notthere was a prior history of ALT elevation and its dura-tion. After acute exposure, HCV RNA is usually detectedin serum before antibody; HCV RNA can be identi??ed asearly as 2 weeks following exposure whereas anti-HCV isgenerally not detectable before 8-12 weeks. These twomarkers of HCV infection may be present in varying per-mutations, requiring careful analysis for interpretation.

Full consideration must be givento the risks of untreated depression, risks of themedication to the infant and mother, and thebenefits of treatment.  \n\n【4】    This Protocol discussesthe importance of actively screening for and,when present, making the diagnosis of postpartumdepression, how treatment can be determined,and specifically addresses the medicationsfor which there is sufficient evidenceto make recommendations and provide data(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \\[SSRIs\\]and tricyclic antidepressants \\[TCAs\\]/heterocyclics).We recognize that this is a complex issue,and that there are many other factors thatimpact the care of women with postpartum depression,but which are beyond the scope ofthis protocol to discuss.  \n\n【5】    CLINICAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYINGPOSTPARTUM DEPRESSIONPostpartum depression is often missed byproviders and mothers.The symptomsof depression—depressed mood, sleep disruption,weight loss, fatigue, difficulty concentrating,anxiety, loss of interest in usual activities—ABM Protocols44can be difficult for mothers and providers todistinguish from the normal experiences ofnew mothers. It is also important to differentiatemothers suffering from postpartum depressionfrom those with postpartum blues asmisdiagnosis of such mothers can lead to unnecessarytreatment. To distinguish symptomsof depression from the “baby blues,” the timing and the severity (functional impairment)must be evaluated.For many women, acknowledgement offeelings other than happiness following thebirth of their infant can be devastating andembarrassing.

These, however, deal mainly with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infec- tions (M tuberculosis, M africanum, and M bovis). With the exception of the ATS guide-lines on non-tuberculous mycobacteria,these do not address the opportunist mycobacteria (also called atypical mycobacteria, mycobacte-ria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), non- tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), or environ- mental mycobacteria). The number of isolates of such opportunist mycobacteria has been increasing,both in HIV negative and HIV positive individuals. Because of the growing numbers of patients with disease due to infection by these mycobac-teria, the wide range of species, the diYculties in both diagnosis and management, and in response to increasing requests for advice on management, the BTS Joint Tuberculosis Committee has reviewed the evidence on man-agement of these infections. On the whole theevidence is not derived from controlled clinical trials as very few have been reported but, where possible, we have graded the evidence accord- ing to the criteria in table 1. Sections cover epi- demiology, bacteriological aspects, diagnosis and treatment in adults and children, separated where appropriate into sections according to their HIV infection status.  \n\n【2】Epidemiology  \nOpportunist mycobacteria can be found throughout the environment and can be isolated from soil, water (including tap water), dust, milk, and various animals and birds. The significance of an isolate can only be established by considering the type of speci- men from which the Mycobacterium was isolated, the number of isolates, the degree ofgrowth, and the identity of the organism. In general, multiple isolates are needed from non- sterile sites to establish disease whereas one positive culture from a sterile site, particularly where there is supportive histopathology, is usually suYcient. The epidemiology may be complicated by the frequent isolation of opportunist mycobacteria from bronchoscopes and therefore from bronchial washings/lavages. The clinical presentation and any predisposing factors are also helpful. Patients with pre-existing lung disease or deficient immune systems seem more prone to these infections than those without such predisposing condi- tions. Good communication between the labo- ratory and clinician is essential. Additional specimens should be taken if unusual oppor- tunist mycobacteria are identified at sites that do not appear to fit the clinical picture. Clinicians should ensure that adequate speci-mens are sent and that the laboratory receives clear information regarding the site and type of specimen, the patient’s age and clinical details, including whether the patient is immunocom- promised.

The average diet provides substan-tial amounts of copper, typically 2-5 mg/day; therecommended intake is 0.mg/day. Most dietary copperends up being excreted. Copper is absorbed by entero-cytes mainly in the duodenum and proximal small intes-tine and transported in the portal circulation inassociation with albumin and the amino acid histidine tothe liver, where it is avidly removed from the circulation.The liver utilizes some copper for metabolic needs, syn-thesizes and secretes the copper-containing protein ceru-loplasmin, and excretes excess copper into bile.

Postpartum depression leads to increased costs of medical care, inappropriate medical care, child abuse and neglect, discontinuation of breastfeeding, and family dysfunction and adversely affects early brain development. Pediatric practices, as medical homes, can establish a system to implement postpartum depression screening and to identify and use community resources for the treatment and referral of the depressed mother and support for the mother-child (dyad) relationship. This system would have a positive effect on the health and well-being of the infant and family. State chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, working with state Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) and maternal and child health programs, can increase awareness of the need for perinatal depression screening in the obstetric and pedi- atric periodicity of care schedules and ensure payment. Pediatricians must advocate for workforce development for professionals who care for very young children and for promotion of evidence-based interven- tions focused on healthy attachment and parent-child relationships.

In the same report, the estimated five-year survival rate for patients with ovarian cancer  was 38% .This rate has not changed signifi-cantly over the past few decades despite significant advances in surgical techniques, chemotherapeutic options, and supportive care that have, however, improved the median survival.Standard management for patients with tumour clinically localized to the ovary(ies) includes com-prehensive surgical staging to guide subsequent need for further adjuvant treatment and to provide prognostic infor-mation. For patients with metastatic disease, numerous ret-rospective and prospective studies have shown that the extent of residual disease after radical surgical debulking is a significant predictor of both progression-free and overall survival.More recently, intraperitoneal chemotherapy has shown significant survival benefits over standard intrave-nous chemotherapy in metastatic disease that has been opti-mally debulked at time of initial surgical exploration,confirming the importance of aggressive surgical tumour resection at the time of initial diagnosis.  \n\n【2】A number of case series have shown that patients with ovar-ian cancer whose initial surgery is performed by gynaecologic oncologists are more likely to be appropriately staged and optimally debulked than those managed initially by general gynaecologists and general surgeons.  \n\n【3】Despite this, data from a large population-based study suggested that only approximately one third of patients with ovarian cancer were initially managed by gynaecologic oncologists.Likely this is secondary to human resource constraints as well as to the challenges facing physicians in diagnosing cancer preoperatively so appropriate referrals can be made.

This statement waspreceded by 2 articles, “The Electrocardiogram and ItsTechnology” and “Diagnostic Statements,” which were pub-lished previously,and it is followed by statements concern-ing abnormalities of repolarization, hypertrophy, and ische-mia/infarction. The rationale for this initiative and the processby which it was achieved were described earlier.  \n\n【2】   The term intraventricular conduction disturbances refersto abnormalities in the intraventricular propagation of su-praventricular impulses that give rise to changes in the shapeand/or duration of the QRS complex. These changes inintraventricular conduction may be fixed and present at allheart rates, or they may be intermittent and be tachycardia orbradycardia dependent. They may be caused by structuralabnormalities in the His-Purkinje conduction system or ven-tricular myocardium that result from necrosis, fibrosis, calci-fication, infiltrative lesions, or impaired vascular supply.Alternatively, they may be functional and due to the arrival ofa supraventricular impulse during the relative refractoryperiod in a portion of the conducting system, in which casethe term aberrant ventricular conduction is applied. Theymay also be due to abnormal atrioventricular connections,which bypass the atrioventricular node, resulting in ventric-ular preexcitation.  \nIn 1985, the electrocardiography (ECG) criteria for intra-ventricular conduction disturbances and ventricular preexci-tation were reviewed by an ad hoc working group establishedby the World Health Organization and the InternationalSociety and Federation of Cardiology.

At the time of preparation of these guidelines, there have been a further two laboratory-acquired cases of SARS and further community-acquired cases. These cases emphasise the potential for SARS to re-emerge and spread unpredictably. These guidelines document the hospital management of adults with probable or confirmed SARS. They are meant only as a brief summary for clinicians. These guidelines do not cover the management in the community of a Person Under Investigation.

Repeatability is the closeness of agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same item carried out, subject to all of the following conditions: same method, same observer, same instrument, same location, same condition of use, and repeated over a short space of time.

Thus, if a technician tests a subject several times, this is looking at the repeatability of the test. If the subject is then given a bronchodilator drug and tested again after 30 min, one needs to know the reproducibility of the test in order to make a decision on this comparison.

An adherent clot on a pepticulcer should be treated with endoscopy combined witha PPI if the clot cannot be removed. Routine repeatedendoscopy is not recommended. High-dose intravenousand oral PPIs are recommended but low-doseintravenous PPIs should be avoided. COX-2 selectivenon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined witha PPI are recommended for patients with very high risk ofUGIB. Aspirin should be resumed soon after stabilisationand clopidogrel alone is no safer than aspirin plus a PPI.When dual antiplatelet agents are used, prophylactic useof a PPI reduces the risk of adverse gastrointestinal  \nBACKGROUND  \nAlthough there is a general declining trend inthe incidence of peptic ulcer disease, non-varicealupper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) remainsa major prevalent and clinically significant conditionworld wide. Recent studies suggest that the inci-dence of NVUGIB ranges from 20 to 60 per 100 000population in North America and in Europe,e3withan increasing elderly population with comorbidillness.The Inter national Consensus Recommendationsonthe Management of Patients with Non-varicealUpper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (ICON-UGIB)published in 2010 was a collective wisdom of 34voters from 15 countries.  \nIt takes into account theupdated literature on the management of NVUGIB and draws up consensus guidelines based on the  \nmodifi ed Delphi process. It has five sectionsdnamely, 1. resuscitation, risk assessment andpre-endoscopy management; 2. endoscopic manage-ment; 3. pharm acological management; 4. non-phar macological and non-endoscopic in-hospitalmanagement; 5. postdischarge management,including the use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-in fl ammator y dr ugs (NSAIDs). Although theguidelines present comprehensive recommendationsand the latest update of the literature, they do notallow for the speci fi c needs of resource-limited countries anddifferences due to ethnicity. For example, the use of pre-endo -scopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment to down-stageendoscopic lesions and decrease the need for endoscopic inter-vention is considered in the ICON-UGIB. This causes fi nancialburden to resource-limited countries in the Asia-Pacific region.High-dose infusion of a PPI is recommended as an adjuvant toendoscopic treatment but, after considering all the studiesavailable, the ICON-UGIB did not reach a conclusion aboutthe ef fi cacy of either lower intravenous doses or high-dose oralPPI treatment. Further more, there are regional differences inHelicobacter pyloriinfection, metabolism of dru gs such as PPIs andantiplatelet agents, which may have implications for the management of NVUGIB.\n\n【1】**亚太地区非静脉曲张性上消化道出血的共识原文下载", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Introduction and background  \nSymptoms and signs of vulval skin disorders are common and include pruritus, pain and changes in skincolour and texture. Community-based surveys indicate that about one-fifth of women have significantvulval symptoms. In the hospital setting, common causes are dermatitis, lichen simplex, vulval candidiasis,lichen sclerosus and lichen planus. Lichen sclerosus accounts for at least 25% of the women seen indedicated vulval clinics, with estimates of incidence quoted as one in 300 to one in 1000 of all patientsreferred to dermatology departments.This guideline aims to provide an evidence-based framework forimproving the initial assessment and care of women with vulval disorders.This guidance is intended forthe general gynaecologist, with advice on when to refer to the specialist multidisciplinary team as themost efficient link to other services,such as a patch test clinic,psychosexual counsellors or reconstructivesurgeons.

These rights come with responsibilities however: in particular, toavoid passing infections on to others.  \nA number of key SRH issues for PLHA have been documented in the literature:There have been several outbreaks of infectious syphilis and gonorrhoea in HIV positiveMSM4 5as well as an outbreak of Lymphogranuloma venereum more recently.It is welldocumented that HIV progression and transmission is increased and facilitated by STIs.Some groups have questioned whether the availability of HAART has resulted in an increasein unsafe sexual behaviour in some men who have sex with men9.  \nMore positive women are choosing to have children10and an increasing number of coupleswho request fertility investigations and assisted conception. Couples that are either seroconcordant (both HIV positive) or sero discordant clearly require different clinicalmanagement strategiesIn recent years there has been a fall in the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance in theUK from 16% in 2002 to 9% in 200411. This still suggests that there is transmission thatoccurs from individuals taking HIV drug therapy who would therefore know of their infection,there is a need to develop health prevention messages and sexual health services forpositive people. It should be remembered however that most HIV transmission occurs incircumstances when individuals do not know their own status.

Leukotrienes are derived from cell membranes andreleased following activation of resident airway cells (mast cells) and infiltrating cells(eosinophils and neutrophils). They are involved in both early and late asthmatic airwayresponses to allergen challenge. Leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors and alsocause airway oedema, mucus secretion and recruitment of eosinophils into the airway.  \n\n【4】Leukotriene receptor antagonists bind to and inhibit specific receptors within the airway.Montelukast (Singulair) is the only LTRA registered in Australia for use in children aged2 and older. Montelukast is an orally active, specific LTRA that protectsagainst early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction response to allergen challenge, andagainst exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.  \n\n【5】**Diagnostic considerations in children**  \n\n【6】Asthma management in children should be based on a careful assessment of the clinicalpattern. Childhood asthma is classified as infrequent intermittent, frequent intermittent,mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent . This classificationis based mainly on clinical \\*\\*\\*rmation, but spirometry and peak expiratory flow (PEF)variability can provide useful additional \\*\\*\\*rmation in children older than 7 years. Theinitial assessment should be reviewed regularly.  \n\n【7】Intermittent asthma accounts for up to 95% of childhood asthma.Because episodesare usually triggered by a viral upper respiratory tract infection, the terms “intermittentasthma” and “virus-associated wheeze” or “viral-induced wheeze” are sometimes usedsynonymously in clinical literature.Montelukast is currently recommended as a treatmentoption for children with frequent intermittent asthma or mild persistent asthma.

This evidence-based clinical practiceguideline provides recommendations to primary care cli-nicians for the management of children from 2 monthsthrough 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitismedia （AOM）。  \n\n【1】    The American Academy of Pediatrics and AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians convened a committeecomposed of primary care physicians and experts in thefields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectiousdisease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agencyfor Healthcare Research and Quality and the SouthernCalifornia Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop acomprehensive review of the evidence-based literaturerelated to AOM. The resulting evidence report and othersources of data were used to formulate the practice guide-line recommendations. The focus of this practice guide-line is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment ofa child presenting with AOM.  \n\n【2】    The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM.It addresses pain management, initial observation versusantibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacte-rials, and preventive measures. Decisions were madebased on a systematic grading of the quality of evidenceand strength of recommendations, as well as expert con-sensus when definitive data were not available. The prac-tice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review be-fore formal approval by the partnering organizations.  \n\n【3】    This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a solesource of guidance in the management of children withAOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clini-cians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment orestablish a protocol for all children with this condition.These recommendations may not provide the only appro-priate approach to the management of this problem.    **《儿童急性中耳炎诊断治疗指南》内容预览**    a significant impact on the health of children, cost ofproviding care, and overall use of antibacterialagents. The illness also generates a significant socialburden and indirect cost due to time lost from schooland work. The estimated direct cost of AOM was$1.billion in 1995. In addition, the indirect costwas estimated to be $1.billion.During 1990 therewere almost 25 million visits made to office-basedphysicians in the United States for otitis media, with809 antibacterial presc\\*\\*tions per 1000 visits, for atotal of more than 20 million presc\\*\\*tions for otitismedia–related antibacterials. Although the totalnumber of office visits for otitis media decreased to16 million in 2000, the rate of antibacterial prescrib-ing was approximately the same 。  \n\n【4】    2–4An individual course ofantibacterial therapy can range in cost from $10 tomore than $100.There has been much discussion recently as to thenecessity for the use of antibacterial agents at thetime of diagnosis in children with uncomplicatedAOM. Although in the United States the use of an-tibacterial agents in the management of AOM hasbeen routine, in some countries in Europe it is com-mon practice to treat the symptoms of AOM initiallyand only institute antibacterial therapy if clinical im-provement does not occur. For the clinician, thechoice of a specific antibacterial agent has become akey aspect of management. Concerns about the ris-ing rates of antibacterial resistance and the growingcosts of antibacterial presc\\*\\*tions have focused theattention of the medical community and the generalpublic on the need for judicious use of antibacterialagents. Greater resistance among many of the patho-gens that cause AOM has fueled an increase in theuse of broader-spectrum and generally more expen-sive antibacterial agents  \n\n【5】   ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

In the management of cow’s milk allergy (CMA), both diagnosis and treatment would benefit from a reappraisal of the more recent literature, for “current” guidelines summarize the achievements of the preceding decade, deal mainly with prevention,do not always agree on recommendations and date back to the turn of the centu- ry.In 2008, the World Allergy Organization (WAO) Spe-cial Committee on Food Allergy identified CMA as an area in need of a rationale-based approach, informed by the consen-sus reached through an expert review of the available clinical evidence, to make inroads against a burdensome, world-wide public health problem. It is in this context that the WAO Diagnosis and Rationale for Action against Cow’s Milk Allergy (DRACMA) Guidelines was planned to provide phy-sicians everywhere with a management tool to deal with CMA from suspicion to treatment.

The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child’s age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive therapy. However, despite several important advances, the optimal strategy for ventilation and adjunctive therapies for patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome is still evolving.Evidence Acquisition To identify reports of invasive ventilatory and adjunctive thera-pies in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we performed a systematic English-language literature search of MEDLINE  using the Medical Subject Heading respiratory distress syndrome, adult, and related text words, with emphasis on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were similarly searched. The search yielded 1357 potential articles of which 53 were relevant to the study ob-jectives and considered in this review.  \n\n【2】Evidence Synthesis There is strong evidence to support the use of volume- and pressure-limited lung-protective ventilation in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The benefit of increased levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers is uncertain and is being further evalu-ated in ongoing trials. Existing randomized controlled trials of alternative ventilation modes, such as high-frequency oscillation and adjunctive therapies, including inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning demonstrate no significant survival advantage. How-ever, they may have a role as rescue therapy for patients with acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome with refractory life-threatening hypoxemia.

Attachment is a central component of social and emotional develop-ment in early childhood, and disordered attachment is defined by specific patterns of abnormal social behavior in the context of “pathogenic care.” Clinically relevant subtypes include an emotionally withdrawn/inhibited pattern and a socially indiscriminate/disinhibited pattern. As-sessment requires direct observation of the child in the context of his/her relationships with pri-mary caregivers. Treatment requires establishing an attachment relationship for the child when none exists and ameliorating disturbed attachment relationships with caregivers when they are evident.

There is little disagreement that PCOS should be considered a syndrome,, in which no single test is diagnostic. In essence, the whole (or global assessment) is greater than the sum of the individual features. However, establishing a clear, contemporaneous, and evidence-based definition for this syndrome has important clinical and investigational implications. Nonetheless, the definition of PCOS has continued to generate significant controversy .  \n    Clinically, diagnosing a woman as having PCOS implies an increased risk for infertility, dysfunctional bleeding, endometrial carcinoma, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,  dyslipidemia,hypertension, and possibly cardiovascular disease . Furthermore, it has important familial implications, principally, but not exclusively, for her sisters and daughters  \n. Finally, a diagnosis of PCOS may mandate life-long treatments,, and may negatively affect her ability to access health care coverage, rincipally in capitalistic markets. Consequently, the diagnosis of PCOS should not be assigned lightly, and diagnostic criteria should be based on robust data.  \n    A judicious definition of PCOS is also essential to guide current and future research. The inclusion of patients whose definition, characterization, and selection criteria are unclear  \ncontinues to plague the PCOS scientific literature. This issue is becoming critical as the field moves to the establishment of larger clinical trials and studies of the molecular biology  \nand genetic nature of the disorder. In addition, definitions not based on clear-cut evidence have the potential effect of discouraging future and needed research into the nature of  \nthe disorder, its breadth, and its phenotype.

Patients without known CVD who have an LDL lowerthan 130 mg/dL have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular events therefore levels of 100 – 129 mg/dl are considered near, but above optimal . At borderline high LDL-C levels, mg/dl,atherogenesis proceeds at a significant rate and accelerates as LDL-C increases, with a very high-risk at levels≥190 mg/dl. Low HDL-C is inversely associated with an increased risk for CVD. Although no threshold forlow HDL has been identified, an arbitrary value of <40 has been set as being low by the NCEP ATP-III ,and appears to be a reasonable set point. Elevated TG levels may be associated with increased risk for CVDand are commonly associated with other lipid and nonlipid risk factors. In persons with no CVD risk factorsTG levels are typically less than 100 mg/dl. Epidemiological studies suggest when TG levels are ≥ 200 mg/dl;the presence of increased quantities of atherogenic lipoproteins can heighten CVD risk beyond that predicted byLDL-C alone. However, there are no trials focusing on treatment of elevated triglycerides alone to loweradverse coronary events.   ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

This docu-ment combines and updates theoriginal transthoracic and transe-sophageal echocardiography ap-propriateness criteria publishedin 2007  and the originalstress echocardiography appro-priateness criteria published in2008 . This revision reflectsnew clinical data, reflectschanges in test utilization pat-terns, and clarifies echocardiog-raphy use where omissions orlack of clarity existed in the orig-inal criteria.The indications (clinical sce-narios) were derived from com-mon applications or anticipateduses, as well as from current clin-ical practice guidelines and re-sults of studies examining theimplementation of the originalappropriate use criteria (AUC).The 202 indications in this docu-ment were developed by a di-verse writing group and scoredby a separate independent tech-nical panel on a scale of 1 to 9,to designate appropriate use(median 7 to 9), uncertain use(median 4 to 6), and inappropri-ate use (median 1 to 3).Ninety-seven indications wererated as appropriate, wererated as uncertain, and 71 wererated as inappropriate. In general,the use of echocardiography forinitial diagnosis when there isa change in clinical status orwhen the results of the echocar-diogram are anticipated tochange patient managementwere rated appropriate. Routinetesting when there was nochange in clinical status or whenresults of testing were unlikelyto modify management weremore likely to be inappropriatethan appropriate/uncertain.The AUC for echocardiogra-phy have the potential to impactphysician decision making,healthcare delivery, and reim-bursement policy. Furthermore,recognition of uncertain clinicalscenarios facilitates identificationof areas that would benefit fromfuture research.  \nPREFACE  \n    \n   In an effort to respond to the need for the rational use of imaging ser-vices in the delivery of high-quality care, the ACCF has undertakena process to determine the appropriate use of cardiovascular imagingfor selected patient indications.AUC publications reflect an ongoing effort by the ACCF tocritically and systematically create, review, and categorize clinicalsituations where diagnostic tests and procedures are utilized byphysicians caring for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Theprocess is based on current understanding of the technical capa-bilities of the imaging modalities examined. Although impossibleto be entirely comprehensive given the wide diversity of clinicaldisease, the indications are meant to identify common scenariosencompassing the majority of situations encountered in contem-porary practice. Given the breadth of \\*\\*\\*rmation they convey,the indications do not directly correspond to the NinthRevision of the International Classification of Diseases systemas these codes do not include clinical \\*\\*\\*rmation, such as symp-tom status.  \nThe ACCF believes that careful blending of a broad range ofclinical experiences and available evidence-based \\*\\*\\*rmation willhelp guide a more efficient and equitable allocation of healthcareresources in cardiovascular imaging. The ultimate objective ofAUC is to improve patient care and health outcomes in a cost-ef-fective manner, but it is not intended to ignore ambiguity and nu-ance intrinsic to clinical decision making. AUC thus should not beconsidered substitutes for sound clinical judgment and practice ex-perience.  \n\n【2】   The ACCF AUC process itself is also evolving. In the currentiteration, technical panel members were asked to rate indicationsfor echocardiography in a manner independent and irrespectiveof the prior published ACCF ratings for transthoracic echocardi-ography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and stress echocardiography  as well as the prior ACCF ratingsfor diagnostic imaging modalities such as cardiac radionuclide im-aging (RNI)  and cardiac computed tomography (CT) .Given the iterative and evolving nature of the process, readersare counseled that comparison of individual appropriate use rat-ings among modalities rated at different times over the past sev-eral years may not reflect the comparative utility of thedifferent modalities for an indication, as the ratings may varyover time. A comparative evaluation of the appropriate use ofmultiple imaging techniques is currently being undertaken to as-sess the relative strengths of each modality for various clinical sce-narios.  \n\n【3】    We are grateful to the technical panel and its chair, Steven Bailey,MD, FACC, FSCAI, FAHA, a professional group with a wide rangeof skills and insights, for their thoughtful and thorough deliberationof the merits of echocardiography for various indications. We wouldalso like to thank the 27 individuals who provided a careful review ofthe draft of indications, the parent AUC Task Force ably led byMichael Wolk, MD, MACC, Rory Weiner, MD, and the ACC staff,John C.

Although the general approach may be applicable to children, the pedi-atric database is much smaller and there may be unantic-ipated differences between adults and children.

The primary signal measured in spirometry may be volume or flow.  \nSpirometry is invaluable as a screening test of general respiratory health in the same way that blood pressure provides important information about general cardiovascular health. However, on its own, spirometry does not lead clinicians directly to an aetiological diagnosis. Some indica-tions for spirometry are given in table 1.  \nIn this document, the most important aspects of spirometry are the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the volume delivered during an expiration made as forcefully and completely as possible starting from full inspiration, and the forced expira-tory volume (FEV) in one second, which is the volume delivered in the first second of an FVC manoeuvre. Other spirometric variables derived from the FVC manoeuvre are also addressed.  \nSpirometry can be undertaken with many different types of equipment, and requires cooperation between the subject and the examiner, and the results obtained will depend on technical as well as personal factors (fig. 1). If the variability of the results can be diminished and the measurement accuracy can be improved, the range of normal values for populations can be narrowed and abnormalities more easily detected. The Snowbird workshop held in 1979 resulted in the first American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement on the standardisation of spirometry . This was updated in 1987 and again in 1994 . A similar initiative was undertaken by the European Community for Steel and Coal, resulting in the first European standardisation document in 1983 . This was then updated in 1993 as the official statement of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) . There are generally only minor differences between the two most recent ATS and ERS statements, except that the ERS statement includes absolute lung volumes and the ATS does not.

A common language facilitates communication among different centers, allowing observations from different sources to be combined and thereby enhance our collective knowledge. As knowledge is gained, further details of a staging system can be defined, and thus the system requires periodic revision and refinement. In lung cancer, a major effort led by the Interna-tional Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging Committee was undertaken to inform a revision of the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system,involving an unprecedented extent of data collection and scientific analy-sis.  \n\n【2】This has prompted us to reflect on the goals of a staging system, the limitations of our current understanding of the biology of lung cancer, and how underlying concepts can help or hinder our ability to make new observations. Inherent in the development of the nomenclature of a staging system is the ability to define homogeneous patient cohorts. This raises the question of how homogeneity is defined. While many measures can be considered, the one most commonly used is prognosis. Indeed, this is the primary end point used in the analysis and staging recommendations of the IASLC staging committee.Another common ex-pectation of a staging system is to define patient cohorts for which the same treatment approach is appropriate.  \n\n【3】However, it must be recognized that prognosis and treatment approaches are not static. There is an incessant quest to define treatments that lead to better outcomes. More-over, prognosis is continually changing due to progress in aspects other than treatment. Advances in imaging affect the prognosis of stage groups through the resultant stage migra-tion.Changing methods of detection (, computed to-mography screening) also affect prognosis by altering the spectrum of disease that is encountered.

The guidelines were sent for comment to the Royal College of Radiologists, the British Thoracic Society, the British Society of Interventional Radiology, the Royal College of Pathologists, and the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons.  \n\n【2】Scheduled review of guidelines  \nAs methods of diagnosis and tissue sampling change and new evidence comes to light, the content and evidence base for these guidelines will be reviewed.  \n\n【3】TYPES OF LUNG BIOPSY  \nLung biopsies may be classified according to the method of access (percutaneously, bronchosco-pically, open operation) or by the reason for biopsy (sampling of diffuse lung disease or obtaining tissue from a mass when malignancy is suspected). Sometimes percutaneous biopsy is also defined by the tissue type obtained (cytolo-gical or histological). The indications for each will be discussed later.  \nFine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA, FNAB) gives cytological specimens and, although these needles tend to be of narrow bore, cutting needles (CNB) that produce histological speci-mens can also be of similar gauge. For that reason, lung biopsy in general is referred to as percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy (PTLB) in these guidelines.  \n\n【4】Percutaneous transthoracic lung biopsy  \nPTLB is performed with imaging guidance and most frequently by a radiologist. Usually the aim is to diagnose a defined mass. Imaging mod-alities are fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound. Ultrasound is useful only where the tissue mass is in contact with the chest wall since the ultrasound beam does not pass through air and, hence, the aerated lung. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) currently has a limited use because of expense, difficulty accessing the patient within the magnet, the relatively poor visualisation of lung lesions, and difficulties with ferromagnetic instruments within the magnetic field.

The 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that among pregnant women 15–44 years of age in the United States, 5.2% had used illicit drugs in the past month.  \n\n【2】The healthcare provider faced with a pregnant or recently post-partum woman with a history of current or past drug abuse and desiring to breastfeed often faces a significant challenge for multiple reasons. Substance-dependent women frequently engender behaviors or conditions that portend risk for the breastfed infant independently, in addition to the direct phar-macologic effect of the drug exposure. Polydrug use is the norm for this population, including the use of licit substances such as tobacco and alcohol. Illicit drugs are frequently cut with dangerous adulterants that can pose additional threats to the infant. Drug using populations are at higher risk for in-fections such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and=or hepatitis B=C, as well as poor nutrition. Psy-chiatric disorders that require pharmacotherapeutic inter-vention are more prevalent among this population, making breastfeeding a further confounded choice, as little informa-tion is available on the relative safety of breastfeeding with many psychotropic medications. Despite the myriad factors that may make breastfeeding a difficult choice for the drug-dependent woman, the population of drug-exposed infants, at high risk for an array of medical, psychological, and de-velopmental problems, as well as their mothers, stands to benefit significantly from this practice. Many of the above factors may pose risks to the infant, but the benefits of humanmilk and breastfeeding must be weighed against these risks.

Early physical recognition is dif-ﬁcult, so boys with developmental delay should be strongly considered for molecular testing. The characteristic adult phenotype usually does not develop until the second decade of life. Girls can also be affected with developmental delay. Because multiple family members can be affected with mental retardation and other conditions (premature ovarian failure and tremor/ataxia), family history information is of critical importance for the diagnosis and management of affected pa-tients and their families. This report summarizes issues for fragile Xsyndrome regarding clinical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, genetic counseling, related health problems, behavior management, and age-related health supervision guidelines.

The etiology, the relationshipbetween the extent of disease and the degree of symptoms, the effect on fertility, and the most appropriate treatmentof endometriosis remain incomplete. The purpose of this document is to present the evidence, including risks and benefits, for the effectiveness of medical and surgical therapy for adult women who are symptomatic with pelvic pain orinfertility or both. Treatment options for adolescents are discussed in other documents .  \nBackgroundIncidence  \nEndometriosis is a gynecologic condition that occursin 6–10% of women of reproductive age , with aprevalence of 38% (range, 20–50%) in infertile women, and in 71–87% of women with chronic pelvic pain. Contrary to much speculation, there are no data tosupport the view that the incidence of endometriosis isincreasing , although improved recognition of endometriotic lesions may have led to an increase in the rateof detection . There also appears to be no particularracial predisposition to endometriosis.  \nA familial association of endometriosis has beensuggested, and patients with an affected firstdegree relative have nearly a 7–10fold increased risk of developingendometriosis. There is a strong concordance inmonozygotic twins . The proposed inheritance is characteristic of a polygenicmultifactorial mechanism. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified .  \nEtiology  \nEndometriosis is a chronic gynecologic disorder whoseprincipal manifestations are chronic pain and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is complex but is stillthought to be principally associated with attachment andimplantation of endometrial glands and stroma on theperitoneum from retrograde menstruation. Other theories such as hematogenous or lymphatic transport, stemcells from bone marrow, and coelomic metaplasia mayexplain some clinical circumstances .The complex interaction between aberrant expression of endometrial genes as well as altered hormonalresponse will predispose patients to the developmentof endometrial lesions. Key components in thedevelopment of endometriosis are local overproductionof prostaglandins by an increase in cyclooxygenase2(COX2) activity and overproduction of local estrogenby increased aromatase activity. Progesterone resistancedampens the antiestrogenic effect of progesterone andamplifies the local estrogenic effect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

(refer to NHMRC Evidence Based Guide-line for Blood Glucose Control in Type 2 Diabetes at).  \nSystolic blood pressure (SBP) appears to be the best indicator of the risk of CKD in type 2 diabetes. However, an optimum and safest lower limit of SBP has not been clearly defined.  \nIn people with type 2 diabetes antihypertensive therapy with ARB or ACEi decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria, promotes regression to normoalbuminuria, and may reduce the risk of decline in renal function.  \nDue to potential renoprotective effects, the use of ACEi or ARB should be considered for the small sub- group of people with normal BP who have type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.  \n The extent to which interventions with lipid lowering therapy reduces the development of CKD in people with type 2 diabetes is unclear. As there is limited evidence relating to effects of lipid treatment on the progression of CKD in people with type 2 diabetes, blood lipid profiles should be managed in accordance with guidelines for pre-vention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  \n Lifestyle modification (diet and physical activity) is an integral component of diabetes care (refer to the NHMRC Evidence Based Guidelines for Blood Glucose Control in Type 2 Diabetes), however, there are insufficient studies of suitable quality to enable dietary recommendations to be made with respect to prevention and/or management of CKD in people with type 2 diabetes  ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Microcytosis and hypochromia are also present in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is often out of proportion to the level of anaemia compared with iron deﬁciency), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. Hb electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis is present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). The serum markers of iron deﬁciency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, and increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deﬁciency in the absence of inﬂammation (A). The cut-off concentration of ferritin that is diagnostic varies between 12 and 15 mg/l.This only holds for patients without coexistent inﬂammatory disease. Where there is inﬂammatory disease, a concentration of 50 mg/l or even more may still be consistent with iron deﬁciency.The sTfR concen-tration is said to be a good marker of iron deﬁciency in healthy subjects,but its utility in the clinical setting remains to be proven. Several studies have shown that the sTfR/log serum ferritin ratio provides superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.****  \n\n【2】    ****", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

OnlyEnglish-language publications were reviewed.The available evidence was evaluated using a uni-fied system called the Strength of RecommendationTaxonomy developed by editors of the US familymedicine and primary care journals (ie, AmericanFamily Physician, Family Medicine, Journal of FamilyPractice, and BMJ USA). This strategy was supported bya decision of the Clinical Guidelines Task Force in 2005with some minor modifications for a consistent ap-proach to rating the strength of the evidence ofscientific studies.Evidence was graded using a 3-point scale based on the quality of methodology asfollows:  \nI. Good-quality patient-oriented evidence.  \nII. Limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.  \nIII. Other evidence including consensus guidelines,opinion, or case studies.  \nClinical recommendations were developed on thebest available evidence tabled in the guideline.These are ranked as follows:  \nA.

Although a minimum bodysurface area, eg, 10%, has been traditionally used as aprerequisite to starting a systemic therapy for psori-asis, a subset of patients with limited disease havedebilitating symptoms. For example, although severepsoriasis of the palms and soles or severe scalppsoriasis affects less than 5% of the body surfacearea, the significant negative affect on the quality oflife of the patient makes a systemic approach totreatment appropriate.

Liver-related mortality is increased 9–10-fold  with cirrhosis an independent cause of death ranking 3rd vs. th in the general population . This has been conﬁrmed in pediatric series. Cardiovascular mortality is increased two fold in NASH patients .  \n\n【2】Liver transplantation. The proportion of patients with NASH among those undergoing liver transplantation has steadily increased over the recent past: from 0.1% between 1995 and 2000 to 3.5% in 2005 according to the UNOS database. Some of the patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis should be added to these: in one series one-third of these patients had histological signs of NASH on a detailed histological review of the graft . If half of the patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have burned-out NASH (based on histology and exposure to metabolic risk factors), then around 7% of liver transplants in the US are performed for NASH . Importantly, this is an underestimate of the proportion of NASH progressing towards end-stage liver disease, as many patients are no longer listed for liver transplantation because of older age and associated comorbidities (mainly obesity, compli-cations of diabetes, or malignancies).

The GDG noted that it would be the preference for these areas to have asimple marker of highrisk status, before they employ an ‘automated’ risk tool. Onesuch marker might, for example, be an eGFR of <30 ml/min/1.m2. However, theuse of such a cut-off before using risk assessment and preventative measures willmiss a proportion of patients who go on to develop CI-AKI . The GDG observationwas that the difficulties in this area should not be allowed to prevent the routine useof risk assessment for all patients due to have a contrast procedure. For a procedureusing iodinated contrast the risk of CI-AKI should always be assessed.  \n\n【2】The GDG felt it important to note as an introduction to their discussions that noscore had been successfully validated in patients with acute coronary syndrome orSTEMI and therefore caution should be taken when assessing risk in these patients(the Mehran score was derived from a mixed group of PCI patients, including about35% with acute coronary syndrome; the Maioli study was derived in patients withelective percutaneous coronary intervention). The GDG felt it was also important tonote that certain risk factors were modifiable and they felt that optimisation of apatient’s diabetic control, heart failure, renal function and fluidstatus should alwaysbe done before performing any elective procedure.  \n\n【3】The GDG felt that it was also important to highlight that people should not be deniedprocedures with contrast just because they were at risk of CI-AKI, but that theseprocedures should be undertaken after full and balanced consideration of the risksand benefits of the procedure. The GDG is aware that patients with CKD are beingunnecessarily denied contrast procedures because of concerns about CI-AKI. Theydrafted a consensus recommendation that emphasised discussion with the patientbecause the risk: benefit ratio is very specific to each individual situation and patientpreferences are particularly important here. The assessment of risk and theconsequent use of preventative measures may also vary depending on the urgencyof the procedure.The GDG noted that clinical judgment was required in assessing risk factors. The listof risk factors has not been given weighting (above), and the finding that a patienthas one of the risk factors (in isolation) on the list does not automatically make themhigh risk. For example, a patient aged over 75 years without other risk factors shouldnot be considered high risk. In risk scoring, the risk of any adverseevent typically rises dramatically the more risk factors a patient possesses. However,the evidence was such that the GDG was not in a position to state that any patientwith any two or more risk factors, for example, is high risk.

It may well represent the oldest form of liver injury known to humankind. Evidence suggests that fermented bever-ages existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (circa 10,B.C.),and liver disease related to it almost as long. Alcohol remains a major cause of liver disease world-wide. It is common for patients with ALD to share risk factors for simultaneous injury from other liver insults (, coexisting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or chronic viral hepatitis). Many of the natural history stud-ies of ALD, and even treatment trials, were performed before these other liver diseases were recognized, or spe-ciﬁc testing was possible. Thus, the individual effect of alcohol in some of these studies may have been con-founded by the presence of these additional injuries. De-spite this limitation, the data regarding ALD are robust enough to draw conclusions about the pathophysiology of this disease. Possible factors that affect the development of liver injury include the dose, duration, and type of alcohol consumption; drinking patterns; sex; ethnicity; and asso-ciated risk factors including obesity, iron overload, con-comitant infection with viral hepatitis, and genetic factors.  \n\n【2】Geographic variability exists in the patterns of alcohol intake throughout the world.Approximately two-thirds of adult Americans drink some alcohol.The majority drink small or moderate amounts and do so without evi-dence of clinical disease.A subgroup of drinkers, how-ever, drink excessively, develop physical tolerance and withdrawal, and are diagnosed with alcohol depen-dence.A second subset, alcohol abusers and problem drinkers, are those who engage in harmful use of alcohol, deﬁned by the development of negative social and health consequences of drinking (, unemployment, loss of family, organ damage, accidental injury, or death).

Establishing adiagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism iscentral to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausalwomen.  \n\n【4】    Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disordersandriskfactors for endometrial cancer,mooddisorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes,andcardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalitiesand hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility;metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities,but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility.  \n\n【5】    Hormonal contraceptivesand metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weightloss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable riskbenefitratio overall, and statins require further study.  \n\n【6】     We suggest that the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) be made if two of the three following criteriaare met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, orpolycystic ovaries (PCO) , whereas disordersthat mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded.These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia,and nonclassic congenital adrenalhyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum17-hydroxyprogesterone \\[17-OHP\\]) .  \n\n【7】    In selectwomen with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes,we suggest more extensive evaluation excludingother causes  .Diagnosis in adolescentsWe suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS in an adolescentgirl be made based on the presence of clinicaland/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (afterexclusion of other pathologies) in the presence of persistentoligomenorrhea.  \n\n【8】    Anovulatory symptoms and PCOmorphology are not sufficient to make a diagnosis in adolescents,as they may be evident in normal stages in reproductivematuration Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause1.Although there are currently no diagnostic criteriafor PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, wesuggest that a presumptive diagnosis ofPCOScan be basedupon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrheaand hyperandrogenism during the reproductiveyears.

In most women withHIV, the infection is diagnosed during their reproductiveyears.  \nAntiretroviral Therapy for NonpregnantHIVinfected Women  \nTreatment of HIV and AIDS should be provided bya health care practitioner with expertise in HIV. Suchexpertise has been shown to be a factor that prolongs thelife of HIVinfected individuals . A team approach is optimal to address both the medical and socialcomplexity of HIV infection. In addition to obtaining acomprehensive medical history, including a gynecologichistory and an HIVrelated history, a detailed social history also should be obtained. Women with HIV oftenhave life circumstances, such as alcohol or drug addiction, psychiatric illness, and domestic violence, that requirespecial attention. Appropriate sensitivity is needed toaddress these life circumstances and to treat HIV.In nonpregnant adults, initiation of antiretroviraltherapy is recommended for patients with a history of anAIDSdefining illness (Box 1) or a CD4 Tcell (or CD4)count of less than 500 cells per cubic millimeter. Forpatients with CD4 counts of 500 cells per cubic millimeter or greater, antiretroviral therapy may be offered.Antiretroviral medications select for resistant mutationswhen used as monotherapy; therefore, combinations ofthree or more drugs, often called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), are used and strict adherence tothe dose regimens is critical.

Urine outputabove 6,ml is designated polyuric .\n\n【1】　　Causes of renal failure are conventionally separated intothree categories: prerenal,  intrarenal, and postrenal.Hypoperfusion is the cause of prerenal failure (fluid loss,fluid sequestration, low cardiac output, renal arterystenosis \\[RAS\\]). Causes of intrarenal failure include acutetubular necrosis (ATN) and  interstitial, glomerular, orsmall–vessel disease. Obstruction is the usual postrenalcause of failure (also, distal renal tubular obstruction).Distinction between acute renal failure (ARF) and chronicrenal failure (CRF) can often be made clinically .However, many patients are first seen with markedlyelevated serum creatinine of unknown duration, so thatclassification into ARF or CRF is not possible.\n\n【2】　　There are significant limitations in using serum creatinineas an accurate measure of renal function, includingdecreased muscle mass and poor nutritional status .Creatinine clearance measures the ability of theglomerulus to filter creatinine from the plasma andapproximates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR); there isa reasonable correlation between the 2-hour and 24-hourcreatinine clearance ( r=0.85), but the error in calculationmay vary from 10%-27%. Creatinine clearance of lessthan 60 ml/min may be termed renal insufficiency; lessthan 30 ml/min is renal failure. End-stage renal disease(ESRD) implies CRF of a degree (ie, GFR <10-12ml/min) such that life cannot  be sustained long-termwithout dialysis. In ARF,  the creatinine clearance isusually less than 25 ml/min. Unfortunately, creatinineclearance is often not helpful when the creatinine value ischanging.\n\n【3】　　ARF can be broadly defined as a sudden decrease in renalfunction resulting in azotemia. It can develop in thesetting of pre-existing renal insufficiency or can developin a patient with previously normal kidneys . In apatient with previously undiagnosed renal failure, initialevaluation of renal size by gray-scale ultrasonography(US) is most helpful. If the kidneys are small andechogenic, the process of long-standing evaluation by UShelps to identify a correctable  cause of renal failure suchas obstruction. If hydronephrosis is present, retrograde orantegrade relief of the obstruction is usually undertaken.If no hydronephrosis is evident and the patient does nothave hypertension or other history to suggest RAS,further workup of small, echogenic kidneys   is notwarranted. Conversely, if the kidneys are of normal sizewith or without increased echogenicity, this may representreversible renal failure, most often ARF, and a moreextensive evaluation is initiated. It should be noted that,as with all modalities and procedures, the yield of gray-scale sonography in the detection of hydronephrosis islow among patients without a high pretest probability for urinary obstruction (eg, flank pain, urolithiasis, pelvicmasses, etc), and, therefore is of little value in patientmanagement . Scintigraphy with a tubular secretionagent (eg, MAG-3) can help assess the level of renalfunction as well as the potential reversibility of theprocess causing the renal failur e. Therefore, in addition tothe history, physical examina tion, and laboratory analysisof serum and urine, US and radionuclide scintigraphy areimaging tools that are used early in the evaluation of thepatient with previously undiagnosed renal failure.

Atthat time, most cases of pneumothorax weresecondary to tuberculosis, although some wererecognised as occurring in otherwise healthypatients (‘pneumothorax simple’). This classi?ca-tion has endured subsequently, with the ?rstmodern desc\\*\\*tion of pneumothorax occurring inhealthy people (primary spontaneous pneumo-thorax, PSP) being that of Kj?rgaard2in 1932. It isa signi?cant global health problem, with a reportedincidence of 18e28/100 000 cases per annum formen and 1.e6/100 000 for women.  \n\n【3】Secondary pneumothorax (SSP) is associatedwith underlying lung disease, in distinction to PSP,although tuberculosis is no longer the commonestunderlying lung disease in the developed world. Theconsequences of a pneumothorax in patients withpre-existing lung disease are signi?cantly greater,and the management is potentially more dif?cult.Combined hospital admission rates for PSP and SSPin the UK have been reported as 16.7/100 000 formen and 5.8/100 000 for women, with corre-sponding mortality rates of 1.26/million and 0.62/million per annum between 1991 and 1995.  \n\n【4】With regard to the aetiology of pneumothorax,anatomical abnormalities have been demonstrated,even in the absence of overt underlying lungdisease. Subpleural blebs and bullae are found at thelung apices at thoracoscopy and on CT scanning inup to 90% of cases of PSP,and are thought toplay a role. More recent auto?uorescence studies7have revealed pleural porosities in adjacent areasthat were invisible with white light. Small airwaysobstruction, mediated by an in?ux of in?ammatorycells, often characterises pneumothorax and maybecome manifest in the smaller airways at an earlierstage with ‘emphysema-like changes’ (ELCs).Smoking has been implicated in this aetiologicalpathway, the smoking habit being associated witha 12% risk of developing pneumothorax in healthysmoking men compared with 0.1% in non-smokers.  \n\n【5】Patients with PSP tend to be taller thancontrol patients.The gradient of negativepleural pressure increases from the lung base to theapex, so that alveoli at the lung apex in tall indi-viduals are subject to signi?cantly greaterdistending pressure than those at the base of thelung, and the vectors in theory predispose to thedevelopment of apical subpleural blebs.

Yet, it often remains unrecognizedand undiagnosed until or after late preschool age because appropriate tools for routine developmental screening andscreening specifically for autism have not been available.

This clinical practice guideline, intendedfor use by primary care clinicians, provides recommen-dations for the diagnosis and management of obstructivesleep apnea syndrome （OSAS）。The Section on Pediatric Pulmonology of the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics selected a subcommittee com-posed of pediatricians and other experts in the fields ofpulmonology and otolaryngology as well as experts fromepidemiology and pediatric practice to develop an evi-dence base of literature on this topic. The resulting evi-dence report was used to formulate recommendations forthe diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS.  \n\n【2】    The guideline contains the following recommenda-tions for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1） all children should bescreened for snoring; 2） complex high-risk patientsshould be referred to a specialist; 3） patients with cardio-respiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4）diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating be-tween primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standardbeing polysomnography; 5） adenotonsillectomy is thefirst line of treatment for most children, and continuouspositive airway pressure is an option for those who arenot candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery;6） high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatientspostoperatively; 7） patients should be reevaluated post-operatively to determine whether additional treatment isrequired.  \n\n【3】    **《儿童阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征诊断治疗指南》内容预览**  \n\n【4】    DEFINITION  \n\n【5】    OSAS in children is a “disorder of breathing dur-ing sleep characterized by prolonged partial upperairway obstruction and/or intermittent complete ob-struction （obstructive apnea） that disrupts normalventilation during sleep and normal sleep patterns.”2Symptoms include habitual （nightly） snoring （oftenwith intermittent pauses, snorts, or gasps）， disturbedsleep, and daytime neurobehavioral problems. Day-time sleepiness may occur but is uncommon inyoung children. Complications include neurocogni-tive impairment, behavioral problems, failure tothrive, and cor pulmonale, particularly in severecases. Risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertro-phy, obesity, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromus-cular disorders. Only the first 2 risk factors are dis-cussed in this guideline.OSAS needs to be distinguished from primarysnoring （PS）， which is defined as snoring withoutobstructive apnea, frequent arousals from sleep, orgas exchange abnormalities.Although PS is usuallyconsidered benign, this has not been well evaluated,because most studies of snoring children did notdiscriminate between PS and OSAS.  \n\n【6】    PREVALENCE  \n\n【7】    OSAS occurs in children of all ages, from neonatesto adolescents. It is thought to be most common inpreschool-aged children, which is the age when thetonsils and adenoids are the largest in relation to theunderlying airway size.Three studies have evalu-ated the prevalence of childhood OSAS. These stud-ies did not use conventional polysomnography, used\\*\\* rather than pediatric polysomnographic crite-ria, or studied only a selected high-risk sample of thepopulation; thus, a definitive epidemiologic studyhas not yet been performed. Despite these limita-tions, the 3 studies showed similar prevalence ratesof approximately 2%.In contrast, PS is more com-mon; habitual snoring occurs in 3% to 12% of pre-school-aged children.Thus, the clinician needsa method to distinguish OSAS from PS. OSAS occursequally among boys and girls.One study indicatedthat the prevalence is higher among African Ameri-can individuals than among white individuals.7  \n\n【8】   ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Rather  than employing an MI definition sensitive for small degrees of myonecrosis （the occurrence of which, based on contemporary large-scale studies, are unlikely to have important clinical consequences）， it is instead recommended that a threshold level of biomarker elevation which has been strongly linked to subsequent adverse events in clinical studies be used to define a “clinically relevant MI.” The present document introduces a new definition for “clinically relevant MI” after coronary revascularization", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Nevertheless, outcome for patients with SAH remains poor, with population-based mortality rates as high as 45% and significant morbidity among survivors.Several multicenter, prospective, randomized trials and prospective cohort analyses have influenced treatment protocols for SAH. However, rapid evolution of newer treatment modalities, as well as other practical and ethical considerations, has meant that rigorous clinical scientific assessment of the treatment protocols has not been feasible in several important areas. To address these issues, the Stroke Council of the AHA formed a writing group to reevaluate the recommendations for management of aneurysmal SAH. A consensus committee reviewed existing data in this field and prepared the recom-mendations in 1994.In an effort to update those recommen-dations, a systematic literature review was conducted based on a search of MEDLINE to identify all relevant randomized clinical trials published between June 30, and Novem- ber 1, 2006 (search terms: subarachnoid hemorrhage, cere- bral aneurysm, trial; Table 1). Each identified article was reviewed by at least 2 members of the writing group. Selected articles had to meet one of the following criteria to be included: randomized trial or nonrandomized concurrent cohort study. Case series and nonrandomized historical co- hort studies were reviewed if no studies with a higher level of evidence were available for a particular topic covered in the initial guidelines. These were chosen on the basis of sample size and the relevance of the particular studies to subjects that were covered in the initial guidelines. The committee’s recommendations were made by applying the standard AHA evidence rating scheme . These recom-mendations are intended to summarize the best available evidence for treatment of patients with aneurysmal SAH and to identify areas of future research.

A working model for its pathogenesis postulates that environmental triggers, a failure of immune tolerance mechanisms, and a genetic predisposition collaborate to induce a T cell–mediated immune attack upon liver antigens, leading to a progressive necroinflammatory and fibrotic process in the liver.  \nOnset is frequently insidious with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue,jaundice, nausea, abdominal pain, and arthralgias atpresentation,but the clinical spectrum is wide, rang-ing from an asymptomatic presentationto an acutesevere disease.  \nThe diagnosis is based on histologic abnormalities, characteristic clinical and laboratory findings, abnormal levels of serum globulins, and the presence of one or more characteristic autoantibod-ies.  \nWomen are affected more frequently than men (sex ratio, 3.6:1).and the disease is seen in all ethnic groups and at all ages.There are no robust epidemiological data on AIH in the United States. In Norway and Sweden, the mean incidence is 1 to 2 per 100,persons per year, and its point prevalence is 11 to 17 per 100,persons per year.A similar incidence and prevalence can beassumed for the Caucasian population of North America.  \nData on the natural progression of untreated disease are derived principally from experiences published prior to the widespread use of immunosuppressive agents for AIH and before the detection of the hepati-tis C virus (HCV).  \nThese studies showed that as many as 40% of patients with untreated severe disease died within 6 months of diagnosis,and that survi-vors frequently developed cirrhosis, esophageal varicesand subsequent hemorrhage.  \nAn acute onsetof illness is common ,and an acute severe presentation, characterized by hepatic encephalopathywithin 8 weeks of clinical symptoms, is sometimesseen.  \nThree randomized, controlled treatment trials estab-lished that prednisone alone or in combination withazathioprine improved symptoms, laboratory tests, his-tological findings, and immediate survival.  \nThesestudies led to the acceptance of immunosuppressiveregimens as the standard in treatment, and supportedan autoimmune pathogenesis of the disease. However,these studies were completed decades ago before thediscovery of HCV. Therefore, HCV infection couldnot be excluded in these studies and one can assumethat several of these patients were indeed infected withHCV.

During the past decade, the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has also increased dramatically, accom-panied by further emphasis on dieting and weight loss among children and adolescents.  \nThe epidemiology of eating disorders has gradually changed; there is an increasing prevalence of eating disorders in males and minority populations in the United States as well as in countries in which eating disorders had not been commonly seen.Of particular con-cern is the increasing prevalence of eating disorders at progressively younger ages.

Unlike alco-holic steatohepatitis (ASH), NASH often is asso-ciated with overnutrition and insulin resistance. Therefore recommendations given for ASH cannot easily be applied to NASH despite remarkable similarities. Nutritional recommendations for NASH patients focus on the underlying disease (metabolic syndrome, other secondary causes).  \n1.1. Does nutritional status influence outcome in ASH? Which is the best widely applicable method to assess nutritional status?  \nThe prognostic value of nutritional status in patients with alcoholic hepatitis has been demonstrated (III). Simple bedside methods such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) or anthropometry are considered adequate for identifying patients at risk (C).  \nComment: Several publications from the American Veteran Affairs (VA) study report a higher rate of complications and mortality in undernourished ASH patients.In order to identify undernutrition, a scoring system consisting of variables such as actual/ideal weight, anthropometry, creatinine index, visceral proteins, absolute lymphocyte count, delayed type skin reaction was used in these studies. This composite scoring system includes unreliable variables such as plasma concentrations of visceral proteins or 24-h urine creatinine excre-tion and has been modified repeatedly, the most recent publication of the series also reported a prognostic significance of the variables absolute CD8+count and hand g\\*\\* strength.  \nMoreover, a clear association between low intake of normal food and high mortality was found.

All applicable articles from July 2005 until March 2012 were identified, evaluated, and combined with the previous analysis  to provide a comprehensive update.\n\n【2】    The prior analysis methodology was utilized with three modifications:  the detectable noninferiority boundary approach was dropped and both failed superiority studies and prespecified noninferiority studies were analyzed using a noninferiority approach,  the definition of an adequate comparator was clarified and now includes an absolute minimum point estimate for efficacy/effectiveness, and  the relationship table between clinical trial ratings, level of evidence, and conclusions no longer includes a recommendation column to reinforce that this review of efficacy/evidence for specific seizure types does not imply treatment recommendations.  \n    This evidence review contains one clarification: The commission has determined that class I superiority studies can be designed to detect up to a 20% absolute (rather than relative) difference in the point estimate of efficacy/effectiveness between study treatment and comparator using an intent-to-treat analysis. Since July, three class I randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 11 class III RCTs have been published. The combined analysis  now includes a total of 64 RCTs  and 11 meta-analyses.  \n    New efficacy/effectiveness findings include the following: levetiracetam and zonisamide have level A evidence in adults with partial onset seizures and both ethosuximide and valproic acid have level A evidence in children with childhood absence epilepsy.  \n    There are no major changes in the level of evidence for any other subgroup. Levetiracetam and zonisamide join carbamazepine and phenytoin with level A efficacy/effectiveness evidence as initial monotherapy for adults with partial onset seizures. Although ethosuximide and valproic acid now have level A efficacy/effectiveness evidence as initial monotherapy for children with absence seizures, there continues to be an alarming lack of well designed, properly conducted epilepsy RCTs for patients with generalized seizures/epilepsies and in children in general.  \n    These findings reinforce the need for multicenter, multinational efforts to design, conduct, and analyze future clinically relevant adequately designed RCTs.

These includeparathyroid hormone (PTH), hydroxyvitamin D D),dihydroxyvitamin D 2 Dis impaired, reducing intestinal calcium absorption andincreasing PTH. The kidney fails to respond adequately toPTH, which normally promotes phosphaturia and calciumreabsorption, or to FGF23, which also enhances phosphateexcretion. In addition, there is evidence at the tissue level of adownregulation of vitamin D receptor and of resistance tothe actions of PTH. Therapy is generally focused oncorrecting biochemical and hormonal abnormalities in aneffort to limit their consequences.  \n\n【2】The mineral and endocrine functions disrupted in CKDare critically important in the regulation of both initial boneformation during growth (bone modeling) and bonestructure and function during adulthood (bone remodeling).As a result, bone abnormalities are found almost universallyin patients with CKD requiring dialysis (stage 5D), and in themajority of patients with CKD stages 3–5. More recently,there has been an increasing concern of extraskeletalcalcification that may result from the deranged mineral andbone metabolism of CKD and from the therapies used tocorrect these abnormalities.  \n\n【3】Numerous cohort studies have shown associations betweendisorders of mineral metabolism and fractures, cardiovasculardisease, and mortality. These observationalstudies have broadened the focus of CKD related mineral andbone disorders (MBDs) to include cardiovascular disease(which is the leading cause of death in patients at all stages ofCKD).

The goal is todescribe a number of generally accepted approaches for diagno-sis, prevention, and treatment of Wilson’s disease. Recommenda-tions are based on a systematic literature review in the Medline(PubMed version), Embase (Dialog version), and the CochraneLibrary databases using entries from 1966 to 2011.

Wilson’s dis-ease is an inherited disorder in which defective biliary excretionof copper leads to its accumulation, particularly in liver and brain. Wilson’s disease is due to mutations of the ATP7B gene onchromosome 13 , which encodes a copper-transportingP-type ATPase (ATP7B) residing in the trans-Golgi network ofhepatocytes. ATP7B is responsible for transporting copper fromintracellular chaperone proteins into the secretory pathway, bothfor excretion into bile and for incorporation into apo-ceruloplas-min for the synthesis of functional ceruloplasmin . Thedevelopment of Wilson’s disease is due to the accumulation ofcopper in affected tissues.  \nClinical presentation can vary widely, but the key features ofWilson’s disease are liver disease and cirrhosis, neuropsychiatricdisturbances, Kayser–Fleischer rings in Des?emet’s membrane ofthe cornea, and acute episodes of hemolysis often in associationwith acute liver failure. Wilson’s disease is not just a disease ofchildren and young \\*\\*s, but may present at any age .Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder that is found worldwide.  \nWilson’s disease is recognized to be more common than previ-ously thought, with a gene frequency of 1 in 90–150 and an inci-dence (based on \\*\\*s presenting with neurologic symptoms) that may be as high as 1 in 30,000 .

Traditionally ‘acute renal failure’ was regarded as a less common organfailure, with patients typically requiring dialysis and managed by nephrologists. This view has nowbeen overturned. AKI encompasses a wide spectrum of injury to the kidneys, not just ‘kidney failure’.It is a common problem amongst hospitalised patients, in particular the elderly population whosenumbers are increasing as people live longer. Such patients are usually under the care of doctorspracticing in specialties other than nephrology. For normal function the kidneys require a competentcirculation. Conversely, it is known that renal function is vulnerable to even relative or quite modesthypotension or hypovolaemia. Hence AKI is a feature of many severe illnesses. Although theseillnesses may affect many organs, the simple process of monitoring urine output and/or creatininepermits detection of AKI.\n\n【1】The definition of AKI has been evolving in recent years. There is a need for a standardised definitionof AKI that can be applied in a pragmatic fashion in routine clinical practice, research, audit andhealthcare education. With current technology most AKI diagnosis is based on monitoring of serumor plasma creatinine levels, with or without urine output measurement. These methods areimperfect, and there is no ‘gold standard’ for the diagnosis of AKI. Work on AKI has been hamperedby multiple definitions. In 2004 the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group14published theirconsensus definition of AKI, known as the RIFLE definition. More recently small rises in creatininehave been recognised as being independently associated with increased mortality. In 2007, the AKINetwork (AKIN)84published their AKI definition, an evolution of the RIFLE definition. The recentInternational Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines67proposed a merger ofRIFLE and AKIN, with some simplification.\n\n【2】In developed countries AKI is seen in 13-18% of all people admitted to hospital.The frequencyof AKI amongst inpatients means that it has a major patient and economic impact. According to NHSKidney Care, the costs of AKI to the NHS (excluding AKI in the community) are estimated to bebetween ￡434 million - ￡620 million per year which is more than expenditure on breast cancer, orlung and skin cancer combined.It also remains the case that AKI is seen increasingly in primarycare in the absence of any acute illness and there is a need to ensure that awareness of the conditionis raised amongst primary care health professionals and that any identified cases of AKI are managedor referred appropriately", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

It may also be normal when asthma is quiescent.The commonest abnormality is a reduction in forced ex-piratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow(PEF). The ratio of FEV1to forced vital capacity (FVC) tobelow 70% is characteristic of obstructive airways disease.The degree of reduction is generally related to severity ofthe asthma. Asthma improvement is usually mirrored by animprovement in FEV1and PEF.  \nSignificant reversibility of the airway obstruction is themajor physiological characteristic of asthma. The stan-dardised criteria are an increase in FEV1of >12% and200 ml, min following the inhalation of 200-400 μg ofsalbutamol, or a 20% improvement in PEF from baseline.It should be noted, however, that many asthma patientswill not exhibit reversibility at each assessment, particularlythose on treatment, and thus the test lacks sensitivity andrepeated testing at different visits is advised.  \nConversely, asthma can also be confirmed by demonstrat-ing increased hyperresponsiveness to bronchoconstrictorstimuli, particularly in subjects with normal spirometry.

Presence of extrahepatic diseases has to be recorded. A thorough occupational and drug history is imperative and any med-ications taken within 6 weeks of presentation may be incriminated (and discontinued); this includes herbal medicines, vitamins and other substances. A history of fever, especially when accompanied by rigors or right upper quadrant abdominal pain is suggestive of cholangi-tis due to obstructive diseases (particularly choledocholi-thiasis), but may be seen in alcoholic disease and rarely, viral hepatitis. A history of prior biliary surgery also increases the likelihood that biliary obstruction is present. Finally, a family history of cholestatic liver disease sug-gests a possibility of a hereditary disorder. Some chole-static disorders are observed only under certain circumstances (, pregnancy, childhood, liver trans-plantation, HIV-infection), and may require speciﬁc investigations that are not relevant in other populations.  \n\n【2】Abdominal ultrasonography is usually the ﬁrst step to exclude dilated intra- and extrahepatic ducts and mass lesions because it is rather sensitive and speciﬁc, non-invasive, portable and relatively inexpensive. Its disadvantages are that its ﬁndings are operator-depen-dent and abnormalities of bile ducts such as those observed in sclerosing cholangitis may be missed. Fur-thermore, the lower common bile duct and pancreas are usually not well depicted. Computed tomography of the abdomen is less interpreter-dependent, but is asso-ciated with radiation exposure and may be not as good as ultrasound at delineating the biliary tree.  \n\n【3】If bile duct abnormalities are present, further work-up depends on the presumed cause. From a purely diagnostic perspective, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra-phy (MRCP) is a safe option to explore the biliary tree. Its accuracy for detecting biliary tract obstruction approa-ches that of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatog-raphy (ERCP) when performed in experienced centres with state-of-the-art technology. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is equivalent to MRCP in the detection of bile duct stones and lesions causing extrahepatic obstruction and may be preferred to MRCP in endoscopic units.

Unfortunately, there has often been a period of several years between the onset of symptoms from occupational asthma and diagnosis.  \n\n【2】Potential reasons for delay in diagnosis include workers’ lack of awareness of work-related asthma and of the association between their symp- toms and workplace exposures. This is especially likely when the sensitiser is a low molecular weight (chemical) sensiti- ser which may cause isolated late asth- matic responses occurring several hours after exposure. Symptoms may then be worst after leaving a work shift or during sleep after work. Even if they do recognise a work association, workers may be afraid to report this to their physician for fear of losing their job or transfer to a lower paid job (especially if working in a small company and/or without support from a union). Also, when seen by a healthcare worker, they may not be asked about the job and work-relatedness of symptoms. In a North American study of barriers to diagnosis of occupational asthma,the median time to suspicion by the physician of the diagnosis was 2 years and to final diagnosis was 4 years. Most patients reported that they only saw a physician when symptoms worsened or became unbearable, and only a minority had been aware of an agent at work potentially causing asthma. Only 57% of primary care physicians surveyed in Ontario, Canada reported always or usually taking a history of workplace exposures, citing time constraints as the most frequent reason for not doing this.In this and an earlier survey of members of the American College of Chest Physicians,a high proportion of physicians recognised the need for further education in occupational lung diseases  ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Approximately 55 000 people worldwide, nearly half of whom are children, die annually of rabies. Rabies is caused by RNA viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus lyssavirus. In the Americas, only type 1 lyssavirus (rabies virus) circulates and is common in wild animals, particularly bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, and skunks, in the United States. Virus is transmitted in the saliva of rabid mammals after a bite or through contamination of an open wound or mucous mem-brane. The incubation period  is long enough to render immunization a highly effective strategy for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Approximately 20 000 to 30 000 persons receive PEP in the United States each year, and 1 to 3 cases of human rabies occurs annually.  \nBetween 2000 and 2007, of 25 cases of human rabies reported in the United States were acquired within the United States. Among the 20 indigenously acquired cases, were associated with bat rabies virus variants.  \nIn the United States, animal rabies is common. Education of children to avoid contact with stray or wild animals is of primary importance. PEP is indicated once an exposure has occurred. PEP has never failed in the United States since the introduction of modern cell-derived vaccines in the 1970s. Keys to effective PEP have included prompt washing of the wound with copious amounts of soap and water, inﬁltration of human rabies immunoglobulin into and around the wound, and a 5-dose schedule of intramuscular vaccine administered over 28 days.

The increasingprevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), continuedadvances in surgical and percutaneous techniques for revas-cularization and concomitant medical therapy for CAD,and the costs of revascularization have resulted in height-ened interest regarding the appropriate use of coronaryrevascularization. Clinicians, payers, and patients are inter-ested in the specific benefits of revascularization. Inappro-priate revascularization may be harmful to patients andgenerate unwarranted costs to the healthcare system,whereas appropriate revascularization procedures can im-prove patients’ clinical outcomes.  \n    \n    As in the original AUC document, the same classificationscheme with ratings of appropriate, uncertain, and inappro-priate was used. The uncertain category can cause confusionin the interpretation of the AUC and can imply severalmeanings within its definition. First, the rating of uncertainis used when pertinent literature is either not available orwhen true discrepancies exist. Second, it is impossible toinclude every relevant piece of clinical \\*\\*\\*rmation (, age,sex, diabetes) in the individual clinical scenarios. Attempt-ing to do that may result in an unmanageable number ofclinical scenarios and thus compromise the usefulness of theAUC in daily practice. The practice of medicine is full ofuncertainties that require a thoughtful clinician to use his orher best judgment about each patient to reach decisionsabout management. Therefore, a rating of uncertain may beassigned by members of the technical panel if clinical\\*\\*\\*rmation not provided might affect their individualrating, causing a shift into either the appropriate or inap-propriate category.  \n    \n    A rating of uncertain means simply what the nameimplies, and depending on additional factors, it can beappropriate or inappropriate to perform revascularization.The writing group emphasizes that uncertain indications arenot inappropriate. Rather, they reflect clinical scenarios thatare reasonable for performing revascularization, but addi-tional clinical factors should be considered or further re-search is needed to more definitively define the benefits oftreatment for patients.  \n\n【2】    ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause ofchildhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, emergencydepartment visits, and hospitalions1. During the past two decades, many scienti?c advanceshave improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively.However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-speci?c. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation, the main pathologichallmarks of the condition, can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in thediagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only desc\\*\\*tive approach that includes thede?nition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended2. In 1993, the Global Initiativefor Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and publichealth of?cials to disseminate \\*\\*\\*rmation about the care of patients with asthma while at the sametime assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scienti?c investigations into asthma care.Since then, GINA has developed and regularly revised a Global Strategy for Asthma Managementand Prevention. Publications based on the Global Strategy for Asthma Management andPrevention have been translated into many different languages to promote internationalcollaboration and dissemination of \\*\\*\\*rmation. In this report, Global Strategy for AsthmaManagement and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to presentthe special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the?rst 5 years of life, including dif?culties with diagnosis, the ef?cacy and safety of drugs and drugdelivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies. Approaches to these issues will varyamong populations in the world based on socioeconomic conditions, genetic diversity, culturalbeliefs, and differences in healthcare access and delivery. Patients in this age group are oftenmanaged by pediatricians and general practitioners routinely faced with a wide variety of issuesrelated to childhood diseases.

C. gattii has recently been responsible for an ongoing  \n\n【4】    outbreak of cryptococcosis in apparently immunocompetent  \n\n【5】    humans and animals on Vancouver Island and surrounding  \n\n【6】    areas within Canada and the northwest United States, and the  \n\n【7】    management of C. gattii infection in immunocompetent hosts  \n\n【8】    needs to be specifically addressed . Similarly, the human  \n\n【9】    immunodeficiency virus （HIV） pandemic continues, and cryp\n\n【10】    tococcosis is a major opportunistic pathogen worldwide, but  \n\n【11】    its management strongly depends on the medical resources  \n\n【12】    available to clinicians in specific regions. In the era of highly  \n\n【13】    active antiretroviral therapy （HAART）， the management of  \n\n【14】    cryptococcosis has become a blend of established antifungal  \n\n【15】    regimens together with aggressive treatment of the underlying  \n\n【16】    disease.  \n\n【17】    Although the widespread use of HAART has lowered the  \n\n【18】    incidence of cryptococcosis in medically developed countries  \n\n【19】    , the incidence and mortality of this infection are still  \n\n【20】    extremely high in areas where uncontrolled HIV disease persists  \n\n【21】    and limited access to HAART and/or health care occurs .  \n\n【22】    It is estimated that the global burden of HIV-associated cryp\n\n【23】    tococcosis approximates 1 million cases annually worldwide  \n\n【24】    . In medically developed countries, the modest burden of  \n\n【25】    patients with cryptococcal disease persists, largely consisting of  \n\n【26】    patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection; a growing and  \n\n【27】    heterogeneous group of patients receiving high-dose cortico\n\n【28】    steroids, monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab and in\n\n【29】    fliximab, and/or other immunosuppressive agents ; and  \n\n【30】    otherwise “normal” patients. It is sobering that, despite access  \n\n【31】    to advanced medical care and the availability of HAART, the  \n\n【32】    3-month mortality rate during management of acute crypto\n\n【33】    coccal meningoencephalitis approximates 20% . Fur\n\n【34】    thermore, without specific antifungal treatment for cryptococ\n\n【35】    cal meningoencephalitis in certain HIV-infected populations,  \n\n【36】    mortality rates of 100% have been reported within 2 weeks  \n\n【37】    after clinical presentation to health care facilities . It is  \n\n【38】    apparent that insightful management of cryptococcal disease is  \n\n【39】    critical to a successful outcome for those with disease caused  \n\n【40】    by this organism.   ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

The spectrum of disease and natural history of chronic HBV infection is diverse and variable, ranging from a low viremic inactive carrier state to progressive chronic hepatitis, which may evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellu-lar carcinoma (HCC). HBV-related end stage liver dis-ease or HCC are responsible for over 1 million deaths per year and currently represent 5–10% of cases of liver transplantation . Host and viral factors, as well as coinfection with other viruses, in particular hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), or human immu-nodeﬁciency viru s (HIV) together with other co-mor-bidities including alcohol abuse and overweight, can aﬀect the natural course of HBV infection as well as the eﬃcacy of antiviral strategies.  \nCHB may present either as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-negative CHB. HBeAg-positive CHB is due to so-called ‘‘wild type” HBV. It typically represents the early phase of chronic HBV infection. HBeAg-negative CHB is due to replication of naturally occurring HBV variants with nucleotide substitutions in the precore and/or basic core promoter regions of the genome and represents a later phase of chronic HBV infection. The prevalence of the HBeAg-negative form of the disease has been increasing over the last decade as a result of HBV-infected population aging and represents the majority of cases in many areas, including Europe .  \nMorbidity and mortality in CHB are linked to persis-tence of viral replication and evolution to cirrhosis or HCC.

Two sections devoted to primary cutaneousCD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders and rare CTCLvariants are found towards the end of the article. It isrecommended that all patients, possibly with the excep-tion of those with early stages of mycosis fungoides (IA)or with lymphomatoid papulosis, should be reviewed bya multidisciplinary team (MDT) which should include adermatologist, a clinical or medical (haemato)oncolo-gist, and a dermatopathologist or pathologist withconsiderable experience of the diagnosis and manage-ment of primary CTCL. In addition, a central review of allpathology would be desirable, consistent with currentrecommendations from the Royal College of Pathologistsfor specialized pathology services. Subsequent manage-ment should ideally be shared between the cancer centreand the local referring physician in a cancer unit. TheMDT should ideally be supported by an accreditedlaboratory for immunophenotypic and molecular diag-nostic studies in lymphoma.  \n\n【2】All patients should have adequate diagnostic biop-sies for histology, immunophenotypic and preferablymolecular studies. This is advised even for stage IAdisease as studies have shown that patients with adetectable T-cell clone have a shorter duration ofresponse and higher rate of failure to respond. Thesefindings should be interpreted with the clinicalfeatures in order to make a specific diagnosis basedon the WHO classification for primary CTCL. This iscritical because treatment and prognosis can varywidely depending on the diagnostic category. Occa-sionally, multiple skin biopsies are required to make adiagnosis and often the opinion of other dermatopa-thologists experienced in cutaneous lymphoma isrequired. The patient should be examined fully andany bulky palpable pe\\*\\*heral nodes should be biop-sied, preferably by excision rather than by core or fineneedle biopsy. Staging computed tomographic (CT)scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are indicatedin all those patients with non-mycosis fungoides CTCLvariants or with stage IIA/B ? III ?

Today, the drivers for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) are different. The rising costs of hospital care, the advent of commercially available noninvasive masks and positive pressure ventilators, have fuelled greater demand for HMV. However, the desire of individuals to maintain a quality of life (QoL) in their homes remains the prevailing impetus. The present HMV clinical practice guideline is intended to be a resource for physicians, healthcare providers, policymakers and individuals at risk for or currently using ventilatory support in the home. The objective is to identify and support ventilated patients who are presently at home, as well as those transitioning to home-based care, where QoL is the greatest and costs are minimized. Developed by The Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS), these guidelines intend to provide the most up-to-date information and evidence-based recommendations to enable practitioners to manage the provision of preventive airway management and home ventilation.

In July 2002, menopause management faced a major turning point when the first data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial were released.  \n\n【2】This study was categorized as a primary prevention trial for coronary heart disease. However, the mean age at recruitment was 63 years, when menopausal symptoms have usually finished and HRT is rarely started, but this important difference from common clinical practice was not acknowl-edged at that time. Instead, WHI investigators concluded that HRT was not cardioprotective and that its risk–benefit ratio did not favor the use of postmenopausal hormones for prevention of chronic diseases. As a result, there was a dramatic change in presc\\*\\*tion habits following recommen-dations to reserve HRT for very symptomatic women, and to limit its use to the ‘shortest duration needed’ and to ‘the lowest effective dosage’.

However, there is limited evidence to guide screening for and management of theseconditions in pregnancy. The purpose of this document is to review common thrombophilias and their association withmaternal venous thromboembolism risk and adverse pregnancy outcomes, indications for screening to detect theseconditions, and management options in pregnancy.  \nBackgroundThe Hemostatic Paradox of Pregnancy  \nPregnancy poses a particularly complex hemostatic chal-lenge. Successful pregnancy requires the avoidance ofhemorrhage during implantation, endovascular cytotro-phoblast remodeling of maternal spiral arteries, andduring the third stage of labor, yet also requires the main-tenance of a fluid uteroplacental circulation. Maintaininghemostatic balance during pregnancy requires alterationsin both local uterine and systemic clotting, as well asanticoagulant and fibrinolytic proteins. The deciduallayer of the uterus plays a crucial role in the preventionof hemorrhage during implantation, placentation, and thethird stage of labor .  \nPregnancy is marked by increased clotting potential,decreased anticoagulant activity, and decreased fibrino-lysis . The thrombotic potential of pregnancy isexacerbated by venous stasis in the lower extremitiesdue to compression of the inferior vena cava and pel-vic veins by the enlarging uterus, a hormone-mediatedincrease in venous capacitance, insulin resistance, andhyperlipidemia. Thus, it is not surprising that venousthromboembolism complicates approximately 1 in 1,births and is a leading cause of maternal morbidity in theUnited States .  \nThere is a strong association between inherited throm-bophilias and venous thromboembolism, which makesdetection of these mutations a logical target for preventionstrategies . However, it is controversial whetherthere is an association between inherited thrombophiliasand uteroplacental thrombosis leading to adverse preg-nancy outcomes such as fetal loss, preeclampsia, fetalgrowth restriction, and placental abruption . This pos-sible association has resulted in increased screening forthrombophilias in pregnancy, although there has been noconfirmation of treatment benefits.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

The Appraisalof Guidelines for Research and Evaluation （AGREE II）instrument was followed to provide a methodologicalstrategy for the guideline development. A systematicreview of the literature was performed for Englishlanguage articles published up until December 2012 inorder to address controversial issues in Barrett'soesophagus including de nition, screening anddiagnosis, surveillance, pathological grading fordysplasia, management of dysplasia, and early cancerincluding training requirements. The rigour and quality ofthe studies was evaluated using the SIGN checklistsystem. Recommendations on each topic were scored byeach author using a ve-tier system （A+, strongagreement, to D+, strongly disagree）。 Statements thatfailed to reach substantial agreement among authors,de ned as >80% agreement （A or A+）， were revisitedand modi ed until substantial agreement （>80%） wasreached. In formulating these guidelines, we took intoconsideration bene ts and risks for the population andnational health system, as well as patient perspectives.For the rst time, we have suggested strati cation ofpatients according to their estimated cancer risk basedon clinical and histopathological criteria. In order toimprove communication between clinicians, werecommend the use of minimum datasets for reportingendoscopic and pathological ndings. We advocateendoscopic therapy for high-grade dysplasia and earlycancer, which should be performed in high-volumecentres. We hope that these guidelines will standardiseand improve management for patients with Barrett'soesophagus and related neoplasia.  \n\n【2】    PURPOSE AND METHODS  \n\n【3】    The purpose of this guideline is to provide a prac-tical and evidence-based resource for the manage-ment of patients with Barrett's oesophagus andrelated early neoplasia. This document is thereforeaimed at gastroenterologists, physicians and nursepractitioners, as well as members of multidisciplin-ary teams （MDTs; surgeons, radiologists, patholo-gists）， who take decisions on the management ofsuch patients. The population covered by theseguidelines includes: patients with gastro-oesophageal re ux disease or other risk factors forBarrett's （obesity, family history for Barrett's andoesophageal adenocarcinoma （OAC））； every patientwith incident or prevalent Barrett's oesophagusregardless of their age, sex or comorbidities; patientswith early OAC and patients with intestinal metapla-sia （IM） at the gastro-oesophageal junction （GOJ）with no endoscopic evidence of Barrett'soesophagus. The previous British Society ofGastroenterology （BSG） guidelines were publishedin 2005 and since then there have been advances inthe diagnostic and management tools available.Within these guidelines, we have systematicallyreviewed the literature in order to address contro-versial issues in Barrett's oesophagus and to formu-late practical recommendations to guide patientmanagement. In particular, we have covered the fol-lowing key questions.  \n    \n\n【4】**《2014BSG Barrett食管诊断和治疗指南》**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Affected children are usually asymptomatic, and histological findings are mild with a low risk of progression, although 5% develop significant liver disease in childhood. The use of combination treatment with pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin has changed the outcome and prognosis for this disease, with approximately 60% of children achieving sustained viral clearance. Combination therapy is not ideal for children because pegylated interferon is administered subcutaneously, impairs growth velocity, and both interferon and ribavirin have significant adverse effects that affect com- pliance. In addition, approximately 50% of children infected with genotype 1 do not respond to therapy. Thus, additional treatment options are required including improvement in dosing, reduction in the length of treatment, and evaluation of new drugs, such as protease inhibitors, which could be more effective for patients infected with genotype 1. The primary goal of treatment is to eradicate the infection. The future clinical trial design should ensure that any new drugs demonstrate noninferiority to the present standard regimen in both children and adults. The measure for documenting sub-stantial improvement above present therapy should be increased viral clearance rate or the same clearance rate, with a shorter duration of treatment and/or fewer adverse effects. We do not believe there is any need for a placebo arm because approved therapy is available and new treatments can be compared with present therapy. Safety measures should include the standard recommended laboratory investigations, growth parameters, qual- ity-of-life or psychological measures, and a requirement for long-term follow-up for up to 5 years**  ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Table 2 highlights the lack of uniformity in bleeding definitions among recent ACS and PCI clinical trials. Current bleeding definitions consist of both laboratory parameters, such as decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit scores, and clinical events, including the need for transfusion or surgery, cardiac tamponade, hematomas, and various degrees of bleeding. Each definition incorporates a different combination of these data elements and then rank orders these combinations into severity categories, which vary widely between definitions.  \n\n【2】The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) bleed-ing criteria have been in use for nearly 30 years, and have been reported in most cardiovascular trials. These criteria were developed during the early TIMI trials to define and classify major and minor hemorrhagic events in patients with ST-segment– elevation MI treated with a fibrinolytic drug. The original TIMI definition relies predominantly on labora-tory data elements based on decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit values after adjustment for the effect of blood transfusion.Over time, the definitions have evolved to represent a broader range of bleeding categories and events while specifically defining each individual category.  \n\n【3】The current updated TIMI definition is shown in Table Potential limitations of the criteria include that they were developed in the fibrinolytic era, and thus typically charac-terized severe acute events and difficulties with perception of the nomenclature (eg, many would consider TIMI minor bleeding to hold greater clinical significance than that con-noted by the term minor). Common pitfalls that may occur when the TIMI definition is applied are recording hemoglo-bin drops without clinically overt signs as major bleeding events, as well as uncertainty on the timing of assessing hemoglobin values that may lead to inappropriate peaks and nadirs related to bleeding, therefore obscuring the timing of the bleeding in relation to the intervention. The TIMI criteria also characterize 3 different types of death in relation to bleeding: fatal bleeding, when a bleeding event directly leads to death within 7 days (eg, an intracranial hemorrhage that leads to herniation of the brain and death, hemopericardium that results in death, and a massive gastrointestinal hemor-rhage that results in shock, hemodynamic collapse, and death); bleeding contributing to death (ie, a death in which a bleeding event was part of a causal chain of medical events that ultimately led to death within 30 days of the bleed, but bleeding did not directly and/or immediately relate to sub-ject’s death; an example is a bleed resulting in discontinua-tion of antiplatelet therapy followed by stent thrombosis and death); and death unrelated to a bleeding event (the death was unrelated to bleeding because either there was no clinically significant bleeding in the month before death orthe bleeding event did not contribute to the subject’s death).

In 2008, the European Respiratory Society/European Society ofThoracic Surgeons Task Force brought together experts to propose practical and up-to-datedguidelines on the management of MPM.  \n\n【2】To obtain an earlier and reliable diagnosis of MPM, the experts recommend performingthoracoscopy, except in cases of pre-operative contraindication or pleural symphysis. Thestandard staining procedures are insufficient in ,10% of cases. Therefore, we propose usingspecific immunohistochemistry markers on pleural biopsies. In the absence of a uniform, robustand validated staging system, we advice use of the most recent TNM based classification, andpropose a three step pre-treatment assessment. Patient’s performance status and histologicalsubtype are currently the only prognostic factors of clinical importance in the management ofMPM. Other potential parameters should be recorded at baseline and reported in clinical trials.MPM exhibits a high resistance to chemotherapy and only a few patients are candidates forradical surgery. New therapies and strategies have been reviewed.  \n\n【3】Because of limited data on the best combination treatment, we emphasise that patients who areconsidered candidates for a multimodal approach should be included in a prospective trial at aspecialised centre.

Ascites only occurs when portal hypertension has developed  and is primarily related to an inability to excrete an adequate amount of sodium into urine, leading to a positive sodium balance. A large body of evidence suggests that renal sodium retention in patients with cirrhosis is secondary to arterial splanchnic vasodilation. This causes a decrease in effective arterial blood volume with activa-tion of arterial and cardiopulmonary volume receptors, and homeostatic activation of vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining systems (, the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system). Renal sodium retention leads to expansion of the extracellular fluid volume and formation of ascites and edema \\[3–5\\]. The development of ascites is associated with a poor prognosis and impaired quality of life in patients with cirrhosis . Thus, patients with ascites should generally be considered for referral for liver transplantation. There is a clear rationale for the management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis, as successful treatment may improve outcome and symptoms.  \nA panel of experts was selected by the EASL Governing Board and met several times to discuss and write these guidelines during 2008–2009. These guidelines were written according to published studies retrieved from Pubmed. The evidence and recommendations made in these guidelines have been graded according to the GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation). The strength of evi-dence has been classiﬁed into three levels: A, high; B, moderate; and C, low-quality evidence, while that of the recommendation into two: strong and weak . Where no clear evidence existed, the recommendations were based on the consensus advice of expert opinion(s) in the literature and that of the writing committee.  \n\n【2】    \n\n【3】    相关专题链接：自发性细菌性腹膜炎的临床诊断及治疗", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}

Based on the Statistics Canada 2006 Census  \n\n【2】   , the visibleminority population surpassed five million, reaching 16.2% of thepopulation. Of these, the four most common minorities in Canadainclude Chinese, South Asian, black and Aboriginal groups. Together,these four groups comprise over 88% of visible minorities in Canadaand, as such, the focus of the present section will primarily be on them.In addition, most of the data currently published in this arena has beenobservational in nature. However, apart from ethnocultural data, mostof the published data suggest that there are more similarities than dif-ferences among these populations and Caucasians with respect to diag-nosis or treatment of HF. To understand and manage a person’s illness, itis necessary to appreciate the effects of the person’s culture, experiencesand social environment. Hope and morale may be crucial to patients’adaptation and maintenance of involvement in the management oftheir condition  \n\n【3】     , and gaps in communications as a result of ethno-cultural differences between the patients and the health care workersmay have a detrimental effect on patients’ adaptation to their illness.To date, there have been very few published population-based epi-demiological studies of HF in countries outside North America andwestern Europe. It is generally believed that rheumatic heart disease isa major cause of HF in sub-Saharan Africa, and certain parts of Asiaand South America. Hypertension is an important cause of HF in Asiaand in the African and African American populations, whereasChagas disease is a cause of HF in subjects from South America  \n\n【4】    .However, because these regions constantly undergo epidemiologicaland economic transitions, the epidemiology of HF is likely to increas-ingly resemble that of the western world. The large international case-controlled INTERHEART study  \n   \n     has demonstrated that the impactof conventional and potentially preventable risk factors on the risk ofmyocardial infarctions is consistent across different geographicalregions and different ethnic groups. This implies that similar preven-tive measures for myocardial infarction and the subsequent develop-ment of HF may be applicable to different ethnic populations indifferent geographical locations. There is little evidence to indicatethat the criteria used to diagnose HF substantially differs among ethnicpopulations. For example, a recent study from the United States (US)  \n\n【5】     demonstrated that the diagnostic performance of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is similar in African Americans and non-African Americans. With respect to the treatment of patients with HF,relatively few large-scale randomized controlled intervention trials inHF have included regions outside Europe and the US. Smaller clinicaltrials  have shown the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in HF patients from Africa and Asia. Given the fundamentalnature of the derangements in HF, our current approach, includingneurohormonal blockade and the appropriate use of devices, will likelybe effective, although dosages and responses may differ slightly amongethnic groups.  \n\n【6】   ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "aiaiyi_zhenliaozhinan", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version1"}
