The pharynx connects the back of the mouth and nose to the larynx (voice box) and oesophagus (gullet).\nThe tonsils lie at the top of the pharynx.\nTonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) is more common in children, because they have large tonsils, which shrink with age. Adults tend to get pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx). However, both conditions can occur together in adults and children.\nPharyngitis and tonsillitis are usually caused by a viral infection, such as the common cold  or infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever, p.), but the conditions may sometimes be due to a bacterial or fungal infection.\nThe symptoms of both conditions are similar and may include sore throat, difficulty swallowing, earache, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\nThere may also be a fever. In severe cases, there may be breathing difficulty,\n\n【2】##Croup\n\n【3】In croup (medically known as laryngotracheitis), the upper airways become inflamed and narrowed, producing hoarseness, a harsh, grating sound while breathing in (known as stridor), a distinctive barking cough, and sometimes breathing difficulty.\nCroup is most common in infants and young children and is usually caused by a viral infection of the airways, although it may also occur as a result of an allergy, inhaling a small foreign body or an irritant chemical, or epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis, which is the flap of tissue behind the tongue that stops food from entering the airways, p.).\nMild cases of croup may be treated with medication. Severe cases with serious breathing difficulty need urgent medical treatment.\n\n【4】页边侧栏删除：<u>and occasionally an abscess forms near a tonsil, a condition called peritonsillar abscess or quinsy.\nTreatment for pharyngitis and tonsillitis is usually with medication, although surgery may be needed for recurrent tonsillitis or a peritonsillar abscess.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>In tonsillitis, the tonsils at the back of the throat become inflamed. They may also have white, pus-filled spots on them, as shown above.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Functional Dysphonia\nVoice Overuse</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Functional dysphonia is the medical term for abnormalities of the voice that are not due to any underlying disorder.\nTypical abnormalities may include a breathy, hoarse, or rough voice, changes in the pitch, loudness, or quality of the voice, a feeling of having to strain to speak, breaks in speaking when the sound cuts out briefly, and discomfort or pain when speaking.\nThe most common cause of the problem is overuse of the voice. Stress may also sometimes be a factor, and smoking may make symptoms worse.\nFunctional dysphonia usually clears up by itself from resting the voice. Speech therapy may be advised if the problem recurs repeatedly.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Herpangina</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Herpangina is a throat infection caused by a specific group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly by coxsackieviruses – a group of viruses that can cause a range of diseases, including hand, foot, and mouth disease , meningitis (inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord, p.), and pneumonia (p). The viruses are usually spread by infected droplets coughed or sneezed into the air, and the viruses can survive on surfaces for several days. Herpangina is most common in young children but can affect people of any age.\nSymptoms of herpangina do not typically appear until two to seven days after infection, when there is a sudden onset of fever, sore throat, and sometimes also headache, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain. Small blisters appear in the throat; they enlarge and then burst, forming ulcers.\nThe infection usually clears up within about a week without specific treatment, although symptoms of the infection may be relieved with medication.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Vocal Cord Polyps And Nodules</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Vocal cord polyps and nodules are noncancerous growths on the vocal cords. A polyp is a small swelling that develops on the membrane covering the vocal cords. As it grows, the polyp may develop a small stalk. A nodule is a small, callus-like lump on the vocal cords.\nBoth polyps and nodules are usually caused by overuse of the voice and both produce similar symptoms. Symptoms include hoarseness, a harsh, breathy voice, and sometimes discomfort or pain when speaking.\nTreatment for vocal cord polyps and nodules consists of resting the voice, although sometimes surgery to remove the growths may be advised. Tests to confirm that the growths are not cancerous may also be carried out.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Pharyngitis And\nTonsillitis\nBacterial Tonsillitis | Viral Sore Throat\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Pharyngitis And Tonsillitis Bacterial Tonsillitis | Viral Sore Throat\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "PHARYNGITIS AND", "bbox": [42.0, 90.0, 165.0, 105.0]}, {"text": "TONSILLITIS", "bbox": [43.0, 105.0, 121.0, 118.0]}, {"text": "Bacterial tonsillitis | Viral sore throat", "bbox": [43.0, 118.0, 225.0, 132.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [41.0, 89.0, 224.0, 131.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nPharyngitis and tonsillitis are common disorders that are often described simply as a sore throat.

By spirometry, FEV, and FVC are measured. The technique involves a maximum inspiration followed by a forced expiration (as long as possible), into the spirometer. FEV, is expressed as a percentage of the FVC.\nIt is done to diagnose and differentiate obstructive airway disorders (e.g. COPD, asthma) from restrictive diseases (e.g. ILD). Spirometry can also be used to determine the severity of asthma and COPD.\n\n【1】By spirometry, five important measures can be detected:\n\n【2】1. FEV, (Forced expiratory volume in 1st second): The volume of air in the first second of forced expiration after full inspiration.\n\n【3】2. FVC (Forced vital capacity): The total volume of air expired forcibly in one breath after full inspiration.\n\n【4】3. FEV  /FVC: The ratio of FEV 1 to FVC expressed as  percentage.\n\n【5】4. PEF (Peak expiratory flow): It is the highest flow one can achieve during forceful expiration.\nIt is used as a short-term monitoring tool at doctor's chamber and emergency room during exacerbations.\nLong-term monitoring of asthma can be done by seeing diurnal variability of PEF at patient's home by maintaining peak flow chart. This is essential for constructing self-management plan.\n\n【6】5. FEF  (Forced expiratory flow in 25 to 75 percentile): It is the graphical measurement of average expiratory flow in between 25 to 75% of the expiration during FVC maneuver. This measurement denotes airflow condition in smaller airways of <2 mm of diameter, which are devoid of cartilages. It is especially important in smokers (with COPD and emphysema) and in children who cannot produce satisfactory FEV .\n\n【7】In spirometric tracings, three values of the above parameters are shown: 1. Predicted values: These are the expected normal values of a person with regard to sex, age, weight and height.\n\n【8】2. Measured values: These are the actual values achieved by a person through expiratory and inspiratory maneuvers.\n\n【9】3. Percentage of predicted value: These are measured values expressed as a percentage of predicted values.\n\n【10】These values are used to differentiate and classify asthma, COPD and restrictive diseases.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR): Measurement of PEFR on a regular basis at home with a portable peak flow meter is especially useful for patients over 5 years of age with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The patient is asked to take a full inspiration as far as possible, then blow out forcefully into the peak flow meter. PEFR is best used to monitor progress of the disease and its treatment.\n\n【11】页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Spirometry</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Measured Value × 100</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>That is =</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Predicted Value</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nSpirometry is a method of assessing lung function by measuring the volume of air after maximal expiration following maximal inspiration.

First, astrocytes modulate synaptic strength by controlling the concentration of neurotransmitter in the cleft via glial transporters. This is the case for most synapses that use amino acid neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, GABA, and monoamines, where astrocytes express specific transporters, depending on the synapse 删除9:<u>(see Chapter )</u>.\nAlternative mechanisms of affecting neurotransmitter concentration exist in central cholinergic synapses; astrocytes covering these synapses are able to synthesize and release the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), which structurally is similar to the nicotinic cholinoreceptor and has a high-affinity binding site for ACh. Extensive stimulation of cholinergic terminals enhances the release of AChBP, which enters the synaptic cleft, binds ACh and effectively lowers the concentration of the latter, thus attenuating the synaptic strength.\nSecond, 'glio' transmitters released from astrocytes also affect synaptic transmission in neighbouring neuronal circuits. In fact, astrocytes are capable of exerting multiple effects on this ongoing neurotransmission. For example, in hippocampal neurones cultured together with astrocytes, the stimulation of the latter increased the frequency of spontaneous (miniature) excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, but decreased the amplitude of the evoked postsynaptic responses . This difference was explained through activation of two independent pathways: in the former case, glutamate acted via presynaptic NMDA receptors (which are active already at low glutamate concentrations), whereas the latter effect was mediated through presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. Astroglial glutamate release may also affect inhibitory pathways in the hippocampus, by facilitating GABA release from interneurones connected to pyramidal CA1 cells; this effect is mediated by activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors of the kainate subtype, located in the terminals of the interneurones.\nAstrocytes are also capable of modulating synaptic transmission through the release of ATP. In hippocampal neuronal–glial co-cultures, ATP secreted by astrocytes inhibited glutamatergic synapses via presynaptic metabotropic (PY) purinoreceptors. Alternatively, as was shown in experiments in hippocampal slices, ATP released by astrocytes was catalyzed by ectoenzymes into adenosine, which produced tonic suppression of synaptic transmission by acting on adenosine receptors. Similar effects have been observed in the retina, where ATP released from Müller cells degrades to adenosine and inhibits neurones acting through adenosine receptors.\n\n【2】##7.11.1删除20:<u>1.1</u>Morphological Plasticity Of Astroglial Synaptic Compartment\n\n【3】Astrocytes are able to directly influence synaptic transmission in certain brain regions by changing their morphology and thus remodelling the structure of the", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Astroglia Regulate Synaptic Transmission 7.11\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Astroglia Regulate Synaptic Transmission 7.11\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Astroglia regulate synaptic transmission", "bbox": [137.0, 79.0, 466.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "7.11", "bbox": [85.0, 82.0, 128.0, 99.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [84.0, 78.0, 465.0, 100.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nAstroglia affect neuronal synaptic transmission in several ways.

More recent theories of personality have been proposed, including Freud's psychodynamic perspective, which holds that personality is formed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction to the psychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural perspectives.\n\n【4】##11.2 Freud And The Psychodynamic Perspective\n\n【5】Sigmund Freud presented the first comprehensive theory of personality. He was also the first to recognize that much of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness. Freud also proposed three components to our personality: the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego is to balance the sexual and aggressive drives of the id with the moral ideal of the superego. Freud also said that personality develops through a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone.\nFailure to resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality traits. Successful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.\n\n【6】##11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, And Horney\n\n【7】The neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud's. They generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Some of the notable neo-Freudians are Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, Erik Erikson, and Karen Horney. The neo-Freudian approaches have been criticized, because they tend to be philosophical rather than based on sound scientific research. For example, Jung's conclusions about the existence of the collective unconscious are based on myths, legends, dreams, and art. In addition, as with Freud's psychoanalytic theory, the neo-Freudians based much of their theories of personality on information from their patients.\n\n【8】##11.4 Learning Approaches\n\n【9】Behavioral theorists view personality as significantly shaped and impacted by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the organism. People behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B.\nF. Skinner, a prominent behaviorist, said that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns, because we have developed certain response tendencies. Mischel focused on how personal goals play a role in the selfregulation process. Albert Bandura said that one's environment can determine behavior, but at the same time, people can influence the environment with both their thoughts and behaviors, which is known as reciprocal determinism. Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality.

These include DNA methylation of the cytosine phosphate guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands in promoters as well as other regions of the genome, chromatin remodeling and higher-order chromatin structural alterations, posttranslational ATP-dependent modifications of histone tail domains including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, and regulation through noncoding RNAs . We have previously delineated (Ross ) at least four different mechanisms in which nutrients may modify DNA methylation. The first is that nutrients may influence the supply of methyl groups for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the universal methyl donor. The second mechanism is that nutrients may modify utilization of methyl groups by processes including altered DNA methyltransferase activity. A third possible mechanism may relate to DNA demethylation activity. Finally, the DNA methylation patterns may influence the response to dietary component(s). Interestingly, such interactions may apply similarly to the way in which diet impacts histone methylation marks and processes. Moreover, diet can also affect other histone tail modifications. The interrelationship between dietary components, epigenetics, and cancer will be further explored in this review by providing additional examples and highlighting areas for further research.",

Both have been reviewed elsewhere  ; therefore, only examples of the processes are discussed here.  Although more effective, the onset of the adaptive immune response is slow (several days). Meanwhile, to prevent extensive damage by a pathogenic agent, the rapid, albeit nonantigenspecific, innate immune response is activated. It includes the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines.\n\n【5】##Innate Immune Mechanisms\n\n【6】##Natural Killer Cells\n\n【7】After coxsackievirus infection, NK cells are activated roughly 2 days postinoculation.

NO has been shown to play a major role in cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis and acts as a neurotransmitter and as a cytotoxic effector molecule of the immune system.Three distinct\nNOS isoforms have been identified: nNOS (NOS), iNOS (NOS), and eNOS (NOS). Both eNOS and nNOS are constitutively active, their activity is calcium and calmodulin dependent, and they have been shown to be expressed in the heart.The inducible form iNOS was first isolated from macrophages but has been shown to be expressed in many other cell types including cardiomyocytes.删除16:<u> 130 </u>It is transcriptionally regulated by several cytokines such as IL-1 β , TNF- α , and IFN- γ . Because these cytokines play a role in antiviral response, it was postulated that iNOS or more broadly NO could play a major role in the host defense against coxsackievirus infection.\nIn a cell culture model, an NO-donor inhibited coxsackievirus replication and viral protein synthesis.删除16:<u> 131 </u>In vivo, coxsackievirus infection in mice resulted in induction of iNOS in the heart.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases bone resorption (demineralization) resulting in the release of calcium and phosphate. It also increases the renal reabsorption of calcium, because PTH activates the renal hydroxylase that converts calcidiol to calcitriol. PTH also increases the renal excretion of phosphate. With the hypoparathyroidism of DiGeorge syndrome, all of these activities of PTH are impaired. Consequently, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are seen.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Correct answer = H. The patient has Wilson disease, an autosomal-recessive disorder that decreases copper efflux from the liver because of mutations to the hepatic copper transport protein ATP7B. Some copper leaks into the blood and is deposited in the brain, eyes, kidney, and skin. This results in liver and kidney damage, neurologic effects, and corneal changes caused by the excess copper. Administration of the metal chelator penicillamine is the treatment. [Note: Because zinc is also chelated, supplementation with zinc is common.] Graves disease results in hyperthyroidism. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload. Keshan disease is the result of selenium deficiency, whereas selenosis is caused by selenium excess. Menkes syndrome is the result of a systemic deficiency in copper as a result of mutations to ATP7A, an intestinal copper transport protein.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Correct answer = B. The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\"bronze diabetes\"). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment.

Puppies and kittens less than 6 months of age with campylobacteriosis can present with subclinical symptoms as well as with signs of ileocolitis.

Feeding of raw meat contaminated by Salmonella and recovery of Salmonella from the feces of sled dogs and Greyhounds has been documented, suggesting a risk of human infection from contact with infected dogs and cats.

Although approximately 90% of CSD patients have a history of cat contact, there are anecdotal cases of CSD associated with dog, rabbit, and monkey contact. The United States has 57 million pet cats (one third of American households have them); thus there is a large reservoir from which B. henselae can be acquired by humans.\nAlthough frequently seen in humans, CSD is not reportable and disease burden is not available. In 1992 to 1993,\n\n【3】页边侧栏删除：<u>Connecticut found the overall incidence of the disease to be  cases/100,000/year, with a peak incidence in children less than 10 years of age (9.3/100,000/year) and a median age of 14 years. In this survey, 52% of patients were female; 11% required hospitalization; and no deaths were reported.\nIn an uncomplicated case of CSD, a nontender papule develops at the site of inoculation followed by regional adenopathy, which develops 1 to 2 weeks later. Regional nodules enlarge for 2 to 3 weeks and then recede over the next 1 to 2 months. Nodes may be small and asymptomatic or massively enlarged and last several months. Most of the comenlarged nodes are axillary (45%), cervical/ monly submandibular (26%), and groin (18%). Nodes may suppurate late in their course and require needle aspiration for relief. Fever occurs in approximately one half of symptomatic patients; systemic symptoms such as malaise, anorexia, and headache can also be present.\nPrevalence of B. henselae among cat populations varies worldwide. The genotype Houston I is more prevalent in the Far East, and the genotype Marseille is dominant in western Europe, Australia, and the western United States. Cats are usually asymptomatic, but uveitis, endocarditis, neurologic signs, fever, necrotic lesions at the inoculation site, lymphadenopathy, and reproductive disorders have been reported in naturally or experimentally infected cats.\nCat contact is usually required for transmission of CSD.\nBecause most cases have a benign course, avoiding cats is unwarranted. Exposure to kittens or young cats—especially kittens with fleas—is associated with the development of CSD in immunocompetent hosts. Fleas spread the bacteria between cats, although currently there is no evidence that fleas can transmit the disease to humans. Once a cat is infected, the bacteria live in the animal's saliva. Immunocompromised patients will want to control cat fleas. They may also wish to limit their exposure to both kittens (preventing bites, keeping the kitten's nails trimmed) and stray cats, which tend to carry B. henselae more frequently than older domestic cats.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>\n##Animal Bites</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Animal bites are a significant public health problem in the United States, and the number of bites appears to be increasing. There are substantially more dog bites than cat bites, and dog bites account for most animal bite wounds encountered in the emergency departments. Ninety percent of animal bites are from dogs and cats; of these, up to 18% of dog bites and up to 80% of cat bites eventually become infected, with occasional sequelae of meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, and septic shock.\nAn estimated  million dogs lived in the United States in 2009, accounting for approximately 5 million dog bites per year.

The genotype Houston I is more prevalent in the Far East, and the genotype Marseille is dominant in western Europe, Australia, and the western United States. Cats are usually asymptomatic, but uveitis, endocarditis, neurologic signs, fever, necrotic lesions at the inoculation site, lymphadenopathy, and reproductive disorders have been reported in naturally or experimentally infected cats.\n\nCat contact is usually required for transmission of CSD.\n\nBecause most cases have a benign course, avoiding cats is unwarranted. Exposure to kittens or young cats—especially kittens with fleas—is associated with the development of CSD in immunocompetent hosts. Fleas spread the bacteria between cats, although currently there is no evidence that fleas can transmit the disease to humans. Once a cat is infected, the bacteria live in the animal's saliva. Immunocompromised patients will want to control cat fleas.

CO must increase to meet the markedly increased metabolic demands, as well as maintain blood pressure in the face of massive peripheral vasodilation in the active skeletal muscle. These challenges are met via the combined action of the feed-forward role of central command and the feedback action of baroreflexes and reflexes arising from activation of skeletal muscle afferents. These reflexes act to control parasympathetic and sympathetic activity to increase HR, ventricular contractility, and central blood volume mobilization to raise CO and vasoconstrict inactive vascular beds, as well as limit skeletal muscle vasodilation to prevent a large fall in arterial pressure.\nWith the initiation of exercise, there is an immediate rapid increase in HR due to rapid withdrawal of parasympathetic activity. This is likely due to activation of central command with possible contribution of resetting of the arterial baroreflex and activation of skeletal muscle mechanoreceptors.\nAs work rate progresses, parasympathetic activity progressively declines and sympathetic activity rises.

They also described how the baroreflex mediated changes in HR were time dependent—again, reinforcing the problems of using HR for baroreflex analysis. Thus, these investigators conclusively demonstrated that the arterial baroreflex is not inhibited during exercise but rather the reflex is reset to a higher pressure in proportion to the exercise intensity. These observations, along with the innovative surgical techniques, have led many investigative teams to use similar approaches over the past 20 years or more to investigate the baroreflex, its action, and interaction with other reflexes at rest, during exercise, and in pathophysiologic conditions.</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Melcher A, Donald DE.

The latter observation had been challenged, inasmuch as baroreflex-mediated HR responses were undiminished (Fig. 9.3).

Because only one lung appears to have fluid accumulation and he is young and exercises regularly; pulmonary hypertension ( answer a ) is unlikely, especially given his physical findings and history and sudden onset of symptoms.

The major blood supply to the posterior ventricular wall in most hearts is the posterior interventricular artery (or posterior descending), normally (70% of the time) a branch off the right coronary artery.

There is normally a kind of balance operating across the endothelium of exchange vessels (capillaries and venules).

In life table theory the hazard function is sometimes termed the force of mortality, and in the epidemiologic literature it is often referred to as the incidence density.

It is only when we consider the probability of dying in an interval of time that a nonzero probability is obtained. For this reason we sometimes refer to f ( t ) and h ( t ) as \"instantaneous\" probabilities. We can characterize S ( t ) , f ( t ) , and h ( t ) as follows: S ( t ) is the probability that an individual alive at time 0 will survive to time t ; f ( t ) is the instantaneous probability per unit time that an individual alive at time 0 will die at time t ; and h ( t ) is the instantaneous probability per unit time that an individual alive at time t will die \"in the next instant.\" In Appendix F we show that S ( t ) , f ( t ) , and h ( t ) are mathematically equivalent in the sense that each of them can be expressed in terms of the others. A useful identity relating the three functions is Consider an open cohort study involving r subjects and denote the observations by (t  , δ  ), . . . , (t i , δ i ), . . . , (t r , δ r ). Suppose that the observations are a sample from the distribution of T . Consequently each subject has the survival function S ( t ) , the probability function f ( t ) , and the hazard function h ( t ) . We seek an expression for the unconditional likelihood of the observations under the assumption that censoring is uninformative. If subject i survives to t i , the corresponding term in the likelihood is S ( t i ), while if subject i dies at t i the term is f ( t i ). Making use of δ i , we can write the contribution of subject i  to the likelihood as 页边侧栏删除：<u>S(tj)l-8i f(tj)gi = S(tj) = S(ti)h(ti) δi S ( ti i )</u>where the last equality follows from 页边侧栏删除：<u>删除11:<u>(8.3)</u></u>.

As a result, he now has absence seizures, myoclonic seizures and atonic seizures.\nHe is also neurologically and developmentally normal with a normal MRI of the brain. As such he meets criteria for Doose syndrome or myoclonic-astatic epilepsy. A slow wave sleep seen on an overnight EEG is not necessary to order because this diagnosis can be made clinically or by performing a routine awake EEG to show that astatic and myoclonic jerks have an electrical origin with polyspike and slow wave discharges correlating with myoclonic jerks and atonic seizures. Valproate acid is a broader spectrum anti-seizure medication which can cover all three seizure types better than ethosuximide. Ethosuximide may be useful adjunctively if he begins to experience an increase in his absence seizures.\nVigabatrin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine should be avoided as these medications may increase absence seizures.

In practice, views on generally accepted indications for any procedure are dynamic and tend to change as additional knowledge is gained concerning procedural success rates and complication rates, as well as the underlying arrhythmia substrates.\nProfessional societies periodically publish consensus statements that represent the best currently available opinions regarding indications for ablation procedures based on the state of scientific knowledge at the time and the best clinical judgment of the coauthors. By definition, such consensus statements are likely to be out of date by the time of publication and badly out of date within several years. In addition, such lists of clinical indications tend to group patients into general categories, but in practice patients and their clinical problems are vastly more heterogeneous than can be captured in simple categories. Therefore, the clinician should view such published consensus statements, as well as the information contained in this chapter, as a general guide but should approach each patient individually with the best interests of the patient being paramount. Thus, there may be patients for whom a procedure is advisable even if not listed under the standard indications, and likewise, there may be patients for whom a normally clearly indicated procedure is nonetheless not in the patients' best interest. Consensus documents and lists of indications do not mandate particular courses of clinical care but should only serve as guides to the medical professional caring for the individual patient.\nThere are three categories of issues that must be considered in deciding on the indications for any procedure including catheter ablation. Firstly, one needs to know the natural history of the disease state being addressed, including the likely course and outcome if the arrhythmia is either not treated or treated with other therapies such as antiarrhythmic medications. Secondly, the likely success rate of that ablation procedure needs to be considered. Finally, the possible complications of the ablation procedure and their incidence needs to be factored into decision-making. Other considerations enter into the discussion as well, such as the cost of the procedure, the cost-effectiveness, and the effects on quality of life.\nWith respect to natural history considerations, we know that for most forms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), once the arrhythmia is well established past infancy, it is unlikely to resolve spontaneously without definitive therapy.\nWe know that WPW often spontaneously resolves in the first year of life,  but that such patients can experience re- onset later in childhood. In some cases, such as WPW, the natural history does include some risk of sudden death if untreated, but the actual magnitude of that risk is difficult to determine in the pediatric population.删除16:<u> 2 </u>Less is known about the natural history of other arrhythmias such as idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and atrial ectopic tachycardia.\nWith respect to success rates and complication rates of catheter ablation procedures, it is important to rely primarily upon large prospective multicenter studies rather than retrospective\n页边侧栏删除：<u>\n#George F. Van Hare And Jennifer N. Avari Silva</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>single site studies, because multicenter studies are more likely to provide reliable information on likely real-world results. Such prospective multicenter registry reports have been published since the early 1990s,  and ongoing reporting of results for multiple centers is taking place through the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR-IMPACT) of the American College of Cardiology. The latter project should provide good ongoing real-world data on expected ablation procedure results in the pediatric and congenital population.删除16:<u> 6\n</u>It is important to point out that published guidelines concerning ablation in the adult population are not applicable to the pediatric population. This is true both because of the different success and risk profile for the procedure in the pediatric population due to smaller size and anatomic variation, as well as important natural history considerations. While some of the considerations in the adult population are similar, they should not be solely relied upon for decision-making in the pediatric population.\nA number of professional societies have published guidelines and consensus documents and several of these are specific to the pediatric and congenital heart disease population, specifically the  document from the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES)  and the  document jointly produced by the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Arrhythmia Working Group of the Association of European Pediatric Cardiologists (AEPC).删除16:<u> 8\n</u>Of note, the AEPC partnered with PACES in producing the  document. These documents will continue to be revised and updated as new evidence becomes available and as expert consensus shifts. The reader is encouraged to search the medical literature for the most recent society-led consensus documents concerning indications for ablation. The indications are reproduced here for the most common forms of arrhythmia substrates requiring catheter ablation, as published by PACES.删除16:<u> 7 </u>Elsewhere in this textbook, the indications for ablation in the more uncommon or heterogenous substrates are also given. In both current North American and European documents, indications are categorized as Class 1, Class , and Class 3 as is commonly done in consensus documents.\nClass 1 indicates that there is evidence and/or general agreement that the procedure is indicated. Class 2 indicates that there may be conflicting evidence or divergence of opinion, and Class 2 is further subdivided into Class a for which the weight of evidence and opinion is in favor, and Class b where usefulness is less well established. These indications are usually expressed as \"can be useful\" or \"can be reasonable\" for Class a indications, as opposed to \"might be reasonable\" or \"can rarely be considered\" for Class b indications. Class 3 indicates that there is general agreement that the procedure is not indicated, either because it is not effective or because it can cause harm. In addition, the level of evidence is usually cited, but for pediatric catheter ablation indications, evidence is primarily from retrospective studies and registry data (level of evidence C) or simply based on consensus of experts (level</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Chapter 4 Indications For Catheter Ablation In Infants, Children, And Patients With Congenital Heart Disease\n", "block_text_old": "# Chapter 4 Indications For Catheter Ablation In Infants, Children, And Patients With Congenital Heart Disease\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Chapter 4", "bbox": [348.0, 79.0, 444.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "INDICATIONS FOR CATHETER ABLATION IN INFANTS, CHILDREN,", "bbox": [124.0, 97.0, 667.0, 117.0]}, {"text": "AND PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE", "bbox": [180.0, 117.0, 611.0, 137.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [123.0, 78.0, 666.0, 136.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nThe phrase \"indications for catheter ablation\" implies a scientifically based consensus among experts concerning when such procedures should be offered, and in what particular clinical scenarios.

In comparison, a radiologist cannot be at the patient's side during an entire small bowel follow-through examination, as the study usually lasts between 30 and 120 minutes. Even during the best small bowel follow-through, the patient is intermittently examined every 15 to 30 minutes.\nA study performed with intermittent palpation cannot guarantee that the radiologist is there at just the right moment to visualize proper barium filling, mucosal coating, or luminal distention of individual bowel loops.\n页边侧栏删除：<u>\n#Examination Of The Small Intestine: Techniques And Normal Anatomy</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Stephen E.删除7:<u> Rubesin, MD</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>Fig. 删除17:<u>6.1</u> Metastatic melanoma demonstrated on enteroclysis.</u>\nSpot radiograph of two proximal ileal loops shows multiple submucosal masses as smoothsurfaced, 6–12 mm, hemispheric-shaped radiolucent filling defects (short arrows). A larger target-shaped metastasis is seen en face as an ovoid filling defect (arrowhead) with a central barium-filled ulcer (thin arrow).</u>页边侧栏删除：<u>During a small bowel follow-through, barium emptying from the stomach is limited by the pylorus, the gatekeeper of the small intestine. The pylorus prevents barium from entering the small bowel at a rate high enough to fully distend the small intestine. The radiologist, therefore, has little control over the degree of small bowel filling and distention. In comparison, during enteroclysis, a catheter is placed distal to the pylorus, enabling the radiologist to fill the small bowel with enough contrast material to obtain adequate luminal distention. Thus, enteroclysis is superior to small bowel follow-through in the degree of luminal distention that is achieved. Better luminal distention enables better visualization of the luminal contour, splaying apart the valvulae conniventes and depicting the mucosal surface en face. Overdistention of the lumen brings out subtle narrowings or obstructing lesions such as adhesions that may be difficult to demonstrate during small bowel follow-through.\nEvaluation of fold size depends on the degree of luminal distention and the phase of barium coating .删除7:<u> The greater the degree of luminal distention, the thinner the folds 删除9:<u>(see Fig.  )</u>.</u> The radiologist best evaluates folds when the lumen is optimally distended and the folds lie perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the small bowel. During enteroclysis, each loop can be fully distended, so that the folds of each loop can be adequately evaluated. In comparison, not all loops are fully distended during a small bowel follow-through, so this technique is less satisfactory for evaluating fold size and focal luminal contour. During a small bowel follow-through, folds in underdistended loops may have a \"feathery appearance\" due to fold overlap or are not seen at all. Small bowel folds are not necessarily best seen when the barium column initially fills a loop of small bowel. Some flow of contrast material is needed to wash the succus entericus off the folds. On the other hand, long after the barium column passes, the folds may also appear falsely thickened, as secretions lift barium from the mucosal surface.\nThe small intestine is a hostile environment for contrast agents. Secretions from the stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and biliary tree enter the small bowel lumen. Each day, about 6 liters of fluid turn over in the small intestine and about  liters of succus entericus reach the cecum.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Introduction\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Introduction\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Introduction", "bbox": [53.0, 257.0, 151.0, 278.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [52.0, 256.0, 150.0, 277.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nThere are many ways to examine the small intestine.

So extensive research has been done in the field of antibiotics, antifungal, and antivirals. But the limitations behind the use of these agents for curing the infections is the development of drug resistance by the causative pathogens. So the dosage forms have been explored from the conventional delivery to novel drug delivery including the nanotechnology. The nano formulations have been engineered in such a way to enhance the bioavailability of the drugs, the absorbability and increase in pharmacokinetic behavior of the drugs. Again the instances of drug resistance and systemic side-effects have been decreased by use of the novel or nano-drug delivery system (Andrade et  al. 2013 ; Newman  ). Also the infections are being treated by repurposing other classes of drugs like antibiotics in dry powder inhalation form.\nInhalation of drugs are beneficial for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as it rapidly delivers the drug directly to lungs with less systemic side-effects (Newman  ). In this chapter, common respiratory infections are reviewed and recent reports are discussed with more emphasis on advanced drug delivery system.\n\n【2】##22.3.1 Pneumonia\n\n【3】Pneumonia is marked as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally due to a lack of suitable therapeutic intervention. In such a pursuit, researchers are engaged in building-up of strategies to devise suitable delivery systems which can specifically address the shortcomings associated with the use of conventional drugs which concentrates majorly on the precipitation of drug resistance and adverse drug reactions which culminates down to diminished therapeutic efficacy (Htun et al.\n\n【4】2019 ).\nThe pulmonary delivery of antibiotics for the management of respiratory infections showcases enhanced therapeutic effectiveness as compared to systemically administrated ones. Drugs of natural origin have also been reported to be used for the treatment of respiratory inflammation. Andrographolide (AG) liposomes in the form of dry powder inhalers (LADPIs) were formulated with a mean size of approximately  nm and a zeta potential of − mV and were further analyzed for treatment of S. aureus -induced pneumonia. LADPIs upon intra-tracheal administration in the groups of rats displayed superior pneumonic effect against S. aureus as compared to the groups given AG in powder form and standard antibiotic, penicillin. The plausible reason for the observed effect may be due to the efficient internalization of the liposomes at the target site. In addition, a significant drop in pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1 and inhibition of I κ B-α phosphorylation in the nuclear factor- κ B (NF- κ B) pathway were also observed in the groups of rats administered with LADPIs, which indicated the promising potential of LADPIs in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia (Li et al.\n\n【5】2017a ).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Different Treatment Strategies For Respiratory Tract 22.3\nInfections\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Different Treatment Strategies For Respiratory Tract 22.3 Infections\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Different Treatment Strategies for Respiratory Tract", "bbox": [117.0, 78.0, 474.0, 94.0]}, {"text": "22.3", "bbox": [70.0, 79.0, 103.0, 94.0]}, {"text": "Infections", "bbox": [117.0, 95.0, 187.0, 111.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [69.0, 77.0, 473.0, 110.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nThe respiratory infections may be due to bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

This effect drags water, which is accompanied by sodium from tubular cells into the tubular fluid. Mannitol is poorly absorbed with oral administration and is active only when given intravenously. It acts in the kidney within 10 minutes and has a terminal half-life ( t  ) of approximately 1.2 hours in patients with normal renal function. Toxicity develops when filtration of mannitol is impaired, as in acute and chronic kidney disease.\nRetained mannitol causes increased plasma osmolality, which can exacerbate CHF, induce hyponatremia, and cause a hyperoncotic syndrome. As a result of these effects, mannitol is contraindicated in patients with CHF and moderate-to-severe kidney disease. In addition, mannitol may cause acute kidney injury (AKI) from osmotic nephropathy in high-risk individuals.\nThe carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide is prescribed to alkalinize the urine (certain drug overdoses), prevent and treat altitude sickness, and decrease intraocular pressure in certain forms of glaucoma. The CA inhibitors disrupt bicarbonate reabsorption by impairing the conversion of carbonic acid (H,CO,) into CO, and H,O in tubular fluid. Excess bicarbonate in the tubular lumen associates with Na + , the most abundant cation in tubular fluid, and exits the proximal tubule.\nAcetazolamide and other CA inhibitors exert their effect within 30 minutes and maintain a t  , of approximately 13 hours. Over time, the effect of these drugs diminishes as a result of the reduction in plasma and filtered bicarbonate. Metabolic consequences of CA inhibitors include metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia results from enhanced delivery of sodium and bicarbonate to the principal cell, which promotes potassium secretion through a change in membrane potential.\nCalcium phosphate stones may also develop as a complication of therapy (urinary alkalinization). These drugs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis (increases serum ammonia [NH 3 ]) and those with uncorrected hypokalemia.

Adenomas may cause pressure symptoms, pain, and, rarely, thyrotoxicosis.\nb. Pathology. There are usually solitary lesions less than 3 cm in diameter that are well encapsulated and compress adjacent thyroid parenchyma. There is a sharp demarcation from surrounding thyroid with a variable amount of colloid, interstitial connective tissue, and acinal size.\n2. Cysts make up 10-25% of solitary nodules and usually represent cystic degeneration of follicular adenomas.\n3.

In man it contains about one million fibres, which are the axons of ganglion cells of retina. It passes through the optic canal to reach the middle cranial fossa, where it approaches and joins its counterpart of the other side to form the optic chiasma above the roof of pituitary fossa. Posteriorly the chiasma divides into two optic tracts which after winding round the cerebral peduncles end in the lateral geniculate body of the corresponding side. The optic nerve is about 4 cm in length. Throughout its course the nerve is surrounded by the extensions of the meninges, i.e. pia, arachnoid and dura mater. The meningeal extensions around the nerve fuse with the scleral coat of the eyeball. The subarachnoid space around the nerve is continuous with that of brain. The fibres arising from macula are numerous and form the papillomacular bundle .\nThe fibres of optic nerve arising in the nasal half of each retina (nasal fibres) enter the optic tract of the opposite side after crossing in the optic chiasma.\nIt is to be noted that immediately after crossing, these fibres loop forward for a short distance in the optic nerve. Therefore, a lesion affecting optic nerve just in front of optic chiasma leads to temporal field defect in opposite eye and blindness on the side of lesion. Fibres from temporal half of each retina (temporal fibres) enter the optic tract of the same side. Thus due to the decussation of nasal fibres of optic nerves in the optic chiasma, each optic tract contains the temporal fibres of the same side and nasal fibres of the opposite side.\n\n【5】##Lateral Geniculate Body\n\n【6】The structure of lateral geniculate body has already been discussed on page . This body (or nucleus) is the site of termination of all the optic nerve fibres except the few which reach and relay in the pretectal region and superior colliculus of the midbrain. These fibres form an afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. Recent studies show that geniculate body receives afferents from the visual cortex also.\n\n【7】##Geniculocalcarine Tract\n\n【8】Fibres arising from cells of lateral geniculate body constitute the geniculocalcarine tract . First these fibres pass through the retrolentiform part of the internal capsule, then they fan out to form the optic radiation which end in the visual cortex (area 17, 18 and 19) of the occipital lobe.

The entire neurologic history is acute; the first event occurred only 3 weeks ago. Although exact localization is not possible from the history alone, it appears that left peroneal fibers were affected 3 weeks ago (foot drop and numbness), followed by a similar event on the right side 1 week ago. One day ago, the left ulnar fibers became involved, with numbness of the ring and little fingers and weakness of grip.\nOn examination, there are bilateral foot drops, correlating with the patient's symptoms 1 and 3 weeks ago. In the left leg, some atrophy has developed as well. In the left hand, there are abnormalities in the ulnar nerve distribution, including weakness of the first dorsal interosseous, ADM, and flexor digitorum profundus muscles.\nThe weakness, along with decreased sensation over the left hypothenar region and fourth and fifth digits, clearly suggests involvement of the left ulnar nerve. Distal muscles that are innervated by different nerves (i.e., the extensor indicis proprius, APB, and flexor pollicis brevis) are all normal. This preferential involvement of only certain distal muscles would not occur in a typical distal axonal polyneuropathy.
