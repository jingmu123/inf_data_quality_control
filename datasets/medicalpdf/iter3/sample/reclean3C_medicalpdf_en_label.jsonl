Dystrophin is a 427-kd protein that links cytoskeletal actin to plasma membrane glycoproteins and is known to mechanically stabilize the cell membrane.删除16:<u> 125 </u>Cleavage of dystrophin results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, in turn leading to an increase in cell membrane permeability facilitating release of virus from the infected myocyte. 删除17:<u>111,113</u> Therefore, protease A mediated dystrophin cleavage facilitates release of infectious particles from the cardiomyocyte. Interestingly, viral protease mediated cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins is a phenomenon that is conserved among many viruses. For example, adenovirus can cleave the cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin. 删除13:<u>18 , 46</u>\n\n【3】##Host Defense\n\n【4】Host defense mechanisms can be divided into two categories: innate and adaptive. Both have been reviewed elsewhere  ; therefore, only examples of the processes are discussed here.  Although more effective, the onset of the adaptive immune response is slow (several days). Meanwhile, to prevent extensive damage by a pathogenic agent, the rapid, albeit nonantigenspecific, innate immune response is activated. It includes the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines.\n\n【5】##Innate Immune Mechanisms\n\n【6】##Natural Killer Cells\n\n【7】After coxsackievirus infection, NK cells are activated roughly 2 days postinoculation. Depletion of NK cells leads to increased viral replication in the heart, demonstrating the importance of this cell type in the innate host defense.删除16:<u> 127 </u>Although the mechanisms of target recognition by NK cells is not totally understood, they are able to identify infected cells and destroy them through perforin-mediated mechanisms. 删除17:<u>128</u>\n\n【8】##Double-Stranded Rna\n\n【9】Production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a part of the coxsackievirus replication cycle. It has been shown that dsRNA is able to directly stimulate a dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR).  A major substrate of PKR is the α subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2a). Phosphorylation of eIF-2a greatly reduces the rate of initiation of translation and inhibits viral translation. Production of dsRNA also activates NF- κ B in turn, leading to the production of several proinflammatory cytokines including IFN- α and IFN- β , IL- , IL- , IL- , and TNF- α . 删除17:<u>129</u>\n\n【10】##Nitric Oxide\n\n【11】NO is a reactive molecule produced by the nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) during the oxidation of the amino acid substrate L -arginine to L -citrulline. NO has been shown to play a major role in cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis and acts as a neurotransmitter and as a cytotoxic effector molecule of the immune system.Three distinct NOS isoforms have been identified: nNOS (NOS), iNOS (NOS), and eNOS (NOS). Both eNOS and nNOS are constitutively active, their activity is calcium and calmodulin dependent, and they have been shown to be expressed in the heart.The inducible form iNOS was first isolated from macrophages but has been shown to be expressed in many other cell types including cardiomyocytes.删除16:<u> 130 </u>It is transcriptionally regulated by several cytokines such as IL-1 β , TNF- α , and IFN- γ . Because these cytokines play a role in antiviral response, it was postulated that iNOS or more broadly NO could play a major role in the host defense against coxsackievirus infection.\nIn a cell culture model, an NO-donor inhibited coxsackievirus replication and viral protein synthesis.删除16:<u> 131 </u>In vivo, coxsackievirus infection in mice resulted in induction of iNOS in the heart. Pharmacologic inhibition of NOS increased the mortality and cardiac virus replication in these animals.删除16:<u> 132 </u>In addition, mice deficient in iNOS are more susceptible to coxsackieviral-mediated myocarditis  and pancreatitis.删除16:<u> 134 </u>The mechanisms by which NO can specifically inhibit coxsackievirus pathogenic effects may be related to protease inhibition. It was shown that NO can inhibit the catalytic activity of proteases A and C through S-nitrosylation of the catalytic cysteine. 删除17:<u>135,136</u>\n\n【12】##Apoptosis\n\n【13】页边侧栏删除：<u>Apoptosis may be used by the host to defend against invading microbes, as a way of getting rid of infected cells. Viruses can trigger apoptosis through cytotoxic T cells, viral-mediated disruption of cellular metabolism and cell cycle regulation, and induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNE  However, several viruses (adenovirus, cowpox, gamma herpes virus, poxvirus) have developed strategies to avoid apoptosis. Infection of cells with mutant viruses lacking the genes conferring antiapoptotic properties often results in premature programmed cell death and altered yields of progeny virus, indicating that antiapoptotic proteins are necessary for efficient virus replication. 删除17:<u>138,139</u> NF-KB is a transcription factor central to immune and inflammatory responses and to viral replication. 删除17:<u>129,140</u> Activation of NF- κ B also inhibits some forms of apoptosis.

Light rays pass through the cornea, the pupil, and lenses that focus the ray of light onto the retina located at the back of the eye. When light rays are not properly focused on the retina, the patient is unable to see clearly. Light rays focused in front of the retina cause myopia (nearsightedness), enabling patients to see things better near them than at a distance. Light rays focused behind the retina causes hyperopia (farsightedness), enabling patients to see things better at a distance than up close. When light rays are irregularly bent, images are blurred, resulting in astigmatism.\nA standard vision test is used to assess the patient's ability to see up close and at a distance. A standard vision test determines if the patient is experiencing peripheral vision difficulty or might have macular degeneration. A standard vision test determines the refractive error of the patient's eye, which determines the corrective lenses needed to restore the patient's eyesight. Patients who have myopia might be able to have this condition fixed by having corneal ring implants or by reshaping the cornea using photorefractive keratectomy. Glaucoma is caused by increased intraocular pressure. The healthcare provider assesses intraocular pressure by performing tonometry. If intraocular pressure is elevated, the healthcare provider may perform one of several procedures to relieve the pressure. Blood flow in the eye can be assessed by performing an eye angiogram, which detects a vitreous hemorrhage.\n\n【2】##28.2删除20:<u>8.2</u>Vision Tests\n\n【3】The healthcare provider examines the patient's peripheral vision and ability to see near distances and far distances along with the patient's ability to distinguish colors by performing nine vision tests:\n#Vision Tests And Procedures\n\n【4】1.

Field hockey may be played on a hard, indoor surface as well (there are no significant differences in the actual mechanisms of play between the two). The objective of the game is for the offence to move the ball up the field in order to score a goal. A goal can only be scored from within the defensive circle, which is marked on the field. Players may use only the flat side of their stick to play the ball. The ball can be raised only if it is safe to do so (i.e. the ball cannot be raised within 5 m of another player). Additionally, the ball cannot be played off the feet of any player, except the goalkeeper. Penalty corners may be awarded when a defender commits an offence within the circle. The game is played in 15-minute quarters with a 2-minute break between the first and second quarters, and then again between the third and fourth quarters. Halftime is 5 minutes in duration.\nThese rules have been adopted at both the NCAA and IFH level, with the exception that halftime is 10 minutes at the NCAA level. At the high school level, games are played in two 30-minute halves with a 10-minute halftime break. At all levels, teams switch sides of the field after halftime.\n页边侧栏删除：<u>\n#12.

The result is villous atrophy and crypt and Brunner gland (the structures labeled with the asterisks in the photomicrograph) hyperplasia. The presence of the mucus and bicarbonate (HCO  -) secreting Brunner's glands in the submucosal layer of the small intestine is an identifying feature of the duodenum. The Brunner's gland secretions function to neutralize the acidic pH of the stomach and establish the appropriate pH for function of the enzymes in the pancreatic juice. Parietal cells are unique to the stomach and synthesize acid (answer a) and intrinsic factor (required for vitamin B  absorption from the small intestine). Chief cells in the fundic glands produce pepsinogen ( answer c ) that is activated by acid to form pepsin. Paneth cells in the base of the crypts make lysozyme (answer d) and modulate the flora of the small intestine.

Contrary to what may be expected given the ligand-dependent toxic gain of function in the mutant AR protein, a cross-sectional study showed that patients with higher testosterone levels have better muscle strength and quality of life 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[4]</u></u>.\n</u>\n\n【6】##Management\n\n【7】There is currently no treatment known to reverse or stop the progression of the disease. Several interventions have been reported to be effective in transgenic mouse models, particularly androgen reduction therapy 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[18]</u></u>. However, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of the androgen-reducing agents leuprorelin and dutasteride have not shown significant effects on primary outcome measures related to muscle strength and function and swallow function overall. Nonetheless, there were some indications of efficacy, e.g. on swallow function in subjects who had been symptomatic for less than 10 years 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[17,19,20]</u></u>.\nThe focus of management of SBMA at present is to prevent complications of the disease and enhance mobility so that function can be preserved. Evaluation for physical therapy is usually helpful to identify patients who may benefit from braces and assistive devices to improve ambulation. Speech and swallowing function should also be assessed, and pulmonary function testing performed if impairment is suspected. An exercise programme tailored to the patient's level of function could also help to maintain and improve mobility.\nThe effect of exercise on progression of the disease remains uncertain, however. One study of eight subjects using moderate- intensity aerobic exercise found an increase in maximal work capacity, but an effect on maximal oxygen uptake and other measures was not detected 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>. It is possible that primary muscle involvement in SBMA attenuates the response to exercise. More studies are needed to assess whether functional exercise may be beneficial.\n\n【8】##Differential Diagnosis\n\n【9】The diagnosis of SBMA is relatively straightforward, given the characteristic clinical presentation and the availability of genetic testing. Accurate diagnosis is delayed for many patients however, in part due to a lack of general awareness of the disease. A recent cross-sectional study found an average time to diagnosis of  years from the onset of weakness and 3.5 years from first medical evaluation 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[4]</u></u>. A third of patients were misdiagnosed with ALS. Both diseases cause weakness and denervation, but ALS unlike SBMA typically has upper motor neuron involvement resulting in spasticity and hyperreflexia, and it usually shows greater asymmetry and progresses much more rapidly. Speech involvement in SBMA is characteristically more nasal sounding, as opposed to the upper motor neuron pattern of dysarthria in ALS. In its early stages SBMA may also be confused with myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory neuropathy, polymyositis, and metabolic myopathy.\n\n【10】##When To Think Of This Disorder\n\n【11】A male patient, who may have gynaecomastia, with slowly progressive muscle wasting and fasciculations in the absence of upper motor neuron signs.\n\n【12】##Conclusion\n\n【13】页边侧栏删除：<u>SBMA is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the AR gene on the X chromosome and results in muscle cramps, weakness, atrophy,</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " A D Video 6.1 Chin fasciculations in a patient with Kennedy disease.", "block_text_old": " A D Video 6.1 Chin fasciculations in a patient with Kennedy disease.", "raw_context": [{"text": "A D Video 6.1 Chin fasciculations in a patient with Kennedy disease.", "bbox": [73.0, 253.0, 355.0, 268.0]}], "block_type": "Caption", "full_blocks": [72.0, 252.0, 354.0, 267.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n action potentials may also be decreased [4].

Preterm births have been organized into two broad categories, spontaneous and indicated, based on the presence or absence of factors that place the mother or the fetus at risk 删除19:<u>(Meis et al., 1987, 1995, 1998)</u>. Spontaneous preterm births occur as a result of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes before 37 weeks of gestation and account for the majority of preterm births in developed countries. Preterm births that are the result of conditions that directly threaten the health of the mother or fetus, such as preeclampsia, placenta previa, and fetal growth restriction, are categorized as indicated preterm births and account for the remaining 25 to 30 percent of preterm deliveries 删除19:<u>(Meis et al., 1987, 1995, 1998)</u>. Although categorization of preterm births as indicated versus spontaneous allows analysis of preterm births according to those that might be prevented versus those that might be beneficial, there is increasing recognition that this distinction may understate the contribution of factors such as vascular compromise or fetal stress to the pathogenesis of preterm labor. This is suggested by reports that infants born after spontaneous preterm labor in the absence of apparent maternal disease have a higher than expected rate of poor intrauterine growth 删除19:<u>(Bukowski et al., 2005; Gardosi, 2005)</u>.删除7:<u> Figure  shows the negative skew in birth weights for fetuses destined for preterm birth versus the range of fetal weights of fetuses ultimately born at term.</u> Efforts to prevent preterm birth must therefore be applied and evaluated primarily for their effects on perinatal mortality and morbidity.</u>\nThe care of infants born preterm and their mothers may be described as primary (prevention and reduction of risk in the population), secondary (identification of and treatment for individuals with an increased risk), and tertiary (treatment aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality after the preterm parturitional process has begun). In the past 30 years, important strides in obstetric and neonatal tertiary care have been made to reduce the rates of infant morbidity and mortality related to preterm birth.

The dying must be helped to understand and supported in gaining the spiritual advice, symbolic supports and other rites that will ensure a safe – or safer – journey than they would otherwise enjoy if no preparations were undertaken.\n\n【1】Bloch 删除11:<u>( 1992 )</u> argues that rites give people a sense of social and personal power. Rites inject new energies into the social system; they revitalise, reenergise old ideas and roles. This has been a longstanding argument of Bloch's (Bloch & Parry  ; Bloch  ) and one that he has always tied to the idea of fertility and regeneration.\n\n【2】Death is often associated with a renewal of fertility, that which is renewed may either be the fecundity of the people, or of animals and crops, or of all three. In most cases what would seem to be revitalised in funeral practices is that resource which is culturally conceived to be most essential to the reproduction of the social order. (Bloch & Parry  : 7) And what is most essential to the reproduction of most social orders are the roles, statuses, and material symbols of political and administrative power.\nIn fact, so important are these sources of social renewal that most of any transfer of 'fertility' occurs well before the mortuary/funeral rites. They often begin during dying (if a 'dying' is possible) or even earlier if detection of the fading of one's social and political powers can be discerned earlier.\nIn fact, according to Goody (  : ), there is very often little property, for example to hand over at death, because much of it is physically if not legally transferred to children at adulthood. This transfer, as I have remarked earlier, is usually prescribed through a lifelong familiarity with the social and religious ideologies of ancestor worship.

The three key genes for viral function include gag , pol , and env.删除16:<u> 11 </u>The env gene in particular is crucial for determining the tropism of retro- and lentiviruses while also aiding in the formation of infectious particles.删除16:<u> 12 </u>Recombinant MMLV virus in any commercially available kit is most often produced using three separate plasmids; one plasmid with the gene of interest and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) necessary for reverse transcription, a second plasmid encoding for structural proteins in gag and reverse transcriptase and integrase within the pol gene, and a third plasmid encoding for env , a viral envelope protein most often derived from the protein coats of other viruses. 删除17:<u>26,34</u> Replication-deficient virus is now most often produced by co-transfection of three plasmids into mammalian cell lines such as HEK293 cells. The murine leukemia virus is currently in use for many of the retroviral vector therapy clinical trials.删除16:<u> 11\n</u>Recombinant retroviral vectors are capable of integrating into the host genome; so these vectors are a good choice to achieve germline transmission of a gene of interest or for use in embryonic stem cells. 删除17:<u>12,32</u> These vectors can stably infect dividing cells and are efficient in transferring genes in eukaryotic cells. Tissue-specific expression is also possible using these vectors by either introducing a tissue-specific promoter into the vector backbone or by choosing a pseudotyped recombinant expression of an envelope protein from a different virus to broaden its tropic binding to a greater number of cell types,  or by altering the cell-surface receptors on the target cell.删除16:<u> 21 </u>These vectors, however, are restricted to DNA fragment sizes of < 8 kb. 删除17:<u>11, 21</u> While these vectors infect dividing cells, infection of quiescent cells presents a challenge.

Hence, after the_last-minute attempt to avert the catastrophe, Mārīcā said to Rāvaṇa: \"What  can  I do when you are so wicked?  I am ready  to  go  to Rama's asrama.\nGod help you!\" Not minding the taunt, Ravana expressed his unabashed delight at Mārīca's consent. He applauded Mārīca  and said: \"That is the spirit, my friend: you are now the same old Mārīca that I knew.  I guess you had been possessed  by  some evil spirit a few minutes ago, on account of which you had begun to preach a different gospel. Let us swiftly get into this vehicle and proceed to our destination. As soon as  you  have accomplished the purpose, you are free to go and to do what you please.\"\n\n【1】Both of them got into the amphibian vehicle which behaved like an aerial car (for it was in fact a hovercraft),and quickly left the hermitage of Mārīca.  Once again they passed  forests, hills, rivers and cities: and soon they reached the neighbourhood of the hermitage of Rāma.  They  got  down  from that hovercraft which had been embellished with gold.  Holding Mārīca by the hand, Rāvaṇa said to him: \"Over there_ is  the hermitage of Rama, surrounded by banana plantations. Well,now, get going with the work for which we have come here.\"Immediately Mārīca transformed himself into an attractive deer.  It was extraordinary, totally unlike  any  deer  that  inhabited  the forest.   It was unique.   It  dazzled like a 'huge 'gem stone.\nEach part of its body had a different colour.  The colours had an unearthly brilliance and charm.  Thus  embellished by  the colours of all the precious stones, the deer which was the demon Mārīca,in disguise,roamed about near the hermitage of Rāma, nibblingGat the grass now and then. I At one time it came close to Sītā; then it ran away and joined the other deer grazing at a distance. It was very playful, jumping about and chasing its tail and spinning around.  Sitä went out to gather flowers.She cast a glance at that extraordinary and unusual deer.   As she did so, the deer too, sensing the accomplishment of  the mission, came_closer to her.  Then it ran away, pretending to  be afraid.  Sita  marvelled at the very appearance  of  this  unusual deer the like of which she had not seen before and which had the hue of jewels.\n\n【2】11th MAY 42 I I I jivan na yadi te 'bhyeti grahanam mrgasattamah\n\n【3】##Ajinam Narasardula Ruciram Me Bhavisyati 删除11:<u>(19)</u>\n\n【4】From  where she was gathering  flowers,  Sita, filled with wonder to see  that  unusual deer,  called out to Rama: re \"Come quick and see,删除16:<u>  0 </u>Lord;  come with your brother.   Look at this extraordinary creature. I have never seen such a beautiful deer before.\" Rama and Laksmana looked at the deer,  and Laksmana's suspicions were aroused: \"I am suspicious;  I think it a is nother same demon Mārīca in disguise.  I have  heard that Mārīca could assume any form at will, and through such tricks he had brought death and destruction to many ascetics in this forest. Surely, this deer is not real: no one has heard of a deer with rainbow colours, each one of its limbs  shining  resplendent  with  the colour of a different gem!  That itself  should  enable  us  to understand that it is a demon, not an animal.\"\n\n【5】Sita interrupted Laksmana's talk,  and  said: \"Never mind, one thing is certain;  this deer has captivated my mind.  It is such a dear. I have not seen such an animal near our hermitage!\nThere are many types of deer which roam about near the hermitage; this is just an extraordinary and unusual deer.\nIt is superlative in all respects: its  colour  is lovely, its texture is lovely, and even its voice sounds delightful.\n\n【6】would be a wonderful feat if it could be caught alive. We could use it as a pet, to divert our minds.  Later we could  take it to Ayodhya: and I am sure all your brothers and mothers would just adore it.

I am terribly curious.\"\n\n【7】In fact, Rama was curious, too! And so, he took Sita's side and said to Laksmana:* \"It is beautiful,  Laksmana.  It is unusual. I have never seen a creature like this. And, princes do hunt animals and cherish their skins. By sporting and  hunting kings acquire great wealth!  People  say  that that is real wealth which one pursues without premeditation.  So, let us try to get the deer or its skin.  If,  as you say, it is a demon in disguise, then surely it ought  to  be  killed  by  me, just as Vatapi who was tormenting and destroying sages and ascetics was justly killed by the sage Agastya.   Vatapi fooled the ascetics till he met the sage Agastya.  This  Mārīca,too, has fooled the ascetics so far: till coming to me today!   The  very beauty of his hide is his doom.  And, you, Laksmana,  please  guard  Sita with great vigilance,  till I kill this deer with just one shot and bring the hide along with me.\"\n\n【8】页边侧栏删除：<u>12th  MAY</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " I I I I I I", "block_text_old": " I I I I I I", "raw_context": [{"text": "I I I I I I", "bbox": [48.0, 50.0, 85.0, 63.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [47.0, 49.0, 84.0, 62.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n adrsta purvam tam drstvā nānāratnamayam mrgaṁ", "block_text_old": " adrsta purvam tam drstvā nānāratnamayam mrgaṁ", "raw_context": [{"text": "adrsta purvam tam drstvā nānāratnamayam mrgaṁ", "bbox": [48.0, 68.0, 399.0, 80.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [47.0, 67.0, 398.0, 79.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n vismayaṁ paramaṁ sftā jagāma janakātmajā (35)", "block_text_old": " vismayaṁ paramaṁ sftā jagāma janakātmajā (35)", "raw_context": [{"text": "vismayaṁ paramaṁ sftā jagāma janakātmajā (35)", "bbox": [47.0, 87.0, 399.0, 101.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [46.0, 86.0, 398.0, 100.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nR a v a n a w a s determined, and M a r f c a knew that there was no use arguing with him.

Since acute thrombosis is the common denominator of both DVT and myocardial infarction (and death from myocardial infarction), it is not surprising that the presence of residual venous thrombus at the time anticoagulants are discontinued following treatment for acute DVT may be a marker for a cardiovascular event. 删除13:<u>19 . 20</u>\nThere appears to be a definite association between idiopathic venous thromboembolic events and clinical cardiovascular disease. Patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE) were found to have more atherosclerotic risk factors than control subjects with VTE,  and the 10-year risk of a symptomatic cardiovascular event among patients with idiopathic DVT was 25.4% compared with 12.9% in those with a secondary venous thromboembolic event. 删除17:<u>22</u>\n\n【1】##Thrombus Resolution\n\n【2】Ideally, thrombus resolution would occur in all patients treated for DVT, thereby restoring vein patency and preserving valve function. Some recanalization of venous thrombi occurs in the majority of patients. Killewich et al.  showed that 86% of patients developed some recanalization within 3 months of initial thrombosis. Van Ramshorst et al.  likewise showed that 87% of patients with femoropopliteal DVT developed recanalization of occluded segments within 6 weeks. Tibial thrombi generally clear more rapidly, which may reflect the larger surface area of endothelium to thrombus volume, thereby improving efficiency of fibrinolysis in small veins.\nThe amount of recanalization that occurs is inversely correlated with the degree of activated coagulation and fibrinolytic inhibition. 删除17:<u>25.26</u> When observed clinically, older patients, veins with smaller thrombi, and nonocclusive thrombi have more effective recanalization and thrombus resolution than occluded veins and patients with multisegment venous thrombosis. Therefore, the initial volume of thrombus predicts the degree of recanalization. What is suggested but has not been confirmed is whether the thrombus burden is related to the level of activated coagulation factors and plasminogen activator inhibition (PAI).\n\n【3】##Dvt, Valve Function, And Recurrence\n\n【4】In his classic work, Sevitt  demonstrated that thrombosis often originated in the area of venous valves. While his work is frequently quoted, most fail to recognize that while the thrombus may surround the valve, often it is not attached to the valve cusp, but rather is attached to the vein wall above or below the valve. This suggests that there are functional differences of the endothelium covering the valve leaflet compared to the endothelium covering the vein wall.\nTh is specifi c issue has been studied by Brooks et al.,  who studied the venous endothelium on the vein wall adjacent to a vein valve cusp and the endothelium covering the valve in human saphenous veins. They demonstrated that endothelial protein C receptor activity and thrombomodulin (antithrombotic proteins) were present in significantly higher concentrations on the valve than the adjacent vein wall, and that von Willebrand factor (a procoagulant) was present in higher concentrations on vein wall endothelium than vein valve endothelium. These observations fit well with the ultrasound correlations of Killewich et al.,删除16:<u> 23\n</u>Markel et al.,  and Meissner et al.,  and help to explain their observations that rapid thrombus resolution preserved vein valve function. In these studies, rapid thrombus resolution was defined as occurring within 2 to 3 months of diagnosis.\nResolution that occurred beyond that time often resulted in valvular incompetence. This suggests that the valve leaflet is entrapped by the thrombus, and once fibrous attachment of the thrombus to a vein wall occurs and the leaflet is encompassed by the thrombus, the leaflet will no longer function, as it will be retracted with the fibrotic evolution (retraction) of the thrombus. On the other hand, if thrombus resolution occurs early, valve leaflets can return to normal function since thrombus was not attached to the valve cusp initially.\n\n【5】##Pathophysiology Of Postthrombotic Morbidity\n\n【6】页边侧栏删除：<u>Venous valvular dysfunction and venous obstruction are the two main components leading to ambulatory venous hypertension.

However, the name stuck and is still used to describe the smallest unit of all living things.\nSince the late 1800s, cell research has been exceptionally fruitful and has provided us with the following four concepts collectively known as the cell theory : .\n\n【1】A cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms. So, when you define cell properties, you are in fact defining the properties of life.\n\n【2】.\n\n【3】The activity of an organism depends on the collective activities of its cells.\n\n【4】According to the principle of complementarity , .\n\n【5】the activities of cells are dictated by their struc- ture (anatomy), which determines function (physiology).\n\n【6】.\nContinuity of life has a cellular basis.\nWe will expand on all of these concepts as we go along. Let's begin with the idea that the cell is the smallest living unit. Whatever its form, however it behaves, the cell contains all the parts necessary to survive in a changing world. It follows, then, that loss of cell homeostasis underlies virtually every disease.\nPerhaps the most striking thing about a cell is its organization. Yet if we chemically analyze cells, we find that they are made up primarily of the same four elements—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen—plus much smaller amounts of several other elements. (A detailed account of body chemistry appears in Chapter 2.)\nStrange as it may seem, especially when we feel our firm muscles, living cells are about 60 percent water, which is one of the reasons water is essential for life.\n\n【7】Continuity of life has a cellular basis.\n\n【8】##Did You Get It?\n\n【9】1. Define cell.\n\n【10】2. According to the cell theory, what the organism can do depends on _ _.

Here we will talk about the generalized cell , which demonstrates most of these typical features.\nIn general, all cells have three main regions or parts—a nucleus (nu'kle-us), a plasma membrane , and the cytoplasm (si'to-plazm\") . The nucleus is usually located near the center of the cell. It is surrounded by the semifluid cytoplasm, which in turn is enclosed by the plasma membrane, which forms the outer cell boundary.删除7:<u> 删除8:<u>(If you look ahead to Figure .</u></u>4 on p. 94, you can see a more detailed illustration of generalized cell structure.)\n\n【17】##The Nucleus\n\n【18】Anything that works, works best when it is controlled. For cells, \"headquarters,\" or the control center, is the nucleus ( nucle = kernel). The genetic material, or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) , is a blueprint that contains all the instructions needed for building the whole body; so, as you might expect, human DNA differs from frog DNA.\nMore specifically, DNA has genes, which carry the instructions for building proteins . DNA is also absolutely necessary for cell reproduction. A cell that has lost or ejected its nucleus (for whatever reason) is destined to \"self-destruct.\"\nAlthough the nucleus is most often oval or spherical, its shape usually conforms to the shape of the cell. For example, if the cell is elongated, the nucleus is usually elongated as well.

He recommended an approach to mental health that focused on the patient's total well-being. Beers' book A Mind That Found Itself 删除11:<u>(1908)</u>, and the National Committee for Mental Hygiene that he founded in 1909, influenced mental health services across the world.

It was at Bicêtre and Salpêtrière that he devised his traitement moral , and chains were removed from patients who had been restrained for decades. Pinel worked at Salpêtrière for the rest of his life and died in 1826.\n\n【6】##Key Works\n\n【7】页边侧栏删除：<u>1794 Memoir on Madness  Treatise on Insanity</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nSee also: Lithium and bipolar disorder 240 antipsychotics 241  ◾  Behavioral and cognitive therapy 242–243", "block_text_old": " See also: Lithium and bipolar disorder 240 antipsychotics 241  ◾  Behavioral and cognitive therapy 242–243", "raw_context": [{"text": "See also: Lithium and bipolar disorder 240", "bbox": [42.0, 51.0, 391.0, 64.0]}, {"text": "antipsychotics 241  ◾  Behavioral and cognitive therapy 242–243", "bbox": [43.0, 66.0, 376.0, 79.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [41.0, 50.0, 390.0, 78.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nThe managers of these institutions … are frequently men of little knowledge and less humanity …\nPhilippe Pinel\nTreatise on Insanity, 1801", "block_text_old": " The managers of these institutions … are frequently men of little knowledge and less humanity … Philippe Pinel Treatise on Insanity, 1801", "raw_context": [{"text": "The managers of", "bbox": [90.0, 182.0, 207.0, 198.0]}, {"text": "these institutions …", "bbox": [77.0, 199.0, 215.0, 212.0]}, {"text": "are frequently", "bbox": [100.0, 215.0, 195.0, 229.0]}, {"text": "men of little knowledge", "bbox": [69.0, 231.0, 228.0, 245.0]}, {"text": "and less humanity …", "bbox": [74.0, 247.0, 218.0, 260.0]}, {"text": "Philippe Pinel", "bbox": [91.0, 261.0, 204.0, 277.0]}, {"text": "Treatise on Insanity, 1801", "bbox": [79.0, 278.0, 218.0, 291.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [68.0, 181.0, 227.0, 290.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n the mentally ill.

The latter depends on the activity of both pre- and post-synaptic activity, and is exemplified by Hebbian learning. This is the process whereby long-term synaptic modifications organise neurons into functional networks called cell assemblies 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[  ]</u></u>. These can perform as associative memory engrams, with memory retrieval by the activation of a subset of the neurons within a given assembly. The (learnt) connections facilitate a network dynamics that can then spread activity to re-activate the whole assembly.

Processes such as  synaptic facilitation and short-term depression cause the amplitude of the response to depend on the recent history of pre-synaptic firing. To describe post-synaptic potentials accurately, one needs a formalism that accounts for these history-dependent effects 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[ 8 ]</u></u>. A natural way to incorporate such effects is to write where the factor A( T m ) scales the response evoked by an action potential by an amount that depends upon the details of the previous spike train data. A common model of facilitation or depression is to assume that between spikes, A(t) relaxes at a rate TA (on a time-scale slower than fast neural signalling though faster than experience-induced learning, so between milliseconds and minutes) to its steady-state value of one, but that directly after the arrival of a spike it changes discontinuously.\nFor facilitation, A is increased, whilst for depression, it is decreased. For example, after the arrival of a spike one could make the replacement A → κ A (multiplicative) or A -> A + ( K - 1) (additive) with K > 1 ( K < 1) for facilitation (depression).

Patients should not receive IV contrast with CT scans if creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL or higher.\n\nComplete blood count with platelets and differential : Assesses for an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) to evaluate for possible infection, baseline hemoglobin, and hematocrit.\n\nCoagulation studies (PT, PTT, INR): Assesses the potential for bleeding disorders, baseline INR (especially if on anticoagulation medications).\n\nUrinalysis: Always send a urine specimen to the lab for a macroscopic and a microscopic analysis. A macroscopic urinalysis will identify the presence of bacteria and red blood cells (RBC). Never rely on an office urinalysis; this can only give preliminary data on the presence of nitrates and/or blood, while a complete laboratory evaluation is important to evaluate for differential diagnosis.\n\nUrine culture and sensitivity: Sending the urine for a culture and sensitivity despite the results of the macro and microscopic urinalysis is a prudent choice, especially if the patient is symptomatic. The culture will identify the type of bacteria present, and sensitivities will identify the appropriate antibiotic to treat the bacteria present in the sample.\n\nUrine cytology: A urine cytology is the most valuable and reliable urine test to detect bladder cancer. A voided urine sample is sent for a laboratory evaluation to determine the presence of cancer cells. The results can be negative, positive, or atypical; atypical urine cytology does not necessarily confirm or deny the presence of cancer cells. Further evaluation based on risk factors and signs and symptoms is recommended. Urine cytology is most helpful in diagnosing high-grade tumors and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Low-grade noninvasive tumors may be missed by routine cytologic analysis. Urine cytology is also used for surveillance after the initial treatment of bladder cancer to detect a recurrence.\n\nFISH (UroVysion Fluorescence in situ hybridization): This is a urine-based genetic test for the diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer. This method detects genetic alterations of the urothelial cells found in the urine, using fluorescent DNA probes binding to the regions of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 as well as on the 9p21.\n\n(Riesz et al. 2007 ).

If these requirements are not fulfilled, urinary retention or residual urine will result (Andersson and Wein  ). Detrusor underactivity (DU) is defined as a contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or a failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span (Taylor and Kuchel  ). Theoretically, when the primary cause of emptying failure is insufficient strength of the detrusor, drugs stimulating bladder contraction via action on muscarinic receptors may be indicated. Carbachol and bethanechol are the two main agents that have been used clinically. Both are quaternary amines, not easily hydrolyzed by cholinesterases, fairly selective for muscarinic receptors with little (bethanechol) or some (carbachol) effect on nicotinic receptors, and they have no distinct receptor subtype selectivity (bethanechol possibly for M  receptors). For unclear reasons, both drugs have been considered to have some selectivity for the urinary bladder (Finkbeiner  ). When bethanechol is given subcutaneously to neurologically normal individuals, the effect on the bladder is characterized by an increased stiffness of the bladder wall at rest. This is reflected in high pressures in the cystometrogram, decreased capacity, and an increased awareness of the distended bladder, effects that may not result in an increase in urine flow rate during voiding.

Macfarlane Burnet proposed an alternative explanation of antibody formation, the clonal selection theory, in 1959 (Chapter 6). This theory hypothesized that specific antibody-forming cells exist prior to exposure to antigen and that antigen \"selects\" and activates the appropriate cell. For the next 10 years the mechanism of antibody formation was debated. Landsteiner's findings provided an argument for those immunologists who rejected the clonal selection theory. This \"Landsteiner problem\" remained a conundrum for the acceptance of the clonal selection theory and was only explained after the mechanisms of genetic rearrangement occurring in developing lymphocytes were unraveled in the 1970s and 1980s (Chapter 18).\n\n【1】##Self–Non-Self-Discrimination\n\n【2】A second hallmark of the adaptive immune response is self–non-self-discrimination. In 1901 , Paul Ehrlich 删除11:<u>(1854–1915)</u> and his associate Julius Morgenroth 删除11:<u>(1871– 1924)</u>, working at the Center for Serum Research and Testing in Stieglitz, Germany, realized that an immunological response against self might result in disease, possibly leading to death. They developed the concept of \"horror autotoxicus,\" literally that the body is prevented from acting against self, based on experiments in which they injected goats with their own erythrocytes or erythrocytes from other goats or other species. The antibodies that were produced lysed the red blood cells used for\n\n【3】##2. Hallmarks Of The Adaptive Immune Responses\n\n【4】页边侧栏删除：<u>stimulation. However, the injection of goats with their own red cells failed to induce antibody production.\nAlmost immediately after Ehrlich and Morgenroth developed the concept of \"horror autotoxicus\" other investigators provided conflicting observations. In 1903 , Paul Uhlenhuth immunized rabbits with lens protein from cattle. The antibodies produced by these rabbits precipitated lens proteins from several animal species, including lens proteins from rabbits. This suggested that rabbits could respond immunologically to their own tissue. However, these autoantibodies failed to induce any pathology in the rabbits producing them.\nThe initial observation of antibodies to self causing pathology was reported in a patient with the rare disease paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). PCH is characterized by the spontaneous lysis in vivo of red cells, particularly in parts of the body where the ambient temperature is less than the core temperature. In 1904 , William Donath and Karl Landsteiner, working in Germany, described antibody in patients with PCH that bound to the individual's own red cells and induced their destruction. The antibody is termed the Donath–\nLandsteiner antibody. Subsequently, other investigators have identified more than 80 diseases with a proven or suspected autoimmune etiology (Chapter ).\nWhile some individuals produce autoantibodies, most people do not develop autoimmune diseases.\nThe mechanism responsible for inhibiting pathologic self-reactivity remained undiscovered for more than 50 years. Finally, in 1959, Macfarlane Burnet suggested a process by which the immune system distinguished between self and nonself when he proposed his clonal selection theory (Chapter 6).

Types I and III are very similar with respect to the final esthetics once there is a color and contour pattern: they lack a visible line between the worn tooth and the prosthetic tooth. However, this type of buccal covering may not be acceptable in all patients due to the level of tooth wear and the possibility of an increase in the buccal volume.

All these alterations were made easier because once the mandible was corrected it was only necessary to fabricate a new complete denture on the maxilla.\n\n【4】##Conclusion\n\n【5】The overlay RPD treatment seems to be satisfactory, restoring the OVD and esthetics and providing greater muscle comfort for the patient with low cost and shorter working time. Further randomized clinical trials are suggested to compare the long-term effectiveness of different treatment options for the worn teeth associated with OVD loss.\n\n【6】##References\n\n【7】参考删除-0:<u>1.

Accumulating evidence from independent  studies revealed that the mean frequency of morphological changes of BD-IPMN, such as increased cyst size, increased MPD diameter, and/or appearance or enlargement of MNs, was 27.4 % (range,  %) of  followed-up patients (follow-up period,  years). Surgical resection was carried out in 9.9 % (range,  %) of all cases. Among the resected cases, 27.3 % were diagnosed histologically as malignant. During the follow-up period, malignant transformation was observed in only 2.7 %. BD-IPMNs without MNs have a low risk for malignant transformation regardless of cyst size at the initial diagnosis. Malignant transformation is associated with signs of progression especially appearance or enlargement of MNs and/or an increase in the MPD diameter. On the other hand, PDAC develops independently in the pancreas distinct from BD-IPMN. The mean frequency of PDAC occurrence was 2.8 % (range,  %) of all cases during the follow-up.\nIn conclusion, careful attention should be paid to the occurrence of PDAC in the entire pancreas in addition to progression of BD-IPMN when performing follow-up examinations in patients with BD-IPMN.\n\n【2】Keywords BD-IPMN\n•BD-IPMNs without MNs\n•Follow-up\n•Guideline 2012\n•Malignant transformation\n•MNs\n•Morphological changes\n•MPD diameter\n•Natural history\n•Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)\n•PDAC concomitant with IPMN\n•Progression H.

Constantini, MD, former head of the WHO Collaborating Center for Mycotoxins in Food and pulmonologist and clinical professor at the University of California has spent  years studying and collecting data on the role fungi and mycotoxins play in devastating diseases.  In his research he found a number of mycotoxins that demonstrate specific toxicity to the pancreas . The fusarium toxin fumonisin, T- mycotoxin and diacetoxyscripenol, all common in corn and its products, produce pancreatic cell damage.  Fumonisin contaminates corn with the greatest frequency and is present in corn in particularly high concentrations. Virtually all corn is contaminated with mycotoxins of one type or another.\n\n【1】Americans rely on corn for the majority of all the nutritive sweeteners they consume. Corn refiners produce three major classes of sweeteners: corn syrups , dextrose , and fructose . Another mainstay of the industry and of the U.S. economy -- is Starch. Americans rely on corn refiners for over 90 percent of their starch needs. In addition to starches, sweeteners and ethanol -- all made from the starch portion of the corn - - refiners produce Corn oil and a variety of important feed products. The mycotoxins, unregulated in the US, are in these products we are ingesting every day.\n\n【2】Dr David Wallinga gives us an added dimension and nightmare to consider when he says, \"Given how much high fructose corn syrup is consumed by children, it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered.\" Researchers in the US have found that much of the high fructose corn syrup that is increasingly replacing sugar in processed foods is tainted with mercury . They also tested many branded food products and found they too contained mercury. The findings come from two studies, one of which is published in the journal Environmental Health and the other is by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP).\n\n【3】We already know that sodium bicarbonate dramatically slows the progress of chronic kidney disease but few have followed the conclusion that it would also be a front line defense against diabetes. From prevention to treatment and to part of a cure, common Baking Soda is an essential tool in working with diabetic and metabolic syndromes.\n\n【4】Pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate decreases in severe malnutrition and it is known that most obese people are malnourished. The famous junk food diet that leads to diabetes is a diet guaranteed to create malnutrition and thus decreased bicarbonate flow as well as severe magnesium deficiencies, which itself is a major cause of diabetes. The more acid the foods the more bicarbonate is needed; so the pancreas gets further and further behind as the demand increases for alkaline buffers.\n\n【5】Sodium bicarbonate injections are already indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis, which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. But sodium bicarbonate can be used safely at home orally and transdermally (and should always be used with magnesium chloride for greatest effect) during all stages of diabetes.\n\n【6】Improper pH balance puts diabetics at greater risk for complications such as kidney failure, gangrene and blindness. A diabetic suffers from an excess of glucose in the bloodstream, glucose that cannot be delivered properly to the body's cells due to lack of insulin. As the liver absorbs more and more of the excess glucose, its ability to remove toxins from the body becomes impaired.\n\n【7】The dietary connection to environmental health is increasingly being made clear in that the causation of the major diseases related to diet are not due to the food but rather to the fungi and mycotoxins present in the food chain.\nA.V.

The structures of DA, NE, and epinephrine are remarkably similar, yet have different functions in the brain.\n\n【1】##Dopamine\n\n【2】The DA neurons constitute only about half a million of the cells in the brain—a tiny percentage out of the 100 billion total cells . Three nuclei contain the cell bodies that project the three primary branches of the DA network. The substantia nigra located in the ventral midbrain has primary projections to the caudate and putamen (collectively called the striatum ). This pathway is called the nigrostriatal system or mesostriatal system . As part of the basal ganglia, this pathway is integral to voluntary movement. Parkinson's disease is the result of a loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra. The extrapyramidal side effects due to antipsychotic medications can induce parkinsonian symptoms by blockade of these neurons.\nThe cells of the ventral tegmental area , also in the ventral midbrain, project to the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus.\nThese innervations, called the mesolimbocortical DA system , are particularly dense in primates. Some writers subdivide these branches into the mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus) and mesocortical FIGURE  system. The substantia nigra forms the nigrostriatal pathways to the caudate and putamen. The ventral tegmental area projects to the nucleus accumbens and cortex. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus projects to the tuberoinfundibular area of the hypothalamus.\n\n【3】##Disorders\n\n【4】The branches to the nucleus accumbens are involved with reward and substance abuse. The branches to the prefrontal cortex are involved with attention and cognition and seem to be impaired in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some speculate that problems with the mesolimbic system cause the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas negative symptoms are caused by impairment in the mesocortical system.\n\n【5】页边侧栏删除：<u>(prefrontal cortex) systems, which seems artificial as they originate from the same cell bodies.\nThe short tracts in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus—called the tuberoinfundibular DA system —release the DA into the portal veins of the pituitary gland.

Its main use is in the prevention or attenuation of recurrent episodes of mania and depression in individuals with bipolar mood disorder (manic depression). Lithium also has clearly established antimanic activity, although its relatively slow onset of action often necessitates the use of ancillary drugs, such as antipsychotic drugs and/or benzodiazepines, at the start of therapy. If lithium alone is ineffective for recurrent bipolar mood disorder, combining it or replacing it with carbamazepine or valproate may be of value; reports with lamotrigine and olanzapine are also encouraging.\nLithium also has antidepressant activity in bipolar disorder, has prophylactic value in recurrent major depression, and is a useful augmenting agent for antidepressantresistant depression. Other uses in psychiatry include schizoaffective disorder, emotional instability, and pathological aggression. The point prevalence of lithium use has been estimated to be as high as 1 in 1000 people in populations in industrial countries. The complex relation between sub-syndromal manifestations of bipolar disorder, particularly cognitive dysfunction, and the role that lithium might play in alleviating or aggravating this problem have been discussed in a thoughtful review 删除11:<u>(1)</u>.\nThe well-established effectiveness of long-term lithium in reducing manic-depressive morbidity includes a reduced risk of suicide and suicidal behavior. For example, in one study, suicidal acts per 1000 patient-years were  before lithium,  during lithium,  in the first year after withdrawal, and  in subsequent years 删除11:<u>(2)</u>. In another study, suicide rates during treatment with lithium were  per 1000 person-years (emergency department suicide attempts),  per 1000 person-years (suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization), and  per 1000 person-years (suicide deaths); the risk of suicide death was 2.7 times higher during treatment with divalproex than during treatment with lithium 删除11:<u>(3)</u>. A retrospective study divided high-risk patients into excellent, moderate, and poor responders to lithium and showed that no further suicide attempts occurred in 93%, 83%, and 49% respectively 删除11:<u>(4)</u>. The substantial reduction in suicidal tendency in the poor responder group suggested an antisuicidal effect of lithium beyond its mood-stabilizing properties, although the psychosocial benefits of lithium clinic treatment could have been contributing factors.\nSince bipolar disorder is a condition for which longterm treatment is usually necessary, both acute and long-term adverse effects are important, especially since patients in remission are often less likely to tolerate them 删除11:<u>(5)</u>. With this in mind, one might consider some speculatively positive findings involving the neurotropic and neuroprotective effects of lithium 删除11:<u>(6)</u>. The concentration of bcl-2, a cytoprotective protein, was upregulated by lithium in both rodent brains and human neuronal cells, as was the concentration of N -acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal viability and function, in human gray matter 删除11:<u>(7)</u>. In addition, a 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging study with quantitative brain-tissue segmentation showed that treatment with lithium for 4 weeks increased the total volume of gray matter by about 3% in eight of 10 patients in the depressed phase of bipolar I disorder.\nGuidelines for treating bipolar disorder, developed in a consensus meeting of experts, have been published by the British Association of Psychopharmacology 删除11:<u>(8)</u>. Lithium was recommended for many of the phases of bipolar disorder, often in combination with other treatments.\nAlthough the efficacy of lithium salts in the treatment of bipolar disorders, particularly in the prevention of recurrence of manic, hypomanic, mixed, and depressive episodes is well established, recent data suggest that it also has a prominent role in reducing the rate of suicide among patients with bipolar mood disorders.\nThe molecular effects of lithium have been reviewed 删除11:<u>(9)</u>. Its direct targets include inositol monophosphatase, inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, biophosphate nucleotidase, fructose 1, 6)biophosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, and glycogen synthase kinase-3.\nThese enzymes are largely phosphomonoesterases, which are magnesium-dependent. Lithium also has effects on adenylate cyclase, arachidonic acid, and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). MARCKS is a presynaptic and postsynaptic protein that affects cellular signalling and cytoskeletal plasticity, and its expression is regulated by lithium 删除11:<u>(10)</u>.\nDuring  a number of clinical trials were reported involving acute and maintenance studies of lithium, mostly either comparing new atypical antipsychotic drugs with lithium in bipolar disorder or in combined treatment studies. Of the relatively few studies of the adverse effects of lithium, most clustered in the areas of cardiovascular effects and issues regarding lithium toxicity.\n\n【2】##Efficacy Of Lithium\n\n【3】页边侧栏删除：<u>Bipolar illness appears to be a changing illness. A comparison of psychiatric services in North-West Wales in the 1890s and the 1990s has shown that the rate of admissions increased from  every 10 years to  every 10 years 删除11:<u>(11)</u>. Similarly, the daily hospital occupancy rate for patients with bipolar affective disorder rose from 16 per million to 24 per million. While acknowledging that there have been many social changes that may have contributed to these differences, the authors suggested that current treatments leave much to be desired.

The incidence of postoperative shivering may be as high as 65% after general anesthesia and 33% with epidural anesthesia.

Forced air warmers can be used to actively warm patients with postoperative hypothermia. 删除11:<u>(687)</u> 68. Patient-related factors associated with an increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) include female gender (postpuberty), nonsmoking status, age less than 50 years, and history of motion sickness or PONV.\nAnesthetic factors include use of volatile anesthetics or nitrous oxide, administration of large doses of neostigmine, and perioperative opioids.\nSignificant surgical factors include type of procedure, such as eye muscle or middle ear surgery, gastric distention as in swallowed blood, and duration of surgery. 删除11:<u>(687)</u> 69. There is a simplified risk score for identifying patients at risk for PONV. It is a four-point score that allots a single point for each of the following factors: 删除11:<u>(1)</u> female gender, 删除11:<u>(2)</u> history of motion sickness or PONV, 删除11:<u>(3)</u> nonsmoking, and 删除11:<u>(4)</u> use of postoperative opioids. A score of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 corresponds to an incidence of 10%, 21%, 39%, 61%, and 79%, respectively. 删除11:<u>(688)</u> 70. Modifications of the anesthetic technique that may prevent PONV include avoidance of general anesthesia, preferential use of propofol infusions, avoidance of nitrous oxide and volatile anesthetics, minimization of opioid administration, and adequate hydration. Although prophylactic measures to prevent PONV are more effective than rescue drugs administered in the PACU, some patients have PONV despite prophylaxis. Several drugs are available for the treatment of PONV, including scopolamine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, droperidol, metaclopromide, ondansetron, dolasetron, and dexamethasone.\nDexamethasone is most effective when given prophylactically at the start of surgery, and ondansetron is most effective when given 30 minutes before the end of anesthesia. 删除11:<u>(688)</u> VOMITING . Residual effects of anesthetic or sedating drugs are the most common cause of delayed awakening in the PACU. If narcotic or benzodiazepines are suspected, then careful titration of the reversal drugs naloxone and flumazenil can be used. For example, in adults - to - µ g increments of naloxone are used to avoid abrupt reversal of analgesia and associated hypertension and tachycardia. The use of flumazenil should be done with caution to avoid precipitation of seizures. Both naloxone and flumazenil have short half-lives, so the patient should be carefully observed for resedation. Rarely physostigmine may be used to reverse the CNS effects of anticholinergic drugs. Hypothermia and hypoglycemia should also be considered as potential causes of delayed awakening postoperatively. In rare cases computed tomographic imaging may be indicated to rule out an intracerebral event. 删除11:<u>(689)</u> 72. PACU discharge criteria are based on the principles that patients must be observed until they are no longer at risk for respiratory depression and their mental status has returned to baseline. No specific length of stay is required, and hemodynamic parameters are based on the patient's baseline measurements.\n\n【5】页边侧栏删除：<u>CRITERIA</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Body Temperature And Shivering\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Body Temperature  And Shivering\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "BODY TEMPERATURE ", "bbox": [74.0, 87.0, 223.0, 104.0]}, {"text": "AND SHIVERING", "bbox": [106.0, 104.0, 222.0, 120.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [73.0, 86.0, 222.0, 119.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Postoperative Nausea And\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Postoperative Nausea And\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "POSTOPERATIVE", "bbox": [104.0, 295.0, 223.0, 311.0]}, {"text": "NAUSEA AND", "bbox": [125.0, 313.0, 222.0, 327.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [103.0, 294.0, 222.0, 326.0], "position": 6, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Delayed\nAwakening\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Delayed Awakening\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "DELAYED", "bbox": [155.0, 696.0, 221.0, 711.0]}, {"text": "AWAKENING", "bbox": [131.0, 712.0, 221.0, 728.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [130.0, 695.0, 220.0, 727.0], "position": 8, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nDISCHARGE", "block_text_old": " DISCHARGE", "raw_context": [{"text": "DISCHARGE", "bbox": [138.0, 919.0, 221.0, 935.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [137.0, 918.0, 220.0, 934.0], "position": 9, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n 66.

Alterations in the activities of these molecules and interactions between them drive the pathophysiological changes responsible for both peripheral IR and central AD, while feed-forwarding the existent condition related to oxidative stress .\n\n【2】1. Brain AngII is always present in abnormally high quantities in many cardiovascular diseases. Central infusion of AngII significantly promoted β -amyloid production. Excess AngII is linked to increased blood pressure, decreased cerebrovascular compliance, and enhanced brain inflammation, which are all recognized risk factors for AD, whereas ATR blockade suppressed such processes 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[126]</u></u>. Altogether, AngII is a crucial mediator in AD; just it has been in IR.\n\n【3】2. The increased Sirt activity is the major player and determinant in the Sirt and Sirt deficient state of chronic oxidative state. Sirt2-promoted tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of aggregated tau and neuronal loss. Small molecule inhibitors of Sirt have been found to ameliorate neurodegeneration, whereas Sirt activation can be protective against amyloid toxicity in AD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[127]</u></u>. Furthermore, Sirt deficiency negatively regulates the interaction with FOXO1 for the transcription of gene encoding Rictor 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[128,129]</u></u>. Thereby, oxidative stress disrupts the mTORC2 formation and impairs Akt signaling, potentiating the insulin resistance.\nSirt2-mediated deacetylation of FOXO proteins is unregulated in oxidative stress, causing an imbalance in the activities of FOXO1 and FOXO3. While FOXO3 activity decreases due to the enhanced FOXO3 degradation, JNK- mediated FOXO1 phosphorylation leads to the nuclear translocation and increased transcriptional activity of FOXO1. Enhanced FOXO1 activity accounts for the systemic low-grade inflammation, which is the important hallmark of IR and AD. Continuously increased FOXO1 activity is also responsible from the major impairments in insulin sensitive tissues: (a) attenuation of glucose transport into adipocyte and muscle cells; (b) augmentation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis; (c) leading to the metabolically active peripheral adipose tissue loss that disrupts energy conservation and secretion of adiponectin. On the other hand, deregulated nuclear FOXO1 function may lead to a transcription dependent mechanism of cell death in post-mitotic neurons 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[130]</u></u>.\n\n【4】3. Nuclear FOXO3 activity protects neurons from insults relevant to neurodegeneration 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[131]</u></u>.The loss of FOXO3 function impairs the cellular antioxidative stress function, autophagy and the physiological regulation of insulin sensitivity, and may promote carcinogenesis through the genomic instability.\nFurthermore, the inhibition of AMPK-FOXO3 loop, which is associated with increased longevity, disrupts the thioredoxin induced defense against oxidative stress. Moreover, FOXO1-induced increase in Txnip expression may even worsen the existing oxidative load.\n\n【5】4. A number of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, have been called \"protein misfolding disorders\" due their characteristic pathology that is closely correlated with intracellular redox status. A general decrease in Trx levels in AD brain regions was demonstrated that is consistent with the presence of high levels of β -amyloid in these regions 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[132]</u></u>. Trx inhibitor Txnip is early overexpressed in the hippocampus of an AD mice model. Therefore, Txnip is an intriguing candidate molecule that may provide a common link between brain IR and AD.
