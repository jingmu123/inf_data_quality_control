Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**There's no cure for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse.**\n\n【3】Your treatment will depend on the stage of your CKD.\n\n【4】The main treatments are:\n\n【5】*   lifestyle changes – to help you stay as healthy as possible\n*   medicine – to control associated problems, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol\n*   dialysis – treatment to replicate some of the kidney's functions, which may be necessary in advanced (stage 5) CKD\n*   kidney transplant – this may also be necessary in advanced (stage 5) CKD\n\n【6】Lifestyle changes\n-----------------\n\n【7】The following lifestyle measures are usually recommended for people with kidney disease:\n\n【8】*   stop smoking if you smoke\n*   eat a healthy, balanced diet\n*   restrict your salt intake to less than 6g a day – that's around 1 teaspoon\n*   do regular exercise – aim to do at least 150 minutes a week\n*   manage your alcohol intake so you drink no more than the recommended limit of 14 units of alcohol a week\n*   lose weight if you're overweight or obese\n*   avoid over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional – these medicines can harm your kidneys if you have kidney disease\n删除7：<u>Find out more about living with CKD and what you can do to stay healthy.</u>\n\n【9】Medicine\n--------\n\n【10】There's no medicine specifically for CKD, but medicine can help control many of the problems that cause the condition and the complications that can happen as a result of it.\n\n【11】You may need to take medicine to treat or prevent the different problems caused by CKD.\n\n【12】### High blood pressure\n\n【13】Good control of blood pressure is vital to protect the kidneys.\n\n【14】People with kidney disease should usually aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg, but you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg if you also have diabetes.\n\n【15】There are many types of blood pressure medicines, but medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are often used. Examples include ramipril, enalapril and lisinopril.\n\n【16】Side effects of ACE inhibitors can include:\n\n【17】*   a persistent dry cough\n*   dizziness\n*   tiredness or weakness\n*   headaches\n\n【18】If the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given a medicine called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) instead.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how high blood pressure is treated. </u>\n\n【19】### Diabetes or high ACR\n\n【20】If you also have type 2 diabetes or a high albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) you may be offered a type of medicine called an SGLT2 inhibitor, such as dapagliflozin, as well as medicines for high blood pressure.\n\n【21】Dapagliflozin helps to lower your blood sugar and can reduce damage to your kidneys.\n\n【22】You may also be given an additional medicine called finerenone to take with dapagliflozin. Finerenone works by blocking the action of certain hormones that can damage your kidneys.\n\n【23】### High cholesterol\n\n【24】People with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke.\n\n【25】This is because some of the causes of kidney disease are the same as those for cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\n【26】You may be prescribed medicines called statins to reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Examples include atorvastatin and simvastatin.\n\n【27】Side effects of statins can include:\n\n【28】*   headaches\n*   feeling sick\n*   constipation or diarrhoea\n*   muscle and joint pain\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how high cholesterol is treated.</u>\n\n【29】### High potassium levels\n\n【30】People with CKD can develop high potassium levels in their blood, called hyperkalaemia, because their kidneys do not work properly.\n\n【31】Hyperkalaemia can cause muscle weakness, stiffness and tiredness. If it becomes severe, it can cause an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) which can lead to a heart attack.\n\n【32】If you have CKD, it's important to avoid taking potassium supplements and some medicines used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure because they can make your potassium levels too high. Talk to a GP about the medicines you take if you're worried.\n\n【33】A medicine called sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can be used to treat hyperkalaemia in adults, but only if it's used:\n\n【34】*   in emergency care for acute life-threatening hyperkalaemia alongside standard care\n*   in people with hyperkalaemia that does not get better, CKD stage 3b to 5, or heart failure\n\n【35】People with hyperkalaemia that does not get better (called persistent CKD) who also have CKD stage 3b to 5, or heart failure, should only take sodium zirconium cyclosilicate if they:\n\n【36】*   have a serum potassium level of at least 6.0 mmol/litre and\n*   are not also taking a certain amount of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor because of hyperkalaemia and\n*   are not on dialysis\n\n【37】You should stop taking sodium zirconium cyclosilicate if RAAS inhibitors are no longer suitable for you.\n\n【38】### Water retention\n\n【39】You may get swelling in your ankles, feet and hands if you have kidney disease.\n\n【40】This is because your kidneys are not as effective at removing fluid from your blood, causing it to build up in body tissues (oedema).\n\n【41】You may be advised to reduce your daily salt and fluid intake, including fluids in food such as soups and yoghurts, to help reduce the swelling.\n\n【42】In some cases you may also be given diuretics (tablets to help you pee more), such as furosemide.\n\n【43】Side effects of diuretics can include dehydration and reduced levels of sodium and potassium in the blood.\n\n【44】### Anaemia\n\n【45】Many people with advanced-stage CKD develop anaemia, which is a lack of red blood cells.\n\n【46】Symptoms of anaemia include:\n\n【47】*   tiredness\n*   lack of energy\n*   shortness of breath\n*   a pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\n\n【48】If you have anaemia, you may be given injections of a medicine called erythropoietin. This is a hormone that helps your body produce more red blood cells.\n\n【49】If you have an iron deficiency as well, iron supplements may also be recommended.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how iron deficiency anaemia is treated.</u>\n\n【50】If you have anaemia but do not have iron deficiency, you may be given a medicine called Roxadustat. This medicine helps your body to produce more red blood cells and comes as tablets.\n删除6：<u>#### Want to know more? \n\n【51】*   National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease\n\n【52】</u>\n### Bone problems\n\n【53】If your kidneys are severely damaged, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it.\n\n【54】Along with calcium, phosphate is important for maintaining healthy bones. But if your phosphate level rises too much, it can upset the balance of calcium in your body and lead to thinning of the bones.\n\n【55】You may be advised to limit the amount food you eat which are high in phosphate, such as red meat, dairy products, eggs and fish.\n\n【56】If this does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. Commonly used medicines include calcium acetate and calcium carbonate.\n\n【57】Some people with CKD also have low levels of vitamin D, which is necessary for healthy bones.\n\n【58】If you're low in vitamin D, you may be given a supplement called colecalciferol or ergocalciferol to boost your vitamin D level. \n\n【59】### Glomerulonephritis\n\n【60】Kidney disease can be caused by inflammation of the filters inside the kidneys, known as glomerulonephritis.\n\n【61】In some cases this happens as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking the kidneys.\n\n【62】If a kidney biopsy finds this is the cause of your kidney problems, you may be prescribed medicine to reduce the activity of your immune system, such as a steroid or a medicine called cyclophosphamide.\n删除6：<u>#### Want to know more?\n\n【63】*   Kidney Care UK: medicines for chronic kidney disease\n\n【64】**Improving muscle strength**\n</u>\n-----------------------------\n\n【65】If you are having a bad flare-up and are unable to exercise, you may be offered electrical stimulation to make your muscles stronger.\n\n【66】This is where electrodes are placed on your skin and small electrical impulses are sent to weak muscles, usually in your arms or legs.\n\n【67】Dialysis\n--------\n\n【68】For a small proportion of people with CKD, the kidneys will eventually stop working.\n\n【69】This usually happens gradually, so there should be time to plan the next stage of your treatment.\n\n【70】One of the options when CKD reaches this stage is dialysis. This is a method of removing waste products and excess fluid from the blood.\n\n【71】There are 2 main types of dialysis:\n\n【72】*   haemodialysis – this involves diverting blood into an external machine, where it's filtered before being returned to the body\n*   peritoneal dialysis – this involves pumping dialysis fluid into a space inside your tummy to draw out waste products from the blood as they pass through vessels lining the inside of your tummy\n\n【73】Haemodialysis is usually done about 3 times a week, either at hospital or at home. Peritoneal dialysis is normally done at home several times a day, or overnight.\n\n【74】If you don't have a kidney transplant, treatment with dialysis will usually need to be lifelong.\n\n【75】Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each type of dialysis and which type you would prefer if your kidney function becomes severely reduced.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【76】*  删除7：<u>Find out more about dialysis</u>\n*   Kidney Patient Guide: treating kidney failure with dialysis\n*   Kidney Care UK: dialysis\n\n【77】</u>\nKidney transplant\n-----------------\n\n【78】An alternative to dialysis for people with severely reduced kidney function is a kidney transplant.\n\n【79】This is often the most effective treatment for advanced kidney disease, but it involves major surgery and taking medicines (immunosuppressants) for the rest of your life to stop your body attacking the donor organ.\n\n【80】You can live with one kidney, which means donor kidneys can come from living or recently deceased donors. \n\n【81】But there's still a shortage of donors, and you could wait months or years for a transplant.\n\n【82】You may need to have dialysis while you wait for a transplant.\n\n【83】Survival rates for kidney transplants are very good. About 90% of transplants still function after 5 years and many work usefully after 10 years or more.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【84】*  删除7：<u>Find out more about kidney transplants</u>\n*   Kidney Patient Guide: transplants\n*   Kidney Care UK: kidney transplant\n\n【85】</u>\nSupportive treatment\n--------------------\n\n【86】You'll be offered supportive treatment if you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they're not suitable for you. This is also called palliative or conservative care.\n\n【87】The aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure. It includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and planning for the end of life.\n\n【88】Many people choose supportive treatment because they:\n\n【89】*   are unlikely to benefit from or have a good quality of life with treatment\n*   do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis\n*   are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits\n*   have been on dialysis, but have decided to stop this treatment\n*   are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious illness, such as severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life\n\n【90】Supportive care through the kidney unit can still help you to live for some time with a good quality of life.\n\n【91】Doctors and nurses will make sure you receive:\n\n【92】*   medicines to protect your remaining kidney function for as long as possible\n*   medicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin\n*   help to plan your home and money affairs\n*   bereavement support for your family\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【93】*   Cruse Bereavement Care\n*   Kidney Patient Guide: the emotional effects of kidney failure\n*   Kidney Research UK: information on choosing not to start dialysis\n*   Kidney Care UK: deciding not to have dialysis (conservative treatment)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 March 2026</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:40", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:53", "cost": 13.412}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:40"}

It's responsible for more than 7 out of 10 cases.\n\n【5】Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).\n\n【6】If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than someone who does not smoke.\n\n【7】Frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer.\n\n【8】While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer.\n\n【9】These products include:\n\n【10】*   cigars\n*   pipe tobacco\n*   snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)\n*   chewing tobacco\n\n【11】Smoking cannabis may also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Most people who smoke cannabis mix it with tobacco. While they tend to smoke less tobacco than people who smoke regular cigarettes, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.\n\n【12】Radon\n-----\n\n【13】Radon is a natural radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.\n\n【14】If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you smoke. Radon gas causes a small number of lung cancer deaths in England.\n\n【15】Occupational exposure and pollution\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Exposure to certain chemicals and substances which are used in several occupations and industries may increase your risk of developing lung cancer.

They do not affect hair on the head.\n\n【7】Other symptoms of pubic lice include:\n\n【8】*   itching, which is usually worse at night\n*   small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)\n*   white/yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)\n*   dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo)\n*   crusted or sticky eyelashes, if they're affected\n\n【9】Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   you think you might have pubic lice\n\n【11】Pubic lice will not go away without treatment.\n\n【12】If you're sure you have pubic lice, you may be able to get treatment from a pharmacist.\n\n【13】Find a sexual health clinic\n\n【14】What happens at your appointment\n--------------------------------\n\n【15】If you go to a sexual health clinic or GP surgery because you think you have pubic lice, a doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice.\n\n【16】They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected, such as your armpits, chest or eyelashes.\n\n【17】To help spot any lice, they might use a comb and a magnifying lens.\n\n【18】If they think you might have caught the lice during sex, they may ask about your sexual partners. They may also suggest getting tested for any sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n【19】Treatment for pubic lice\n------------------------\n\n【20】The main treatments for pubic lice are medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.\n\n【21】You usually need to use the treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You'll need to repeat this again a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.\n\n【22】You may be asked to come back a week after you finish treatment, to check if the treatment has worked.\n\n【23】Any current or recent sexual partners should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms.\n\n【24】How to stop pubic lice spreading\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】While you're being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice spreading to others and stop the lice coming back.\n\n【26】### Do\n\n【27】*   wash your clothes and bedding on a hot wash (50C or higher), get them dry cleaned, or put them in a plastic bag for at least a week – this will help kill any lice\n\n【28】*   vacuum your mattress to remove any lice\n\n【29】### Don’t\n\n【30】*   do not share clothes, bedding or hygiene products (such as razors)\n\n【31】*   do not have close body contact (including sexual contact) with anyone else during treatment\n\n【32】How you get pubic lice\n----------------------\n\n【33】Pubic lice are mainly spread by close body contact, most commonly sexual contact.\n\n【34】The lice cannot jump or fly, but can climb from one person to another.\n\n【35】You can also catch the lice from clothes, bedding or towels used by someone with pubic lice, but this is rare.\n\n【36】How to avoid getting pubic lice\n-------------------------------\n\n【37】It can be hard to prevent pubic lice.\n\n【38】The only way to avoid getting them is to avoid having sexual contact (or sharing bedding or clothing) with anyone you know who has pubic lice, until they've been treated.\n\n【39】Condoms and other forms of contraception will not protect you from pubic lice. But it's still a good idea to use condoms during sex because they reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:21", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:27", "cost": 5.826}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:21"}

This is known as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).\n\n【13】Symptoms of an underactive thyroid can include:\n\n【14】*   sensitivity to cold\n*   tiredness\n*   weight gain\n*   constipation\n*   depression\n\n【15】An underactive thyroid is sometimes only temporary, but often it's permanent and long-term treatment with thyroid hormone medicine is needed.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how an underactive thyroid is treated</u>\n\n【16】Pregnancy problems\n------------------\n\n【17】It's very important that you use contraception if:\n\n【18】*   you’re taking carbimazole\n*   you’ve had radioactive iodine treatment in the last 6 months\n\n【19】Both treatments can harm your unborn baby.\n\n【20】Tell your doctor immediately if you’re planning a pregnancy or become pregnant while taking carbimazole, or after having radioactive iodine treatment within the past 6 months.\n\n【21】If you have an overactive thyroid during pregnancy and your condition is not well controlled, it can increase the risk of:\n\n【22】*   pre-eclampsia\n*   miscarriage\n*   premature labour and birth (before the 37th week of pregnancy)\n*   your baby having a low birthweight\n\n【23】Your doctor will want to check whether your condition is under control, and if you’re taking carbimazole they may recommend switching to a treatment that will not affect your baby, such as the medicine propylthiouracil.\n\n【24】Thyroid storm\n-------------\n\n【25】Rarely, an undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a serious, life-threatening condition called a thyroid storm.\n\n【26】This is a sudden flare-up of symptoms that can be triggered by:\n\n【27】*   an infection\n*   pregnancy\n*   not taking your medicine correctly\n*   damage to the thyroid gland, such as a punch to the throat\n\n【28】Symptoms of a thyroid storm include:\n\n【29】*   a rapid heartbeat\n*   a high temperature\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n*   severe agitation and confusion\n*   loss of consciousness\n\n【30】**A thyroid storm is a medical emergency.

This is to provide a comparison if you develop shortness of breath or a persistent dry cough while taking it. But most people tolerate methotrexate well.\n\n【19】It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It's important to keep taking the medicine, even if you do not notice it working at the beginning.\n\n【20】It's important to take methotrexate as instructed by your doctor, and see your doctor if you have any side effects.\n\n【21】You may have to try 2 or 3 types of DMARD before you find the one that's most suitable for you.\n\n【22】Once you and your doctor find the most suitable DMARD, you'll usually have to take the medicine long term.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【23】*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: DMARDs\n\n【24】</u>\nBiological treatments\n---------------------\n\n【25】Biological treatments, such as adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【26】They're usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD, and are usually only used if DMARDs have not been effective on their own.\n\n【27】Biological medicines are given by injection. They work by stopping particular chemicals in your blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints.\n\n【28】Side effects from biological treatments are usually mild but include:\n\n【29】*   skin reactions at the site of the injections\n*   infections\n*   feeling sick\n*   a high temperature\n*   headaches\n\n【30】Some people may also be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB) if they have had them in the past.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【31】*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): biologic treatments\n\n【32】</u>\nJAK inhibitors\n--------------\n\n【33】JAK inhibitors are a new type of medicine available on the NHS for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【34】They are offered to people who cannot take DMARDs or biologicals, or tried them but found they were not effective.\n\n【35】This medicine is usually used in combination with methotrexate.\n\n【36】JAK inhibitors can also be taken on their own by adults who cannot take methotrexate.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【37】*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): JAK inhibitors\n\n【38】</u>\nMedicine to relieve pain\n------------------------\n\n【39】In addition to the medicines used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medicine specifically to relieve pain.\n\n【40】### Painkillers\n\n【41】In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers, such as paracetamol or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol), to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【42】These medicines do not treat the inflammation in your joints, but they may be helpful in relieving pain in some people.\n\n【43】### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n【44】In addition to, or instead of, painkillers such as paracetamol, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n\n【45】This may be a traditional NSAID, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac. Or your doctor may prescribe a type called a COX-2 inhibitor, such as celecoxib or etoricoxib.\n\n【46】These medicines can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time.\n\n【47】Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take, and the benefits and risks associated with it.\n\n【48】Although uncommon, taking NSAIDs can increase the risk of serious stomach problems, such as internal bleeding.\n\n【49】This is because the medicines can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids.\n\n【50】If you're prescribed NSAID tablets, you'll often be given another medicine to take with it, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).\n\n【51】Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining.\n\n【52】### Steroids\n\n【53】Steroids are powerful medicines that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation.\n\n【54】They can be given as:\n\n【55】*   a tablet (for example, prednisolone)\n*   an injection directly into a painful joint\n*   an injection into a muscle (to help lots of joints)\n\n【56】They're usually used to provide short-term pain relief – for example, while you're waiting for DMARD medicines to take effect or during a flare-up.\n\n【57】Steroids are usually only taken for a short time because long-term use can have serious side effects, such as:\n\n【58】*   weight gain\n*   osteoporosis (weakening of the bones)\n*   easy bruising\n*   muscle weakness\n*   thinning of the skin\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【59】*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): managing the pain of rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【60】</u>\nSupportive treatments\n---------------------\n\n【61】Your doctor may also refer you to other services that might be able to help you with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.\n\n【62】### Physiotherapy\n\n【63】A physiotherapist may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible.\n\n【64】If your hands or wrists are affected, you can try a tailored hand exercise programme. This involves face-to-face sessions with a trained therapist and doing the exercises yourself at home.\n\n【65】A physiotherapist may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).\n\n【66】A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【67】### Occupational therapy\n\n【68】If rheumatoid arthritis causes you problems with everyday tasks, occupational therapy may help.\n\n【69】An occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you're at home and at work.\n\n【70】Using a support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help you open jars or turn on taps.\n\n【71】### Podiatry\n\n【72】If you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help.\n\n【73】You may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【74】*   Versus Arthritis: managing your symptoms\n*   Versus Arthritis: treatments for arthritis\n*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): rheumatoid arthritis healthcare\n\n【75】</u>\nSurgery\n-------\n\n【76】Sometimes, despite taking medicines, your joints may still become damaged.

A Mediterranean-style diet, which is based on vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, beans, cereals, grains, fish and unsaturated fats such as olive oil, is recommended.\n\n【101】There's also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medicines you may be taking.\n\n【102】For example, calcium and vitamin D supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you're taking steroids, and folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【103】*   Versus Arthritis: complementary and alternative treatments\n*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: diet\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 March 2026</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:08", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:27", "cost": 19.194}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:08"}

The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol μ followed by the letter g (μg).\n\n【6】Folic acid reduces the risk of your baby having a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.\n\n【7】A neural tube defect is when the foetus's spinal cord (part of the body's nervous system) does not form normally.\n\n【8】You might be advised to take a higher dose supplement of 5 milligram (5mg) every day.\n\n【9】You may need to take a 5mg supplement of folic acid if:\n\n【10】*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a neural tube defect\n*   you previously had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a family history of neural tube defects\n*   you have diabetes\n\n【11】Your doctor may also recommend a a 5mg supplement if you take certain medicines, such as anti-epilepsy medicine or anti-retroviral medicine for HIV.\n\n【12】Talk to a GP if you think you need a 5mg dose of folic acid, as they can prescribe a higher dose.\n\n【13】You can get folic acid tablets at pharmacies, or talk to a GP about getting a prescription.\n\n【14】Do not worry if you get pregnant unexpectedly and were not taking a folic acid supplement at the time. Start taking them as soon as you find out, until you're past the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【15】Stop smoking\n------------\n\n【16】Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to a variety of health problems, including:\n\n【17】*   premature birth\n*   low birth weight\n*   sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death\n*   miscarriage\n\n【18】Quitting can be hard, no matter how much you want to, but support is available.\n\n【19】NHS Quit Smoking offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking, including when you're pregnant, and can give you details of local support services.\n\n【20】Smoke from other people's cigarettes can damage your baby, so ask your partner, friends and family not to smoke near you.\n\n【21】Cut out alcohol\n---------------\n\n【22】Do not drink alcohol if you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Alcohol can be passed to your unborn baby.\n\n【23】Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby, and the more you drink, the greater the risk.\n\n【24】Find out about alcohol and pregnancy.\n\n【25】Keep to a healthy weight\n------------------------\n\n【26】If you're overweight, you may have problems getting pregnant and fertility treatment is less likely to work.\n\n【27】Being overweight (having a BMI over 25) or obese (having a BMI over 30) also raises the risk of some pregnancy problems, such as high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis, miscarriage and gestational diabetes.\n\n【28】Before you get pregnant you can calculate your BMI. But this may not be accurate once you're pregnant, so consult your midwife or doctor.\n\n【29】Having a healthy diet and doing moderate exercise are advised in pregnancy, and it's important not to gain too much weight.\n\n【30】You can keep to a healthy weight by having a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n删除7：<u>Read more about exercise in pregnancy</u>\n\n【31】Know which medicines you can take\n---------------------------------\n\n【32】Not all medicines are safe to take when you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, whether they're on prescription or medicines you can buy in a pharmacy or shop.\n\n【33】Information:\n\n【34】If you take prescribed medicine and you're planning to get pregnant, talk to a doctor.\n\n【35】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to a doctor.\n\n【36】Find out about medicines in pregnancy.\n\n【37】Vaccinations and infections\n---------------------------\n\n【38】Some infections, such as rubella (German measles), can harm your baby if you catch them during pregnancy.\n\n【39】Most people in the UK are immune to rubella, thanks to the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.\n\n【40】If you have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, or you're not sure if you have, ask your GP surgery to check your vaccination history.\n\n【41】If you have not had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP surgery.\n\n【42】You should avoid getting pregnant for 1 month after having the MMR vaccination, which means you'll need a reliable method of contraception.\n\n【43】Talk to a doctor if you have a long-term condition\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】If you have a long-term condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes, it could affect the decisions you make about your pregnancy – for example, where you might want to give birth.\n\n【45】Before you get pregnant, have a discussion with your specialist or a GP about getting pregnant.\n\n【46】You can also talk to your GP if you have a mental health condition and are planning to get pregnant. They may be able to refer you to a specialist mental health team who offer support before, during and after pregnancy.\n\n【47】If you're taking medicine for a condition, do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor.\n\n【48】Testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia\n----------------------------------------\n\n【49】Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia are inherited blood disorders that mainly affect people whose ancestors come from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.\n\n【50】If you are pregnant and live in England you will be offered screening tests for these disorders, but you do not have to wait until you're pregnant before you have a test.\n\n【51】If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier for 1 of these disorders, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before starting a family.\n\n【52】You can ask for a free blood test from either a GP or a local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia in pregnancy</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Trying for a baby\n-------------------------\n\n【53】*   Trying to get pregnant\n*   Getting pregnant if you have a mental health condition\n*   Planning your pregnancy\n*   Doing a pregnancy test\n*   Signs and symptoms of pregnancy\n*   How long does it usually take to get pregnant?\n*   Planning another pregnancy\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:34:41", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:25", "cost": 44.102}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:34:40"}

CHD is a condition in which the coronary arteries (the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood) become clogged with deposits of fats such as cholesterol and other substances.

Most boys with the condition are otherwise completely healthy.\n\n【14】Being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) and having a low birth weight and a family history of undescended testicles may increase the chances of a boy being born with the condition.\n\n【15】Diagnosing undescended testicles\n--------------------------------\n\n【16】Undescended testicles can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination.\n\n【17】This will determine whether the testicles can be felt near the scrotum (palpable) or if they can't be felt at all (impalpable).\n\n【18】This physical examination can sometimes be difficult, so your doctor may need to refer your child to a paediatric surgeon.\n\n【19】No further scans or tests are needed to locate the testicles if they can be felt by the doctor.\n\n【20】If they can't be felt, part of the initial surgical treatment may involve keyhole surgery (a diagnostic laparoscopy) to see if the testicles are inside the abdomen.\n\n【21】How undescended testicles are treated\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】If the testicles haven't descended by 6 months, they're very unlikely to do so and treatment will usually be recommended.\n\n【23】This is because boys with untreated undescended testicles can have fertility problems (infertility) in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer.\n\n【24】Treatment will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum. This is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate.\n\n【25】Surgery is ideally carried out before 12 months of age. If undescended testicles are treated at an early age, the risk of fertility problems and testicular cancer can be reduced.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating undescended testicles.</u>\n\n【26】Retractile testicles\n--------------------\n\n【27】In most boys, the testicles can move in and out of the scrotum at different times, usually changing position as a result of temperature changes or feelings of fear or excitement.\n\n【28】If the testicles move in and out of the scrotum and do not stay ascended, this is known as retractile testicles.\n\n【29】Retractile testicles in young boys aren't a cause for concern, as the affected testicles often settle permanently in the scrotum as they get older.\n\n【30】But they may need to be monitored during childhood because they sometimes don't descend naturally and treatment may be required.\n\n【31】See your GP if you notice that your child's testicles are not within the scrotum. Your GP can carry out an examination to determine whether your child's testicles are undescended or retractile.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 October 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:36", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:45", "cost": 9.003}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:35"}

Risks</u>\n\n【2】**It's important to take good care of your eye after a cornea transplant to help ensure a good recovery and reduce the risk of complications.**\n\n【3】After the procedure\n-------------------\n\n【4】Most people have to stay in hospital for a night after a full-thickness cornea transplant (penetrating keratoplasty). \n\n【5】You may be able to go home the same day if you have a partial-thickness transplant. \n\n【6】Your eye may be covered with an eye pad or plastic shield, which is removed the day after the procedure.\n\n【7】When it's taken away, you may find that your sight is blurred. This is normal.\n\n【8】There should not be serious pain after the operation, but there might be some swelling and discomfort.\n\n【9】If you have had an endothelial keratoplasty – a type of partial-thickness transplant that uses an air bubble to hold the donated cornea in place – you may be asked to lie on your back as much as possible in the first few days after surgery.\n\n【10】This can help hold the transplant in the correct place. The air bubble will be absorbed after a few days.\n\n【11】Looking after your eye\n----------------------\n\n【12】Once you return home after the procedure, you'll need to take good care of your eye.\n\n【13】Some important points to remember include:\n\n【14】*   do not rub your eyes\n*   during the first weeks after surgery, avoid strenuous exercise and heavy lifting\n*   if you have a job that does not involve physical strain, you can return to work 2 to 3 weeks after surgery\n*   if your job involves manual labour, you should wait for 3 to 4 months\n*   avoid smoky or dusty places as this could irritate your eyes\n*   if your eye is sensitive to light, wearing sunglasses can help\n*   avoid contact sports and swimming until you're given clear advice that it's safe, and wear protective goggles when resuming contact sports\n*   bath and shower as normal, but be careful not to get water in your eye for at least a month\n*   do not drive until your specialist tells you it's possible\n\n【15】You'll usually be given a patch to wear at night for the first few weeks after surgery to help protect your eye.\n\n【16】For all types of cornea transplant, you have to use steroid or antibiotic eyedrops daily.\n\n【17】These are normally required for several months, although some people may need to use them for more than a year.\n\n【18】The drops reduce swelling and inflammation, and help prevent infection and rejection.\n\n【19】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【20】At first you'll need to attend regular follow-up appointments. These should gradually become less frequent over time.\n\n【21】If stitches were used to hold the transplant in place, these are initially left in place to allow the cornea to heal. They're usually removed after about a year.\n\n【22】Your vision\n-----------\n\n【23】The time it takes for your vision to return after a cornea transplant can range from as little as a few weeks up to a year or more.\n\n【24】This largely depends on the specific procedure used. In some cases, your vision may fluctuate between being better or worse before it settles down.\n\n【25】It's likely you'll need corrective lenses (either glasses or contact lenses), even after your vision returns.\n\n【26】In some cases, a small operation called arcuate keratotomy (AK) or laser treatment is used to correct vision problems after your eyes have healed.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : How it is performed</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Risks</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:06", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:24", "cost": 17.79}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:06"}

But in alkaptonuria a substance produced along the way, homogentisic acid, cannot be broken down any further.\n\n【5】This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down does not work properly. Enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen.\n\n【6】One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours.\n\n【7】If this sign is missed or overlooked in a baby or child, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s.\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms in adults\n----------------------------\n\n【9】Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body.\n\n【10】It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems.\n\n【11】### Joints and bones\n\n【12】When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 30s, they may start to experience joint problems.\n\n【13】Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness, followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are similar to the early symptoms of osteoarthritis. \n\n【14】Eventually, cartilage – a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body – may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations may be needed.\n\n【15】### Eyes and ears\n\n【16】Many people develop brown or black spots on the whites of their eyes.\n\n【17】Another sign in many adults with alkaptonuria is thickening of ear cartilage. The cartilage may also look blue, grey or black. This is called ochronosis.\n\n【18】The earwax may be black or reddish-brown.\n\n【19】Alkaptonuria can cause dark spots in the whites of the eyes\n\n【20】Alkaptonuria can thicken the ear cartilage and make it look blue-black\n\n【21】### Skin and nails\n\n【22】Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish or brownish colour.\n\n【23】The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found – the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area.\n\n【24】### Breathing difficulties\n\n【25】If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\n\n【26】### Heart, kidney and prostate problems\n\n【27】Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to narrow, harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken.\n\n【28】This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements.\n\n【29】The deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones.\n\n【30】How alkaptonuria is inherited\n-----------------------------\n\n【31】Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents.\n\n【32】One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell.\n\n【33】The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid.\n\n【34】You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the condition is very rare.\n\n【35】The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they will not have any signs or symptoms of the condition.\n\n【36】How alkaptonuria is managed\n---------------------------\n\n【37】Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition.\n\n【38】A medicine called nitisinone is used to slow the advance of alkaptonuria in adults.\n\n【39】Painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms.\n\n【40】### Nitisinone\n\n【41】Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It’s offered at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients, based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital.\n\n【42】Find out about the National Alkaptonuria Centre and nitisinone treatment on the Alkaptonuria Society website\n\n【43】### Diet\n\n【44】A protein-controlled diet can be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian will assess and advise you about this.\n\n【45】### Exercise\n\n【46】If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints.\n\n【47】Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms.\n\n【48】But avoid exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby. Gentle exercise such as yoga and pilates might help in the early stages, while cycling, walking and swimming may be more suitable for advanced alkaptonuria.\n\n【49】Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints.\n\n【50】### Pain relief\n\n【51】Speak to a doctor about painkillers and other techniques to manage pain.\n\n【52】Find tips for managing your pain levels about with 10 ways to reduce pain.\n\n【53】### Emotional support\n\n【54】A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed.\n\n【55】But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website, a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers.\n\n【56】### Surgery\n\n【57】Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened.\n\n【58】Your doctor may recommend:\n\n【59】*   hip replacement\n*   knee replacement\n*   aortic valve replacement\n\n【60】Outlook\n-------\n\n【61】People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will eventually experience symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints and spine, which can affect quality of life.\n\n【62】Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around.\n删除12：<u>Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support.</u>\n\n【63】Sharing your information\n------------------------\n\n【64】If you or your child have alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass relevant patient information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【65】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the NCARDRS register on GOV.UK</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:54:14", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:54:25", "cost": 11.139}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:57", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:54:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:54:14"}

More than 95% of people will be cured if they take their antibiotics correctly.**\n\n【3】You may be started on antibiotics once test results have confirmed you have chlamydia. But if it's very likely you have the infection, you might be started on treatment before you get your results.\n\n【4】The two most commonly prescribed antibiotics for chlamydia are: \n\n【5】*   doxycycline – taken every day for a week\n*   azithromycin – one dose of 1g, followed by 500mg once a day for 2 days\n\n【6】Your doctor may give you different antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or erythromycin, if you have an allergy or are pregnant or breastfeeding. A longer course of antibiotics may be used if your doctor is concerned about complications of chlamydia.\n\n【7】Some people experience side effects during treatment, but these are usually mild. The most common side effects include stomach ache, diarrhoea, feeling sick, and thrush in women.\n\n【8】When can I have sex again?\n--------------------------\n\n【9】If you had doxycycline, you shouldn't have sex – including vaginal, oral or anal sex, even with a condom – until both you and your partner(s) have completed treatment.\n\n【10】If you had azithromycin, you should wait 7 days after treatment before having sex (including oral sex).\n\n【11】This will help ensure you don't pass on the infection or catch it again straight away.\n\n【12】Will I need to go back to the clinic?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【13】If you take your antibiotics correctly, you may not need to return to the clinic.\n\n【14】However, you will be advised to go back for another chlamydia test if:\n\n【15】*   you had sex before you and your partner finished treatment\n*   you forgot to take your medication or didn't take it properly\n*   your symptoms don't go away\n*   you're pregnant\n\n【16】If you're under 25 years of age, you should be offered a repeat test for chlamydia 3 to 6 months after finishing your treatment because you're at a higher risk of catching it again.\n\n【17】Testing and treating sexual partners\n------------------------------------\n\n【18】If you test positive for chlamydia, it's important that your current sexual partner and any other recent sexual partners you've had are also tested and treated.\n\n【19】A specialist sexual health adviser can help you contact your recent sexual partners, or the clinic can contact them for you if you prefer.\n\n【20】Either you or someone from the clinic can speak to them, or the clinic can send them a note to let them know they may have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\n【21】The note will suggest that they go for a check-up.

It also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.\n\n【4】When morphine blocks the pain, there are other unwanted effects, for example, slow or shallow breathing. It also slows down digestion, which is why morphine can cause constipation.\n\n【5】How long will it take to work?\n\n【6】This depends on the type of morphine you take.\n\n【7】A morphine injection into a vein gives the quickest pain relief. It works almost straight away.\n\n【8】Morphine tablets and liquid work in 30 to 60 minutes but wear off after 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【9】Slow-release morphine can take a day or two to start working but the pain relief will last for longer.\n\n【10】How will it make me feel?\n\n【11】When you first take morphine, you might feel sleepy or sick. But this side effect will wear off after a few days as your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【12】You might also notice you are less alert. Do not drive, cycle or operate machinery if you feel sleepy or less alert.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】Some people with conditions that need long-term pain relief may need to take morphine for a long time.\n\n【15】If you need to take it for a long time your body can become used to it (known as tolerance). That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【16】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【17】It's possible to become addicted to morphine. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only having the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【18】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop morphine.\n\n【19】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【20】How will I know if I'm addicted?\n\n【21】If you're addicted to morphine, you may find it difficult to stop taking it or feel you need to take it more often than necessary.\n\n【22】If you stop taking morphine suddenly you may get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【23】These can include:\n\n【24】*   feeling agitated or anxious\n*   panic attacks\n*   feeling your heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   shaking\n*   sweating\n*   body aches\n*   feeling restless\n\n【25】Talk to your doctor if you:\n\n【26】*   are worried about addiction\n*   need help with addiction\n*   want to stop taking morphine\n\n【27】Is morphine a controlled medicine?\n\n【28】Morphine is a controlled medicine. This means there are strict rules on how it's prescribed and dispensed to make sure it's not given to the wrong person or misused.\n\n【29】When you collect morphine your pharmacist will ask for proof of your identity such as your passport or driving licence. You'll also be asked to sign the back of your prescription, to confirm that you've received it.\n\n【30】If you're collecting morphine for someone else, you're legally required to show the pharmacist proof of your identity if asked.\n\n【31】How can I tell what type of morphine I'm taking?\n\n【32】Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure what type of morphine you're taking.\n\n【33】Standard tablets are known by the brand name Sevredol.\n\n【34】Slow-release tablets are also known as MST Continus or Morphgesic SR. Slow-release capsules are also known as MXL or Zomorph.\n\n【35】Are there other painkillers I can try?\n\n【36】The type of painkiller that's best for you depends on what type of pain you have and the cause of your pain.\n\n【37】If morphine does not get rid of your pain or it becomes less effective, discuss this with your doctor.\n\n【38】Is morphine only used at the end of life?\n\n【39】Morphine is not only used at the end of a terminal illness. It's the amount of pain you have, not the stage of your illness, that decides whether morphine is prescribed for you.\n\n【40】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【41】Morphine does not affect any type of contraception including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【42】But if morphine makes you sick (vomit), your contraceptive pill may not protect you from pregnancy. If this happens, follow the instructions in the leaflet that comes with your contraceptive pill.\n\n【43】Find out what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick\n\n【44】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【45】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if morphine makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions. This may be more likely when you first start taking morphine but could happen at any time, for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【46】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【47】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much morphine is in your body.\n\n【48】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking morphine.\n\n【49】Read more on the law on drugs and driving from GOV.UK\n\n【50】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【51】It may be best not to drink alcohol while taking morphine as it may make you feel more sleepy or increase the risk of serious side effects.\n\n【52】It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of treatment until you see how the morphine affects you.\n\n【53】If you feel sleepy with morphine, stop drinking alcohol while you are taking it.\n\n【54】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【55】If you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine or heroin, while you're taking morphine, you're more likely to get the serious side effects of morphine including breathing difficulties, heart problems such as high blood pressure, seizures or fits and even going into a coma.\n\n【56】Some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, will also increase morphine side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness.\n\n【57】Taking heroin while you're on prescribed morphine is especially dangerous. You're more likely to get all the side effects of morphine, including addiction.\n\n【58】Tell your doctor if you think you may take recreational drugs while you're on morphine.\n\n【59】You can read more about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n删除11：<u>More in Morphine\n----------------\n\n【60】*   About morphine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking morphine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 January 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:41:03", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:41:10", "cost": 7.021}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:41:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:41:03"}

This is because the medicine works best when your bowels are empty.\n\n【9】After you use the foam, try not to poo again for at least a few hours. For the medicine to work properly it needs to stay inside your bowel as long as possible.\n\n【10】### How to use it\n\n【11】1.  Read the instruction leaflet. The pictures show you exactly how to use the foam.\n2.  If you're using it for the first time, remove the plastic flap (or safety lock) from underneath the dome-shaped pump at the top of the can.\n3.  Wash your hands before and after using the foam.\n4.  Push a new applicator onto the nozzle. This nozzle sticks out beneath the dome at the top of the can.\n5.  Shake the can for about 15 seconds.\n6.  Twist the rounded dome at the bottom.\n7.  Put your index finger on top of the dome and turn the can upside down. It's important to keep the can as straight (vertical) as possible.\n8.  Stand with one leg raised on a chair – or lie down on your side if you prefer. Gently put the applicator into your bottom as far as possible.\n9.  Push the dome down fully once.\n10.  Then release the dome slowly. The foam comes out of the spray can when you do this.\n11.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before removing the applicator from your bottom. This is important to make sure you get the full dose and to stop any foam spilling out.\n12.  Twist the dome at the base and remove the applicator from the nozzle. This stops any foam coming out when you're not using it. Put the applicator in the plastic bag provided and throw the bag away.\n\n【12】**Budesonide enemas**\n---------------------\n\n【13】This medicine comes as liquid and tablets that you mix together. Once made up, it contains a 2mg dose of budesonide.\n\n【14】It's best to use budesonide enemas at night, just before going to bed.\n\n【15】It's best to go to the toilet before using the enema. This is because it's more comfortable if you empty your bowels and bladder before using it.\n\n【16】You may want to sleep on a towel or similar covering. This is to protect your bedding from stains.\n\n【17】### How to use a budesonide enema\n\n【18】You should have 1 bottle of liquid, 1 nozzle and enema tablets.\n\n【19】1.  Check the instruction leaflet first. The pictures show you exactly how to prepare and use the enema.\n2.  Take a bottle of the liquid and unscrew the cap.\n3.  Remove 1 tablet from the foil strip and drop it into the bottle of liquid.\n4.  Replace the cap and screw firmly back onto the bottle.\n5.  Shake the bottle well for at least 15 seconds, or until the tablet has dissolved in the liquid.\n6.  Remove the cap and screw the nozzle tightly onto the top of the bottle.\n7.  The enema is now ready and should be used immediately.\n8.  Wash your hands before and after using the enema.\n9.  Lie on your side, with your bottom slightly higher than the rest of your body. You can use a pillow to lift your bottom up. You may want to lie on a towel.\n10.  Put one of the disposable plastic bags provided over your hand (like a glove) and pick up the bottle.\n11.  Shake the bottle and remove only the protective cap that covers the nozzle (do not unscrew the nozzle itself).\n12.  Gently push the nozzle into your bottom as far as is comfortable. You can use a lubricant if you find this uncomfortable.\n13.  Squeeze the bottle to push the liquid into your bottom. It's normal for some liquid to be left in the bottle afterwards.\n14.  Remove the nozzle from your bottom.\n15.  Put the bottle into the disposable plastic bag by rolling the bag off your hand and over the bottle, ready to throw away.\n16.  Roll onto your front and wait for 5 minutes. This will stop any liquid coming out of your bottom.\n17.  For sleeping, find a comfortable position that keeps the liquid in your bottom for as long as possible. The longer it stays there, the better it will work.\n\n【20】How long to use it for\n----------------------\n\n【21】Your doctor will tell you how long to use budesonide rectal foam or enemas for. This will usually be for no longer than 8 weeks. Do not use budesonide rectal foam or enemas for more than 8 weeks without speaking to a doctor.\n\n【22】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【23】If you forget to use your budesonide rectal foam or enema, use it as soon as you remember unless it's nearly time for the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【24】Never use 2 doses to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【25】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to use this medicine.\n\n【26】If you use too much\n-------------------\n\n【27】Using too much budesonide is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【28】If you're worried, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist.\n删除11：<u>More in Budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】*   About budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 11:20:34", "endTime": "2024/09/05 11:21:36", "cost": 61.376}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 19:21:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 19:20:32"}

It makes your blood clot more slowly.\n\n【3】Blood clotting (thickening) is a complicated process involving substances called clotting factors.\n\n【4】Clotting factors are made by the liver and help stop bleeding. They work with blood cells called platelets that trigger the clotting process to make sure your blood clots properly.\n\n【5】To make some of the clotting factors, the liver needs a good supply of vitamin K.\n\n【6】Warfarin blocks the liver from using vitamin K to make clotting factors. This thins your blood, so it takes longer to clot.\n\n【7】How long does it take to work?\n\n【8】Warfarin takes about 3 days to work fully.\n\n【9】But it can take weeks or even months before you settle on the right dose.\n\n【10】This is because everyone reacts differently to warfarin, so it's normal for your dose to go up and down when you first start taking it.\n\n【11】You will not feel any different while you take warfarin. The only way to check it's working is to have a blood test to see how long your blood takes to clot.\n\n【12】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【13】Do not stop taking warfarin without talking to your doctor.\n\n【14】If you stop taking warfarin, your blood will start clotting at the same rate as before you started taking it, usually within a day or two of stopping.\n\n【15】This means you may be at an increased risk of serious problems like strokes, heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.\n\n【16】Are there any other medicines for blood clots?\n\n【17】Warfarin is one of the oldest and most commonly used anticoagulants.\n\n【18】There are newer anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban and edoxaban.\n\n【19】Warfarin does not seem to be any better or worse than newer anticoagulants at treating and preventing blood clots.\n\n【20】But the newer anticoagulants may be more convenient because you do not need to have regular blood tests or be quite as careful about what you eat.\n\n【21】Will I need to stop warfarin before surgery?\n\n【22】Because of the risk of bleeding, your dose of warfarin may need to be lowered or stopped a few days before you have an operation.\n\n【23】Tell the surgeon or nurse that you're taking warfarin.\n\n【24】Also tell anyone else involved with your care, such as your anticoagulant specialist, so they can arrange any changes to your medicine for you.\n\n【25】Will I need to stop warfarin before dental treatment?\n\n【26】You can still go to your dentist as usual. But tell your dentist that you're taking warfarin before you have any treatment, especially if you need to have a tooth out.\n\n【27】You may need to have blood tests before starting treatment to make sure your blood will clot enough to stop any bleeding.\n\n【28】Before taking out a tooth, your dentist will need to know how well your blood is clotting. This will be checked using the international normalised ratio (INR) test.\n\n【29】Most people do not need to change their warfarin dose.\n\n【30】Can I have vaccinations?\n\n【31】It's safe for you to have vaccinations, but tell the nurse or doctor that you're taking warfarin.\n\n【32】If the vaccine is normally given by injection into the muscle, provided you're up to date with your blood tests and the results are within the target range, you can have the injection as normal into muscle.\n\n【33】Or sometimes the injection can be given into the layer of fat underneath your skin. This is called a subcutaneous injection.\n\n【34】It might help prevent bruising if you press on the injection site for 10 minutes after the vaccination.\n\n【35】Can I have a tattoo or piercing?\n\n【36】Having a body piercing or tattoo is not recommended while you're taking warfarin. This is because of the increased risk of bleeding and infection.\n\n【37】If you still want to go ahead, talk to your doctor about your specific risks in case you need antibiotics or changes to your warfarin dose.\n\n【38】And let the tattooist or piercer know beforehand that you're taking an anticoagulant medicine.\n\n【39】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【40】There's no evidence that taking warfarin affects your sex life.\n\n【41】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【42】Warfarin does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【43】But you'll need to have an international normalised ratio (INR) blood test when you start or stop taking contraception.\n\n【44】This is to check whether your warfarin dose is still at the right level or needs to be changed.\n\n【45】Can I drink alcohol while taking warfarin?\n\n【46】You can drink alcohol while taking warfarin.\n\n【47】But drinking heavily, especially binge drinking lots of alcohol in one go, is dangerous while taking warfarin. The alcohol can increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n【48】Can I take recreational drugs with warfarin?\n\n【49】It's thought that cannabis can affect your blood tests and increase your risk of serious bleeding.\n\n【50】It's not clear how other recreational drugs like cocaine and heroin affect warfarin. They could be potentially dangerous.\n\n【51】Injecting while taking warfarin will increase your risk of bleeding.\n\n【52】Talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking warfarin.\n\n【53】You can find out more about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【54】Can lifestyle changes help reduce the risk of blood clots?\n\n【55】You can reduce your risk of having a blood clot by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:\n\n【56】*   quitting smoking\n*   eating a healthy, balanced diet – but speak to your doctor before making changes to your diet\n*   getting regular exercise\n*   keeping to a healthy weight, or losing weight if you need to\n删除11：<u>More in Warfarin\n----------------\n\n【57】*   About warfarin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Advice about food and drink\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking warfarin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 April 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:41", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:52", "cost": 11.001}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:40"}

In the case of drugs, alcohol and nicotine, these substances affect the way you feel, both physically and mentally. These feelings can be enjoyable and create a powerful urge to use the substances again.\n\n【7】Gambling may result in a similar mental \"high\" after a win, followed by a strong urge to try again and recreate that feeling. This can develop into a habit that becomes very hard to stop.\n\n【8】Being addicted to something means that not having it causes withdrawal symptoms, or a \"come down\". Because this can be unpleasant, it's easier to carry on having or doing what you crave, and so the cycle continues.\n\n【9】Often, an addiction gets out of control because you need more and more to satisfy a craving and achieve the \"high\".\n\n【10】How addictions can affect you\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】The strain of managing an addiction can seriously damage your work life and relationships. In the case of substance misuse (for example, drugs and alcohol), an addiction can have serious psychological and physical effects.\n\n【12】Some studies suggest a person's risk of becoming addicted is partly genetic, but environmental factors, such as being around other people with addictions, are also thought to increase the risk.\n\n【13】Behaviours such as substance misuse can be a way of blocking out difficult issues. Unemployment and poverty can trigger addiction, along with stress and emotional or professional pressure.\n\n【14】Getting help for addictions\n---------------------------\n\n【15】Addiction is a treatable condition. Whatever the addiction, there are lots of ways you can seek help. You could see your GP for advice or contact an organisation that specialises in helping people with addictions.\n\n【16】You can use the following online directories to find addiction treatment services in your area:\n\n【17】*   Alcohol addiction services\n*   Drug addiction services\n*   Stop smoking services\n\n【18】To speak to someone anonymously about any type of addiction, you can call the Samaritans free on 116 123.\n删除11：<u>More in Addiction support\n-------------------------\n\n【19】*   Drug addiction: getting help\n*   Heroin addiction: get help\n*   Cocaine addiction: get help\n*   Advice for families of people who use drugs\n*   Addiction: what is it?\n*   Help for problems with gambling\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 June 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:08:47", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:09:02", "cost": 15.395}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:09:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:08:45"}

It also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.\n\n【4】How long does it take to work?\n\n【5】This depends on whether you are taking standard oxycodone capsules, tablets or liquid, or slow-release tablets.\n\n【6】Standard oxycodone takes 30 to 60 minutes to work, but this wears off after 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【7】Slow-release oxycodone can take 1 to 2 days to work fully, but the pain relief will last longer.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Some people who need long-term pain relief may need to take oxycodone for a long time.\n\n【10】If you need to take it for a long time, your body can become used to it (known as tolerance). That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【11】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia).

It's usually the result of a viral infection or liver damage caused by drinking alcohol.**\n\n【2】There are several different types of hepatitis. Some types will pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting (chronic) and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer.\n\n【3】Symptoms of hepatitis\n---------------------\n\n【4】Short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it.\n\n【5】If symptoms do develop, they can include:\n\n【6】*   muscle and joint pain\n*   a high temperature\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   feeling unusually tired all the time\n*   a general sense of feeling unwell\n*   loss of appetite\n*   tummy pain\n*   dark urine\n*   pale, grey-coloured poo\n*   itchy skin\n*   yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\n\n【7】See your GP if you have any persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by hepatitis.\n\n【8】Long-term (chronic) hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly (liver failure) and may only be picked up during blood tests.\n\n【9】In the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion, and blood in your stools or vomit.\n\n【10】Hepatitis A\n-----------\n\n【11】Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person, and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor.\n\n【12】Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life threatening.\n\n【13】There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms like pain, nausea and itching.\n\n【14】Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if:\n\n【15】*   you're at high risk of infection or severe consequences of infection\n*   you're travelling to an area where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and eastern Europe.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about hepatitis A</u>\n\n【16】Hepatitis B\n-----------\n\n【17】Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person.\n\n【18】It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact.\n\n【19】It can also be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs.\n\n【20】Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK. It most commonly affects people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n【21】Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months.\n\n【22】But most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B, and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medicine can be used to treat it.\n\n【23】In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as:\n\n【24】*   healthcare workers\n*   people who inject drugs\n*   men who have sex with men\n*   children born to mothers with hepatitis B\n*   people travelling to parts of the world where the infection is more common\n\n【25】Hepatitis B vaccination is also part of the routine immunisation programme so all children can benefit from protection from this virus.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about hepatitis B</u>\n\n【26】Hepatitis C\n-----------\n\n【27】Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus.\n\n【28】It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person.\n\n【29】In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs.\n\n【30】Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it's spread outside the UK.\n\n【31】Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected.\n\n【32】Some people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In other cases, it'll stay in the body for many years.\n\n【33】This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\n【34】Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medicines, but there's currently no vaccine available.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about hepatitis C</u>\n\n【35】Hepatitis D\n-----------\n\n【36】Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body.\n\n【37】Hepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact. It's uncommon in the UK, but is more widespread in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America.\n\n【38】Long-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\n【39】There's no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine can help protect you from it.\n\n【40】Hepatitis E\n-----------\n\n【41】Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. The number of cases in Europe has increased in recent years and it's now the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK.\n\n【42】The virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal, but also with wild boar meat, venison and shellfish. \n\n【43】Hepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that does not require any treatment, but it can be serious in some people, such as those who have a weakened immune system.\n\n【44】There's no vaccine for hepatitis E.

Overview\n2.  Orthodontic treatments</u>\n\n【2】**There are many different types of orthodontic treatment. The best treatment for you depends on the exact problem you have.**\n\n【3】The first stage of any treatment is to assess the current position of your teeth and how they're likely to change over time.\n\n【4】This often involves taking X-rays, making plaster models, and taking photographs of your teeth.\n\n【5】You will then be given a treatment plan. This may suggest more than 1 way to treat the problem you have. Talk to your orthodontist about your options.\n\n【6】Orthodontic appliances\n----------------------\n\n【7】Orthodontic treatment uses appliances to correct the position of teeth.\n\n【8】The 4 main types are:\n\n【9】*   fixed braces – a brace you cannot remove which is made up of brackets that are glued to the front of each tooth and linked with wires\n*   removable braces – usually plastic plates that cover the roof of the mouth and clip on to some teeth; these can only be used to achieve very limited tooth movements\n*   functional appliances – usually a pair of removable plastic braces that are joined together or designed to interact together and fit on to both the upper and lower teeth\n*   headgear – this can be used with other appliances and is usually worn at night\n\n【10】In more severe cases, treatment may involve fixed braces plus surgery to move the jaw. This treatment is done in hospital.\n\n【11】These treatments are outlined in more detail on this page.\n\n【12】You can also find more information about different orthodontic treatments on the British Orthodontic Society (BOS) website\n\n【13】### Fixed braces\n\n【14】Fixed braces are a widely used type of orthodontic appliance.\n\n【15】A few days after a fixed brace is fitted, you'll be able to eat a normal range of foods. But you should avoid certain foods and drinks, such as toffee, hard sweets and fizzy drinks, as these can damage the appliance and your teeth.\n\n【16】If you're using a fixed appliance and you play a contact sport such as rugby, you should wear a gum shield to protect both your mouth and the appliance.\n\n【17】Fixed braces are usually made from metal, so they will be noticeable on the front of your teeth.\n\n【18】Many private orthodontists offer ceramic or clear braces, or metal braces fitted to the back of the teeth, although these are usually more expensive.\n\n【19】### Removable braces\n\n【20】Removable braces can be used to correct minor problems, or as part of fixed-brace treatment.\n\n【21】They can also sometimes be used to discourage children from sucking their thumb, but this is not available on the NHS.\n\n【22】These braces should only be taken out of your mouth for cleaning or as a precaution during certain activities. Your orthodontist can advise you about this.\n\n【23】### Functional appliances\n\n【24】Functional appliances can be used to treat problems with the position of the upper and lower jaw and teeth.\n\n【25】Most people need to wear them all the time. It's very important to follow your orthodontist's instructions about how and when to wear the appliance. If it's not worn correctly, the treatment will not work.\n\n【26】It may be necessary to remove your functional appliance for cleaning and while you're eating.\n\n【27】### Headgear\n\n【28】Headgear is used to correct the position of the back teeth or to keep them in position while the front teeth are being treated.\n\n【29】Most people only need to wear headgear in the evening and during the night. You will not be able to eat or drink while wearing headgear.\n\n【30】Other treatments\n----------------\n\n【31】There are other types of braces available privately, such as aligners, or invisible or lingual braces that fit onto the back of the teeth.\n\n【32】You'll need to talk to your orthodontist to see whether they can be used for your problem. The cost of these braces is usually higher.\n\n【33】### Retainers\n\n【34】Retainers are used at the end of a course of orthodontic treatment. They hold straightened teeth in place while the surrounding gum and bone adjusts to their new position. Retainers can either be removable or fixed.\n\n【35】Under the NHS, your orthodontist is responsible for your care for 12 months after usual treatment ends. After this period, you'll have to pay privately for continuing care, repeated treatment, and any replacement or repair of retainers.\n\n【36】It's likely there will be some tooth movement if you stop wearing your retainer. Changes in the position of your teeth can continue throughout life and are normal.\n\n【37】The only way to have permanently straight teeth is to wear a retainer as advised.\n\n【38】### Removing teeth\n\n【39】In some cases, it may be necessary to remove one of your teeth to correct the position and appearance of nearby teeth.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】You're likely to achieve good results within 6 to 30 months of starting treatment as long as you:\n\n【42】*   take care of your teeth and gums\n*   wear your appliances as instructed\n*   follow your orthodontist's advice about what to eat and drink\n*   wear your retainer every night to maintain the results; your orthodontist will talk to you about exactly how long you need to wear this\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Orthodontics</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:37:40", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:38:20", "cost": 40.535}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:38:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:37:40"}

Your doctor may increase your dose every 4 weeks up to 20mg a day\n\n【6】Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you're unsure how much to take.\n\n【7】### Doses for children\n\n【8】The maximum dose for children is 20mg a day. Your child's doctor will work out the right dose of rosuvastatin for your child. This will depend on why they need it, their age and any other medicines they are already taking.\n\n【9】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【10】You'll usually take rosuvastatin once a day. You can take it at any time, but it's best to take it at the same time every day.\n\n【11】Rosuvastatin will not usually upset your stomach, so you can take it with or without food.\n\n【12】Swallow rosuvastatin tablets whole with a drink of water.\n\n【13】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【14】You'll usually take rosuvastatin for life. The benefits of the medicine will only continue for as long as you take it.\n\n【15】You may want to stop rosuvastatin if you think you're having side effects. Talk to your doctor first to see if it really is a side effect of rosuvastatin or an unrelated problem. Your doctor may decide to lower your dose or change your medicine.\n\n【16】You will not get any withdrawal symptoms. But stopping rosuvastatin may cause your cholesterol to rise. This increases your risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【17】If you want to stop taking your medicine, it's important to find another way to lower your cholesterol.\n\n【18】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【19】If you forget to take a dose of rosuvastatin, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until the next day, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【20】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for the forgotten one.\n\n【21】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【22】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【23】Taking an extra dose of rosuvastatin is unlikely to harm you. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried or if you take more than 1 extra dose.\n删除11：<u>More in Rosuvastatin\n--------------------\n\n【24】*   About rosuvastatin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking rosuvastatin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:20", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:46:08", "cost": 48.081}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:46:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:20"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**The symptoms of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are caused by the growth of fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the kidneys.**\n\n【3】Although ADPKD is present from birth, it may not cause any obvious problems until the cysts have reached a size where they significantly affect how well your kidneys work.\n\n【4】In most cases, this does not happen until 30 to 60 years of age.\n\n【5】The growth of the cysts can eventually cause your kidneys to increase in size.\n\n【6】The kidneys of older adults with ADPKD can get much larger than those of adults who do not have the condition.\n\n【7】Problems caused by ADPKD\n------------------------\n\n【8】The growth of cysts in your kidneys can cause a wide range of problems, including:\n\n【9】*   pain in your tummy (abdomen), side or lower back\n*   blood in your urine (haematuria)\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   kidney stones\n*   urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n*   eventually, loss of kidney function (chronic kidney disease, or CKD)\n\n【10】### Pain\n\n【11】Pain in the abdomen, side or lower back is often the first noticeable symptom of ADPKD. \n\n【12】This can be severe, but is usually short-lived, lasting from a few minutes to several days.\n\n【13】Common causes of pain associated with ADPKD include:\n\n【14】*   a cyst becoming larger\n*   bleeding into 1 or more cysts\n*   a kidney stone\n*   a kidney or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder, becoming infected (a UTI)\n\n【15】### Blood in your urine\n\n【16】Blood in your urine (haematuria) is another common initial symptom of ADPKD.\n\n【17】Although it can often be a frightening symptom, it's not usually a cause for concern and most cases will resolve within a week without the need for treatment.\n\n【18】But you should see a GP if you notice blood in your urine so that other possible causes, such as a growth in your bladder, can be investigated and excluded.\n\n【19】### High blood pressure\n\n【20】Many experts consider high blood pressure to be the first effect of ADPKD, but as it often does not cause any obvious symptoms, it's only usually detected during routine testing.\n\n【21】Symptoms only occur when blood pressure reaches a very high level, which is rare. \n\n【22】In such circumstances, symptoms can include:\n\n【23】*   a persistent headache\n*   blurred or double vision\n*   nosebleeds\n*   shortness of breath\n\n【24】See a GP straight away if you experience these symptoms so that the cause can be investigated.\n\n【25】Untreated or poorly controlled high blood pressure is a major risk factor for a number of serious health conditions, including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\n\n【26】### Kidney stones\n\n【27】Having ADPKD puts you at an increased risk of developing kidney stones. \n\n【28】Smaller kidney stones may pass out of your kidneys without causing any symptoms.\n\n【29】But larger stones can get blocked in your kidney or the tube that connects your kidney to your bladder (ureter), causing problems such as:\n\n【30】*   intense pain in the back or side of your tummy, or occasionally in your groin – the pain may last for minutes or hours, with pain-free intervals in between\n*   feeling restless and being unable to lie still\n*   feeling sick\n*   needing to pee more often than normal\n*   blood in your urine\n\n【31】Get advice from 111 or ask for an urgent GP appointment if you think you may have a kidney stone.\n\n【32】### Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n\n【33】Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are broadly classified into 1 of 2 groups: lower UTIs and upper UTIs.\n\n【34】A lower UTI is an infection that develops in your bladder or urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.\n\n【35】An upper UTI is an infection that develops in your kidneys or ureters.\n\n【36】ADPKD does not increase your risk of developing lower UTIs, such as bladder infections (cystitis), but it can mean that any lower UTIs you do develop could spread to your kidneys and become potentially serious upper UTIs.\n\n【37】Symptoms of a lower UTI can include:\n\n【38】*   cloudy urine\n*   a need to urinate more frequently, either during the day or night, or both\n*   pain or discomfort when peeing\n*   an urgent need to pee, where holding urine in becomes more difficult\n*   unpleasant-smelling urine\n\n【39】Symptoms of an upper UTI can include:\n\n【40】*   a high temperature\n*   uncontrollable shivering\n*   feeling sick\n*   being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【41】Get advice from 111 or ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have ADPKD and you think you may have a UTI. You may need treatment to stop the infection spreading into the cysts in your kidneys.\n\n【42】Chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n----------------------------\n\n【43】Most people with ADPKD will eventually lose a significant amount of kidney function.\n\n【44】Loss of kidney function caused by kidney damage is known as chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\n【45】CKD does not usually cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage, known as CKD stage 4, when around 75% of kidney function has been lost.\n\n【46】The most advanced stage of CKD (stage 5) is called kidney failure or end-stage renal disease.\n\n【47】This is when dialysis, where waste products and excess fluid from the blood are removed, is essential to keep the person alive.\n\n【48】Symptoms of kidney failure include:\n\n【49】*   poor appetite and weight loss\n*   swollen ankles, feet or hands (oedema)\n*   shortness of breath\n*   an increased need to pee, particularly at night\n*   itchy skin\n*   feeling sick\n*   in men, erectile dysfunction\n*   in women, absent periods (amenorrhoea)\n*   difficulty concentrating\n\n【50】Kidney failure rarely happens suddenly, and treatment options should have been discussed and a treatment plan chosen before this stage is reached.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:34:48", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:08", "cost": 20.41}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:34:48"}

Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**There's currently no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatments are available to help people with the condition be as active and independent as possible.**\n\n【3】Children and adults with the condition are cared for by a team of healthcare professionals, who will work with you to come up with a care and support plan.\n\n【4】This plan will be continually reassessed as the person's needs change. As people with cerebral palsy grow older, they may need different care and support.\n\n【5】For example, bone and joint problems can get worse and this may affect movement.\n\n【6】It's important to continue having regular check-ups with your care team all your life.\n\n【7】If your symptoms change or get worse, you should see your doctor.\n\n【8】The charity Scope has information about ageing and cerebral palsy\n\n【9】Physiotherapy\n-------------\n\n【10】Physiotherapy involves exercises to help maintain and hopefully improve movement.\n\n【11】It's one of the most important treatments for cerebral palsy.\n\n【12】The main goals of physiotherapy are to:\n\n【13】*   encourage movement\n*   increase strength and stop muscles becoming weak\n*   stop muscles shortening and losing their range of movement (contracture), which can be painful and affect how the bones and muscles grow\n\n【14】A physiotherapist may also advise on walking aids (such as a walking frame or walking sticks) if needed, and arm or leg braces called orthoses to support the limbs.\n\n【15】Speech and language therapy\n---------------------------\n\n【16】Speech and language therapy can help people who have trouble communicating.\n\n【17】A speech and language therapist can provide exercises to help practise speech, or teach an alternative method of communication, such as sign language or using pictures.\n\n【18】The therapist may also be able to provide special equipment, such as a computer or device that generates speech.\n\n【19】Younger children may be given a device similar to a laptop that's covered with symbols of everyday objects and activities. The child presses a combination of symbols to communicate.\n\n【20】Occupational therapy\n--------------------\n\n【21】Occupational therapy involves a therapist identifying problems that you or your child have carrying out everyday tasks.\n\n【22】They can advise you about the best way to do activities that involve complex movements, such as going to the toilet or getting dressed.\n\n【23】Occupational therapy can be very useful in boosting your child's self-esteem and independence, especially as they get older.\n\n【24】An occupational therapist can advise adults with cerebral palsy on independent living. This can include advice on housing, getting a job, benefits, and technology like computers and gadgets that can make it easier to do things.\n删除7：<u>Read more about occupational therapy</u>\n\n【25】Medicines\n---------\n\n【26】Medicines that can help relieve several of the symptoms of cerebral palsy include:\n\n【27】*   medicines for muscle stiffness, such as diazepam or baclofen, that can be taken as tablets or liquids – baclofen can also sometimes be given using a small pump inserted under the skin, which allows the medicine to trickle into the area inside the spine\n*   botulinum toxin injections – injections that relax certain muscles or groups of muscles for a few months at a time\n*   a medicine called melatonin for sleeping difficulties\n*   anti-seizure medicines for epilepsy\n*   laxatives for constipation\n*   painkillers for pain or discomfort\n*   medicines to reduce drooling\n\n【28】It's unlikely you or your child will need to take all of these medicines.\n\n【29】Speak to your care team if you have any questions about a medicine that's been offered, including why they recommend it and what side effects it might cause.\n\n【30】Treatments for feeding problems\n-------------------------------\n\n【31】Some people with cerebral palsy have difficulty swallowing food.\n\n【32】This can be serious because it can mean they're at risk of choking or developing a chest infection as a result of accidentally inhaling food.\n\n【33】Long-lasting feeding difficulties could also lead to malnutrition.\n\n【34】Treatments for swallowing problems include:\n\n【35】*   swallowing techniques and exercises taught by a speech and language therapist\n*   making dietary changes, such as eating soft or liquid foods\n*   a feeding tube in more severe cases\n\n【36】A feeding tube can either be passed into the stomach through the nose or directly into the stomach through the skin of the tummy.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about swallowing problems</u>\n\n【37】Treatments for drooling\n-----------------------\n\n【38】Drooling is common in people with cerebral palsy.\n\n【39】It's not usually serious, but the excess saliva can irritate the skin around the mouth, which may increase the risk of the skin becoming infected.\n\n【40】Treatments that can help with excessive drooling include:\n\n【41】*   techniques and exercises taught by a speech and language therapist\n*   anticholinergic medicines – tablets or skin patches that reduce how much saliva is produced\n*   botulinum toxin injections into the saliva glands – injections that can help relieve drooling problems for a few months at a time\n*   surgery to redirect the saliva glands so saliva runs towards the back of the mouth, rather than the front\n\n【42】Surgery\n-------\n\n【43】Some people with cerebral palsy may need surgery to help with movement difficulties or other problems.\n\n【44】Surgery can be carried out to:\n\n【45】*   restore movement to parts of the body if they're restricted by a tight muscle or piece of connective tissue\n*   repair a hip joint that's popped out (dislocated)\n*   correct curvature of the spine (scoliosis) – find out more about treatment for scoliosis in children\n*   treat problems with bladder control (urinary incontinence) – find out more about surgery for urinary incontinence\n*   make walking easier by reducing stiffness in the legs – this operation is known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR)\n\n【46】If surgery is suggested, speak to your care team about the results you can expect, what the risks are, and what the recovery period might be like.\n\n【47】For some types of surgery it can take months or even years for the full benefits to be achieved, and extensive physiotherapy may be needed to help with recovery.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:06:21", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:06:42", "cost": 21.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:06:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:06:20"}

They may suggest changing your dose, or switching to a different type of HRT.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】It's best to only take HRT at the lowest dose that works for you, and only for as long as you need it to control your menopause symptoms.\n\n【10】This is because HRT can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and blood clots. The risk is small, but it increases the longer you take HRT.\n\n【11】Usually, the risk is outweighed by the benefits of HRT, such as improving menopause symptoms, quality of life and preventing osteoporosis. But this depends on your age, symptoms and health. Speak to your doctor, who can help you decide.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the benefits and risks of HRT</u>\n\n【12】How does it compare with other types of HRT?\n\n【13】There are several different types of HRT. They all work equally well to replace the hormones that fall during and after the menopause.\n\n【14】No one type of HRT is suitable for everyone. You may need to try different types to find what works best for you.\n\n【15】It's better to take or use sequential combined HRT if you're still having periods (perimenopause). You'll normally have withdrawal bleeding at the end of each course of progestogen.\n\n【16】Once your periods have stopped, you'll usually be advised to switch to continuous combined HRT, where you take both oestrogen and progestogen every day, without a monthly bleed.\n\n【17】Sequential combined HRT contains an oestrogen and a progestogen to protect your womb. If you've had a hysterectomy to remove your womb, you'll be advised to take oestrogen-only HRT.\n\n【18】Your doctor can help you decide on the type of HRT that's best for you.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about types of HRT</u>\n\n【19】How does it compare with alternatives to HRT?\n\n【20】HRT such as sequential combined HRT is usually the most effective treatment for menopause symptoms.\n\n【21】If you cannot take HRT, or prefer not to take it, your doctor may be able to recommend other medicines or lifestyle changes to help with your symptoms.\n\n【22】Medicines such as clonidine and some antidepressants (such as fluoxetine or sertraline) are sometimes used as an alternative to HRT to help with symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and mood swings.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about alternatives to HRT</u>\n\n【23】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【24】If you stop taking HRT your menopause symptoms might come back.\n\n【25】If you're taking it for osteoporosis there is a chance that your bones will get weaker and you may be more likely to have fractures in the future.\n\n【26】Talk to your doctor if you're thinking of stopping. They'll help you decide what's best for you. They may suggest that you reduce your dose gradually, to help stop symptoms coming back.\n\n【27】If you're having problems with side effects, your doctor might suggest changing your dose, or switching to another type of HRT.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about when to take HRT and stopping taking it</u>\n\n【28】Can I switch to a different brand?\n\n【29】There are different brands and types of sequential combined HRT. A pharmacist or doctor can advise on which type would be suitable. It will depend on whether you prefer to take tablets or use patches, and what dose you need.\n\n【30】If the brand or type of HRT that you've been using is not available because of supply shortages, is not helping your symptoms, or if you have problems with side effects, a doctor or pharmacist can advise about switching to a different type.\n\n【31】Can I get HRT for free?\n\n【32】You'll need to pay for your hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions unless you're eligible for free prescriptions. When there is more than one type of patch or tablet in the same box, you will need to pay a charge for each.\n\n【33】However, you can reduce the cost by getting an HRT pre-payment certificate (PPC). This means you can pay a small fee that will cover all your HRT prescriptions for a year.\n\n【34】Find out how to save money with a prescription prepayment certificate.\n\n【35】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【36】There's no good evidence that sequential combined HRT makes you put on weight.\n\n【37】However, it's common to gain weight around the time of the menopause. Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly will help you keep to a healthy weight.\n\n【38】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【39】Sequential combined HRT is not a contraceptive.\n\n【40】It's still possible to get pregnant while taking HRT, so you'll need to use contraception until 2 years after your last period if you're under 50 years old, or for 1 year if you're over 50 years old.\n\n【41】You'll need to use a non-hormonal method of contraception such as condoms or a diaphragm, or other options which you can speak to your doctor about.\n\n【42】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【43】Yes. Sequential combined HRT does not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【44】Can I drink alcohol while taking sequential combined HRT?\n\n【45】You can drink alcohol while taking HRT but it may be helpful to cut down on alcohol during the menopause to reduce symptoms of flushing, and improve your sleep.\n\n【46】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【47】You can eat and drink normally while taking sequential combined HRT.\n\n【48】Try to have a healthy diet, as this can help with menopause symptoms and keep you well.\n\n【49】Cutting down on alcohol and caffeine may help reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep.\n\n【50】Can lifestyle changes help menopause symptoms?\n\n【51】The following lifestyle changes can sometimes help with menopause symptoms:\n\n【52】*   Regular exercise. This helps with bone health and can reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep. It may also help improve your general mood, reduce stress and help you keep to a healthy weight.\n*   Cut down on caffeine and alcohol. This may help reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep.\n*   Quit smoking. This can help reduce hot flushes and reduce your risk of developing other health problems such as cancer, heart disease and stroke.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about lifestyle changes for menopause symptoms</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Sequential combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablets and patches\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】*   About sequential combined HRT\n*   Who can and cannot take or use it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking sequential combined HRT with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:54", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:33:48", "cost": 54.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:33:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:54"}

Staff at the centre will check you do not have any new medical problems and then ask you to go to the centre.**\n\n【3】When you hear from the transplant centre:\n\n【4】*   do not eat or drink anything\n*   take all current medicines with you\n*   take a bag of clothes and essential items for your hospital stay\n\n【5】When you arrive at the transplant centre, you'll be quickly assessed. Some of the tests you had at your initial assessment may be repeated to ensure no new medical conditions have developed. Tests will also be done to ensure the donor kidney is suitable for you.\n\n【6】The transplant procedure must be carried out as quickly as possible for the transplant to have the best chance of success. After the medical team has confirmed the kidney is in good condition and is suitable, you'll be given the general anaesthetic and taken to the operating theatre.\n\n【7】The operation\n-------------\n\n【8】The kidney transplant procedure involves 3 main stages:\n\n【9】*   First, an incision (cut) is made in your lower abdomen (tummy), through which the donated kidney is put into place. Your own kidneys will usually be left where they are, unless they're causing problems such as pain or infection.\n*   Second, nearby blood vessels are attached to the blood vessels of the donated kidney. This is to provide the donated kidney with the blood supply it needs to function properly.\n*   Finally, the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) of the donated kidney is connected to your bladder.\n\n【10】A small plastic tube called a stent may be inserted into the ureter to help ensure a good flow of urine initially. This will usually be removed about 6 to 12 weeks later during a minor procedure called a cystoscopy.\n\n【11】When the kidney is properly in place, the incision in your abdomen will be closed with surgical staples, stitches or surgical glue.\n\n【12】Although the procedure may sound relatively straightforward, it's very demanding and complex surgery that usually takes around 3 hours to complete.\n\n【13】After the operation\n-------------------\n\n【14】Once you've recovered from the effects of the anaesthetic, it's likely you will feel some pain at the site of the incision. Painkillers will be provided, if necessary.\n\n【15】After the operation, you'll immediately begin treatment with medicine designed to prevent your immune system from rejecting your new kidney. See living with a kidney transplant for more information on this.\n\n【16】Most transplanted kidneys will start working within a week or two. You may need to have dialysis until your transplanted kidney is working properly.\n\n【17】Most people can leave hospital in about a week, but you'll need to attend frequent appointments at the transplant centre, so your kidney function can be assessed and tests can be carried out to check how well your medicines are working.\n\n【18】For the first month after surgery, you may need to have 2 to 3 appointments a week. However, over time, your appointments will become less frequent. After a year, as long as you do not have any serious problems, you should only have to attend the centre once every 3 to 6 months.\n\n【19】After kidney surgery, you should be able to return to work and normal activities within a few months, provided you make good progress.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 August 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 August 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Waiting list</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:35", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:37:37", "cost": 62.159}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:37:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:35"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications\n7.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**Your treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life.**\n\n【3】If you don't have any symptoms, active monitoring is often recommended. This means you won't receive immediate treatment, but you should let your GP know if you notice any symptoms.\n\n【4】As a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse.\n\n【5】You may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of developing complications, such as:\n\n【6】*   scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\n*   high blood pressure inside the liver (this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of alcohol-related liver disease)\n*   diabetes\n\n【7】Treatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to gallbladder cancer in later life.\n\n【8】If you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities.\n\n【9】If the pain is mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and be given advice about eating a healthy diet to help control the pain.\n\n【10】If your symptoms are more severe and frequent, surgery to remove the gallbladder is usually recommended.\n\n【11】The gallbladder isn't an essential organ and you can lead a normal life without one.\n\n【12】Some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. If certain foods trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.\n\n【13】Keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【14】If surgery is recommended, you'll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【15】During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3 or 4 small cuts are made in your abdomen.\n\n【16】One larger cut (about 2 to 3cm) is made by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen.\n\n【17】Your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs.\n\n【18】A laparoscope (a long, thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen.\n\n【19】This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor. They'll remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments.\n\n【20】If it's thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation.\n\n【21】If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can't be done this way, or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery.\n\n【22】After the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings.\n\n【23】Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain while it's carried out.\n\n【24】The operation takes 60 to 90 minutes and you can usually go home the same day.\n\n【25】Full recovery typically takes around 10 days.\n\n【26】### Single-incision keyhole surgery\n\n【27】Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder.\n\n【28】During this type of surgery, only 1 small cut is made, which means you'll only have a single scar.\n\n【29】But as this type of cholecystectomy hasn't been carried out as often as conventional cholecystectomies, there are still some uncertainties about it.\n\n【30】Access to single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training.\n删除7：<u>Read more about single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website</u>\n\n【31】Open surgery\n------------\n\n【32】A laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not be recommended if you:\n\n【33】*   are in the third trimester (the last 3 months) of pregnancy\n*   are extremely overweight\n*   have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous\n\n【34】In these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended.\n\n【35】A 10 to 15cm (4 to 6in) incision is made in the abdomen, underneath the ribs, so the gallbladder can be removed.\n\n【36】General anaesthetic is used, so you'll be unconscious and won't feel any pain.\n\n【37】Open surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring.\n\n【38】Most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5 days. It typically takes 6 weeks to fully recover.\n删除7：<u>Read more about recovering from gallbladder surgery.</u>\n\n【39】Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct.\n\n【41】The gallbladder isn't removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless they're removed using other surgical techniques.\n\n【42】ERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see diagnosing gallstones for more information), where an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine.\n\n【43】But during ERCP, the opening of the bile duct is widened with a small cut or an electrically heated wire.\n\n【44】The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body.\n\n【45】Sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass.\n\n【46】ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you'll be conscious throughout the procedure but won't experience any pain.\n\n【47】The procedure lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour.\n\n【48】Afterwards, you may need to stay in hospital overnight so you can be monitored.\n\n【49】Medicine to dissolve gallstones\n-------------------------------\n\n【50】If your gallstones are small and don't contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid tablets to dissolve them.\n\n【51】But these aren't prescribed very often because:\n\n【52】*   they're rarely very effective\n*   they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2 years)\n*   you can get gallstones again after treatment is stopped\n\n【53】Side effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin.\n\n【54】Ursodeoxycholic acid isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.\n\n【55】Sexually active women should either use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills.\n\n【56】Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets may occasionally be used to prevent gallstones if it's thought you're at risk of developing them.\n\n【57】For example, ursodeoxycholic acid may be prescribed if you have recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.\n\n【58】Diet and gallstones\n-------------------\n\n【59】In the past, people with gallstones who weren't suitable for surgery were sometimes advised to adopt a very low-fat diet to stop the gallstones growing.\n\n【60】But recent evidence suggests this isn't helpful because rapid weight loss resulting from a very low-fat diet can actually cause gallstones to grow.\n\n【61】This means that if surgery isn't recommended or you want to avoid having an operation, it's advisable to adopt a healthy, balanced diet based on The Eatwell Guide.\n\n【62】This involves eating a variety of foods, including moderate amounts of fat, and having regular meals.\n\n【63】A healthy diet won't cure gallstones or completely eliminate your symptoms, but it can improve your general health and help control pain caused by gallstones.\n删除7：<u>Read more about healthy eating.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 November 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:03:02", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:03:11", "cost": 9.213}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:03:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:03:01"}

Your organs might be struggling because you:\n\n【11】*   have previous organ damage (for example, your lungs have been damaged by smoking)\n*   have a serious long-term condition (this is not the same as a disability)\n*   have current severe illness\n*   are frail\n*   are approaching the end of your life\n\n【12】Only a few people make a full recovery even if their heart or breathing can be restarted with CPR.\n\n【13】You may still be very unwell and need more treatment and you may never get back to the health you had before.\n\n【14】Your heart and/or brain may be permanently damaged.

It's sometimes called DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation) or DNR (do not resuscitate) but they all refer to the same thing.\n\n【17】DNACPR means if your heart or breathing stops your healthcare team will not try to restart it.\n\n【18】A DNACPR decision is made by you and/or your doctor or healthcare team. This is explained in more detail in the following section \"When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\".\n\n【19】A DNACPR decision is usually recorded on a special form. Different doctors or hospitals might use different forms, but they all serve the same purpose. Some examples are a DNACPR form, a treatment escalation plan, or a recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) process.\n\n【20】All these forms are easily recognised by doctors, nurses and healthcare workers, so they know what to do in an emergency.\n\n【21】This form is kept in your medical records. It may also be printed and kept with you if you are at home or in a care home.\n\n【22】You and the people important to you should know that a DNACPR form has been put in your medical records.\n\n【23】The form says that if your heart or breathing stop, CPR should not be tried. This means medical staff will not try to restart your heart or breathing.\n\n【24】### Important\n\n【25】DNACPR is about CPR only. It does not mean that you will not get care and treatment. You will continue to have all the other appropriate care, treatment and support you need.\n\n【26】When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】There are different situations when a DNACPR decision might be made.\n\n【28】### You decide – deciding in advance to refuse CPR\n\n【29】Everyone who has capacity to do so can refuse CPR if they wish.\n\n【30】This is a choice you can make at any time, for example when you are healthy or when you are approaching the end of your life.\n\n【31】You can make it clear to your doctor or medical team that you do not want CPR if your heart or breathing stops.\n\n【32】Your doctor may complete a DNACPR form to indicate this and put it in your medical records.\n\n【33】*   If you wish to make your refusal of CPR legally binding for when in the future you are unable to make this decision, then you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains to a doctor or medical team when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatments).\n*   You can change your mind about your DNACPR decision at any time. If you do, you need to tell your doctors and nurses so that the DNACPR form is marked as no longer valid. The fact that you once had a DNACPR form will still be recorded on your records so that doctors and nurses can see your full medical history and know about conversations that happened in the past.\n\n【34】### A doctor decides in advance\n\n【35】*   DNACPR is a medical treatment decision that can be made by your doctor even if you do not agree.\n*   You must be told that a DNACPR form will be/has been completed for you, but a doctor does not need your consent. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n*   You should be given the chance to understand what a DNACPR is, how the decision is made and why they think CPR would not be suitable for you. For example, your doctor may think that CPR will not help you live longer or that giving you CPR could cause you more harm. This may be because your organs are already too damaged because of another illness or you are approaching the end of your life.\n*   You should then be consulted, and doctors should ask about your wishes and preferences. Your doctor makes the final decision.\n*   Doctors do not have to give you treatment if they think it will not work.\n*   A DNACPR decision must be made on an individual (person by person) basis. This means it must be based on your health, needs and priorities as an individual. The judgement about whether the discussion or decision would cause you harm should also be made on an individual basis.\n*   DNACPR decisions should not be made for a group of people at once. For example, DNACPR decisions should not be made for everyone living in a care home or for a group of people over a certain age. This is unlawful, irrespective of medical condition, age, disability, race or language.\n*   Learning disability, autism or dementia are not reasons to put a DNACPR on someone's record.\n*   If you disagree with a DNACPR decision that a doctor has made, you can ask for a second opinion and a review. You cannot demand CPR. The law does not require your consent to a DNACPR. The law does provide you with the right to be involved in, and informed of, a doctor's DNACPR decision.\n\n【36】What happens if you are unable to make or discuss a DNACPR decision in advance of your heart stopping?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Some people cannot make decisions about CPR for themselves. If you have been assessed as unable to make a specific decision for yourself, you will be referred to as \"lacking capacity\".\n\n【38】If you lack capacity to decide about CPR, doctors should first check to see if you have an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT) that says that you do not want CPR. They should also check to see if you have a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and care decisions.\n\n【39】An LPA is a document that explains who you have chosen to help you make decisions or who can make decisions for you. Your chosen person(s) are known as \"attorneys\". If you would like your LPA to make decisions about CPR, then you must complete and sign the section on life-sustaining treatment in the LPA document.\n\n【40】An LPA (with the right to make decisions on life-sustaining treatment) means if you lack the relevant capacity, your attorney can make the decision relating to CPR in your best interests. Your attorney cannot insist on CPR being given.\n\n【41】If you do not have an ADRT (which says that you do not want CPR) or an LPA (with life-sustaining treatment decision-making powers) then a best interest's decision is made by the senior doctor.\n\n【42】This doctor must ask the people who are important to you about your wishes and preferences. This includes anyone with the legal power to represent you, such as a personal welfare deputy, special guardian or – for children and young people under 16 – a parent.\n\n【43】If you do not have family or friends appropriate to ask, then the doctor should ask an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to represent you in the decision-making process. The doctor should also ask members of your healthcare (multidisciplinary) team for their views.\n删除6：<u>Information:\n\n【44】### Further information\n\n【45】*   GOV.UK: Deputies - make decisions for someone who lacks capacity\n*   GOV.UK: Become a special guardian\n\n【46】</u>\nHow long does a DNACPR form last?\n---------------------------------\n\n【47】A DNACPR form can be written for a short period – for example, if you have been admitted to hospital. Or it can be written with no end date – for example, if you have a long-term condition that has damaged your heart, lungs or other organs – only being reviewed if your situation changes.\n\n【48】When the DNACPR decision is made you should be told when it will be reviewed, and this is usually recorded on the form. It's recommended that a DNACPR is reviewed each time your situation changes – for example, when you leave hospital. If a DNACPR form is placed on your medical records while in hospital, this will be included in your discharge summary and shared with your GP.\n\n【49】Is a DNACPR form legally binding?\n---------------------------------\n\n【50】A DNACPR form is not legally binding. It's a tool to tell doctors, nurses or paramedics not to attempt CPR.\n\n【51】If you wish to make your DNACPR decision legally binding, you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatment).\n\n【52】Talking about a DNACPR\n----------------------\n\n【53】You do not have to talk about DNACPR if you do not want to. If you would prefer not to talk about it, you can let your doctors and nurses know. You could ask your doctors and nurses to make it clear on your record. If you change your mind and want to talk about it, you can.\n\n【54】If a decision needs to be made about CPR, your doctors can still decide to complete a form even if you ask not to talk about it. Your doctor will do this if they believe that CPR would not prolong your life or would do you more harm than good.\n\n【55】Even if you ask not to be involved in the decision, you should be told if a DNACPR form is written and placed on your medical records. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n\n【56】What should you do if you are concerned about a DNACPR form in your medical record or on somebody else's (such as a relative)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】If you are concerned about a DNACPR form, you should first raise those concerns with your doctor.\n\n【58】If you are still not happy, then you can ask for another doctor's opinion.\n\n【59】If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity to make their own decisions, they will need to agree to it being discussed with you. If you do not have capacity, your family, friends or those with the legal power to represent you (such as a Lasting Power of Attorney) can raise concerns on your behalf.\n\n【60】It's important to understand that nobody has the right to demand CPR, so the decision may not change if there was a good clinical reason for it (for example, your heart, lungs or other organs are struggling to work). The doctor should explain their reasons and ask about your wishes and preferences.\n\n【61】If the DNACPR form was made by a GP, and you are not happy with their response, you should follow the practice's complaints procedure. If you are still concerned, or you wish to make a complaint, contact NHS England and NHS Improvement.\n\n【62】If the DNACPR form was made by a doctor in a hospital, and you are not happy with their response, you can ask to speak to the senior doctor on duty or the consultant responsible for your care. The hospital should have its own complaints procedure. This will tell you how to make a complaint.\n\n【63】If your DNACPR form was made by a GP or doctor in a hospital, you can contact your local Healthwatch to find out about how to get help making a complaint. You can also have support from an advocate if you want help to make a complaint about your GP or a doctor in the hospital.\n\n【64】If you are still not happy with the response you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 December 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 December 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:48", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:50:08", "cost": 20.367}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:50:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:47"}

The adrenal glands are above your kidneys.\n\n【4】When prescribed in doses higher than your body's usual levels, steroids like dexamethasone reduce inflammation (swelling). This can help the symptoms of inflammatory conditions, such as croup, arthritis and asthma.\n\n【5】Steroids also help calm your immune system. This can help in autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues.\n\n【6】When taken for nausea and vomiting dexamethasone is thought to work on chemical messengers in the brain to reduce feelings of sickness.\n\n【7】How is dexamethasone used to treat COVID-19?\n\n【8】Dexamethasone is being used to treat severe COVID-19 in hospitals.\n\n【9】For patients on a ventilator or who need oxygen to help them breathe, dexamethasone can improve their chances of recovery.\n\n【10】There's no evidence to suggest that dexamethasone will help in less serious COVID-19 when people do not need to be in hospital.\n\n【11】It does not stop you getting COVID-19 and it may not stop mild symptoms getting worse.\n\n【12】When will I feel better?\n\n【13】This can vary depending on why you're taking dexamethasone.\n\n【14】For some conditions, you will feel better after a couple of days.\n\n【15】For other conditions, you may not feel any better even though the medicine is helping you.\n\n【16】Ask your doctor what to expect for your condition.\n\n【17】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【18】If you take dexamethasone for several months it can make your bones weaker and more likely to break (osteoporosis).\n\n【19】You can also get eyesight problems and it can cause slower growth in children and teenagers.\n\n【20】If you have diabetes, dexamethasone can affect blood sugar control. Your doctor may need to adjust your diabetes treatment while you take this medicine and again after you stop.\n\n【21】However, there are steps you can take to help you stay as healthy as possible.\n\n【22】### For healthy bones\n\n【23】Take regular exercise and make sure you get enough calcium in your diet to help strengthen your bones. Calcium-rich foods include milk, cheese and leafy green vegetables. To check your bones, your doctor may arrange for you to have an occasional bone scan.\n\n【24】### For diabetes\n\n【25】If you have diabetes you may need to check your blood glucose more often. Your doctor can give you more advice about this.\n\n【26】### For eye health\n\n【27】To reduce the chances of eyesight problems, visit an optometrist every 12 months. They'll check for high pressure in your eye (glaucoma) and cataracts.\n\n【28】### For children and teenagers\n\n【29】If your child takes dexamethasone for several months, their height and weight need to be monitored carefully. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth. Talk to their doctor if you're worried. They'll be able to explain the benefits and risks of giving your child dexamethasone.\n\n【30】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【31】Do not stop taking dexamethasone suddenly, especially if you've been on a high dose for a long time.\n\n【32】Your health condition may flare up again.\n\n【33】You may also get extra side effects including:\n\n【34】*   severe tiredness\n*   weakness\n*   body aches\n*   joint pain\n\n【35】Your doctor will probably want to reduce your dose gradually over several weeks to prevent these side effects.\n\n【36】### Important\n\n【37】Do not stop taking dexamethasone without talking to your doctor. You'll need to reduce your dose gradually.\n\n【38】Can I still have vaccinations?\n\n【39】If you need any vaccinations, let the doctor or nurse know that you're taking a steroid.\n\n【40】Some types of vaccines, known as live vaccines, are not suitable while you're taking dexamethasone. This is because taking dexamethasone affects your immune system, so you're more at risk of infection caused by a live vaccine.\n\n【41】Live vaccines include the oral typhoid vaccine and the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis.\n\n【42】There are non-live versions of vaccines available for conditions including flu, shingles and polio. These are safe to have while you're taking dexamethasone.\n\n【43】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【44】### Red steroid emergency card\n\n【45】If you're prescribed steroid medicines such as dexamethasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【46】It's more likely to happen if you either:\n\n【47】*   take high doses for a long time, especially tablets and injections\n*   regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time, such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler\n\n【48】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking and may recommend that you carry a red steroid emergency card. This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse删除7：<u>\n\n【49】The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【50】#### Important\n\n【51】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【52】### Blue steroid card\n\n【53】If you take dexamethasone for longer than 3 weeks, or you take more than 6mg a day, your doctor or pharmacist will give you a blue steroid treatment card.\n\n【54】It tells you how you can reduce the risks of side effects. It also gives details of your doctor, how much dexamethasone you take and how long the treatment will last for. The card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n\n【55】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue steroid card to the doctor or dentist.\n\n【56】How does dexamethasone compare with other steroid medicines?\n\n【57】There are other steroids available, including:\n\n【58】*   deflazacort\n*   methylprednisolone\n*   prednisolone\n*   prednisone\n\n【59】For most health problems, these steroids are very similar to dexamethasone in terms of how well they work and how safe they are.\n\n【60】Do I need to be careful of infections?\n\n【61】Taking dexamethasone makes you more likely to catch infections such as flu, COVID-19, the common cold and chest infections. Tell your doctor if you get symptoms of an infection or test positive for COVID-19.\n\n【62】Keep away from people with an infectious illness, especially measles, chickenpox or shingles. If you get any of these illnesses they could make you very ill.\n\n【63】Tell your doctor straight away if you come into contact with someone who has chickenpox, shingles or measles. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a medicine to protect you.\n\n【64】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【65】Dexamethasone will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【66】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【67】Dexamethasone does not make you sleepy and so it's usually safe to drive or ride a bike while taking this medicine.\n\n【68】However, do not drive, cycle or operate machinery if your eyesight is affected.\n\n【69】Can I drink alcohol while taking dexamethasone?\n\n【70】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking dexamethasone.\n\n【71】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【72】No, you can eat and drink normally while taking dexamethasone.\n删除11：<u>More in Dexamethasone tablets and liquid\n----------------------------------------\n\n【73】*   About dexamethasone tablets and liquid\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 7 September 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 7 September 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:10", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:38", "cost": 27.621}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:56", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:09"}

Cyclizine works by blocking these signals and reducing feelings of sickness.\n\n【3】How long does it take to work?\n\n【4】Cyclizine starts to work after 30 minutes. You should feel better after 1 to 2 hours.\n\n【5】It should work for about 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】Cyclizine tablets are unlikely to do you any harm if you take them for a long time. However, there have been a few reports of people having problems stopping cyclizine injections after long-term use. Because of this, it's best to only take cyclizine for as long as you need it to control your symptoms.\n\n【8】How does cyclizine compare to other anti-sickness medicines?\n\n【9】Cyclizine is a type of drowsy (sedating) antihistamine, as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【10】There are other drowsy antihistamines that can help with feeling or being sick, such as promethazine and cinnarizine. Both cyclizine and cinnarizine are less likely to make you feel sleepy than promethazine.\n\n【11】There's not enough information available to say whether one is better than another for helping with sickness.\n\n【12】There are also other medicines that can help with sickness, such as metoclopramide, ondansetron and domperidone.\n\n【13】You may need to try a few different medicines to find out what works best for you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you're unsure.\n\n【14】Is cyclizine addictive?\n\n【15】It's unlikely that you'll get addicted to cyclizine tablets prescribed to help relieve sickness or feeling dizzy. However, to be on the safe side it's best to only take cyclizine for as long as you need to.\n\n【16】Are there other ways to treat morning sickness?\n\n【17】Most cases of feeling and being sick in pregnancy pass after 16 to 20 weeks.\n\n【18】If your morning sickness is not too bad, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to help.\n\n【19】Although cyclizine has not been officially approved for treating morning sickness, it's considered to be a useful and safe medicine to use in pregnancy.\n\n【20】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【21】Cyclizine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【22】But if cyclizine is not working for you and you're being sick, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【23】Check the pill packet to find out what to do or find out what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.\n\n【24】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【25】Do not drive a car, ride a bike or use heavy machinery or tools if cyclizine makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【26】This may be more likely when you first start taking cyclizine, but could happen at any time, for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【27】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected.

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**The term obese describes a person who has excess body fat.**\n\n【3】In the UK it's estimated that around 1 in every 4 adults and around 1 in every 5 children aged 10 to 11 are living with obesity.\n\n【4】How to tell if you're living with obesity\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】The most widely used method to check if you're a healthy weight is body mass index (BMI).\n\n【6】BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the NHS BMI healthy weight calculator to find out your BMI.\n\n【7】For most adults, if your BMI is:\n\n【8】*   below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range\n*   18.5 to 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range\n*   25 to 29.9 – you're in the overweight range\n*   30 to 39.9 – you're in the obese range\n*   40 or above – you're in the severely obese range\n\n【9】If you have a South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background you'll need to use a lower BMI score to measure overweight and obesity:\n\n【10】*   23 to 27.4 – you're in the overweight range\n*   27.5 or above – you're in the obese range\n\n【11】BMI score has some limitations because it measures whether a person is carrying too much weight but not too much fat. For example, people who are very muscular, like professional sportspeople, can have a high BMI without much fat.\n\n【12】But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight.\n\n【13】Another measure of excess fat is waist to height ratio, which can be used as an additional measure in adults who have a BMI under 35.\n\n【14】To calculate your waist to height ratio, measure around your waist just above your belly button, and divide it by your height, measured in the same units (for example, centimetres or inches).\n\n【15】A waist to height ratio of 0.5 or higher means you may have increased health risks.\n\n【16】Risks of living with obesity\n----------------------------\n\n【17】Obesity is a serious health concern that increases the risk of many other health conditions.\n\n【18】These include:\n\n【19】*   type 2 diabetes\n*   coronary heart disease\n*   some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer\n*   stroke\n\n【20】Living with overweight and obesity can also affect your quality of life and contribute to mental health problems, such as depression, and can also affect self-esteem.\n\n【21】Causes of obesity\n-----------------\n\n【22】Obesity is a complex issue with many causes. Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories, particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat.\n\n【23】Obesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity.\n\n【24】Genetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat.\n\n【25】There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines.\n\n【26】Some medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions.\n\n【27】Treating obesity\n----------------\n\n【28】The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly.\n\n【29】To do this, you can:\n\n【30】*   eat a balanced calorie-controlled diet as recommended by a GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)\n*   take up activities such as fast walking, jogging, swimming or tennis for 150 to 300 minutes (2.5 to 5 hours) a week\n\n【31】You may benefit from joining a local weight management programme with group meetings or online support. Your GP can tell you about these.\n\n【32】You may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits.\n\n【33】If you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended.\n\n【34】If taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.\n\n【35】A specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide or semaglutide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry.\n\n【36】For some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend weight loss surgery.\n\n【37】Other obesity-related problems\n------------------------------\n\n【38】Living with obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.\n\n【39】Day-to-day problems related to obesity include:\n\n【40】*   breathlessness\n*   increased sweating\n*   snoring\n*   difficulty doing physical activity\n*   often feeling very tired\n*   joint and back pain\n*   low confidence and self-esteem\n*   feeling isolated\n\n【41】The psychological problems associated with living with obesity can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.\n\n【42】### Serious health conditions\n\n【43】Living with obesity can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including:\n\n【44】*   type 2 diabetes \n*   high blood pressure\n*   high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and stroke\n*   asthma\n*   metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity\n*   several types of cancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer and womb cancer\n*   gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the gullet\n*   gallstones \n*   reduced fertility\n*   osteoarthritis, a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints\n*   sleep apnoea, a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease\n*   liver disease and kidney disease\n*   pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia, when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy\n\n【45】Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is.\n\n【46】Outlook\n-------\n\n【47】Managing a complex issue like obesity can be hard. Losing weight takes time and commitment.\n\n【48】The healthcare professionals involved with your care can provide encouragement and advice about how to mange your weight, build healthy lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss achieved.\n\n【49】Completing a weight management programme, regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with ways to lose weight can also help.\n\n【50】It's important to remember that losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n【51】Information:\n\n【52】### Social care and support guide\n\n【53】If you:\n\n【54】*   need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n*   care for someone regularly because they're ill, disabled or because of their age (including family members)\n\n【55】Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support.\n\n【56】Couch to 5K\n-----------\n\n【57】If it's been a long time since you did any exercise, you should check out the Couch to 5K running plan.\n\n【58】It consists of podcasts delivered over the course of 9 weeks and has been specifically designed for absolute beginners.\n\n【59】To begin with, you start running for short periods of time, and as the plan progresses, gradually increase the amount.\n\n【60】At the end of the 9 weeks, you should be able to run for 30 minutes non-stop, which for most people is around 5 kilometres (3.1 miles).\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:24", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:29:03", "cost": 38.572}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:29:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:24"}

This peaks during the early part of the night, so sleepwalking tends to happen in the first few hours after falling asleep.\n\n【3】Sleepwalking can start at any age but is more common in children. It's thought 1 in 5 children will sleepwalk at least once. Most grow out of it by the time they reach puberty, but it can sometimes persist into adulthood.\n\n【4】Why some people sleepwalk\n-------------------------\n\n【5】The exact cause of sleepwalking is unknown, but it seems to run in families. You're more likely to sleepwalk if other members of your close family have or had sleepwalking behaviours or night terrors.\n\n【6】The following things can trigger sleepwalking or make it worse:\n\n【7】*   not getting enough sleep\n*   stress and anxiety\n*   infection with a high temperature, especially in children\n*   drinking too much alcohol\n*   taking drugs\n*   certain types of medicine, such as some sedatives\n*   being startled by a sudden noise or touch, causing abrupt waking from deep sleep\n*   waking up suddenly from deep sleep because you need to go to the toilet\n\n【8】Other sleep disorders that can cause you to frequently wake up suddenly during the night, such as obstructive sleep apnoea and restless legs syndrome, can also trigger a sleepwalking episode.\n\n【9】Taking steps to prevent some of these triggers – such as making sure you get enough sleep, and working on strategies to deal with and reduce stress – will often help.\n\n【10】What happens when a person sleepwalks\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】In some episodes of sleepwalking, a person may just sit up in bed and look around, briefly appearing confused. Others may get out of bed and walk about, open cupboards, get dressed or eat, and they may appear agitated.\n\n【12】In extreme cases, the person may walk out of the house and carry out complex activities, such as driving a car.\n\n【13】The eyes are usually open while someone is sleepwalking, although the person will look straight through people and not recognise them. They can often move well around familiar objects.\n\n【14】If you talk to a person who is sleepwalking, they may partially respond or say things that do not make sense.\n\n【15】Most sleepwalking episodes last less than 10 minutes, but they can be longer. At the end of each episode, the person may wake up, or return to bed and go to sleep.\n\n【16】They will not normally have any memory of it in the morning or may have patchy memory. If woken while sleepwalking, the person may feel confused and not remember what happened.\n\n【17】What to do if you find someone sleepwalking\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The best thing to do if you see someone sleepwalking is to make sure they're safe. If undisturbed, they will often go back to sleep again. Gently guide them back to bed by reassuring them.\n\n【19】Do not shout or startle the person and do not try to physically restrain them unless they're in danger, as they may lash out.\n\n【20】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【21】Occasional sleepwalking episodes do not usually need medical attention. Sleepwalking is rarely a sign of anything serious and may get better with time, particularly in children.\n\n【22】But, you should consider seeing a GP if sleepwalking happens frequently, you're concerned a person may be at risk of injuring themselves or others, or the episodes continue or start in adult life.\n\n【23】The GP may refer you to a specialist sleep centre, where your or your child's sleep history can be discussed in more detail. If appropriate, sleep studies can be arranged to exclude other conditions that could be triggering the sleepwalking, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome.\n\n【24】Treatments for sleepwalking\n---------------------------\n\n【25】There's no specific treatment for sleepwalking, but it generally helps to try to get enough sleep and have a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime. \n\n【26】You may find the following advice helpful:\n\n【27】*   try to go to bed at a similar time each night\n*   make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet when you go to sleep\n*   limit drinks before bedtime, particularly ones containing caffeine, and go to the toilet before going to sleep\n*   find ways to relax before going to bed, such as having a warm bath, reading or deep breathing\n*   if your child sleepwalks at the same time most nights, try gently waking them for a short time 15 to 30 minutes before they would normally sleepwalk – this may stop them sleepwalking by altering their normal sleep cycle\n\n【28】Read about sleep and young children.\n\n【29】Medicine is not usually used to treat sleepwalking. However, medicines such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants are sometimes used if you sleepwalk often or there's a risk you could seriously injure yourself or others. These medicines can help you sleep and may reduce the frequency of sleepwalking episodes.\n\n【30】Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy may sometimes be helpful.\n\n【31】Preventing accidents\n--------------------\n\n【32】It's important to keep the areas of your home where a person may sleepwalk free of breakable or potentially harmful objects and to remove any items they could trip over. It's also a good idea to keep windows and doors locked.\n\n【33】If your child sleepwalks, do not let them sleep on the top bed of a bunk bed. You may want to fit safety gates at the top of the stairs.\n\n【34】It's also important to tell babysitters, relatives or friends who look after your child at night that your child may sleepwalk and what they should do if it happens.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 October 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:09:04", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:09:38", "cost": 33.514}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:09:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:09:03"}

Overview\n2.  When it's used\n3.  How it's performed\n4.  Recovery\n5.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Lumbar decompression surgery is a type of surgery used to treat compressed nerves in the lower (lumbar) spine.**\n\n【3】It's only recommended when non-surgical treatments haven't helped. \n\n【4】The surgery aims to improve symptoms such as persistent pain and numbness in the legs caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine.\n\n【5】Lumbar decompression surgery is used to treat:\n\n【6】*   **spinal stenosis** – narrowing of a section of the spinal column, which puts pressure on the nerves inside\n*   **a** **slipped disc** and **sciatica** – where a damaged spinal disc presses down on an underlying nerve\n*   **spinal injuries** – such as a fracture or the swelling of tissue\n*   **metastatic spinal cord compression** – where cancer in one part of the body, such as the lungs, spreads into the spine and presses on the spinal cord or nerves\n\n【7】What happens during lumbar decompression surgery\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】If lumbar decompression surgery is recommended, you'll usually have at least 1 of the following procedures:\n\n【9】*   **laminectomy** – where a section of bone is removed from 1 of your vertebrae (spinal bones) to relieve pressure on the affected nerve\n*   **discectomy** – where a section of a damaged disc is removed to relieve pressure on a nerve\n*   **spinal fusion** – where 2 or more vertebrae are joined together with a section of bone to stabilise and strengthen the spine\n\n【10】In many cases, a combination of these techniques may be used.\n\n【11】Lumbar decompression is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain as it's carried out. The whole operation usually takes at least an hour, but may take much longer, depending on the complexity of the procedure.\n\n【12】Recovering from lumbar decompression surgery\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【13】You'll usually be well enough to leave hospital about 1 to 4 days after having surgery, depending on the complexity of the surgery and your level of mobility before the operation.\n\n【14】Most people are able to walk unassisted within a day of having the operation, although more strenuous activities will need to be avoided for about 6 weeks.\n\n【15】You may be able to return to work after about 4 to 6 weeks, although you may need more time off if your job involves driving for long periods or lifting heavy objects.\n\n【16】Effectiveness of lumbar decompression surgery\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【17】There's good evidence that decompression surgery can be an effective treatment for people with severe pain caused by compressed nerves. \n\n【18】Many people who have the operation experience a significant improvement in pain. People who found walking difficult before surgery because of leg pain or weakness are often able to walk further and more easily after the operation.\n\n【19】Risks of lumbar decompression surgery\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Although lumbar decompression is often successful, like all types of surgery it carries a risk of complications.\n\n【21】Complications associated with lumbar decompression surgery include:\n\n【22】*   infection at the site of the operation, or in rare cases an infection elsewhere\n*   a blood clot developing in 1 of your leg veins, known as DVT (deep vein thrombosis); in rare cases, the clot can dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a serious problem called a pulmonary embolism\n*   damage to the spinal nerves or cord – resulting in continuing symptoms, numbness or weakness in 1 or both legs, or in rare cases some degree of paralysis\n\n【23】Surgery tends to be safer if you do not smoke, have good general fitness and lose weight if needed.\n\n【24】The spine and spinal cord\n-------------------------\n\n【25】The spine is made up of 33 segments, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of each other to form the spinal column. In between each vertebra are protective, circular pads of tissue called discs, which cushion the vertebrae during activities such as walking and running.\n\n【26】The spinal canal runs through the centre of the spinal column. It contains and protects the spinal cord and nerves.\n删除3：<u>Video: lumbar surgery\n---------------------\n\n【27】In this video, an expert talks about what happens during lumbar surgery.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 12 January 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 12 January 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 April 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : When it's used</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:33", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:48", "cost": 15.437}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:33"}

About oxybutynin\n--------------------\n\n【3】Oxybutynin is a medicine used to treat symptoms of an overactive bladder. These can include:\n\n【4】*   a sudden and urgent need to pee (urinary urgency)\n*   needing to pee more often than usual (urinary frequency)\n*   wetting yourself if you cannot make it to the loo in time (urinary incontinence)\n\n【5】It's also used to treat bedwetting in children (nocturnal enuresis).\n\n【6】Oxybutynin works by relaxing the muscles around your bladder. This means your bladder can hold more liquid and you do not need to pee as often or as urgently.\n\n【7】Oxybutynin is only available on prescription.\n\n【8】It comes as standard tablets for immediate release, or slow-release tablets (also called prolonged release), a liquid to swallow, or as patches.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Oxybutynin may take up to 4 weeks to reach its full effect. If the symptoms do not improve after 1 to 2 weeks, talk to your doctor.\n*   Your doctor will do a review after 4 weeks to check oxybutynin is still working and is the best treatment for you.\n*   Your doctor will also check that your treatment is still needed every 6 to 12 months .\n*   Common side effects of oxybutynin include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and feeling dizzy or sleepy.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol when you first start taking oxybutynin, as it can make you very sleepy.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take oxybutynin\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Oxybutynin can be taken by adults and children aged 5 years or over.\n\n【13】Oxybutynin is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor before starting oxybutynin if you have:\n\n【14】*   ever had an allergic reaction to oxybutynin, any of its ingredients or any other medicine\n*   myasthenia gravis, a rare long-term condition that causes muscle weakness\n*   an eye problem called glaucoma\n*   difficulty peeing, or an enlarged prostate\n*   ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease\n*   heart problems, including a very fast heart rate or high blood pressure\n*   thyroid, kidney or liver problems\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take oxybutynin\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Always read the information that comes with your medicine.\n\n【17】### Dosage and strength of standard tablets\n\n【18】Standard tablets come as either 2.5mg, 3mg or 5mg.\n\n【19】The usual starting dose of 2.5mg is 1 tablet, taken twice a day, in the morning or evening, or 1 tablet, taken 3 times a day.\n\n【20】If you take 3 doses a day, space each dose evenly throughout the day. You could take it first thing in the morning, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime.\n\n【21】### Dosage and strength of slow-release tablets\n\n【22】Slow-release tablets come in 2 strengths, 5mg and 10mg. The usual starting dose is 5mg once a day.\n\n【23】### Dosage and strength of liquid\n\n【24】Oxybutynin is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets. It comes in 2 strengths:\n\n【25】*   2.5mg of oxybutynin in a 5ml spoonful\n*   5mg in oxybutynin in a 5ml spoonful\n\n【26】The usual starting dose for an adult is 5mg, taken twice a day (12 hours apart), or 5mg, taken 3 times a day.\n\n【27】The dose will usually be lower for adults over 65 and children.\n\n【28】If you take 3 doses a day, space each dose evenly throughout the day. You could take it first thing in the morning, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime.\n\n【29】### How to take standard tablets\n\n【30】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. You can take tablets with or without food.\n\n【31】### How to take slow-release tablets\n\n【32】Slow-release tablets release oxybutynin slowly and evenly throughout the day.\n\n【33】Swallow these tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not break, crush or chew them.\n\n【34】Try to take your tablet at the same time each day. This will help you to remember to take them.\n\n【35】Part of the tablet can pass through your body and you might see it in your poo. Do not worry, this is normal and does not affect the way the medicine works.\n\n【36】### How to take liquid\n\n【37】If you are giving this medicine to a child to help stop them wetting the bed, give the last dose just before bedtime.\n\n【38】Oxybutynin liquid will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount of medicine.\n\n【39】### How to use patches\n\n【40】Oxybutynin patches are applied twice a week.\n\n【41】They work like a plaster. you stick them to your skin.\n\n【42】1.  Follow the instructions that come with the patches.\n2.  Stick a patch to clean, dry skin on your stomach, hip or bottom twice a week (every 3 or 4 days).\n3.  Change the patch on the same 2 days every week, such as every Sunday and Wednesday, or Monday and Thursday.\n4.  Remove the old patch before sticking on the new one.\n5.  Stick the new patch to a different area of your stomach, hips or bottom. Using the same area may irritate your skin. Do not stick the patch in the same place for at least 1 week.\n\n【43】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【44】Your doctor may increase your dose depending on how the medicine works for you.\n\n【45】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【46】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【47】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【48】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.\n\n【49】### What if I take too much?\n\n【50】Taking 1 extra dose of oxybutynin is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【51】However, you may get more side effects, such as a dry mouth or headache.\n\n【52】The amount of oxybutynin that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person, and too much oxybutynin can be dangerous.\n\n【53】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【54】You take 2 or more extra doses of oxybutynin and you:\n\n【55】*   have hallucinations\n*   feel very restless or excited\n*   have dilated pupils in your eyes\n*   are not able to pee\n\n【56】Call 111 or go to 111.nhs.uk\n\n【57】If you need to go to hospital, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you, or to call you an ambulance.\n\n【58】Take the oxybutynin packet with you, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine.\n\n【59】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【60】You take more than your usual dose of oxybutynin and you have:\n\n【61】*   a fast heartbeat\n*   breathing problems\n\n【62】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【63】Like all medicines, oxybutynin can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them.\n\n【64】Keep taking oxybutynin, but talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away, or if you notice any other possible side effects.\n\n【65】### Common side effects of oxybutynin\n\n【66】These common side effects of oxybutynin may affect more than 1 in 100 people:\n\n【67】*   dry mouth\n*   headache\n*   feeling dizzy, sleepy, or a spinning sensation (vertigo)\n*   diarrhoea or being sick (vomiting)\n*   constipation\n*   farting and burping (wind)\n*   stomach pain\n*   dry eyes\n*   blurred vision\n*   problems or pain when peeing, and not being able to empty your bladder\n\n【68】### Serious side effects\n\n【69】Serious side effects are rare.\n\n【70】Tell your doctor if you have:\n\n【71】*   stomach pain (especially after meals), feeling sick or being sick, a persistent urge to poo, not being able to poo or you have runny poos – these are all signs of faecal impaction, where large, hardened poo gets stuck and you cannot push it out\n*   difficulty fully emptying your bladder, or difficulty in starting to pee – these are signs of urinary retention, where pee builds up in your bladder because you're unable to pee\n*   high temperature or chills, burning sensation when peeing, pain in your back or side, or bloody or cloudy pee – these can be signs of a severe urinary tract infection (UTI)\n*   swollen ankles or legs (oedema) – where fluid builds up in your legs\n\n【72】Do not take any more oxybutynin and call a doctor straight away if you feel you're overheating and not sweating when you're in hot surroundings.\n\n【73】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【74】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to oxybutynin.\n\n【75】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【76】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【77】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【78】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【79】These are not all the side effects of oxybutynin. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【80】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n删除12：<u>Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u></u>\n\n【81】6\\. How to cope with side effects of oxybutynin\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【82】**What to do about:**\n\n【83】*   **dry mouth** – try sugar-free gum or having sugar-free sweets. Having a dry mouth can cause tooth decay or a fungal infection. It also might stop medicine that you put under your tongue from dissolving properly, such as medicine for angina.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headache is severe or lasts longer than 1 or 2 days.\n*   **feeling dizzy, sleepy or a spinning sensation** – do not drive, cycle, use tools, or operate machinery. Avoid drinking alcohol, as this may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your doctor if the dizziness or sleepiness bothers you or lasts more than a few days.\n*   **diarrhoea or being sick** – drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor, if the effects last more than 1 or 2 days.\n*   **constipation** – eat more high-fibre foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to a pharmacist or doctor. Watch this short video about how to treat constipation.\n*   **farting and burping** – eat less foods that cause wind, like lentils, peas, beans and onions. It might also help to eat smaller and more frequent meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. Ask your pharmacist about remedies you can buy to help with trapped wind.\n*   **stomach pain** – try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Try putting a heat pad or a covered hot water bottle on your stomach to help. If you have episodes of severe, griping pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry eyes** – ask your pharmacist or optician to recommend some eye drops. If you wear contact lenses and these become uncomfortable, you might have to wear glasses instead while you're taking this medicine.\n*   **blurred vision** – do not drive or cycle until you can see clearly again. Do not take your next dose of oxybutynin if your vision is still blurred. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist if your vision has not returned to normal a day after taking your last dose.\n*   **problems or pain when peeing** – try to relax when you pee. Do not try to force the flow of urine. If it does not happen, try again later. Talk to a doctor urgently if you cannot pee at all.\n\n【84】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【85】### Oxybutynin and pregnancy\n\n【86】Oxybutynin is occasionally used in pregnancy when bladder symptoms are severe and cannot be controlled any other way.\n\n【87】If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about whether taking oxybutynin is right for you.\n\n【88】### Oxybutynin and breastfeeding\n\n【89】Oxybutynin is not usually recommended while breastfeeding. However, you may still need to take it.\n\n【90】It's not known how much oxybutynin gets into breast milk, but it's likely to be small.\n\n【91】If your doctor says it's OK for you to keep taking oxybutynin, monitor your baby for possible side effects, such as constipation, peeing less and colic.\n\n【92】Talk to your doctor, midwife, or health visitor if you have any concerns about your baby, or you do not think your baby is putting on enough weight.\n\n【93】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【94】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【95】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about treating bladder problems (urinary incontinence) during pregnancy, read this leaflet on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【96】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【97】Oxybutynin may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how oxybutynin works.\n\n【98】Tell your pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\n【99】*   amantadine, a medicine used for Parkinson's disease or for infections\n*   levodopa, used to treat Parkinson's disease\n*   phenothiazines, clozapine, haloperidol or benperidol, medicines for mental health problems\n*   donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine or tacrine, medicines used for dementia\n*   amitriptyline, imipramine or dosulepin (tricyclic antidepressants), medicines for depression\n*   medicines used to make you feel sleepy (sedatives)\n*   anti-sickness medicines like prochlorperazine\n*   medicines for stomach and bowel-related problems like domperidone and metoclopramide\n*   digoxin, quinidine or disopyramide, medicines used to treat heart problems\n*   dipyridamole, used to treat blood problems\n*   chlorphenamine or diphenhydramine, medicines used to treat allergies\n*   any medicines used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, incontinence, motion sickness or movement disorders related to Parkinson's disease, that work in a similar way to oxybutynin\n\n【100】### Mixing oxybutynin with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【101】There's very little information about taking oxybutynin with herbal remedies and supplements. These remedies are not tested in the same way as medicines.\n\n【102】Some herbal medicines can make you feel sleepy, cause a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee. Their effect is similar to oxybutynin. This can increase your risk of getting side effects or make your side effects worse.\n\n【103】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【104】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【105】9\\. Common questions about oxybutynin\n-------------------------------------\n\n【106】How does oxybutynin work?\n\n【107】Oxybutynin is a type of medicine called an antimuscarinic (or anticholinergic) muscle relaxant.\n\n【108】It works by relaxing the muscle that is found in the wall of the bladder. This helps to increase the volume of pee your bladder can hold and control the release of pee.\n\n【109】How long does it take to work?\n\n【110】Oxybutynin starts to work after about 3 to 4 hours to relax the muscle surrounding your bladder.\n\n【111】However it may take up to 4 weeks before it works fully.\n\n【112】If your symptoms do not start to get better after 7 days talk to your doctor.\n\n【113】Talk to your doctor if your symptoms get worse at any time.\n\n【114】How long will I take it for?\n\n【115】Usually, you'll need to take oxybutynin for a long time.\n\n【116】After 4 weeks your doctor will check that oxybutynin is helping your symptoms. They'll also do a review every 6 to 12 months after that to check it's still working for you.\n\n【117】Take oxybutynin until your doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop taking it just because you feel better.\n\n【118】Is it safe to take for a long time?\n\n【119】There may be an increased risk of confusion and possibly dementia in people taking oxybutynin, but more study needs to be done. If you're worried about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【120】Do not take oxybutynin for longer than you need to. Your doctor will check every 6 to 12 months that your treatment is still needed.\n\n【121】Is it safe to take with painkillers?\n\n【122】It's safe to take oxybutynin with everyday painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n\n【123】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【124】If you've been taking oxybutynin for at least 6 months your doctor may suggest that you stop taking the medicine for up to 4 weeks to see how your symptoms change without it.\n\n【125】Some people find that the improvement in their symptoms continues after the medicine has been stopped. Talk to your doctor if you're thinking about stopping your medicine.\n\n【126】Do not stop taking oxybutynin without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【127】Are there other medicines for urinary incontinence and overactive bladder?\n\n【128】Oxybutynin belongs to a group of medicines called antimuscarinics. There are other antimuscarinics that can be used for overactive bladder:\n\n【129】*   solifenacin\n*   tolterodine\n*   darifenacin\n*   fesoterodine\n*   propiverine\n*   trospium\n\n【130】They all seem to work just as well as oxybutynin. However, if you get side effects with one antimuscarinic a different one may suit you better.\n\n【131】If antimuscarinics are unsuitable for you, they have not helped your overactive bladder, or you have had side effects, you may be offered a medicine called mirabegron, which works in a slightly different way.\n\n【132】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【133】Try to avoid drinking alcohol when you first start taking oxybutynin, or if your dose is increased, to see how you feel. Oxybutynin combined with alcohol can make you feel very sleepy.\n\n【134】Drinking alcohol may make you more likely to need to get up in the night to pee.\n\n【135】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【136】You can eat normally while taking oxybutynin. If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola.\n\n【137】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【138】Oxybutynin can make you feel less hungry, so you may lose weight.\n\n【139】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking oxybutynin, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【140】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【141】Oxybutynin does not stop contraceptive pills working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【142】However, if oxybutynin makes you sick or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【143】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【144】There's no clear evidence to suggest that taking oxybutynin will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【145】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【146】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【147】Do not drive a car, ride a bike, use tools or operate machinery if oxybutynin makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【148】This may be more likely when you first start taking it, but it could happen at any time, such as when you increase the dose or start another medicine.\n\n【149】Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking oxybutynin.\n\n【150】Are there lifestyle changes that can help overactive bladder?\n\n【151】There are a number of lifestyle changes that may help your symptoms. It's a good idea to:\n\n【152】*   cut back on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola, as caffeine can increase how much you pee\n*   not drink too much or too little fluid during the day, as this can make incontinence worse\n*   lose weight if you are overweight or obese, as being overweight can increase your risk of urinary incontinence – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out if you're a healthy weight for your height\n*   try pelvic floor muscle training (Kegel exercises)\n*   try bladder training\n*   discuss other options for urinary incontinence with your doctor, such as surgery and procedures\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【153】*   Urinary incontinence\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【154】*   HealthUnlocked: oxybutynin forum\n*   Bladder & Bowel UK: charity\n*   Medicines for Children: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 June 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:35", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:26:24", "cost": 49.392}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:26:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:34"}

Overview\n2.  Seeing a specialist\n3.  Before surgery\n4.  On the day\n5.  After surgery\n6.  Getting back to normal</u>\n\n【2】**After surgery, you'll be moved back to the ward (after local anaesthetic) or a recovery room (after general anaesthetic or an epidural), where you'll be told how the operation went.**\n\n【3】You may feel hazy or groggy as you come round from the general anaesthetic. A nurse may give you oxygen (through tubes in your nose or a mask) to help you feel better.\n\n【4】It's common to feel sick or vomit after you've been given general anaesthesia. Your nurse may offer you medicine to help with sickness. You may also have a sore throat and dry mouth.\n\n【5】Your blood pressure will be taken regularly. This will either be done by a nurse, or by using an automatic cuff that squeezes tightly at regular times. Your temperature will also be taken.\n\n【6】The outcome of your operation\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】It's important to find out how your operation went.\n\n【8】Here are some questions you may want to ask:\n\n【9】*   Was the operation as successful as expected?\n*   What effect has the operation had on my condition?\n*   How will I expect to feel when I get home?\n*   How long will it be before I'm back to normal?\n\n【10】Coping with pain\n----------------\n\n【11】You'll always have some pain after having surgery. Tell your nurse as soon as you start to feel any pain so they can give you painkilling medicine as soon as possible.\n\n【12】This will stop it getting worse (medicine can take 20 minutes to start working) and improve it.\n\n【13】Avoiding blood clots\n--------------------\n\n【14】The sooner you start to move around, the better. Lying in bed for too long can cause some of your blood to pool in your legs. This puts you at risk of a blood clot.\n\n【15】If possible, doing some leg exercises can help prevent a blood clot. These may be as simple as flexing your knees or ankles and rotating your feet.\n\n【16】You may be given special support stockings to wear after surgery to help your blood circulation. Your nurse or doctor will explain how you should use these.\n\n【17】Some people are given an injection to thin the blood slightly to help reduce the risk of clots.\n\n【18】Enhanced recovery\n-----------------\n\n【19】Research shows the earlier you get out of bed and start walking, eating and drinking after your operation, the better.\n\n【20】Your hospital may offer an enhanced recovery programme if you have had major surgery. This rehabilitation programme aims to get you back to full health quickly.\n\n【21】Plan for your days after surgery\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】It's important to arrange for appropriate care after your operation. For older people, it's important to arrange for suitable equipment and care.\n\n【23】You should not be afraid to ask for things that may help you, such as a wheelchair or walking frame.\n\n【24】It's a good idea to have an adult available to help you for at least 24 hours after having a general anaesthetic or an epidural.\n\n【25】Discharge from hospital\n-----------------------\n\n【26】Before you leave hospital, you may (depending on the type of operation you had) have an appointment with a physiotherapist. They'll be able to advise you about any exercises you need to carry out.\n\n【27】You'll also be given advice about how to care for your wound, any equipment you may require, such as dressings, bandages, crutches and splints, and maybe painkillers.\n\n【28】Each hospital will have its own policy and arrangements for sending patients home (discharge).\n\n【29】Your discharge will be affected by:\n\n【30】*   how quickly your health improves while you're in hospital\n*   what support you'll need after you return home\n\n【31】You may want to ask some questions before you leave hospital, such as:\n\n【32】*   Who should I call if I have any concerns once I'm home?\n*   What should I be trying to do on my own – for example, going to the bathroom and getting out of bed?\n*   Is there anything I should avoid doing?\n*   When can I go back to work?\n*   How much pain, bruising or swelling should I expect when I get home?\n*   When and where will any stitches be removed?\n*   Do I need to return to hospital or my GP for follow-up? If so, when will this be?\n删除7：<u>Read more about being discharged from hospital.</u>\n\n【33】Transport home\n--------------\n\n【34】You will not usually be able to drive yourself home after surgery.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Recovery</u>\n\n【2】**Guillain-Barré syndrome is thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, the body's natural defence against illness and infection.**\n\n【3】Normally the immune system attacks any germs that get into the body. But in people with Guillain-Barré syndrome, something goes wrong and it mistakenly attacks the nerves.\n\n【4】This damages the nerves and stops signals from the brain travelling along them properly, which can cause problems such as numbness, weakness and pain in the limbs.\n\n【5】It's not clear exactly why this happens. The condition is not passed from person to person and is not inherited.\n\n【6】Possible triggers\n-----------------\n\n【7】Sometimes Guillain-Barré syndrome appears to have a particular trigger. These are some of the main triggers.\n\n【8】### Infections\n\n【9】In most cases, Guillain-Barré syndrome occurs a few days or weeks after an infection.\n\n【10】Infections that have been known to trigger the condition include:\n\n【11】*   food poisoning – especially if caused by Campylobacter bacteria\n*   flu\n*   cytomegalovirus – a common virus that does not usually cause any symptoms\n*   glandular fever\n*   HIV\n*   some tropical diseases, including dengue and the Zika virus\n\n【12】### Vaccinations\n\n【13】In the past, vaccinations (particularly the flu vaccine used in the US during a swine flu outbreak in 1976) were linked to an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n【14】But research has since found the chances of developing the condition after having a vaccination are extremely small.\n\n【15】For example, a study into the vaccine used during the 2009 swine flu outbreak found that for every million people who had the vaccination, there were fewer than 2 extra cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n\n【16】And evidence suggests that you are far more likely to get Guillain-Barré syndrome from an infection, such as the flu, than the vaccine designed to prevent the infection, such as the flu jab.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:26", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:34", "cost": 7.808}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:26"}

Overview\n2.  Uses\n3.  Dosage\n4.  Considerations\n5.  Side effects</u>\n\n【2】**If you're prescribed anticoagulants, always follow the instructions of your GP or another healthcare professional.**\n\n【3】Some of the main issues you'll need to consider while taking your medicine are outlined below.\n\n【4】Having surgery\n--------------\n\n【5】If you're taking anticoagulants and you need to have surgery or any kind of invasive procedure, make sure that the healthcare professionals treating you are aware of your medicine.\n\n【6】This includes procedures used to diagnose other conditions, such as an endoscopy or cystoscopy.\n\n【7】As anticoagulants reduce the ability of your blood to clot, there's a risk you could experience heavy bleeding if any kind of cut (incision) is made during a procedure.\n\n【8】You may therefore be advised to stop taking your medicine before surgery.\n\n【9】If you're having a dental procedure, such as having a tooth removed, tell your dentist that you take anticoagulants.\n\n【10】You may not need to stop taking your medicine, but you might need to have a blood test before the procedure to make sure your blood clots at the right speed.\n\n【11】Only stop taking your medicine on the advice of your GP or another healthcare professional.\n\n【12】Pregnancy\n---------\n\n【13】Warfarin isn't normally given to pregnant women because it can affect the unborn baby.\n\n【14】It can cause birth defects or excessive bleeding from the placenta or foetus.\n\n【15】It may sometimes be used in the second trimester, but should never be taken during the first trimester and should ideally be avoided in the third trimester as well.\n\n【16】The newer anticoagulant medicines apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Lixiana) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) also are not recommended in pregnancy.\n\n【17】If you're taking any of these medicines, you should make sure you use contraception when having sex to avoid becoming pregnant.\n\n【18】If you're on anticoagulants and find out you're pregnant or plan to start trying for a baby, speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic about stopping or changing your prescription. \n\n【19】Injections of an anticoagulant called heparin can be given while you're pregnant if necessary.删除7：<u>Read more about heparin on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website.</u>\n\n【20】Breastfeeding\n-------------\n\n【21】You can usually take warfarin while you're breastfeeding, but you should discuss this with your GP or midwife first.\n\n【22】Heparin is also safe to take while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【23】Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban aren't recommended if you're breastfeeding because it's not clear if they're safe for the baby.\n\n【24】If you're on anticoagulants and are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or midwife to find out if you need to change your prescription.\n\n【25】Avoiding injury\n---------------\n\n【26】Taking anticoagulant medicines can make you more prone to bleeding if you're injured.\n\n【27】Try to avoid minor injuries and cuts and grazes by:\n\n【28】*   taking care when brushing your teeth and shaving (consider using a soft toothbrush and an electric razor)\n*   using insect repellent to avoid insect bites or stings\n*   using protection when gardening, sewing or playing sports\n\n【29】Your GP or anticoagulant clinic may advise you to avoid contact sports because of the risk of excessive bleeding.\n\n【30】Other medicines and remedies\n----------------------------\n\n【31】If you're taking anticoagulants, you should speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medicine, remedy or supplement.\n\n【32】This includes prescription medicines, medicines bought over the counter without a prescription (such as aspirin), and any herbal remedies (such as St John's Wort).\n\n【33】Some treatments can stop anticoagulants working or can increase the effect they have, which can be dangerous.\n\n【34】Some of the medicines that can affect anticoagulants include certain:\n\n【35】*   antibiotics\n*   antidepressants\n*   steroids (medicines used to reduce inflammation)\n*   anticonvulsants (medicines used to treat epilepsy)\n*   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (take paracetamol instead if you need pain relief)\n\n【36】For a full list of medicines that you should avoid, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\n\n【37】Food and drink\n--------------\n\n【38】It's important to have a healthy, balanced diet that includes lots of fruit and vegetables if you're taking anticoagulants.\n\n【39】But you should avoid making frequent changes to the amount of green vegetables you eat if you're taking warfarin.\n\n【40】Foods with a lot of vitamin K, such as leafy green vegetables, chickpeas and liver, can interfere with how warfarin works.\n\n【41】You can still include these in your diet while taking warfarin, as the clinic will adjust your dose accordingly, but it's important to be consistent in the amount you eat.\n\n【42】Do not drink cranberry juice, grapefruit juice or pomegranate juice while you're taking warfarin. They can increase the blood-thinning effect of warfarin.\n\n【43】You should also seek advice before taking supplements containing vitamin K.\n\n【44】The effect of warfarin is also affected by alcohol. If you're taking warfarin, do not drink more than 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks a day and never binge drink.\n\n【45】These food and drink restrictions don't usually apply if you're taking apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban, but you should check with your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist if you're not sure.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Dosage</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Side effects</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:41", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:55", "cost": 14.13}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:41"}

It's best to arrange for someone to drive you home.\n\n【29】When you get home:\n\n【30】*   stay close to a toilet for the next few hours, as you may find you need to empty your bowels quite often at first\n*   your poo may be a whitish colour for a few days – this is normal and is just the remaining barium passing out of your body\n*   you can eat and drink as normal – drink plenty of fluids and eat high-fibre foods for the first few days to help stop the barium causing constipation\n\n【31】The X-ray images taken during the test will be analysed by a specialist. A report will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test and you can discuss the results at your next appointment.\n\n【32】Does a barium enema hurt?\n-------------------------\n\n【33】Having a barium enema may be a bit embarrassing and unpleasant, but it shouldn't be painful.\n\n【34】You'll probably feel uncomfortable when the air is pumped into your bowel during the test, similar to the feeling of having trapped wind.\n\n【35】You may have some bloating, wind or stomach cramps for a short while afterwards.\n\n【36】Are there any risks or side effects?\n------------------------------------\n\n【37】A barium enema is generally a very safe procedure, although there a few risks and side effects that you should be aware of.\n\n【38】These include:\n\n【39】*   laxative side effects – side effects such as feeling sick, a mild headache and bloating are common, but shouldn't last long\n*   barium side effects – barium is usually harmless, but it can cause an upset stomach or constipation, and can cause an allergic reaction in very rare cases\n*   radiation exposure – you'll be exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test; this is about the equivalent to what you would receive naturally from the environment over 3 years (for more information, see GOV.UK: patient dose information)\n*   bowel perforation – there's a risk of a small hole developing in your bowel as a result of the procedure, but this is very rare\n\n【40】Your doctor can help you weigh up the risks of the procedure against the benefits of identifying any problem in your bowel.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:50:17", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:51:28", "cost": 70.609}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:51:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:50:16"}

Alternatives</u>\n\n【2】**Following a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), you may need to recover in hospital for1 to 3 days before you can go home.**\n\n【3】While in hospital, you may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenously) until you've recovered from the anaesthetic and are able to eat and drink.\n\n【4】You shouldn't experience any severe pain, but there may be some discomfort and bladder spasms (contractions) from the catheter, which is left in place because your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) will be swollen and sore.\n\n【5】Before you're discharged, you'll be given advice about your recovery. A follow-up appointment to check your progress should be made for a few weeks later.\n\n【6】Peeing after TURP\n-----------------\n\n【7】You won't be able to pee normally at first because your urethra will be swollen.\n\n【8】The catheter used to flush out your bladder during the operation will be left in place for a while to allow you to pee until the swelling goes down.\n\n【9】During the day after the operation, water may be pumped through the catheter to clean your bladder and get rid of any blood clots and other debris.\n\n【10】This usually is not painful, but may make your bladder feel uncomfortably full.\n\n【11】The catheter may be removed to check if you can pee before going home.\n\n【12】It's normal to find peeing uncomfortable and difficult to control for at least a few days after the catheter is removed.\n\n【13】If you still cannot pee, a catheter may need to be put back in.\n\n【14】You'll be able to go home with the catheter still in place, and an appointment will be made to remove it a few days or weeks later. \n\n【15】See living with a urinary catheter for information about looking after your catheter.\n\n【16】Recovering at home\n------------------\n\n【17】It's common to feel tired and under the weather for a week or two after having a TURP. Most men are up and about after 3 to 4 weeks recovery.\n\n【18】For the first 3 to 4 weeks, you shouldn't lift or move any heavy objects (including shopping) or do any strenuous exercise. If possible, ask friends or family members if they can help around the house.\n\n【19】Once you feel able, gentle exercise such as walking will help keep your blood circulating and lower your risk of getting a blood clot in your legs.\n\n【20】Drinking plenty of water while you're recovering may help reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) and can help clear any blood from your pee.\n\n【21】You may also be advised to do some pelvic floor exercises to help improve your bladder control.\n\n【22】Any pain can usually be treated by taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【23】Returning to your normal activities\n-----------------------------------\n\n【24】It usually takes between 3 and 4 weeks to fully recover from a TURP. Your surgeon or GP will advise you about when it's safe to return to your normal activities.\n\n【25】### Work\n\n【26】When you can return to work will largely depend on your job. For example, someone who works in an office may be able to return to work sooner than someone who does heavy manual work.\n\n【27】In most cases, you'll be advised to take around 3 or 4 weeks off work.\n\n【28】### Driving\n\n【29】Ask your surgeon or GP for advice on when it's safe for you to drive again.\n\n【30】You should also speak to your insurer before driving again after having surgery.\n\n【31】### Having sex\n\n【32】It will probably be around 3 or 4 weeks after your operation before you feel comfortable enough to have sex.\n\n【33】Blood in your pee\n-----------------\n\n【34】After having a TURP, it's normal to occasionally notice some blood in your urine. Around a week or two after the operation, the amount of blood may increase as the scab on your prostate falls off.\n\n【35】Drinking plenty of fluids will help flush any blood or small blood clots out of your bladder.\n\n【36】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【37】While you're recovering, you should contact a GP immediately or call 111 if:\n\n【38】*   you have a high temperature\n*   you have severe pain when peeing\n*   you cannot pee\n*   there's a lot of blood in your pee or this gets worse\n*   there are blood clots in your pee\n\n【39】These symptoms can be a sign of a problem, such as internal bleeding or a urinary infection, that needs to be treated.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : How it's performed</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Risks</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:04:46", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:04:56", "cost": 10.622}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:04:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:04:45"}

It's a good idea to leave a gap between taking ferrous fumarate and any other medicine.

Some vitamin and mineral supplements may already contain ferrous fumarate.\n\n【8】Tell a pharmacist or doctor if you take any supplements or remedies that contain iron, calcium, magnesium or zinc.

That's about 30g a day for anyone aged 11 and older.**\n\n【2】Sugar's many guises\n-------------------\n\n【3】There are lots of different ways added sugar can be listed on ingredients labels:\n\n【4】*   sucrose\n*   glucose\n*   fructose\n*   maltose\n*   fruit juice\n*   molasses\n*   hydrolysed starch\n*   invert sugar\n*   corn syrup\n*   honey\n\n【5】Food labels tell you how much sugar a food contains:\n\n【6】*   high in sugar – 22.5g or more of total sugar per 100g\n*   low in sugar – 5g or less of total sugar per 100g\n\n【7】Some packaging uses a colour-coded system that makes it easy to choose foods that are lower in sugar, salt and fat. Look for more \"greens\" and \"ambers\", and fewer \"reds\", in your shopping basket.\n\n【8】Breakfast\n---------\n\n【9】Many breakfast cereals are high in sugar. Try switching to lower-sugar cereals or those with no added sugar, such as:\n\n【10】*   plain wheat biscuit cereal\n*   plain shredded wholegrain cereal\n*   no-added-sugar muesli\n*   plain porridge\n*   wholemeal toast\n*   plain natural yoghurt topped with chopped fruit\n\n【11】Porridge oats are cheap and contain vitamins, minerals and fibre. Make porridge with semi-skimmed, 1% or skimmed milk, or water.\n\n【12】If you usually add sugar to your porridge, try adding a few chopped dried apricots or a sliced or mashed banana instead.\n\n【13】For a more gradual approach, you could eat sugary cereals and plain cereals on alternate days, or mix both in the same bowl.\n\n【14】If you add sugar to your cereal, you could try adding less. Or you could eat a smaller portion and add some chopped fruit, such as a pear or banana, which is an easy way of getting some of your 5 A Day.\n\n【15】If toast is your breakfast staple, try wholemeal or granary bread, which is higher in fibre than white bread, and see if you can get by with a little less of your usual spreads like jam, marmalade, honey or chocolate. Or you could try sugar-free or lower-sugar options.\n\n【16】You can find breakfast recipes on the Better Health website.\n\n【17】Main meals\n----------\n\n【18】Many foods that we do not consider to be sweet contain a surprisingly large amount of sugar. Some ready-made soups, stir-in sauces and ready meals can also be higher in sugar than you think.\n\n【19】When eating out or buying takeaways, watch out for dishes that are typically high in sugar, such as sweet and sour dishes, sweet chilli dishes and some curry sauces, as well as salads with dressings like salad cream, which can also be high in sugar.\n\n【20】Condiments and sauces such as ketchup can have as much as 23g of sugar in 100g – roughly half a teaspoon per serving. These foods are usually served in small quantities, but the sugar count can add up if eaten every day.\n\n【21】Snacks\n------\n\n【22】Healthier snack options are those without added sugar, such as fresh or tinned fruit (in juice, not syrup), unsalted mixed nuts, plain popcorn, rice cakes, crackers topped with lower-fat cheese or lower-sugar yoghurts.\n\n【23】If you are not ready to give up your favourite flavours, you could start by having less. Instead of 2 biscuits in 1 sitting, try having 1. If your snack has 2 bars, have 1 and share the other, or save it for another day.\n\n【24】If you're an \"all-or-nothing\" type person, you could find something to do to take your mind off food on some days of the week.\n\n【25】When shopping, look out for lower-sugar (and lower-fat) versions of your favourite snacks. Buy smaller packs, or skip the family bags and just go for the normal-sized one instead.\n\n【26】Here are some lower-calorie substitutes for popular snacks:\n\n【27】*   **cereal bars** – despite their healthy image, many cereal bars can be high in sugar and fat. Look out for bars that are lower in sugar, fat and salt.\n*   **chocolate** – swap for a lower-calorie hot instant chocolate drink. You can also get chocolate with coffee and chocolate with malt varieties.\n*   **biscuits** – swap for oatcakes, oat biscuits, or unsalted rice cakes, which also provide fibre.\n*   **cakes** – swap for a plain currant bun, fruit scone, or malt loaf. If you add toppings or spreads, use them sparingly or choose lower-fat and lower-sugar varieties.\n\n【28】Dried fruit, such as raisins, dates and apricots, is high in sugar and can be bad for your dental health because it sticks to your teeth.\n\n【29】To prevent tooth decay, dried fruit is best enjoyed at mealtimes – as part of a dessert, for example – rather than as a snack.\n\n【30】Drinks\n------\n\n【31】Nearly a quarter of the added sugar in our diets comes from sugary drinks, such as fizzy drinks, sweetened juices, milkshakes and cordials.\n\n【32】A can of regular cola contains 7 teaspoons of sugar (35g). Try swapping to water, sugar-free or no-added-sugar drinks or lower-fat milks.\n\n【33】If you take sugar in tea or coffee, gradually reduce the amount until you can cut it out altogether, or try swapping to sweeteners instead. Try some new flavours with herbal teas, or make your own with hot water and a slice of lemon or ginger.\n\n【34】Like some fizzy drinks, fruit juice can be high in sugar. When juice is extracted from the whole fruit to make fruit juice, sugar is released, and this can damage your teeth.\n\n【35】Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day – which is a small glass. For example, if you have 150ml of orange juice and 150ml smoothie in one day, you'll have exceeded the recommendation by 150ml.\n\n【36】Fruit juices and smoothies do contain vitamins and minerals and can count towards your 5 A Day. However they can only ever count as a maximum of 1 portion of your 5 A Day. For example, if you have 2 glasses of fruit juice and a smoothie in 1 day, that still only counts as 1 portion.\n\n【37】You could try flavouring water with a slice of lemon, lime, or a splash of fruit juice. But watch out for the sugar content in squash or cordials with added sugar. Some can contain up to 3 teaspoons of sugar in each glass.\n\n【38】Dessert\n-------\n\n【39】Work out some ground rules. Do you need to have dessert every day? How about only having dessert after your evening meal, or only eating dessert on odd days of the month, or only on weekends, or only at restaurants?\n\n【40】Do you have to have chocolate, biscuits, and cake every day? If you had this type of sugary snack less often, would you actually enjoy it more?\n\n【41】Less sugary desserts include fruit – fresh, frozen, dried, or tinned, but choose those canned in juice rather than syrup – as well as lower-fat and lower-sugar rice pudding, and plain lower-fat yoghurt.\n\n【42】However, lower fat does not necessarily mean low sugar. Some lower-fat yoghurts can be sweetened with refined sugar, fruit juice concentrate, glucose, and fructose syrup.\n\n【43】If you're stuck between choosing 2 desserts at the supermarket, why not compare the labels on both packages and go for the one with the lower amount of sugar.\n删除11：<u>More in How to eat a balanced diet\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】*   Eating a balanced diet\n*   The vegan diet\n*   The vegetarian diet\n*   Eating processed foods\n*   How to eat less saturated fat\n*   How to cut down on sugar in your diet\n*   8 tips for healthy eating\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 3 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 3 October 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:48", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:55", "cost": 6.365}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:48"}

However, if you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red or processed meat a day, the Department of Health and Social Care advises that you cut down to 70g.**\n\n【2】Some meats are high in saturated fat, which can raise blood cholesterol levels if you eat too much of it. Making healthier choices can help you eat meat as part of a balanced diet.\n\n【3】If you eat a lot of red or processed meat, it's recommended that you cut down as there is likely to be a link between red and processed meat and bowel cancer.\n\n【4】A healthy balanced diet can include protein from meat, as well as from fish and eggs or non-animal sources such as beans and pulses. Meats such as chicken, pork, lamb and beef are all rich in protein.\n\n【5】Red meat provides us with iron, zinc and B vitamins. Meat is one of the main sources of vitamin B12 in the diet.\n\n【6】Food hygiene is important when storing, preparing and cooking meat.\n\n【7】Meat and saturated fat\n----------------------\n\n【8】Some meats are high in fat, especially saturated fat. Eating a lot of saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels in the blood, and having high cholesterol raises your risk of coronary heart disease.\n\n【9】The type of meat product you choose and how you cook it can make a big difference to the saturated fat content.\n\n【10】Make healthier choices when buying meat\n---------------------------------------\n\n【11】When buying meat, go for the leanest option. As a rule, the more white you can see on meat, the more fat it contains. For example, back bacon contains less fat than streaky bacon.\n\n【12】These tips can help you buy healthier options:\n\n【13】*   ask your butcher for a lean cut\n*   if you're buying pre-packed meat, check the nutrition label to see how much fat it contains and compare products\n*   go for turkey and chicken without the skin as these are lower in fat (or remove the skin before cooking)\n*   try to limit processed meat products such as sausages, salami, pâté and beefburgers, because these are generally high in fat – they are often high in salt, too\n*   try to limit meat products in pastry, such as pies and sausage rolls, because they are often high in fat and salt\n\n【14】Cut down on fat when cooking meat\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】Cut off any visible fat and skin before cooking – crackling and poultry skin are much higher in fat than the meat itself.\n\n【16】Here are some other ways to reduce fat when cooking meat:\n\n【17】*   grill meat, rather than frying\n*   avoid adding extra fat or oil when cooking meat\n*   roast meat on a metal rack above a roasting tin so the fat can run off\n*   try using smaller quantities of meat and replacing some of the meat with vegetables, pulses and starchy foods in dishes such as stews, curries and casseroles\n\n【18】How much red and processed meat should we eat?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Red meat (such as beef, lamb and pork) can form part of a healthy diet. But eating a lot of red and processed meat probably increases your risk of bowel (colorectal) cancer.\n\n【20】Processed meat refers to meat that has been preserved by smoking, curing, salting or adding preservatives. This includes sausages, bacon, ham, salami and pâtés.\n\n【21】If you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red or processed meat a day, the Department of Health and Social Care advises that you cut down to 70g.\n\n【22】90g is equivalent to around 3 thinly cut slices of beef, lamb or pork, where each slice is about the size of half a piece of sliced bread. A cooked breakfast containing 2 typical British sausages and 2 rashers of bacon is equivalent to 130g.\n\n【23】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information read red meat and the risk of bowel cancer.</u>\n\n【24】Storing meat safely\n-------------------\n\n【25】It's important to store and prepare meat safely to stop bacteria from spreading and to avoid food poisoning:\n\n【26】*   store raw meat or raw poultry in clean sealed containers on the bottom shelf of the fridge, so the meat cannot touch or drip onto other food\n*   follow any storage instructions on the label and do not eat meat after its \"use by\" date\n*   store red meat or raw poultry in a freezer before its \"use by\" date\n*   if you cook meat that you're not going to eat straight away, cool it as quickly as possible and then put it in the fridge or freezer – remember to keep cooked meat separate from raw meat and only reheat cooked meat once\n*   always thoroughly clean plates, utensils, surfaces and hands straight away after they have touched raw or thawing meat using warm soapy water or disinfectant cleaning products\n\n【27】### Freezing meat safely\n\n【28】It's safe to freeze raw meat providing that you:\n\n【29】*   freeze it before the \"use by\" date\n*   date and label meat in the freezer, following any freezing or thawing instructions on the packaging\n*   defrost meat in the microwave, using the defrost setting, if you are going to cook it straight away\n*   thaw meat fully in a fridge, if you want to defrost it and cook it later – keep it in the fridge and use it within 2 days of defrosting\n*   cook food until it's steaming hot all the way through\n\n【30】When meat thaws, liquid can come out of it. This liquid will spread bacteria to any food, plates or surfaces that it touches. Keep the meat in a sealed container at the bottom of the fridge so that it cannot touch or drip onto other foods.\n\n【31】If you defrost raw meat and then cook it thoroughly, you can freeze it again. But never reheat meat or any other food more than once as this could lead to food poisoning.\n\n【32】### Cooking meat safely\n\n【33】Follow the cooking instructions on the packaging.\n\n【34】Some people wash meat before they cook it, but this actually increases your risk of food poisoning, because the water droplets splash onto surfaces and can contaminate them with bacteria.\n\n【35】It's important to prepare and cook food safely. Cooking meat properly ensures that harmful bacteria on the meat are killed. If meat is not cooked all the way through, these bacteria may cause food poisoning.\n\n【36】Bacteria and viruses can be found all the way through poultry and certain meat products (such as burgers). This means you need to cook poultry and these sorts of meat products all the way through. When meat is cooked all the way through, its juices run clear and there is no pink or red meat left inside.\n\n【37】Meats and meat products that you should cook all the way through are:\n\n【38】*   poultry and game, such as chicken, turkey, duck and goose, including liver\n*   pork\n*   offal, including liver\n*   burgers and sausages\n*   kebabs\n*   rolled joints of meat\n\n【39】You can eat whole cuts of beef or lamb when they are pink inside – or \"rare\" – as long as they are cooked on the outside.\n\n【40】These meats include:\n\n【41】*   steaks\n*   cutlets\n*   joints\n\n【42】Liver and liver products\n------------------------\n\n【43】Liver and liver products, such as liver pâté and liver sausage, are a good source of iron, as well as being a rich source of vitamin A.\n\n【44】You should be able to get all the vitamin A you need from your daily diet. Adults need:\n\n【45】*   700 micrograms of vitamin A per day for men\n*   600 micrograms of vitamin A per day for women\n\n【46】However, because they are such a rich source of vitamin A, we should be careful not to eat too much liver and liver product foods.\n\n【47】Having too much vitamin A – more than 1.5mg (1,500 micrograms) of vitamin A per day from food and supplements – over many years may make your bones more likely to fracture when you are older.\n\n【48】People who eat liver or liver pâté once a week may be having more than an average of 1.5mg of vitamin A per day. If you eat liver or liver products every week, you may want to consider cutting back or not eating them as often. Also, avoid taking any supplements that contain vitamin A and fish liver oils, which are also high in vitamin A.\n\n【49】Women who have been through the menopause, and older men, should avoid having more than 1.5mg of vitamin A per week from food and supplements. This is because older people are at a higher risk of bone fracture. This means not eating liver and liver products more than once a week, or having smaller portions. It also means not taking any supplements containing vitamin A, including fish liver oil, if they do eat liver once a week.\n\n【50】Pregnant women should avoid liver and liver products and vitamin A supplements.\n\n【51】Eating meat when you're pregnant\n--------------------------------\n\n【52】Meat can generally be part of a pregnant woman's diet. However, pregnant women should avoid:\n\n【53】*   raw and undercooked meat because of the risk of toxoplasmosis – make sure any meat you eat is well cooked before eating\n*   pâté of all types, including vegetable pâté – they can contain listeria, a type of bacteria that could harm your unborn baby\n*   liver and liver products – these foods are very high in vitamin A, and too much vitamin A can harm the unborn child\n*   game meats such as goose, partridge or pheasant – these may contain lead shot\n删除7：<u>Read more about foods to avoid in pregnancy.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Food types\n------------------\n\n【54】*   Starchy foods and carbohydrates\n*   Meat in your diet\n*   Fish and shellfish\n*   Dairy and alternatives in your diet\n*   Salt in your diet\n*   Fat: the facts\n*   The truth about sweeteners\n*   Sugar: the facts\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 July 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:37:21", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:37:57", "cost": 35.834}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:37:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:37:21"}

Also try taking your medicine with, or just after, a meal or snack. Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food.\n\n【6】If you're being sick, take small, frequent sips of water to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【7】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【8】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【9】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking allopurinol. Tell a doctor or call 111 now if:\n\n【10】*   the whites of your eyes or your skin turn yellow, although this is less obvious on black or brown skin – these can be signs of a liver problem\n*   you get a high temperature, sore throat and swollen glands or feel generally unwell – this could mean there are problems with your white blood cells\n*   you have bruising for no obvious reason or bleeding gums (which takes a long time to stop) when brushing your teeth\n*   you are unusually thirsty, going to the toilet to pee a lot, unusually tired, losing weight without trying, or have blurred vision – these could be signs of diabetes\n\n【11】### Skin rashes\n\n【12】Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare side effect of allopurinol. It causes flu-like symptoms, followed by a red or purple rash that spreads and forms blisters. The affected skin eventually dies and peels off.\n\n【13】It's more likely to happen in the first 8 weeks of taking allopurinol, or when the dose is increased too quickly. It can also happen if allopurinol is stopped suddenly for a few days and then restarted at the same dose as before. It's better to reduce the dose and then increase it slowly.\n\n【14】Stevens-Johnson syndrome is more common in:\n\n【15】*   children\n*   people who developed a rash with an epilepsy medicine in the past\n*   people who are allergic to an antibiotic called trimethoprim\n*   people also taking a medicine called sodium valproate\n\n【16】To help prevent the chance of you getting a rash that could be confused with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, it's best not to try new medicines or food during the first 3 months of treatment with allopurinol.\n\n【17】It's also best to not start taking allopurinol within 2 weeks of a viral infection, vaccination, or rash caused by something else.\n\n【18】#### Immediate action required: Go to A&E now if:\n\n【19】*   you get a skin rash with flushing, blisters or ulcers – these can be signs of Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n\n【20】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【21】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【22】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to allopurinol.\n\n【23】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【24】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【25】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【26】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【27】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【28】These are not all the side effects of allopurinol.

Your clinic will advise you on how often to have it.\n\n【11】How long to have medroxyprogesterone contraceptive injections for\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】This will depend on how long you need contraception and your reasons for choosing the injection.\n\n【13】Medroxyprogesterone injections are sometimes stopped after 2 years, but you can keep having them for longer.\n\n【14】If you stay on medroxyprogesterone injections for more than 2 years a doctor may suggest a bone scan to check the strength of your bones.\n\n【15】If you forget to have it\n------------------------\n\n【16】If you do not have the injection 14 weeks after your last injection, you could get pregnant.\n\n【17】If you forget to have it, talk to the doctor or nurse as soon as you remember. You'll need to use another type of contraception. You will not be able to have the dose late if there's a chance you might be pregnant.\n\n【18】If you have the injection too soon\n----------------------------------\n\n【19】If you have the injection less than 12 weeks after your last injection, it's unlikely to harm you but you could get more of the common side effects.\n\n【20】Talk to the nurse, doctor or your pharmacist.\n删除11：<u>More in Contraceptive injections (medroxyprogesterone)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】*   About medroxyprogesterone contraceptive injections\n*   Who can and cannot have them\n*   How and when to have them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n*   Having them with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:26:25", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:26:55", "cost": 30.804}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:26:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:26:24"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is caused by mutations (faults) in genes that cause the peripheral nerves to become damaged.**\n\n【3】The peripheral nerves are a network of nerves that run from the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system).\n\n【4】They carry impulses to and from the rest of the body, such as the limbs and organs, and are responsible for the body's senses and movements.\n\n【5】A peripheral nerve is similar to an electrical cable, and is made up of 2 parts:\n\n【6】*   the axon – which transmits electrical information between your brain and limbs, similar to the wiring in an electrical cable\n*   the myelin sheath – which is wrapped around the axon to protect it and ensure the electrical signal is not broken, similar to the insulation around electrical cable\n\n【7】In some types of CMT, faulty genes cause the myelin sheath to break down.\n\n【8】Without protection, the axons become damaged, which affects the transmission of messages between the brain and the muscles and senses. This leads to muscle weakness and numbness.\n\n【9】In other types of CMT, the axons are directly affected and do not transmit electrical signals at the normal strength.\n\n【10】This means the muscles and senses do not get used enough, leading to symptoms of muscle weakness and numbness.\n\n【11】How CMT is inherited\n--------------------\n\n【12】A child with CMT may have inherited the genetic fault responsible for the condition from 1 or both parents.\n\n【13】No single faulty gene causes CMT. The many types of CMT are caused by different genetic mutations and the faulty genes can be inherited in several different ways.\n\n【14】### Autosomal dominant\n\n【15】Autosomal dominant inheritance of CMT occurs when 1 copy of a mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.\n\n【16】If either parent carries a faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance the condition will be passed on to each child they have.\n\n【17】### Autosomal recessive\n\n【18】Autosomal recessive inheritance of CMT occurs when 2 copies of the defective gene are needed to cause the condition.\n\n【19】You inherit 1 copy from each parent. As your parents only have 1 copy of the gene, they don't develop CMT themselves.\n\n【20】If both you and your partner are carriers of the autosomal recessive CMT gene, there's a:\n\n【21】*   1 in 4 chance each child you have will develop CMT\n*   1 in 2 chance each child you have will inherit 1 of the defective genes and be able to pass the condition to any children they have (known as being a carrier) – although they will not have any of the symptoms of CMT themselves\n*   1 in 4 chance each child you have will receive a pair of healthy genes and will not develop CMT\n\n【22】If only 1 parent has the autosomal recessive gene, your children will not develop CMT. But there's a 1 in 2 chance each child will be a carrier.\n\n【23】### X-linked inheritance\n\n【24】In X-linked inheritance, the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and passed from mother to son. Chromosomes are the parts of cells that carry your genes.\n\n【25】Men have XY sex chromosomes. They receive the X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father.\n\n【26】Women have XX chromosomes. They receive 1 X chromosome from their mother and the other X chromosome from their father.\n\n【27】A woman with the defective X chromosome will usually have no or very mild symptoms because the other healthy X chromosome counters the effect of the defective one.\n\n【28】But there's a 1 in 2 chance she'll pass on the defective gene to her son and he'll develop CMT.\n\n【29】If a woman with the defective X chromosome only has daughters, CMT can skip a generation until one of her grandsons inherits it.\n\n【30】Types of CMT\n------------\n\n【31】There are many different types of CMT that are all caused by different mutations (changes) in your genes.\n\n【32】The main types of CMT are:\n\n【33】*   CMT 1 – the most common type, caused by defective genes that cause the myelin sheath to slowly break down\n*   CMT 2 – a less common and usually less severe type than CMT 1, caused by defects in the axon\n*   CMT 3 (Dejerine-Sottas syndrome) – a rare and severe type of CMT that affects the myelin sheath, causing severe muscle weakness and sensory problems to begin developing in early childhood\n*   CMT 4 – another rare and severe type of CMT that affects the myelin sheath, which begins developing in early childhood and causes many people to eventually lose the ability to walk\n*   CMT X – caused by a mutation in the X chromosome, and more common in men than women\n\n【34】You can read more about the classification of CMT on Charcot-Marie-Tooth UK.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:11", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:22", "cost": 10.839}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:11"}

About loratadine\n--------------------\n\n【3】Loratadine is an antihistamine medicine that helps with the symptoms of allergies. It's used to treat:\n\n【4】*   hay fever\n*   conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)\n*   eczema\n*   hives (urticaria)\n*   reactions to insect bites and stings\n*   some food allergies\n\n【5】Loratadine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's much less likely to make you feel sleepy than some other antihistamines.\n\n【6】Loratadine is available on prescription. You can also buy it from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【7】It comes as tablets or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【8】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【9】*   You'll usually take loratadine once a day.\n*   Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine, but some people still find it makes them feel slightly sleepy.\n*   Children may have a headache and feel tired or nervous after taking loratadine.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【10】3\\. Who can and cannot take loratadine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【11】Adults and children aged 2 years and older can take loratadine.\n\n【12】Loratadine is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking loratadine if you:\n\n【13】*   have ever had an allergy to loratadine or any other medicines\n*   have severe liver failure\n*   have an allergy to food additives\n*   have epilepsy or another illness that puts you at risk of seizures or fits\n*   are due to have an allergy test – taking loratadine may affect the results, so you might need to stop taking it a few days before the test\n\n【14】4\\. How and when to take loratadine\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】If you or your child have been prescribed loratadine, follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to take it.\n\n【16】If you've bought loratadine from a pharmacy or shop, follow the instructions that come with the packet.\n\n【17】### Dosage\n\n【18】Loratadine comes as 10mg tablets and as a liquid medicine (labelled either 5mg/5ml or 1mg/1ml).\n\n【19】The usual dose in adults is 10mg once a day.\n\n【20】Doses are usually lower for people with liver problems.\n\n【21】For children, your doctor will use your child's weight or age to work out the right dose. Children aged between 6 and 12 years can only take loratadine tablets if they weigh more than 30kg. Give children loratadine liquid instead of tablets if they are under 6 or weigh 30kg or less.\n\n【22】### How to take it\n\n【23】Loratadine comes as 2 different types of tablet: ordinary and melt-in-the-mouth tablets.\n\n【24】Swallow ordinary loratadine tablets with a drink of water, milk or juice. If the tablet has a score line across the middle, you can break it in half if you find it hard to swallow it whole. Do not chew it.\n\n【25】Melt-in-the-mouth tablets dissolve instantly on your tongue without needing a drink. Be careful not to crush them when you take them out of the packet.\n\n【26】You can take loratadine with or without food.\n\n【27】Loratadine liquid may be easier for children to take than tablets. The medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【28】### When to take it\n\n【29】You may only need to take loratadine on a day when you have symptoms, for instance if you've been exposed to a trigger such as animal hair. Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as hay fever during spring and summer.\n\n【30】Try to take loratadine at about the same time every day. Choose a time that is easy to remember.\n\n【31】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【32】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【33】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【34】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【35】### What if I take too much?\n\n【36】Loratadine is generally very safe. If you or your child take too much, it is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【37】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice if:\n\n【38】You've taken more than your usual dose of loratadine and:\n\n【39】*   you get a headache, have a fast heartbeat or feel sleepy\n*   you're concerned\n\n【40】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【41】Call 111 if you're asking about a child under the age of 5 years.\n\n【42】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【43】Like all medicines, loratadine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【44】### Common side effects\n\n【45】The most common side effect of loratadine is feeling sleepy. This happens in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【46】Side effects in children may include:\n\n【47】*   headaches\n*   feeling tired or nervous\n\n【48】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【49】In rare cases, loratadine may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【50】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【51】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【52】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【53】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【54】These are not all the side effects of loratadine.

How to cope with side effects of loratadine\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【57】**What to do about:**\n\n【58】*   **feeling sleepy** – try a different non-drowsy antihistamine. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should normally go away after the first week of taking loratadine. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired or nervous** – talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects do not go away. They may be able to offer you a different antihistamine.\n\n【59】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【60】### Loratadine and pregnancy\n\n【61】Loratadine can be taken in pregnancy. There is no good evidence that it can harm your baby.\n\n【62】### Loratadine and breastfeeding\n\n【63】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take loratadine while breastfeeding.\n\n【64】There is some information available which shows that only tiny amounts get into breast milk. It has been used for many years in breastfeeding women without side effects in their babies.\n\n【65】If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how loratadine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【66】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【67】Some medicines affect how loratadine works or can increase the chances of you having side effects.\n\n【68】Tell your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【69】*   amiodarone, a medicine used to treat an irregular heartbeat\n*   cimetidine, an indigestion medicine\n*   erythromycin, an antibiotic\n*   ketoconazole, a medicine to treat fungal infections\n*   any medicine that makes you feel sleepy, gives you a dry mouth or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking loratadine might make these side effects worse\n\n【70】### Mixing loratadine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【71】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with loratadine. But there might be a problem with some of them, especially ones that cause sleepiness or a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee.\n\n【72】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【73】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【74】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【75】9\\. Common questions about loratadine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【76】How does loratadine work?\n\n【77】Loratadine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine.\n\n【78】When you come into contact with something you have an allergy to, such as pollen, animal hair or fur, house dust or insect bites, your body produces a chemical called histamine.\n\n【79】Usually, histamine is a useful substance but in an allergic reaction it causes unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watery eyes, running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.\n\n【80】Loratadine blocks the effects of histamine and so reduces these symptoms.\n\n【81】Loratadine is a non-drowsy antihistamine, so it does not make you feel as sleepy as other medicines like it.\n\n【82】When will I feel better?\n\n【83】You should start to feel better within an hour.\n\n【84】How long should I take loratadine for?\n\n【85】It depends on why you're taking it.\n\n【86】You may only need to take loratadine for a short time or as a one-off dose. If you have a reaction to an insect bite, you may only need to take loratadine for a day or two.\n\n【87】You may need to take it for longer if you're taking it to prevent hay fever symptoms when the pollen count is high.\n\n【88】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure how long you need to take loratadine for.\n\n【89】Is it safe to take loratadine for a long time?\n\n【90】Loratadine is unlikely to do you any harm if you take it for a long time. However, it's best to take it only for as long as you need to.\n\n【91】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【92】It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine, as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【93】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【94】You can eat and drink normally while taking loratadine.\n\n【95】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【96】Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine but it's still possible to feel sleepy after taking it.\n\n【97】If this happens to you, do not drive a car or ride a bike until you feel better.\n\n【98】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【99】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking loratadine删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【100】What's the difference between loratadine and other antihistamines?\n\n【101】Loratadine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's less likely to make you feel sleepy than other, so-called, sedating antihistamines such as Piriton (chlorphenamine).\n\n【102】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine instead of a sedating one. An exception is when you want the medicine to make you sleepy – for example, if you have itchy skin that's keeping you awake.\n\n【103】What's the difference between loratadine and other non-drowsy antihistamines?\n\n【104】Other non-drowsy antihistamines like cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine seem to work as well as loratadine.\n\n【105】However, loratadine, desloratadine and fexofenadine seem to be less likely to make you feel sleepy than cetirizine.\n\n【106】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【107】Yes, you can take loratadine together with paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【108】Can I take 2 different antihistamines together?\n\n【109】Sometimes, doctors recommend that people with a severe, itchy skin rash take 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【110】As well as taking a non-drowsy antihistamine like loratadine during the day, your doctor may tell you to take a sedating antihistamine at night if the itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【111】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless recommended by your doctor.\n\n【112】Can I take loratadine with other hay fever treatments?\n\n【113】Yes, it's fine to take loratadine together with some other types of hay fever treatment, including steroid nasal sprays (such as Beconase, Rhinacort Aqua and Flixonase Nasules), or eyedrops.\n\n【114】Can I take loratadine at higher doses than on the packet?\n\n【115】Your doctor might suggest you or your child take a higher dose of loratadine (up to 4 times the usual dose) for severe itchy skin rash or swelling underneath the skin (angioedema).\n\n【116】Taking high doses of loratadine is not suitable for everyone though.\n\n【117】Speak to your doctor if you think loratadine is not working for you.\n\n【118】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【119】There's no evidence to suggest that taking loratadine will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【120】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【121】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【122】Loratadine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【123】Can lifestyle changes relieve hay fever?\n\n【124】It will help if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【125】#### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【126】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you've been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【127】#### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【128】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【129】*   Atopic eczema\n*   Conjunctivitis\n*   Food allergy\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n*   Insect bites and stings\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【130】*   HealthUnlocked: loratadine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n*   Medicines for Children: loratadine for allergy symptoms\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 October 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:34:19", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:34:45", "cost": 25.808}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:55", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:34:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:34:19"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Coeliac disease is caused by an abnormal immune system reaction to the protein gluten, which is found in foods such as bread, pasta, cereals and biscuits.**\n\n【3】It's an autoimmune condition, where the immune system mistakes healthy cells and substances for harmful ones and produces antibodies against them (antibodies usually fight off bacteria and viruses).\n\n【4】In the case of coeliac disease, your immune system mistakes one of the substances that makes up gluten, called gliadin, as a threat to the body. The antibodies that are produced cause the surface of your intestine to become inflamed (red and swollen).\n\n【5】The surface of the intestine is usually covered with millions of tiny tube-shaped growths called villi. Villi increase the surface area of your gut and help it to digest food more effectively.\n\n【6】However, in coeliac disease, the damage and inflammation to the lining of the gut flattens the villi, reducing their ability to help with digestion.\n\n【7】As a result, your intestine is not able to digest the nutrients from your food, which causes the symptoms of coeliac disease.\n\n【8】Oats\n----\n\n【9】Some people with coeliac disease may find that eating oats can trigger symptoms. This is because some oats may be contaminated by other grains during production.\n\n【10】Oats also contain a protein called avenin, which is similar to gluten. Most people with coeliac disease can safely eat avenin. However, there's some evidence to suggest a very small number of people may still be sensitive to products that are gluten-free and do not contain contaminated oats.\n\n【11】Increased risk\n--------------\n\n【12】It's not known why people develop coeliac disease. It's also not clear why some people have mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms.\n\n【13】However, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing coeliac disease.\n\n【14】### Family history\n\n【15】Coeliac disease often runs in families. If you have a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister, your chance of also getting it is increased.\n\n【16】This risk is approximately 10% for those with a family history. If you have an identical twin with coeliac disease, there's around a 75% chance you'll also develop the condition.\n\n【17】Research shows that coeliac disease is strongly associated with abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity (genetic mutations). These mutations affect the HLA-DQ genes, which are a group of genes responsible for the development of the immune system and may be passed down through a family.\n\n【18】However, mutations in HLA-DQ genes are very common. This suggests that something else, such as environmental factors, must trigger coeliac disease in certain people.\n\n【19】### Environmental factors\n\n【20】You're more likely to develop coeliac disease if you had a digestive system infection (such as a rotavirus infection) during early childhood.\n\n【21】Most experts recommend waiting until your child is at least 6 months old before giving them food containing gluten.\n\n【22】There might also be an increased chance of babies developing coeliac disease if they're not being breastfed when gluten is introduced into their diet.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about your baby's first solid foods.</u>\n\n【23】### Other health conditions\n\n【24】Other health conditions can increase your risk of developing coeliac disease, including:\n\n【25】*   type 1 diabetes\n*   thyroid conditions\n*   Down's syndrome \n*   Turner syndrome\n\n【26】It's unclear whether these health conditions directly increase the risk of developing coeliac disease, or whether they and coeliac disease both have another, single underlying cause.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:14", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:21", "cost": 7.154}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:14"}

You can also speak to your child’s teacher or their school’s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO).**\n\n【3】The GP cannot formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. Your school may also be able to arrange a specialist referral for your child.\n\n【4】When you see a GP, they may ask you:\n\n【5】*   about your symptoms or those of your child\n*   when these symptoms started\n*   where the symptoms occur – for example, at home, in school, college or university, or at work\n*   whether the symptoms affect your or your child's day-to-day life – for example, if they make socialising difficult\n*   if there have been any recent significant events in your or your child's life, such as a death or divorce in the family\n*   if there's a family history of ADHD\n*   about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have\n\n【6】Next steps\n----------\n\n【7】### Children and teenagers\n\n【8】If the GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of \"watchful waiting\" – lasting around 10 weeks – to see if your child's symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse.\n\n【9】They may also suggest starting a group-based, ADHD-focused parent training or education programme. Being offered a parent training and education programme does not mean you have been a bad parent – it aims to teach you ways of helping yourself and your child.\n删除8：<u>See treating ADHD for more information.</u>\n\n【10】If your child's behaviour does not improve, and both you and the GP believe it's affecting their day-to-day life, the GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment.\n\n【11】### Adults\n\n【12】For adults with possible ADHD, the GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if:\n\n【13】*   you were not diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since\n*   your symptoms cannot be explained by a mental health condition\n*   your symptoms significantly affect your day-to-day life – for example, if you're underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult\n\n【14】You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment.\n\n【15】Assessment\n----------\n\n【16】You or your child may be referred to 1 of the following types of specialist for a formal assessment:\n\n【17】*   a specialist child or adult psychiatrist\n*   a paediatrician – a specialist in children's health\n*   an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with training and expertise in the diagnosis of ADHD\n\n【18】Who you're referred to depends on your age and what's available in your local area.\n\n【19】There's no simple test to determine whether you or your child has ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment. The assessment may include:\n\n【20】*   a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms\n*   a series of interviews with you or your child\n*   interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers\n\n【21】Diagnosis in children and teenagers\n-----------------------------------\n\n【22】Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have 6 or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or 6 or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of ADHD</u>\n\n【23】To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have:\n\n【24】*   been displaying symptoms continuously for at least 6 months\n*   started to show symptoms before the age of 12\n*   been showing symptoms in at least 2 different settings – for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or to parental control\n*   symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level\n*   symptoms that are not just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and are not better accounted for by another condition\n\n【25】Diagnosis in adults\n-------------------\n\n【26】Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there's some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults.\n\n【27】In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have 5 or more of the symptoms of inattentiveness, or 5 or more of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD.\n\n【28】As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults cannot be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood.\n\n【29】If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, your specialist may wish to see your old school records, or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child.\n\n【30】For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate effect on different areas of their life, such as:\n\n【31】*   underachieving at work or in education\n*   driving dangerously\n*   difficulty making or keeping friends\n*   difficulty in relationships with partners\n\n【32】If your problems are recent and did not occur regularly in the past, you're not considered to have ADHD. This is because it's currently thought that ADHD cannot develop for the first time in adults.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 December 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:37", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:33:50", "cost": 313.325}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:33:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:36"}

Overview\n2.  Diagnosis\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles. It's also known as peripheral vascular disease (PVD).**\n\n【3】Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】Many people with PAD have no symptoms. However, some develop a painful ache in their legs when they walk, which usually disappears after a few minutes' rest. The medical term for this is \"intermittent claudication\".\n\n【5】The pain can range from mild to severe, and usually goes away after a few minutes when you rest your legs.\n\n【6】Both legs are often affected at the same time, although the pain may be worse in 1 leg.\n\n【7】Other symptoms of PAD can include:\n\n【8】*   hair loss on your legs and feet\n*   numbness or weakness in the legs\n*   brittle, slow-growing toenails\n*   ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs, which do not heal\n*   changing skin colour on your legs, such as turning paler than usual or blue – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin\n*   shiny skin\n*   in men, erectile dysfunction\n*   the muscles in your legs shrinking (wasting)\n\n【9】The symptoms of PAD often develop slowly, over time. If your symptoms develop quickly, or get suddenly worse, it could be a sign of a serious problem requiring immediate treatment.\n\n【10】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【11】You should see a GP if you experience recurring leg pain when exercising.\n\n【12】Many people mistakenly think this is just part of growing older, but there's no reason why an otherwise healthy person should experience leg pain.\n\n【13】PAD is usually diagnosed through a physical examination by a GP, and by comparing the blood pressure in your arm and your ankle.\n\n【14】A difference between the 2 may indicate PAD and is called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI).\n\n【15】Read about diagnosing PAD.\n\n【16】Causes of peripheral arterial disease\n-------------------------------------\n\n【17】PAD is a form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) because it affects the blood vessels.\n\n【18】It's usually caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the walls of the leg arteries. The fatty deposits (atheroma) are made up of cholesterol and other waste substances.\n\n【19】The build-up of fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries makes the arteries narrower and restricts blood flow to the legs. This process is called atherosclerosis.\n\n【20】There are certain things that can increase your chances of developing PAD and other forms of CVD, including:\n\n【21】*   smoking – the most significant risk factor\n*   type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   high cholesterol\n*   growing older\n\n【22】Treating peripheral arterial disease\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】PAD is largely treated through lifestyle changes and medication.\n\n【24】Exercising regularly and not smoking are the main lifestyle changes that can ease the symptoms of PAD and reduce the chances of it getting worse. It's also important to:\n\n【25】*   eat a healthy diet\n*   lose weight, if you're overweight or obese\n*   moderate your consumption of alcohol\n\n【26】Read about:\n\n【27】Stopping smoking\n\n【28】Exercise\n\n【29】The underlying causes should also be treated, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Medicine and, in some cases, surgery can be used to improve the blood flow in your legs.\n\n【30】With treatment, most people's symptoms remain stable and some people may experience an improvement in their pain.\n\n【31】If treatment is unsuccessful, there's a risk of potentially serious complications.\n\n【32】Read about treating PAD.\n\n【33】Complications of peripheral arterial disease\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【34】PAD is not immediately life-threatening, but the process of atherosclerosis that causes it can lead to serious and potentially fatal problems.\n\n【35】### Coronary heart disease (CHD)\n\n【36】The blockages in the arteries in the legs can also affect other areas of your body, such as the arteries supplying the heart and brain. \n\n【37】This means that having PAD makes you more likely to develop another form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as:\n\n【38】*   coronary heart disease\n*   stroke\n*   heart attack\n*   angina\n\n【39】### Critical limb ischaemia (CLI)\n\n【40】If the blood flow to the legs becomes severely restricted, critical limb ischaemia (CLI) can develop. CLI is an extremely serious complication that can be challenging to treat.\n\n【41】Symptoms of CLI include:\n\n【42】*   a severe burning pain in your legs and feet that continues even when you're resting\n*   your skin turning pale, shiny, smooth and dry\n*   wounds and ulcers (open sores) on your feet and legs that do not heal\n*   loss of muscle mass in your legs\n*   the skin on your toes or lower limbs becoming cold and numb, turning red and then black, and/or beginning to swell and produce smelly pus, causing severe pain (gangrene) – changes in skin colour may be harder to see on brown and black skin\n\n【43】If you think you're developing symptoms of CLI, contact a GP immediately. If this is not possible call 111 or use 111 online.\n\n【44】An angioplasty or bypass graft is usually recommended if you have CLI, although these may not always be successful or possible.

Or a catheter may be inserted directly into your bladder through a small cut in your tummy (abdomen). This is called a suprapubic catheter\n\n【13】Find out about urinary catheterisation.\n\n【14】In a few cases where one of the kidneys has already been severely damaged, it may be better to remove the affected kidney. \n\n【15】Most people can function normally with just one working kidney, which will not usually have a significant effect on your health or lifestyle.\n\n【16】Treating the underlying cause\n-----------------------------\n\n【17】Once the pressure on your kidneys has been relieved, the cause of the build-up of urine may need to be treated.\n\n【18】Some possible causes and their treatments are described below:\n\n【19】*   **kidney stones** can be removed during an operation or broken up using sound waves – read more about treating kidney stones\n*   **an** **enlarged prostate** can be treated with medication or surgery to remove some of the prostate – read more about treating prostate enlargement\n*   **narrowing of the ureter** (the tube that runs from the kidney to the bladder) can be treated by inserting a hollow plastic or metal tube called a stent, which allows urine to flow through the narrowed section – this can often be done without making cuts in your skin\n*   **cancer** that's causing hydronephrosis may be treated using chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous tissue\n\n【20】If hydronephrosis happens because you're pregnant, you will not usually need any treatment because the condition will pass within a few weeks of giving birth.\n\n【21】In the meantime, catheters can be regularly used to drain urine from the kidneys.\n\n【22】Painkillers and antibiotics can also be given if you're in pain or develop a UTI.\n\n【23】Treating antenatal hydronephrosis in babies\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Most babies diagnosed with antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) before they're born will not need any treatment because the condition will improve before they're born or within a few months of their birth.\n\n【25】There's usually no risk to you or your child, so labour should not need to be started early.\n\n【26】After the birth, your baby may be examined to check for any obvious problems, such as swollen kidneys, but normally you'll be able to take them home with you.\n\n【27】Your baby may need to return to hospital for some scans during the next few weeks to check there aren't any continuing problems.\n\n【28】These scans may include:\n\n【29】*   **an** **ultrasound scan** – where sound waves are used to create a picture of your baby's kidneys\n*   **a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG)** – where a thin tube is used to pass a special type of liquid that shows up clearly on X-rays into your baby's bladder while a series of X-rays are taken\n*   **a dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan or MAG-3 scan** – where your baby is injected with a substance that shows up on a special device called a gamma camera; the camera is then used to take pictures of your child's kidneys\n\n【30】In most babies, antenatal hydronephrosis will get better as they get older. But until scans show there's no longer a problem, your child may need to take antibiotics to reduce their chances of developing a UTI. This is because the urine inside their kidneys can make them more vulnerable to infection.\n\n【31】If ANH does not get better by itself, your child may need to keep taking antibiotics.

The type or combination of treatments you have will depend on how the cancer was diagnosed and the stage it's at.\n\n【6】Breast cancer diagnosed at routine screening may be at an early stage, but breast cancer diagnosed when you have symptoms may be at a later stage and require a different treatment.\n\n【7】Your MDT should discuss with you which treatments are most suitable.\n\n【8】Choosing the right treatment for you\n------------------------------------\n\n【9】When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:\n\n【10】*   the stage and grade of the cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread)\n*   your general health\n*   whether you have experienced the menopause\n\n【11】You should be able to discuss your treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.\n\n【12】### Want to know more?\n\n【13】The online tool Predict helps you see how different treatments for early invasive breast cancer might affect you.\n\n【14】Treatment overview\n------------------\n\n【15】Surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer.

Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.\n\n【19】Treatment aims to achieve remission, where cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel able to enjoy a good quality of life.\n\n【20】### Secondary breast cancer\n\n【21】Most breast cancers are discovered at an early stage.\n\n【22】A small proportion of women discover they have breast cancer after it has already spread to other parts of the body (metastasis), and for some women breast cancer may come back after initial treatment.\n\n【23】In these cases, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called \"advanced\" or \"metastatic\" cancer, is not curable.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【24】*   Macmillan Cancer Support: treatments for breast cancer\n*   Breast Cancer Now: secondary (metastatic) breast cancer\n\n【25】</u>\nSurgery\n-------\n\n【26】There are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery:\n\n【27】*   breast-conserving surgery, where the cancerous lump (tumour) is removed\n*   mastectomy, where the whole breast is removed\n\n【28】In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a breast.\n\n【29】Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.\n\n【30】### Breast-conserving surgery\n\n【31】Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where up to a quarter of the breast is removed.\n\n【32】If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue that is removed will depend on:\n\n【33】*   the type of cancer you have\n*   the size of the tumour and where it is in your breast\n*   the amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed\n*   the size of your breasts\n\n【34】Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the tumour, which will be tested for traces of cancer.\n\n【35】If there's no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there's less chance that the cancer will return.\n\n【36】If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.\n\n【37】After having breast-conserving surgery, you'll usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\n\n【38】### Mastectomy\n\n【39】A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple.\n\n【40】If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n【41】If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you'll probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the area under your arm (axilla).\n\n【42】### Reconstruction\n\n【43】Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast.\n\n【44】Reconstruction can be done at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be done later (delayed reconstruction).\n\n【45】It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.\n\n【46】### Lymph node surgery\n\n【47】To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done.\n\n【48】The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They're part of the lymph nodes under your arms (axillary lymph nodes).\n\n【49】The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies. They're identified using either a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye, or a magnetic liquid (Magtrace).\n\n【50】The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.\n\n【51】If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under your arm.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【52】*   Cancer Research UK: types of breast cancer surgery\n*   Breast Cancer Now: breast reconstruction and prostheses\n\n【53】</u>\nRadiotherapy\n------------\n\n【54】Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.\n\n【55】If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy to give your body a chance to recover.\n\n【56】You'll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 5 weeks. Each session will last a few minutes.\n\n【57】### The types of radiotherapy\n\n【58】The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on the type of breast cancer and the type of surgery you have. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all.\n\n【59】Types of radiotherapy include:\n\n【60】*   breast radiotherapy – after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue\n*   chest-wall radiotherapy – after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall\n*   breast boost – some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, this may affect the appearance of your breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of breast tissue (fibrosis)\n*   radiotherapy to the lymph nodes – where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be in the lymph nodes\n\n【61】### The side effects of radiotherapy\n\n【62】Side effects of radiotherapy include:\n\n【63】*   irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin\n*   extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n*   excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm (lymphoedema)\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【64】*   Macmillan Cancer Support: radiotherapy explained\n*   Breast Cancer Now: radiotherapy for primary breast cancer\n*   Cancer Research UK: radiotherapy for breast cancer\n\n【65】</u>\nChemotherapy\n------------\n\n【66】Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medicine to kill cancer cells.\n\n【67】It's usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that have not been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【68】In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【69】Several different medicines are used in chemotherapy, and 2 to 3 are often given at once.\n\n【70】The choice of medicine and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how far it has spread.\n\n【71】Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【72】The medicines are usually given through a drip straight into a vein.\n\n【73】In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 4 weeks and then have a break. Each treatment session is known as a cycle. You may have up to 8 cycles of chemotherapy.\n\n【74】The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by its influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells.\n\n【75】Side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\n【76】*   infections\n*   loss of appetite\n*   feeling sick\n*   being sick\n*   tiredness\n*   hair loss\n*   sore mouth\n\n【77】Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.\n\n【78】Chemotherapy medicine can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.\n\n【79】If you have not experienced the menopause, your periods may stop while you're having chemotherapy treatment.\n\n【80】After you have finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.\n\n【81】But this does not always happen and you may enter an early menopause. This is more likely in women over 40, as they're closer to menopausal age.\n\n【82】Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that treatment will have on your fertility.\n\n【83】### Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer\n\n【84】If your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy will not cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【85】*   Breast Cancer Now: chemotherapy\n*   Cancer Research UK: chemotherapy for breast cancer\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: chemotherapy explained\n\n【86】</u>\nHormone treatment\n-----------------\n\n【87】Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body. These are known as hormone receptor-positive cancers.\n\n【88】Hormone therapy lowers the levels of oestrogen or progesterone hormones in your body or stops their effects.\n\n【89】The type of hormone therapy you have will depend on the stage and grade of the cancer, which hormone it's sensitive to, your age, whether you have experienced the menopause, and what other type of treatment you're having.\n\n【90】You'll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it's sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove.\n\n【91】Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\n【92】In most cases, you'll need to take hormone therapy for 5 years or more after having surgery.\n\n【93】If the type of breast cancer you have is not sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.\n\n【94】### Tamoxifen\n\n【95】Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It's taken every day as a tablet or liquid.\n\n【96】### Aromatase inhibitors\n\n【97】If you have experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor.\n\n【98】This type of medicine blocks aromatase, a substance that helps the body to produce oestrogen after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.\n\n【99】3 aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day.\n\n【100】### Ovarian ablation or suppression\n\n【101】In women who have not yet experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries.\n\n【102】Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.\n\n【103】Ablation can be done using surgery or radiotherapy. It permanently stops the ovaries from working and means you'll experience the menopause early.\n\n【104】Ovarian suppression involves using a medicine called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa).\n\n【105】Your periods will stop while you're taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.\n\n【106】If you're approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.\n\n【107】Goserelin comes as an injection you have once a month.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【108】*   Breast Cancer Now: hormone therapy\n\n【109】</u>\nTargeted therapies\n------------------\n\n【110】Targeted therapies are medicines that change the way cells work and help to stop cancer from growing and spreading. Not all types of breast cancer can be treated with targeted therapies\n\n【111】The targeted therapy most commonly used to treat breast cancer is trastuzumab (also known by the brand name herceptin).\n\n【112】Other targeted therapies include abemaciclib (brand name Verzenios), and palbociclib (brand name, Ibrance). These are used alongside hormone therapy treatments such as fulvestrant to treat certain types of breast cancer. You may be offered them if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body.\n\n【113】Abemaciclib is also used for primary breast cancer if it's likely to come back after treatment such as surgery.\n\n【114】Targeted therapies come as tablets or injections or are given through a drip into a vein.\n\n【115】Side effects of targeted therapies include:\n\n【116】*   shivering and feeling unwell\n*   diarrhoea\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   headache\n*   cough\n*   skin rash\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【117】*   Breast Cancer Now: targeted therapies for breast cancer\n*   Cancer Research UK: targeted cancer drugs\n\n【118】</u>\nRisk of infection\n-----------------\n\n【119】Some of the medicines used to treat breast cancer can make you more vulnerable to infections. You should contact your care team immediately if you develop possible symptoms of infection, such as:\n\n【120】*   a high temperature\n*   feeling shivery\n*   you suddenly feel very unwell even though your temperature may be normal\n\n【121】Bisphosphonates\n---------------\n\n【122】If you have been through the menopause, you may be offered bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or sodium clodronate).\n\n【123】Recent research has shown they may help to reduce the risk of breast cancer spreading to your bones and elsewhere in your body.\n\n【124】Bisphosphonates will probably be given to you at the same time as chemotherapy, either directly into a vein or as tablets.\n\n【125】Rarely, they can cause kidney problems and osteonecrosis of the jaw (when bone in the jaw dies).\n\n【126】Your doctor will explain the benefits and possible side effects before starting this treatment.\n\n【127】Psychological support\n---------------------\n\n【128】Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for you and your family and friends. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties.\n\n【129】Many women with breast cancer will have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.\n\n【130】It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.\n\n【131】Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor.\n\n【132】If you're feeling depressed, talk to a GP. A course of antidepressants may help, or a GP can refer you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.\n\n【133】It can also help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you. Many breast cancer charities have helplines and online forums and staff can also put you in touch with other women who have had cancer treatment.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【134】*   Breast Cancer Now: someone to talk to\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: online community\n\n【135】</u>\nClinical trials\n---------------\n\n【136】A great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.\n\n【137】These advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.\n\n【138】All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they're worthwhile and conducted safely.\n\n【139】If you're invited to take part in a trial, you'll be given information about it and, if you want to take part, you'll be asked to sign a consent form.\n\n【140】You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【141】*   Against Breast Cancer: our research\n*   Breast Cancer Now: clinical trials\n*   Cancer Research UK: breast cancer research and clinical trials\n\n【142】</u>\nComplementary therapies\n-----------------------\n\n【143】Complementary therapies are therapies that may help improve physical and emotional wellbeing.\n\n【144】They're given alongside conventional treatments and include:\n\n【145】*   breathing exercises for stress\n*   massage\n*   aromatherapy\n*   acupuncture\n\n【146】Complementary therapies can help some women cope with their diagnosis and treatment, and provide a break from their regular treatment plan.\n\n【147】Your hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can get them.\n\n【148】It's important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to try to make sure it does not interfere with your conventional treatment.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【149】*   Breast Cancer Now: complementary therapies\n\n【150】</u>\nWill the NHS fund an unlicensed medicine?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【151】It's possible for your doctor to prescribe a medicine outside the uses it's licensed for if they're willing to take personal responsibility for this 'off-licence' use of treatment.\n\n【152】Your local integrated care board (ICB) may need to be involved, as it would have to decide whether to support your doctor's decision and pay for the medicine from NHS budgets.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 October 2019  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 October 2022</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:06:44", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:07:13", "cost": 28.502}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:07:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:06:44"}

Overview\n2.  Why it's performed\n3.  How it's performed\n4.  FAQs\n5.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Pacemakers are sometimes recommended for people with conditions that cause the heart to beat abnormally.**\n\n【3】Each time the heart beats, the heart muscle contracts (pulls inwards) in preparation for pumping blood around the body.\n\n【4】The contractions are triggered by electrical pulses. These are generated by a group of specialised cells known as the sinoatrial node (SA node).\n\n【5】The SA node is often referred to as a natural pacemaker because it generates a series of electrical pulses at regular intervals.\n\n【6】The pulse is then sent to a group of cells known as the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node relays the pulse to the 2 lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles).\n\n【7】A pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is needed when something disrupts this process and causes an abnormal heartbeat.\n\n【8】An abnormal heartbeat is called an arrhythmia. Here are some of the most common causes of arrhythmias:\n\n【9】Sick sinus syndrome\n-------------------\n\n【10】In sick sinus syndrome, the SA node doesn't work as it should. This can lead to an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia), an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia), or a combination of both.\n\n【11】Symptoms of sick sinus syndrome can include:\n\n【12】*   a slower pulse than normal (bradycardia)\n*   extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n*   fainting (or nearly fainting)\n*   dizziness or lightheadedness\n*   shortness of breath\n*   chest pain\n*   irregular or fluttering heartbeats (palpitations)\n\n【13】Most cases of sick sinus syndrome are thought to be related to age.\n\n【14】Over time, the SA node tissue can become hardened and scarred. This can disrupt the normal pattern of electrical pulses released by the SA node.\n\n【15】Some types of medication can also trigger sick sinus syndrome as a side effect. These include calcium channel blockers and beta blockers.\n\n【16】Atrial fibrillation\n-------------------\n\n【17】Atrial fibrillation is a condition that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast.\n\n【18】This is usually considerably higher than 100 beats a minute (often 140 beats a minute or more).\n\n【19】Atrial fibrillation can usually be treated with medication, but some people don't respond to treatment, so a pacemaker may be recommended.\n\n【20】Sometimes people with atrial fibrillation can have a much slower pulse rate than normal, which can also be intermittent (not continuous).\n\n【21】In these cases, a pacemaker will usually be recommended.\n\n【22】Heart block\n-----------\n\n【23】In people with heart block, the pulse that needs to be sent from the SA node to the AV node is either delayed or absent.\n\n【24】Heart block can be caused when the heart is damaged (acquired heart block), or it can occur if a baby is born with 1 or more defects that affect their heart (congenital heart block).\n\n【25】If you have heart block and it's causing troublesome symptoms, a pacemaker will usually be recommended.\n\n【26】Cardiac arrest\n--------------\n\n【27】An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which is a device similar to a pacemaker, is mainly used to prevent cardiac arrest.\n\n【28】A cardiac arrest is a potentially fatal condition where the electrical activity that controls the heart becomes so disrupted that the heart stops beating.\n\n【29】Unless it's treated quickly, a cardiac arrest will be fatal.\n\n【30】An ICD can detect abnormal electrical signals that could indicate that a cardiac arrest is about to happen.\n\n【31】If the ICD detects these type of signals, it sends a powerful electrical shock to the heart. \n\n【32】This basically \"reboots\" the heart. After the shock, the heart should start beating normally again.\n\n【33】An ICD implantation may be recommended if you have had a cardiac arrest in the past or it's thought you have a significant risk of having one in the future.\n\n【34】Factors that increase the risk of a cardiac arrest occurring include:\n\n【35】*   coronary heart disease (where the main vessels that supply the heart become narrowed and hardened, reducing the blood supply)\n*   having a heart attack\n*   congenital heart disease (where a person is born with one or more defects affecting their heart)\n*   cardiomyopathy (abnormalities of the heart muscle, which leads to poor heart function)\n\n【36】Types of pacemaker\n------------------\n\n【37】There are several different types of pacemaker.\n\n【38】The main types are:\n\n【39】*   single-chamber pacemaker – this has 1 wire, which is connected to either the right atrium (upper heart chamber) or right ventricle (lower heart chamber)\n*   dual-chamber pacemaker – this has 2 wires, which are connected to the right atrium and right ventricle\n*   biventricular pacemaker – this has 3 wires, which are connected to the right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle\n\n【40】The type of pacemaker you need will depend on your specific heart problem.\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【41】Alila Medical Images / Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-pacemaker-insertion-surgery-49381420.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=2E7D9799-97E0-47F6-A282-E690C0934D4A&p=178046&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dCT9EE4%26qt\\_raw%3dCT9EE4%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d0%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 July 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Pacemaker implantation</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : How it's performed</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:54", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:53:32", "cost": 38.165}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:53:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:54"}

There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【3】Peeing more than normal\n\n【4】This will last for about 6 hours after taking furosemide. It's nothing to worry about, but if it's inconvenient for you, change the time you take furosemide to one that suits you better (provided it's no later than 4pm).\n\n【5】If peeing a lot is still a problem for you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【6】Feeling thirsty\n\n【7】It's important not to get dehydrated, but how much you drink will depend on why you're taking furosemide.\n\n【8】Check with your doctor how much liquid you can drink while you're taking this medicine.\n\n【9】Dry mouth\n\n【10】Chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n\n【11】Headaches\n\n【12】Make sure you rest and drink fluids – ask your doctor how much you can drink while taking this medicine. Do not drink too much alcohol.\n\n【13】Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【14】Feeling confused or dizzy\n\n【15】If furosemide makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so that you do not faint, then sit until you feel better.\n\n【16】Do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery while you're feeling dizzy.\n\n【17】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【18】Take furosemide with or just after a meal or snack. Take small, regular sips of water or squash so you do not get dehydrated (ask your doctor how much fluid you can drink). Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【19】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【20】Speak to a doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects bother you or last more than a few days.\n\n【21】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【22】Some people have serious side effects after taking furosemide.\n\n【23】Tell your doctor or call 111 now if you get:\n\n【24】*   unexplained bruising or bleeding, a high temperature, sore throat and mouth ulcers – these could be signs of a blood disorder\n*   severe stomach pain which could reach through to your back – this could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)\n*   severe pain in your side or blood in your urine – these could be signs of inflamed kidneys\n*   ringing in your ears (tinnitus) or loss of hearing\n\n【25】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【26】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to furosemide.\n\n【27】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【28】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【29】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【30】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【31】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【32】These are not all the side effects of furosemide.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer that grows quickly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed.**\n\n【3】As AML is a complex condition, it's usually treated by a group of different specialists working together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\n\n【4】Your treatment plan\n-------------------\n\n【5】Treatment for AML is often carried out in 2 stages:\n\n【6】*   induction – this first stage of treatment aims to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible and treat any symptoms you may have\n*   consolidation – this stage aims to prevent the cancer coming back (relapsing) by killing any remaining leukaemia cells in your body\n\n【7】The induction stage of treatment is not always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin.\n\n【8】If you're thought to have a high risk of experiencing complications of AML treatment (for example, if you're over 75 or have another underlying health condition), less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out.\n\n【9】Your doctors will watch you carefully and suggest other treatments if needed.\n\n【10】Induction\n---------\n\n【11】The initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you're fit enough to have intensive chemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.\n\n【12】### Intensive chemotherapy\n\n【13】If you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you'll be given chemotherapy medicine at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow.\n\n【14】You'll usually be given a combination of 2 or more chemotherapy medicines.\n\n【15】The treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you'll need very close medical and nursing supervision.\n\n【16】You may be able to go home between treatment rounds.\n\n【17】You'll have regular blood transfusions because your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells.\n\n【18】You'll also be vulnerable to infection, so it's important that you're in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be treated quickly.\n\n【19】You may also be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent infections.\n\n【20】For intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medicines will be injected into a thin tube that's inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart or into your arm.\n\n【21】Side effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common.\n\n【22】They can include: \n\n【23】*   feeling or being sick\n*   bruising or bleeding easily\n*   diarrhoea\n*   loss of appetite\n*   sore mouth and mouth ulcers (mucositis)\n*   tiredness\n*   skin rashes\n*   hair loss\n*   infertility – this may be temporary or permanent (see complications of AML for more information)\n\n【24】Most side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the side effects of chemotherapy</u>\n\n【25】### Non-intensive chemotherapy\n\n【26】If your doctors do not think you're fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment.\n\n【27】This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy.\n\n【28】The medicines used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis.\n\n【29】### Other medicines\n\n【30】If you have the type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you'll usually be given other medicines as well as having chemotherapy.\n\n【31】The 2 medicines most commonly used are:\n\n【32】*   all tans retinoic acid (ATRA) – usually given during and after induction chemotherapy, it changes immature white blood cells into healthy mature cells, and can reduce symptoms quickly\n*   arsenic trioxide – usually given if the AML has come back, it speeds up the death of leukaemia cells and changes the immature blood cells into healthy mature cells\n\n【33】Side effects of ATRA can include headaches, nausea, bone pain, and dry mouth (excessive thirst), skin and eyes.\n\n【34】Consolidation\n-------------\n\n【35】If there's no AML left after induction chemotherapy, the next stage of treatment is consolidation.\n\n【36】This often involves regularly having chemotherapy medicine, which may be given as injections or tablets.\n\n【37】The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.\n\n【38】Other treatments\n----------------\n\n【39】### Radiotherapy\n\n【40】Radiotherapy involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells.\n\n【41】It's used to:\n\n【42】*   prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant\n*   treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system or brain, although this is uncommon\n\n【43】Side effects of radiotherapy can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue.\n\n【44】Most of the side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed.\n\n【45】### Bone marrow and stem cell transplants\n\n【46】If the treatment is not working or there's a high chance of your leukaemia coming back, you may be offered a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n\n【47】Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need intensive high-dose chemotherapy, and possibly radiotherapy, to destroy the cells in their bone marrow.\n\n【48】You may be given donated stem cells or you may have a transplant of your own stem cells. The stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel (a drip) in a similar way to chemotherapy medicine.\n\n【49】You'll need to stay in hospital for a few weeks after the transplant, usually in a room on your own, because you'll have a high chance of getting infections.\n\n【50】Your friends and family should be able to visit you, but they'll need to wear protective clothing.\n\n【51】Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation.\n\n【52】The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.\n\n【53】### Targeted medicines\n\n【54】You may be offered targeted medicines if you have certain types of AML. Targeted medicines affect the way cancer cells grow.\n\n【55】Some targeted medicines come as tablets and others are given through a drip into your vein.\n\n【56】Adults recently diagnosed with AML may be offered a combination of venetoclax and low-dose cytarabine, if intensive chemotherapy is not suitable.\n\n【57】Your specialist can discuss with you whether targeted treatment is suitable for you.\n\n【58】Clinical trials and newer unlicensed treatments\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【59】In the UK, a number of clinical trials are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating AML.\n\n【60】Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML.\n\n【61】As part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your AML, and AML in general.\n\n【62】Find a clinical trial for acute myeloid leukaemia on Cancer Research UK\n\n【63】If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medicine that's not licensed for use in the UK and is not normally available.\n\n【64】But there's no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments.\n\n【65】Your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.\n\n【66】Find more research into AML on Cancer Research UK\n\n【67】Your care team\n--------------\n\n【68】A treatment team for AML may include a:\n\n【69】*   haematologist (blood cancer specialist)\n*   haemato-pathologist (specialist in the study of cancerous blood cells)\n*   paediatrician (specialist in treating children)\n*   cancer nurse specialist (sometimes called a CNS), who will be the first point of contact between you and the members of your care team\n*   radiologist (specialist in X-rays and scans)\n*   pharmacist\n*   social worker\n*   psychologist\n*   counsellor\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【66】Find more research into AML on Cancer Research UK", "content": "【0】Treatment \\- Acute myeloid leukaemia\n====================================\n删除10：<u>Contents\n--------\n\n【1】1.

They also have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide.\n\n【21】People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless.\n\n【22】Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person will usually have a history of conduct personality disorder before the age of 15.\n\n【24】Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous detailed psychological assessment.\n\n【25】A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least 3 of the following criteria behaviours apply:\n\n【26】*   repeatedly breaking the law\n*   repeatedly being deceitful\n*   being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead\n*   being irritable and aggressive\n*   having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others\n*   being consistently irresponsible\n*   lack of remorse\n\n【27】These signs are not part of a schizophrenic or manic episode – they're part of a person's everyday personality and behaviour.\n\n【28】This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20s. It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40s.\n\n【29】Treating antisocial personality disorder\n----------------------------------------\n\n【30】In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated.\n\n【31】Evidence suggests behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain. \n\n【32】But antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat.\n\n【33】A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court.\n\n【34】The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse.\n\n【35】The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care.\n\n【36】Sometimes, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved.\n\n【37】National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): management and prevention of antisocial personality disorder\n\n【38】### Talking therapies\n\n【39】Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder.\n\n【40】It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.\n\n【41】Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.\n\n【42】The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour.\n\n【43】### Democratic therapeutic communities (DTC)\n\n【44】Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons.\n\n【45】DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs.\n\n【46】It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community.\n\n【47】There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work.\n\n【48】The recommended length of treatment is 18 months, as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice.\n\n【49】Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups, and be subject to the democratic process.\n删除7：<u>Read more about DTC and working with offenders with personality disorder on GOV.UK</u>\n\n【50】### Medicine\n\n【51】There's little evidence to support the use of medicine for treating antisocial personality disorder, but certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines may be helpful in some instances.\n\n【52】Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【53】*   Personality disorders\n</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:09", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:23", "cost": 13.897}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:09"}

It's often very helpful having a friend or family member there.\n\n【4】An accurate, timely diagnosis gives you the best chance to adjust, prepare and plan for the future, as well as access to treatments and support that may help.\n\n【5】Seeing a GP\n-----------\n\n【6】Memory problems are not just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by:\n\n【7】*   depression or anxiety\n*   stress\n*   medicines\n*   alcohol or drugs\n*   other health problems – such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficiencies\n\n【8】Read about common causes of memory loss.\n\n【9】A GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary.\n\n【10】A GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed.\n\n【11】They'll also check other aspects of your health and carry out a physical examination.\n\n【12】They may also organise some blood tests and ask about any medicines you're taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n\n【13】You'll usually be asked some questions and to carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning.\n\n【14】This can help a GP decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments.\n\n【15】Referral to a specialist\n------------------------\n\n【16】If a GP is unsure about whether you have Alzheimer's disease, they may refer you to a specialist, such as:\n\n【17】*   a psychiatrist (usually called an old age psychiatrist)\n*   an elderly care physician (sometimes called a geriatrician)\n*   a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system)\n\n【18】The specialist may be based in a memory clinic alongside other professionals who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.\n\n【19】There's no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, but the staff at the memory clinic will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking.\n\n【20】They'll assess your memory and other areas of mental ability and, if necessary, arrange more tests to rule out other conditions.\n\n【21】### Mental ability tests \n\n【22】A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities, such as memory or thinking, using tests known as cognitive assessments.\n\n【23】Most cognitive assessments involve a series of pen and paper tests and questions, each of which carries a score.\n\n【24】These tests assess a number of different mental abilities, including:\n\n【25】*   short- and long-term memory\n*   concentration and attention span\n*   language and communication skills\n*   awareness of time and place (orientation)\n*   abilities related to vision (visuospatial abilities)\n\n【26】It's important to remember that test scores may be influenced by a person's level of education.\n\n【27】For example, someone who cannot read or write very well may have a lower score, but they may not have Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【28】Similarly, someone with a higher level of education may achieve a higher score, but still have dementia.\n\n【29】These tests can therefore help doctors work out what's happening, but they should never be used by themselves to diagnose dementia.\n\n【30】### Other tests\n\n【31】To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan.\n\n【32】This could be a:\n\n【33】*   CT scan – several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer puts the images together\n*   MRI scan – a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your brain\n删除7：<u>Read more about tests for diagnosing dementia.</u>\n\n【34】After diagnosis\n---------------\n\n【35】It may take several appointments and tests over many months before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be confirmed, although often it may be diagnosed more quickly than this.\n\n【36】It takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family.\n\n【37】Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news.\n\n【38】It might help to talk things through with family and friends, and to seek support from the Alzheimer's Society.\n\n【39】As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis are often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you have just been diagnosed with dementia.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:48:21", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:29", "cost": 67.634}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:54", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:48:20"}

Overview\n2.  How it's performed\n3.  Recovery</u>\n\n【2】**A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.**\n\n【3】Your muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your intestines and organs in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots.\n\n【4】Femoral hernia\n--------------\n\n【5】A femoral hernia is a rare type of hernia.\n\n【6】Femoral hernias sometimes appear as a painful lump in the inner upper part of the thigh or groin. The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear.\n\n【7】For information on other types of hernia, see: \n\n【8】*   inguinal hernia\n*   hiatus hernia\n*   umbilical hernia\n\n【9】Causes of a femoral hernia\n--------------------------\n\n【10】A femoral hernia usually occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\n\n【11】It pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (abdominal wall) into an area called the femoral canal.\n\n【12】Unlike inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are far more common in women, particularly older women. This is because of the wider shape of the female pelvis. Femoral hernias are rare in children.\n\n【13】Femoral hernias can sometimes appear suddenly because of strain on the tummy, such as:\n\n【14】*   straining on the toilet if you have constipation\n*   carrying and pushing heavy loads\n\n【15】They've also been linked to obesity and having a persistent, heavy cough.\n\n【16】When surgery is needed\n----------------------\n\n【17】Femoral hernias can be repaired using surgery to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the wall of the tummy.\n\n【18】Unlike some other types of hernia, treatment of femoral hernias is almost always recommended straight away because there's a higher risk of complications developing in these cases.\n\n【19】Complications that can develop as a result of a femoral hernia include:\n\n【20】*   **obstruction** – where a section of the bowel becomes stuck in the femoral canal, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, as well as a painful lump in the groin\n*   **strangulation** – where a section of bowel becomes trapped and its blood supply is cut off; this requires emergency surgery within hours to release the trapped tissue and restore its blood supply, so it does not die\n\n【21】Surgery gets rid of the hernia and prevents any serious complications, although there's a chance of it returning after the operation.\n\n【22】What happens during surgery\n---------------------------\n\n【23】There are 2 ways a femoral hernia repair can be performed:\n\n【24】*   **open surgery** – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into your tummy\n*   **laparoscopy (keyhole) surgery** – a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various instruments to repair the hernia\n\n【25】There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have depends on which method suits you and your surgeon's experience.\n\n【26】You should be able to go home the same day or the day after surgery.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects how a woman's ovaries work.**\n\n【3】The 3 main features of PCOS are:\n\n【4】*   irregular periods – which means your ovaries do not regularly release eggs (ovulation)\n*   excess androgen – high levels of \"male\" hormones in your body, which may cause physical signs such as excess facial or body hair\n*   polycystic ovaries – your ovaries become enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs (follicles) that surround the eggs (but despite the name, you do not actually have cysts if you have PCOS)\n\n【5】If you have at least 2 of these features, you may be diagnosed with PCOS.\n\n【6】Polycystic ovaries\n------------------\n\n【7】Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles that are up to 8mm (approximately 0.3in) in size. \n\n【8】The follicles are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. In PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place.\n\n【9】It's difficult to know exactly how many women have PCOS, but it's thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.\n\n【10】More than half of these women do not have any symptoms.\n\n【11】Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【12】If you have signs and symptoms of PCOS, they'll usually become apparent during your late teens or early 20s.\n\n【13】They can include:\n\n【14】*   irregular periods or no periods at all\n*   difficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or no ovulation\n*   excessive hair growth (hirsutism) – usually on the face, chest, back or buttocks\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair and hair loss from the head\n*   oily skin or acne\n\n【15】PCOS is also associated with an increased risk of developing health problems in later life, such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol levels.\n\n【16】What causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families.\n\n【18】It's related to abnormal hormone levels in the body, including high levels of insulin.\n\n【19】Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body.\n\n【20】Many women with PCOS are resistant to the action of insulin in their body and produce higher levels of insulin to overcome this.\n\n【21】This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone.\n\n【22】Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces.\n\n【23】Treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【24】There's no cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be treated. Speak to a GP if you think you may have the condition.\n\n【25】If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet can make some symptoms better.\n\n【26】Medicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems.\n\n【27】If fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended.\n\n【28】This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone.\n\n【29】With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant.\n删除14：<u><a>Community content from HealthUnlocked</a></u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:53", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:46", "cost": 412.963}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:51"}

Chloride also helps the body digest food.\n\n【138】### Sources of salt\n\n【139】Salt is found naturally at low levels in all foods, but some salt is added to many processed foods, such as:\n\n【140】*   ready meals\n*   meat products – such as bacon\n*   some breakfast cereals\n*   cheese\n*   tinned vegetables with added salt\n*   some bread\n*   savoury snacks\n\n【141】### How much salt do I need?\n\n【142】You should have no more than 6g of salt (2.4g of sodium) a day.\n\n【143】But, on average, people in the UK eat approximately 8g of salt (about 3.2g of sodium) a day, which is much more than the body needs.\n\n【144】A few practical tips for cutting down on salt include:\n\n【145】*   check food labels and choose foods with less salt – where colour-coded labels are used, try to pick products with more greens and ambers, and fewer reds, for a healthier choice\n*   choose tinned vegetables and pulses with no added salt\n*   choose tinned fish in spring water rather than brine\n*   only use sauces like soy sauce, brown sauce, ketchup and mayonnaise sparingly, as these are often high in salt\n*   eat fewer salty snacks, such as crisps, salted nuts, and salty foods such as bacon, cheese, pickles and smoked fish\n*   add less or no salt when cooking – use herbs and spices for flavour instead\n*   choose low-salt stock cubes, or make your own stock without added salt\n*   taste your food first, and do not automatically add extra salt\n\n【146】Read more facts about salt, cutting down on salt and how much salt is good for me?\n\n【147】You can also download the Change4Life Be Food Smart app, which allows you to scan food barcodes to check the salt content.\n\n【148】### What happens if I have too much salt?\n\n【149】Having too much salt is linked to high blood pressure, which raises your risk of serious problems like strokes and heart attacks.\n\n【150】### What does the Department of Health and Social Care advise?\n\n【151】Adults should eat no more than 6g of salt a day – that's around 1 teaspoon. On average, we eat 2.1g more salt than we should each day.\n\n【152】The Department of Health and Social Care advises that people cut down on salt and says sodium chloride should not be used in supplements.\n\n【153】Zinc\n----\n\n【154】Zinc helps with:\n\n【155】*   making new cells and enzymes\n*   processing carbohydrate, fat and protein in food\n*   wound healing\n\n【156】### Good sources of zinc\n\n【157】Good sources of zinc include:\n\n【158】*   meat\n*   shellfish\n*   dairy foods – such as cheese\n*   bread\n*   cereal products – such as wheatgerm\n\n【159】### How much zinc do I need?\n\n【160】The amount of zinc you need is about:\n\n【161】*   9.5mg a day for men (aged 19 to 64 years)\n*   7mg a day for women\n\n【162】You should be able to get all the zinc you need from your daily diet.\n\n【163】### What happens if I take too much zinc?\n\n【164】Taking high doses of zinc reduces the amount of copper the body can absorb. This can lead to anaemia and weakening of the bones.\n\n【165】### What does the Department of Health and Social Care advise?\n\n【166】You should be able to get all the zinc you need by eating a varied and balanced diet.\n\n【167】If you take zinc supplements, do not take too much as this could be harmful.\n\n【168】Do not take more than 25mg of zinc supplements a day unless advised to by a doctor.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 August 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 August 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Iron</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:59", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:46:29", "cost": 30.445}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:46:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:59"}

The remaining cases are not associated with cancer and can start at any age.\n\n【4】LEMS is also known as myasthenic syndrome or Eaton-Lambert syndrome.\n\n【5】Symptoms of LEMS\n----------------\n\n【6】The symptoms of LEMS develop gradually over weeks or months.\n\n【7】The main symptoms are weakness in the legs, arms, neck and face, as well as problems with automatic body functions, such as controlling blood pressure.\n\n【8】Common symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   aching muscles\n*   feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)\n*   difficulty walking and climbing stairs\n*   difficulty lifting objects or raising the arms\n*   drooping eyelids, dry eyes and blurred vision\n*   swallowing problems\n*   dizziness upon standing\n*   a dry mouth\n*   constipation\n*   erectile dysfunction\n*   muscle weakness that gets worse with time\n\n【10】See a GP if you have a combination of these symptoms.\n\n【11】Causes of LEMS\n--------------\n\n【12】LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves.\n\n【13】Normally, nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles.\n\n【14】If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly.\n\n【15】It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer, but can occur in people without cancer.\n\n【16】Tests for LEMS\n--------------\n\n【17】The GP will first check your medical history, ask about your symptoms, carry out a physical examination, and test your reflexes.\n\n【18】If they think you have a problem with your nerves, they may refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for further tests to determine the cause.\n\n【19】Tests you may have include:\n\n【20】*   **blood tests** – a blood test can detect substances in the blood (antibodies) resulting from the immune system attacking the nerves\n*   **nerve studies** – a needle may be inserted into your skin to check how well signals are reaching the muscles from the nerves\n*   **scans** – you may have a CT scan or PET scan to check for lung cancer\n\n【21】If initial scans do not find cancer, you may be advised to have regular scans every few months for a few years to check that it does not develop later on.\n\n【22】Treatments for LEMS\n-------------------\n\n【23】There's currently no cure for LEMS, but a number of treatments can help reduce the symptoms.\n\n【24】These include:\n\n【25】*   **treatment for lung cancer** – if you have lung cancer, treating it can significantly improve the symptoms of LEMS\n*   **medicine to help nerve signals reach the muscles** – commonly used medicines include 3,4-diaminopyridine and pyridostigmine\n*   **medicine to reduce the activity of the immune system (immunosuppressants)** – commonly used medicines include steroid tablets (such as prednisolone), azathioprine and methotrexate\n*   **plasmapheresis** – a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves\n*   **immunoglobulin therapy** – injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves\n\n【26】Medicine is the main treatment, although plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin therapy may be recommended in the short term, or if muscle weakness is severe and other treatments have not helped.\n\n【27】Outlook for LEMS\n----------------\n\n【28】Some people respond well to treatment and find that treatment helps keep their symptoms under control.\n\n【29】Others respond less well and find the condition affects their everyday activities and quality of life.\n\n【30】LEMS does not affect life expectancy if it's not associated with cancer. But people with lung cancer and LEMS tend to have a shorter life expectancy because by this point it's very difficult to treat.\n\n【31】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【32】If you have LEMS, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【33】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

They're usually mild and only last for a short time. There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【5】Feeling sleepy, tired or dizzy\n\n【6】As your body gets used to atenolol, these side effects should wear off. If atenolol makes you feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery until you feel better. Avoid alcohol as it will make you feel worse.\n\n【7】Cold fingers or toes\n\n【8】Put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine in, as this can make your blood vessels narrower and further restrict blood flow to your hands and feet. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Do not wear tight watches or bracelets.\n\n【9】Feeling sick or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【10】Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your atenolol after a meal or snack.\n\n【11】Drink plenty of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【12】Do not take any other medicines to treat vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【13】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【14】Diarrhoea\n\n【15】Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【16】Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【17】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【18】Stomach pain\n\n【19】Try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your stomach may also help.\n\n【20】If you are in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【21】If this advice does not help and you are bothered by any of these side effects, keep taking the medicine but tell your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【22】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【23】It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking atenolol.\n\n【24】Tell your doctor or call 111 now if:\n\n【25】*   you have shortness of breath with a cough that gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, or an irregular heartbeat – these can be signs of heart problems\n*   you have shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest – these can be signs of lung problems\n*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, or your skin turns yellow, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, or you have pale poo or dark pee – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you get unexplained bruising, or you bruise more easily than usual – these can be signs of low numbers of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)\n\n【26】### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【27】*   you get chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes, or is new or worse if you already have angina\n\n【28】Chest pain is a possible sign of a heart attack and needs to be checked out as soon as possible.\n\n【29】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【30】In rare cases, atenolol may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【31】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【32】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【33】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【34】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【35】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【36】These are not all the side effects of atenolol.

This reduces swelling (inflammation) and helps to relieve the pain and itching of piles.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】The pain and itching should get better within a few days of starting treatment.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】If you use hydrocortisone for a long time, it can make the skin around your anus thinner.\n\n【8】It's best not to use it for more than 7 days, and not to repeat the treatments too often.\n\n【9】Can I have vaccinations?\n\n【10】With some hydrocortisone treatments, you need to be careful about having vaccinations. However, this is not the case with hydrocortisone treatments for piles and itchy bottom. You can have vaccinations if you need them.\n\n【11】Are there other medicines that help piles or itchy bottom?\n\n【12】There are other treatments available to buy that do not contain hydrocortisone.

Examples of foods with lots of fibre are porridge oats and wholegrain breakfast cereals, wholemeal breads, wholewheat pasta, pulses, potatoes with their skins on and vegetables.\n\n【23】To avoid constipation, try to drink several glasses of water or other non-alcoholic drinks each day. If you can, it may also help to increase your level of exercise.\n\n【24】Can lifestyle changes help with piles or itchy bottom?\n\n【25】Piles and itchy bottom often settle down without treatment, but there are some things you can do to help.\n\n【26】Piles can be brought on by too much straining on the toilet. Straining is often because of constipation. You're less likely to get constipated if you:\n\n【27】*   increase the amount of fibre you eat, like wholemeal bread, fruit and vegetables\n*   drink lots of water every day\n*   exercise regularly\n*   go to the toilet as soon as you feel you need to – do not hold it in\n\n【28】Skin moisturisers can also help relieve the pain and itching of piles.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare inherited childhood condition where the development of the kidneys and liver is abnormal. Over time, these organs may fail.**\n\n【3】The condition often causes serious problems soon after birth, although less severe cases may not become obvious until a child is older.\n\n【4】ARPKD can cause a wide range of problems, including:\n\n【5】*   underdeveloped lungs, which can cause severe breathing difficulties soon after birth\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   excessive peeing and thirst\n*   problems with blood flow through the liver, which can lead to serious internal bleeding\n*   a progressive loss of kidney function, known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)\n\n【6】When these problems develop and how severe they are can vary considerably, even between family members with the condition.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of ARPKD and diagnosing ARPKD.</u>\n\n【7】Even though ARPKD is rare, it's one of the most common kidney problems to affect young children.\n\n【8】It's estimated around 1 in 20,000 babies is born with the condition. Both boys and girls are affected equally.\n\n【9】The kidneys\n-----------\n\n【10】The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just beneath the rib cage.\n\n【11】The main role of the kidneys is to filter out waste products from the blood before passing them out of the body as urine.\n\n【12】The kidneys also help maintain blood pressure at a healthy level.\n\n【13】What causes ARPKD?\n------------------\n\n【14】ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver.\n\n【15】In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them.\n\n【16】Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function.\n\n【17】Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow a digestive fluid called bile to flow out of the liver.\n\n【18】The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time.\n\n【19】ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents.\n\n【20】If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have developing ARPKD.\n\n【21】The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood.\n\n【22】Sometimes ADPKD can happen when only one parent has passed on a faulty gene, but this is rare.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the causes of ARPKD</u>\n\n【23】Treating ARPKD\n--------------\n\n【24】There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause.\n\n【25】Treatment for ARPKD may include:\n\n【26】*   breathing assistance with a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs (a ventilator) for children with severe breathing difficulties\n*   medication to treat high blood pressure\n*   procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur\n*   medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements for anaemia\n\n【27】If kidney failure does occur, there are 2 main treatment options:\n\n【28】*   dialysis, where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney\n*   a kidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how ARPKD is treated</u>\n\n【29】Outlook\n-------\n\n【30】The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably depending on the severity of the condition.\n\n【31】If routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage.\n\n【32】But in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first 4 weeks after birth.\n\n【33】About 9 out of 10 babies with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least 5 years old.\n\n【34】It's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates.\n\n【35】But with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood.\n\n【36】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【37】If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【38】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

Sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age.**\n\n【3】The rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual.\n\n【4】In some cases, other conditions can be responsible for symptoms getting worse.\n\n【5】These conditions include:\n\n【6】*   infections\n*   stroke\n*   delirium\n\n【7】As well as these conditions, other things, such as certain medicines, can also worsen the symptoms of dementia.\n\n【8】Anyone with Alzheimer's disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor so these can be managed.\n\n【9】There may be reasons behind the worsening of symptoms that can be treated.\n\n【10】Stages of Alzheimer's disease\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】Generally, the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are divided into 3 main stages.\n\n【12】### Early symptoms\n\n【13】In the early stages, the main symptom of Alzheimer's disease is memory lapses.\n\n【14】For example, someone with early Alzheimer's disease may:\n\n【15】*   forget about recent conversations or events\n*   misplace items\n*   forget the names of places and objects\n*   have trouble thinking of the right word\n*   ask questions repetitively\n*   show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions\n*   become less flexible and more hesitant to try new things\n\n【16】There are often signs of mood changes, such as increasing anxiety or agitation, or periods of confusion.\n\n【17】### Middle-stage symptoms\n\n【18】As Alzheimer's disease develops, memory problems will get worse.\n\n【19】Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends.\n\n【20】Other symptoms may also develop, such as:\n\n【21】*   increasing confusion and disorientation – for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is\n*   obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour\n*   delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members\n*   problems with speech or language (aphasia)\n*   disturbed sleep\n*   changes in mood, such as frequent mood swings, depression and feeling increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated\n*   difficulty performing spatial tasks, such as judging distances\n*   seeing or hearing things that other people do not (hallucinations)\n\n【22】Some people also have some symptoms of vascular dementia.\n\n【23】By this stage, someone with Alzheimer's disease usually needs support to help them with everyday living.\n\n【24】For example, they may need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet.\n\n【25】### Later symptoms\n\n【26】In the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and can be distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.\n\n【27】Hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get worse as the condition progresses.\n\n【28】Sometimes people with Alzheimer's disease can be violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them.\n\n【29】A number of other symptoms may also develop as Alzheimer's disease progresses, such as:\n\n【30】*   difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance\n*   weight loss – sometimes severe\n*   unintentional passing of urine (urinary incontinence) or stools (bowel incontinence)\n*   gradual loss of speech\n*   significant problems with short- and long-term memory\n\n【31】In the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and personal care.\n删除7：<u>Read more about how Alzheimer's disease is treated.</u>\n\n【32】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【33】If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP.\n\n【34】If you're worried about someone else's memory problems, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\n\n【35】Memory problems are not just caused by dementia – they can also be caused by depression, stress, medicines or other health problems.\n\n【36】A GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests if necessary.\n删除7：<u>Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Alzheimer's disease</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:45", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:52", "cost": 7.064}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:45"}

The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you're awake and resting.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 March 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Restless legs syndrome</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:31", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:37", "cost": 6.022}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:29"}

It can also help relieve muscle spasms or symptoms of restless legs syndrome.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】How quickly clonazepam works will depend on what condition you're taking it for.\n\n【7】For seizures, fits and involuntary muscle spasms, it might take a few days to a week for clonazepam to work fully. This is because your dose will be increased gradually until you're taking the right amount.\n\n【8】For panic disorder and restless legs syndrome, clonazepam should take around 1 hour to start working.\n\n【9】How will it make me feel?\n\n【10】Clonazepam will help you feel calmer and it can reduce your feelings of anxiety.\n\n【11】It can also make you feel sleepy and relaxed and might make you feel confused when you first start taking it.\n\n【12】This will usually get better as you get used to taking the medicine.\n\n【13】It's important not to drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery if you feel sleepy or confused.\n\n【14】Is clonazepam addictive?\n\n【15】Clonazepam is not likely to be addictive if you take it for a short time (2 to 4 weeks).\n\n【16】If you've been taking it for longer than 2 to 4 weeks, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually if they want you to stop taking it.\n\n【17】You're more likely to get addicted if you've ever had problems with alcohol or drugs.\n\n【18】Speak to your doctor if you've had problems with alcohol or recreational drugs. They may want to try you on a different medicine.\n\n【19】What will happen if I stop taking clonazepam?\n\n【20】If your doctor recommends you stop taking clonazepam and you've been taking it for more than 2 to 4 weeks, they will reduce your dose gradually.\n\n【21】This allows your body to get used to being without the medicine and reduces the chance of side effects when you stop taking it.\n\n【22】If you stop taking it suddenly, you may get some side effects, such as:\n\n【23】*   confusion\n*   seizures or fits\n*   depression\n*   feeling nervous or irritable\n*   sweating\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【24】You're less likely to get these side effects if you reduce your dose gradually.\n\n【25】### Important\n\n【26】Do not stop taking clonazepam without talking to a doctor.\n\n【27】Are there other treatments for panic disorder?\n\n【28】For panic disorder, depending on your symptoms, you may need a medicine to treat your physical symptoms, as well as your psychological ones.\n\n【29】If you and your doctor think it might be helpful, you may be prescribed a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram.\n\n【30】There are also different types of talking therapies for panic disorder, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling.\n\n【31】Are there other medicines for muscle spasms?\n\n【32】For involuntary muscle spasms, there are other medicines available that can help. You can discuss the different options with your doctor. They can help you decide which medicine is best for you.\n\n【33】Are there other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【34】For epilepsy, treatment options include a range of different anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), a special diet (ketogenic diet) and surgery. These may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n【35】You can discuss the different options with your specialist. They can help you decide which may be best for you.\n\n【36】Are there other medicines for restless legs syndrome?\n\n【37】For restless legs syndrome, there are other medicines that can help regulate the levels of dopamine or iron in your body.\n\n【38】If restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms.\n\n【39】Speak to your doctor about which medicine is best for you.\n\n【40】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【41】Clonazepam will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【42】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【43】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if clonazepam makes you feel sleepy, dizzy or light-headed, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【44】This may be more likely when you first start taking clonazepam, but could happen at any time, for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【45】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【46】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much clonazepam is in your body.\n\n【47】Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking clonazepam删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【48】Can I drink alcohol while taking clonazepam?\n\n【49】Do not drink alcohol while taking clonazepam. Alcohol can increase the side effects of clonazepam.\n\n【50】It can make you go into a very deep sleep. This can be dangerous. There's a risk you may not be able to breathe properly and you may have difficulty waking up, or even go into a coma.\n\n【51】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【52】It's best to avoid drinks such as coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks, and not to eat too much chocolate, because these contain caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant and may reduce the calming effects of clonazepam.\n\n【53】Do not drink alcohol while taking clonazepam. Alcohol can increase the effects of clonazepam and make you go into a very deep sleep. There's a risk you will not be able to breathe properly and you may have difficulty waking up. This can be dangerous.\n\n【54】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【55】Using cannabis, heroin or methadone with clonazepam will increase the drowsy effects of clonazepam.\n\n【56】It can make you go into a very deep sleep. There's a risk you will not be able to breathe properly, and you may have difficulty waking up. This can be dangerous.\n\n【57】Using cocaine or other stimulants such as MDMA (ecstasy) and amphetamines with clonazepam can also make you drowsy.\n\n【58】Talk to a doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking clonazepam.\n\n【59】You can find out more about the side effects of recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【60】Can lifestyle changes help with panic disorder?\n\n【61】If you have panic disorder, there are some things you can try to help, including:\n\n【62】*   reading a self-help book for anxiety based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (ask your doctor to recommend one)\n*   trying complementary therapies such as massage and aromatherapy, or activities such as yoga or pilates, to help you relax\n*   learning breathing techniques to help ease symptoms\n*   exercising regularly to reduce stress and tension\n\n【63】It may help to find out more about how to deal with panic attacks.\n\n【64】Can lifestyle changes help with restless legs syndrome?\n\n【65】If you have restless legs syndrome, there are some lifestyle changes that can help, including:\n\n【66】*   quitting smoking\n*   exercising regularly (but avoid exercising close to bedtime)\n*   good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, not napping during the day, and taking time to relax before going to bed\n*   avoiding medicines that trigger the symptoms or make them worse (if you think a medicine is causing your symptoms, keep taking it and make an appointment to see a doctor)\n删除11：<u>More in Clonazepam\n------------------\n\n【67】*   About clonazepam\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:58", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:10", "cost": 12.673}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:58"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**See a GP if you have** **symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome**.\n\n【3】They'll ask about your symptoms and look at your eyes and mouth to check for any obvious problems.\n\n【4】Because there are many conditions with similar symptoms to Sjögren's syndrome, it can be very difficult for a GP to diagnose.\n\n【5】They can refer you to a specialist for further checks, if needed.\n\n【6】Blood tests\n-----------\n\n【7】Blood tests can be done to look for antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are substances produced by your immune system (the body's defence against infection) to attack germs.\n\n【8】In Sjögren's syndrome, the immune system produces antibodies that attack healthy areas of the body. These can be found during a blood test.\n\n【9】But not everyone with Sjögren's syndrome has these antibodies, so you may have the condition even if a blood test does not find them.\n\n【10】Checking the layer of tears on your eyes\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may do a test to look at the layer of tears that forms across the front of your eyes.\n\n【12】Harmless coloured drops are put in your eyes to make the layer of tears easier to see for a short time. A special microscope with a light is then used to look at your eyes.\n\n【13】If the layer of tears is very patchy, it could be a sign of Sjögren's syndrome.\n\n【14】Testing a piece of lip tissue\n-----------------------------\n\n【15】In people with Sjögren's syndrome, clumps of white blood cells, which are produced by the immune system, can form inside the cells where spit (saliva) is produced.\n\n【16】To check for this, a very small piece of tissue from the inside of your lip may be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is known as a lip biopsy.\n\n【17】Local anaesthetic is injected into your lip to numb it before the procedure.\n\n【18】Other tests\n-----------\n\n【19】Occasionally, other tests may be done. These may include:\n\n【20】*   a spit test – you spit as much saliva as you can into a cup over a 5-minute period and the amount is then measured or weighed\n*   measuring how many tears you produce – small strips of paper are placed in your lower eyelid for 5 minutes to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears\n\n【21】Producing less saliva or fewer tears than normal can be a sign of Sjögren's syndrome.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:53:45", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:53:50", "cost": 4.564}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:53:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:53:45"}

These tablets have a special coating that means they may be more gentle on your stomach. Do not chew or crush them because it will stop the coating from working.

Treatment in adults</u>\n\n【2】**If your child has scoliosis, the recommended treatment will depend on their age, how severe the curve is, and whether it's getting worse.**\n\n【3】Many children will not need treatment, and only a small number end up having surgery.\n\n【4】There is a separate page about treatments for scoliosis in adults.\n\n【5】Monitoring\n----------\n\n【6】Treatment is not always necessary for very young children because their spine may straighten as they grow.\n\n【7】But if the curve does not correct itself, there's a small risk it could reduce the space for the organs to grow, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important.\n\n【8】Your specialist may recommend regular examinations and X-rays to monitor the curve and decide if treatment is needed.\n\n【9】Regular monitoring may also be recommended for older children with mild scoliosis, as treatment might not be needed if it's not getting worse over time.\n\n【10】Wearing a cast\n--------------\n\n【11】In babies and toddlers, treatment to try to help straighten the spine as it grows may be recommended.\n\n【12】This may involve wearing a plaster cast fitted around their back.\n\n【13】The cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but it's changed every few months as your child grows.\n\n【14】Parents often find it easier for their child to wear a cast while they're still very young, rather than getting them to wear a removable back brace every day.\n\n【15】A removable back brace may be recommended once your child grows older.\n\n【16】Back braces\n-----------\n\n【17】If the curve of your child's spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they're growing.\n\n【18】This will not correct the curve, but might help stop it getting worse. There are still some uncertainties about how well braces work so they're not recommended by all scoliosis specialists.\n\n【19】The brace:\n\n【20】*   will be custom-made to fit your child's body\n*   will normally be made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available\n*   is designed to be difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing\n*   usually needs to be worn for 23 hours a day\n*   should not interfere with most everyday activities – it normally only needs to be removed for baths, showers, swimming and contact sports\n\n【21】Your child will usually have to wear the brace for as long as they're growing删除7：<u>\n\n【22】Scoliosis Association UK has more information about bracing.</u>\n\n【23】Surgery\n-------\n\n【24】Surgery may be recommended if your child's scoliosis continues to get worse despite trying other treatments, or if they have severe scoliosis and they've stopped growing.\n\n【25】The type of surgery offered will depend on your child's age.\n\n【26】### Surgery in children\n\n【27】Younger children – generally those under 10 – can have an operation to insert special rods alongside the spine. This can help stop the curve getting worse as the spine grows.\n\n【28】After the operation, your child will need to return to their specialist every few months to have the rods lengthened to keep up with their growth.\n\n【29】Depending on the type of rods used, this will be done either:\n\n【30】*   during a minor procedure where the rods are extended through a small cut (incision) in the back\n*   using a remote control that activates magnets inside the rods – no incisions are needed to lengthen these rods\n\n【31】Even if they have surgery, your child may need to wear a brace to protect their back.\n\n【32】When they stop growing, the rods can be removed and a final operation to straighten their spine may be carried out.\n\n【33】### Surgery in teenagers and young adults\n\n【34】Teenagers and young adults who've stopped growing can have an operation called a spinal fusion to correct the curve.\n\n【35】This is a major operation where the spine is straightened using metal rods, screws, hooks or wires, along with bits of bone taken from elsewhere in your body, often the hip.\n\n【36】These are usually left in place permanently.\n\n【37】Most people:\n\n【38】*   spend about a week in hospital after the operation\n*   can return to school after a few weeks\n*   can play sports after a few months – although they may need to avoid contact sports for longer\n\n【39】Sometimes they'll need to wear a back brace after surgery to protect the back while it heals.\n\n【40】### Risks of surgery\n\n【41】Like any operation, spinal surgery carries a risk of complications. It will only be recommended if your child's surgeon feels the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n【42】Some of the main risks include:\n\n【43】*   bleeding – if this is severe, your child may need a blood transfusion\n*   wound infection – this can usually be treated with antibiotics\n*   the rods or metalwork moving or the grafts failing to attach properly – additional surgery may be required to correct this\n*   in rare cases, damage to the nerves in the spine – this can lead to permanent numbness in the legs, and can sometimes cause paralysis of the legs and loss of bowel and bladder control\n\n【44】Make sure you discuss the potential complications with your surgeon.\n删除4：<u>### More information\n\n【45】*   Scoliosis Association UK: surgery in young people (adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery)\n*   Scoliosis Association UK: preparing your child for surgery\n*   Scoliosis Association UK: advice for before and after surgery\n\n【46】</u>\nExercise and other therapies\n----------------------------\n\n【47】Regular exercise is important for children with scoliosis. It can help improve muscle strength and may help reduce any back pain.\n\n【48】Children with scoliosis can usually do most types of exercise. They only need to avoid certain activities if advised to do so by a specialist.\n\n【49】It's not yet clear whether specific back exercises or physiotherapy can help improve scoliosis, and they're not recommended by all specialists.\n\n【50】There's currently little reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, can help correct a curved spine or stop it getting worse.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Scoliosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment in adults</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:12", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:27", "cost": 15.074}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:10"}

It's an important part of your recovery.\n\n【5】### How to access cardiac rehabilitation\n\n【6】A member of the cardiac rehab team may visit you in hospital with information about your condition or the procedure you're having. After you leave hospital, they may visit you at home or call you to check on your progress.\n\n【7】You do not need a referral from your cardiologist. You can also:\n\n【8】*   contact your local cardiac team – you can call the British Heart Foundation's Heart Helpline on 0808 802 1234 for help finding your nearest cardiac rehab programme\n*   contact your GP surgery to find out how to register for cardiac rehab\n\n【9】Cardiac rehab programmes are available locally, often in weekly sessions that last 6 to 12 weeks. You may be able to choose between group classes, online classes or a home programme.\n\n【10】### How cardiac rehabilitation can help\n\n【11】Research has found that people who attend cardiac rehab have a lower risk of having another heart attack and being admitted to hospital. It also had a positive impact on their wellbeing and quality of life.\n\n【12】Your local cardiac rehab service can give you more details about what they offer, but most programmes will cover:\n\n【13】*   physical activities that are suitable for you\n*   educational talks about managing your condition, taking medicines and other practical advice\n*   relaxation techniques and how to manage stress\n*   psychological support for anxiety and low mood\n\n【14】Your cardiac rehab team will tailor the programme to suit your age, fitness level and any other medical issues.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【15】*   British Heart Foundation: cardiac rehabilitation\n\n【16】</u>\nSelf care\n---------\n\n【17】Self care is an integral part of daily life, and is all about you taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with the support of those involved in your care.\n\n【18】Self care includes actions you take for yourself every day so you stay fit and maintain good physical and mental health. It also helps you to prevent illness or accidents and care more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions.\n\n【19】People living with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being supported so they can achieve self care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent.\n\n【20】Support groups\n--------------\n\n【21】If you have a heart condition, or if you're caring for someone with a heart condition, you might find it useful to meet other people in your area who are in a similar situation.\n\n【22】There are a number of heart support groups around the UK that organise regular exercise sessions, such as walking groups, as well as other social activities. A GP or specialist can provide you with details about your nearest group.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【23】*   British Heart Foundation: how we can help you\n*   British Heart Foundation: call the Heart Helpline on 0300 330 3311\n\n【24】</u>\nRelationships and sex\n---------------------\n\n【25】Coming to terms with a long-term condition such as heart disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they're close to you.\n\n【26】Be open about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. But do not feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself.\n\n【27】### Your sex life\n\n【28】If you have coronary heart disease (CHD) or you've recently had heart surgery, you may be concerned about having sex. You'll usually be able to resume sexual activity as soon as you feel well enough.\n\n【29】Communicate with your partner and stay open-minded. Explore what you both like sexually. Simply touching, being touched and being close to someone helps a person feel loved and special.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【30】*   British Heart Foundation: sex and heart conditions\n\n【31】</u>\nReturning to work\n-----------------\n\n【32】After recovering from heart surgery, you should be able to return to work, but you may need to change the type of work you do. For example, you may not be able to do a job that involves heavy physical exertion.\n\n【33】Your specialist will be able to advise you about when you can return to work and what type of activities you should avoid.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【34】*   British Heart Foundation: returning to work\n\n【35】</u>\nFinancial support\n-----------------\n\n【36】If you're unable to work after having heart surgery, you may be entitled to financial support, such as:\n\n【37】*   GOV.UK: Attendance Allowance\n*   GOV.UK: Disability Living Allowance\n*   GOV.UK: Statutory Sick Pay\n\n【38】If you're caring for someone who has heart disease, you may also be entitled to financial support.\n\n【39】To find out if you're entitled to financial support, you can contact your local Social Security department.

Treatment can ease some of the symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely.\n\n【8】How fibromyalgia is treated\n---------------------------\n\n【9】Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with.\n\n【10】Treatment tends to be a combination of:\n\n【11】*   lifestyle changes, such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques\n*   talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)\n*   medicine, such as antidepressants\n\n【12】In particular, exercise has a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain.\n\n【13】What causes fibromyalgia?\n-------------------------\n\n【14】The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body.\n\n【15】It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents.\n\n【16】In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by things that are physical or emotional like an injury, an infection or stress.\n\n【17】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【18】Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, but it's more common in women than men.\n\n【19】The condition typically develops between the ages of 25 and 55, but people of any age can get it, including children and older people.\n\n【20】It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition.\n\n【21】Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree.\n\n【22】One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose.\n\n【23】There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions.\n\n【24】Support groups\n--------------\n\n【25】If you have fibromyalgia, support groups can provide an important network for talking to others living with the condition.\n\n【26】Fibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia.\n\n【27】If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 3333.\n\n【28】Fibromyalgia Action UK also has a number of regional co-ordinators who can put you in touch with a support group near you.\n\n【29】Another organisation you may find useful is UK Fibromyalgia.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:41:52", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:03", "cost": 11.57}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:53", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:41:52"}

If timolol makes you feel dizzy or weak, sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery if you're feeling tired or dizzy. Do not drink alcohol as this can make you feel worse.\n\n【7】Cold fingers or toes\n\n【8】Put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them, and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine in. Both of these can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. Smoking also makes your skin colder. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Do not wear tight watches or bracelets because it could affect your blood flow.\n\n【9】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【10】Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your timolol after a meal or snack.\n\n【11】If you're being sick, try drinking small, frequent sips of water. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【12】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy.

This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n【24】People feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the causes of diabetes insipidus</u>\n\n【25】Who's affected by diabetes insipidus\n------------------------------------\n\n【26】Diabetes insipidus affects about 1 in 25,000 people in the general population.\n\n【27】Adults are more likely to develop the condition, but it can occur at any age.\n\n【28】In rarer cases, diabetes insipidus can develop during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes insipidus.\n\n【29】Types of diabetes insipidus\n---------------------------\n\n【30】There are 2 main types of diabetes insipidus:\n\n【31】*   cranial diabetes insipidus\n*   nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n\n【32】### Cranial diabetes insipidus\n\n【33】Cranial diabetes insipidus occurs when there's not enough AVP in the body to regulate urine production.\n\n【34】Cranial diabetes insipidus is the most common type of diabetes insipidus.\n\n【35】It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland – for example, after an infection, operation, brain tumour or head injury.\n\n【36】In about 1 in 3 cases of cranial diabetes insipidus there's no obvious reason why the hypothalamus stops making enough AVP.\n\n【37】### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n\n【38】Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when there's enough AVP in the body but the kidneys fail to respond to it.\n\n【39】It can be caused by kidney damage or, in some cases, inherited as a problem on its own.\n\n【40】Some medications, particularly lithium (used to help stabilise mood in some people with specific mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder), can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n【41】Treating diabetes insipidus\n---------------------------\n\n【42】Treatment is not always needed for mild cases of cranial diabetes insipidus.\n\n【43】You just need to increase the amount of water you drink to compensate for the fluid lost through urination.\n\n【44】If necessary, a medication called desmopressin can be used to replicate the functions of AVP.\n\n【45】Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics, which reduce the amount of urine the kidneys produce.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treating diabetes insipidus</u>\n\n【46】Complications\n-------------\n\n【47】As diabetes insipidus increases water loss in the urine, the amount of water in the body can become low.

You can eat and drink as normal beforehand.\n\n【5】In some cases, you may be asked to avoid going to the toilet for a few hours before having CVS because it's sometimes easier to do the test when your bladder is full.\n\n【6】Your doctor or midwife will tell you about this before you attend your appointment.\n\n【7】You can bring a partner, friend or family member for support when you have the test.\n\n【8】How CVS is performed\n--------------------\n\n【9】CVS is carried out under the continuous guidance of an ultrasound scan.\n\n【10】This is to make sure nothing enters the amniotic sac (the protective sac that cushions the baby) or touches the baby.\n\n【11】The test can be carried out using 2 different methods: transabdominal CVS and transcervical CVS.\n\n【12】### Transabdominal CVS\n\n【13】Your tummy is cleaned with antiseptic before a local anaesthetic injection is used to numb it.\n\n【14】A needle is inserted through your skin into the womb and guided to the placenta using the image on the ultrasound scan.\n\n【15】A syringe is attached to the needle, which is used to take a small sample of cells from the chorionic villi.\n\n【16】After the sample is removed, the needle is removed.\n\n【17】### Transcervical CVS\n\n【18】A sample of cells from the chorionic villi is collected through the neck of your womb (the cervix).\n\n【19】A thin tube attached to a syringe, or small forceps, are inserted through your vagina and cervix and guided towards the placenta using the ultrasound scan.\n\n【20】Which method will be used?\n--------------------------\n\n【21】The transabdominal method is preferred in most cases because it's often easier to carry out.\n\n【22】Transcervical CVS is also more likely to cause vaginal bleeding immediately after the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in 10 women who have this procedure.\n\n【23】But there's no difference in the rate of miscarriages between the 2 methods.\n\n【24】Transcervical CVS may be preferred to transabdominal CVS if it's easier to reach your placenta this way.\n\n【25】Is CVS painful?\n---------------\n\n【26】CVS is usually described as being uncomfortable, rather than painful.\n\n【27】In most cases, an injection of local anaesthetic will be given before transabdominal CVS to numb the area where the needle is inserted, but you may have a sore tummy afterwards.\n\n【28】Transcervical CVS feels similar to a cervical screening test.\n\n【29】How long does it take?\n----------------------\n\n【30】CVS usually takes around 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes.\n\n【31】Afterwards, you'll be monitored for up to an hour in case you have any side effects, such as heavy bleeding.\n\n【32】You can then go home to rest.\n\n【33】It's a good idea to arrange for someone to drive you home as you might not feel up to it yourself.\n\n【34】Recovering after CVS\n--------------------\n\n【35】After having CVS, it's normal to have cramps similar to period pain and light vaginal bleeding called spotting for a few hours.\n\n【36】You can take painkillers you can buy in a pharmacy or shop, such as paracetamol (but not ibuprofen or aspirin) if you experience any discomfort.\n\n【37】You may wish to avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of the day.\n\n【38】Contact your midwife or the hospital where the procedure was carried out for advice as soon as possible if you develop any of the following symptoms afterwards:\n\n【39】*   persistent or severe pain\n*   a high temperature or feeling hot or shivery\n*   heavy vaginal bleeding\n*   discharge of clear fluid from your vagina\n*   contractions\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Why it's offered</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Results</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:04", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:12", "cost": 7.351}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:04"}

It needs to be removed, cleaned and replaced regularly.\n\n【28】### Side effects of vaginal pessaries\n\n【29】Vaginal pessaries can occasionally cause:\n\n【30】*   unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge, which could be a sign of a bacterial infection in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis)\n*   some irritation and sores inside your vagina, and possibly bleeding\n*   stress incontinence, where you pass a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise\n*   a urinary tract infection\n*   interference with sex (but most women can have sex without any problems)\n\n【31】These side effects can usually be treated.\n\n【32】Surgery\n-------\n\n【33】If non-surgical options have not worked or the prolapse is more severe, surgery may be an option.\n\n【34】There are several different surgical treatments for pelvic organ prolapse.\n\n【35】They include:\n\n【36】*   surgical repair\n*   vaginal mesh surgery\n*   hysterectomy\n*   closing the vagina\n\n【37】Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of different treatments, and you'll decide together which is best for you.\n\n【38】### Surgical repair\n\n【39】There are several different types of surgery that involve lifting and supporting the pelvic organs.\n\n【40】This could be by stitching them into place or supporting the existing tissues to make them stronger.\n\n【41】Surgical repairs are usually done by making cuts in the wall of the vagina under general anaesthetic.\n\n【42】This means you'll be asleep during the operation and will not feel any pain.\n\n【43】You may need 6 to 12 weeks off work to recover, depending on the type of surgery you have.\n\n【44】If you'd like to have children in the future, your doctors may suggest delaying surgery because pregnancy can cause the prolapse to happen again.\n\n【45】### Vaginal mesh surgery\n\n【46】Information:\n\n【47】At the moment, it's not possible to have vaginal mesh surgery for pelvic organ prolapse on the NHS unless there's no alternative and the procedure cannot be delayed, and after detailed discussion between you and a doctor.\n\n【48】Vaginal mesh surgery is where a piece of synthetic mesh, a plastic product that looks like a net, is inserted to hold the pelvic organs in place.\n\n【49】The mesh stays in your body permanently.\n\n【50】You'll be asleep during the operation and you will usually need to stay in hospital for 1 to 3 days afterwards.\n\n【51】A few women have had serious complications after mesh surgery.

The most common is called a ring pessary.\n\n【26】You may need to try a few different types and sizes to find the one that works best for you.\n\n【27】A gynaecologist or a specialist nurse usually fits a pessary.

They help to relieve indigestion and heartburn by reducing the damage that acid can do to your stomach. They give quick relief that lasts for a few hours. They're ideal for occasional bouts of stomach acid symptoms.\n\n【2】Some antacids, such as Gaviscon, have an extra ingredient called alginic acid. They work by lining your stomach so that juices from it do not splash up into your food pipe. They're especially good for relieving acid reflux.\n\n【3】Taking rabeprazole with painkillers\n-----------------------------------\n\n【4】It’s safe to take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, at the same time as rabeprazole.\n\n【5】It’s best to take ibuprofen with, or just after, a meal so it does not upset your stomach.\n\n【6】Cautions with other medicines\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】If you are taking rabeprazole, it can affect the way other medicines work.

Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines before you start taking rabeprazole:\n\n【8】*   antifungal medicines such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole\n*   clopidogrel and warfarin, medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n*   methotrexate, a medicine that treats psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis\n*   HIV medicines\n*   rifampicin, an antibiotic\n\n【9】These are not all the medicines that may not mix well with rabeprazole. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n\n【10】**Mixing rabeprazole with herbal remedies and supplements**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Do not take St John's wort, the herbal remedy for depression, while you're taking rabeprazole. It may stop rabeprazole working as well as it should.\n\n【12】There's not enough information to say that other complementary medicines and herbal remedies are safe to take with rabeprazole.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus (excess fluid in the brain) can cause complications.**\n\n【3】Shunt problems\n--------------\n\n【4】A shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that can malfunction, usually by becoming blocked or infected.\n\n【5】Sometimes, a scan after the operation shows the shunt is not in the best position and further surgery is needed to reposition it.\n\n【6】If a baby or child has a shunt fitted, the shunt may become too small as the child grows, and it will need to be replaced. As most people need a shunt for the rest of their life, more than one replacement may be needed.\n\n【7】There can occasionally be bleeding when a shunt is positioned. This can cause nerve problems, such as weakness down one side. There's also a small risk of fits after any type of brain surgery.\n\n【8】In younger children, particularly babies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can run alongside the shunt rather than down it, and the fluid can leak through the skin wound. Additional stitches will be needed to stop the leak.\n\n【9】### Shunt blockage\n\n【10】A shunt blockage can be very serious as it can lead to a build-up of excess fluid in the brain, which can cause brain damage.

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus (excess fluid in the brain) can cause complications.**\n\n【3】Shunt problems\n--------------\n\n【4】A shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that can malfunction, usually by becoming blocked or infected.\n\n【5】Sometimes, a scan after the operation shows the shunt is not in the best position and further surgery is needed to reposition it.\n\n【6】If a baby or child has a shunt fitted, the shunt may become too small as the child grows, and it will need to be replaced. As most people need a shunt for the rest of their life, more than one replacement may be needed.\n\n【7】There can occasionally be bleeding when a shunt is positioned. This can cause nerve problems, such as weakness down one side. There's also a small risk of fits after any type of brain surgery.\n\n【8】In younger children, particularly babies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can run alongside the shunt rather than down it, and the fluid can leak through the skin wound. Additional stitches will be needed to stop the leak.\n\n【9】### Shunt blockage\n\n【10】A shunt blockage can be very serious as it can lead to a build-up of excess fluid in the brain, which can cause brain damage. This will cause the symptoms of hydrocephalus.\n\n【11】Emergency surgery will be needed to replace the malfunctioning shunt.\n\n【12】### Shunt infection\n\n【13】Shunt infection is also a relatively common complication after shunt surgery. Infections are more likely to develop during the first few months after surgery.\n\n【14】The symptoms of a shunt infection may include:\n\n【15】*   redness and tenderness along the line of the shunt\n*   a high temperature\n*   headache\n*   vomiting\n*   neck stiffness\n*   tummy pain if the shunt drains into your tummy\n*   irritability or sleepiness in babies\n\n【16】Contact your care team immediately if you or your child has these symptoms. \n\n【17】Antibiotics may be needed to treat the infection and, in some cases, surgery may be required to replace the shunt.\n\n【18】### Shunt alert cards\n\n【19】The hydrocephalus and spina bifida charity Shine has produced a series of shunt alert cards for adults and children.

This is a device that delivers medicine directly into your lungs as you breathe in.\n\n【14】A doctor or nurse will advise you on how to use an inhaler correctly and how often to use it.\n\n【15】There are several different types of inhaler for COPD. The main types include:\n\n【16】### Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers\n\n【17】For most people with COPD, short-acting bronchodilator inhalers are the first treatment used.\n\n【18】Bronchodilators are medicines that make breathing easier by relaxing and widening your airways.\n\n【19】There are 2 types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler:\n\n【20】*   beta-2 agonist inhalers – such as salbutamol and terbutaline\n*   antimuscarinic inhalers – such as ipratropium\n\n【21】Short-acting inhalers should be used when you feel breathless, up to a maximum of 4 times a day.\n\n【22】### Long-acting bronchodilator inhalers\n\n【23】If you experience symptoms regularly or have flare-ups (exacerbations) despite using short-acting bronchodilators, a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler may be recommended.\n\n【24】These work in a similar way to short-acting bronchodilators, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours, so they only need to be used once or twice a day.\n\n【25】There are 2 types of long-acting bronchodilator inhaler:\n\n【26】*   beta-2 agonist inhalers – such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol\n*   antimuscarinic inhalers – such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium\n\n【27】Some new inhalers contain a combination of a long-acting beta-2 agonist and antimuscarinic.\n\n【28】### Steroid inhalers\n\n【29】If you're still becoming breathless when using a long-acting inhaler, or you have frequent flare-ups (exacerbations), a GP may suggest including a steroid inhaler as part of your treatment.\n\n【30】Steroid inhalers contain corticosteroid medicines, which can help to reduce the inflammation in your airways.\n\n【31】Steroid inhalers are normally prescribed as part of a combination inhaler that also includes a long-acting medicine.\n\n【32】Tablets\n-------\n\n【33】If your symptoms are not controlled with inhalers, a doctor may recommend taking tablets or capsules as well.\n\n【34】### Theophylline tablets\n\n【35】Theophylline is a type of bronchodilator. It's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but it seems to reduce swelling (inflammation) in the airways and relax the muscles lining them.\n\n【36】Theophylline comes as tablets or capsules and is usually taken twice a day.\n\n【37】You may need to have regular blood tests during treatment to check the level of medicine in your blood.\n\n【38】This will help a doctor work out the best dose to control your symptoms while reducing the risk of side effects.\n\n【39】Possible side effects include:\n\n【40】*   feeling and being sick\n*   headaches\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n*   noticeable pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeats (palpitations)\n\n【41】Sometimes a similar medicine called aminophylline is also used.\n\n【42】### Mucolytics\n\n【43】If you have a persistent chesty cough with lots of thick phlegm, the doctor may recommend taking a mucolytic medicine called carbocisteine.\n\n【44】Mucolytic medicines make the phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up.\n\n【45】Carbocisteine comes as tablets or capsules and is usually taken 3 or 4 times a day.\n\n【46】If carbocisteine does not help your symptoms, or you cannot take it for medical reasons, another mucolytic medicine called acetylcysteine is available.\n\n【47】This comes as a powder that you mix with water. Acetylcysteine powder has an unpleasant smell, like rotten eggs, but this smell should go away once you mix it with the water.\n\n【48】### Steroid tablets\n\n【49】If you have a particularly bad flare-up, you may be prescribed a short course of steroid tablets to reduce the inflammation in your airways.\n\n【50】A 5-day course of treatment is usually recommended, as long-term use of steroid tablets can cause troublesome side effects such as:\n\n【51】*   weight gain\n*   mood swings\n*   weakened bones (osteoporosis)\n\n【52】Your doctor may give you a supply of steroid tablets to keep at home to take as soon as you experience a bad flare-up.\n\n【53】Longer courses of steroid tablets must be prescribed by a COPD specialist. You'll be given the lowest effective dose and monitored closely for side effects.\n\n【54】### Antibiotics\n\n【55】Your doctor may prescribe a short course of antibiotics if you have signs of a chest infection, such as:\n\n【56】*   becoming more breathless\n*   coughing more\n*   noticing a change in the colour (such as becoming brown, green or yellow) and/or consistency of your phlegm (such as becoming thicker)\n\n【57】Sometimes you may be given a course of antibiotics to keep at home and take as soon as you experience symptoms of an infection.\n\n【58】Pulmonary rehabilitation\n------------------------\n\n【59】Pulmonary rehabilitation is a specialised programme of exercise and education designed to help people with lung problems such as COPD.\n\n【60】It can help improve how much exercise you're able to do before you feel out of breath, as well as your symptoms, self-confidence and emotional wellbeing.\n\n【61】Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes usually involve 2 or more group sessions a week for at least 6 weeks.\n\n【62】A typical programme includes:\n\n【63】*   physical exercise training tailored to your needs and ability – such as walking, cycling and strength exercises\n*   education about your condition for you and your family\n*   dietary advice\n*   psychological and emotional support\n\n【64】The programmes are provided by a number of different healthcare professionals, including physiotherapists, nurse specialists and dietitians删除7：<u>\n\n【65】The British Lung Foundation has more information about pulmonary rehabilitation.</u>\n\n【66】Improving muscle strength\n-------------------------\n\n【67】If you are having a bad flare-up and are unable to exercise, you may be offered electrical stimulation to make your muscles stronger.\n\n【68】This is where electrodes are placed on your skin and small electrical impulses are sent to weak muscles, usually in your arms or legs.\n删除3：<u>### Video: Pulmonary rehabilitation\n\n【69】This video explores pulmonary rehabilitation and how exercise can improve the symptoms of COPD.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 February 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 February 2024</u>\n\n【70】</u>\nOther treatments\n----------------\n\n【71】If you have severe symptoms or experience a particularly bad flare-up, you may sometimes need additional treatment.\n\n【72】### Nebulised medicine\n\n【73】Nebulised medicine may be used in severe cases of COPD if inhalers have not worked.\n\n【74】This is where a machine is used to turn liquid medicine into a fine mist that you breathe in through a mouthpiece or a face mask. It enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go.\n\n【75】You'll usually be given a nebuliser device to use at home after being shown how to use it.\n\n【76】### Roflumilast\n\n【77】Roflumilast is a new medicine that can be used to treat flare-ups.\n\n【78】It is recommended for people whose symptoms have suddenly become worse at least 2 times over the past 12 months, and who are already using inhalers.\n\n【79】Roflumilast comes as tablets and the medicine helps reduce inflammation inside the lungs and airways.\n\n【80】Side effects of roflumilast include:\n\n【81】*   feeling and being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   reduced appetite\n*   weight loss\n*   headache\n\n【82】### Long-term oxygen therapy\n\n【83】If COPD causes a low level of oxygen in your blood, you may be advised to have oxygen at home through nasal tubes or a mask.\n\n【84】This can help stop the level of oxygen in your blood becoming dangerously low, although it's not a treatment for the main symptoms of COPD, such as breathlessness.\n\n【85】Long-term oxygen treatment should be used for at least 15 hours a day.\n\n【86】The tubes from the machine are long, so you will be able to move around your home while you're connected. Portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home.\n\n【87】Do not smoke when using oxygen. The increased level of oxygen is highly flammable and a lit cigarette could cause a fire or explosion.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about home oxygen therapy.</u>\n\n【88】### Ambulatory oxygen therapy\n\n【89】Some people with COPD will benefit from ambulatory oxygen, which is oxygen you use when you walk or are active in other ways.\n\n【90】If your blood oxygen levels are normal while you're resting but fall when you exercise, you may be able to have ambulatory oxygen therapy rather than long-term oxygen therapy.\n\n【91】### Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)\n\n【92】If you're taken to hospital because of a bad flare-up, you may have a treatment called non-invasive ventilation (NIV).\n\n【93】This is where a portable machine connected to a mask that covers your nose or face is used to support your lungs and make breathing easier.\n\n【94】Surgery\n-------\n\n【95】Surgery is usually only suitable for a small number of people with severe COPD whose symptoms are not controlled with medicine.\n\n【96】There are 3 main operations that can be done:\n\n【97】*   bullectomy – an operation to remove a pocket of air from one of the lungs, allowing the lungs to work better and make breathing more comfortable\n*   lung volume reduction surgery – an operation to remove a badly damaged section of lung to allow the healthier parts to work better and make breathing more comfortable\n*   lung transplant – an operation to remove and replace a damaged lung with a healthy lung from a donor\n\n【98】These are major operations done under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep, and involve significant risks.\n\n【99】If your doctors feel surgery is an option for you, speak to them about what the procedure involves and what the benefits and risks are.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:27", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:59", "cost": 31.751}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:27"}

They can develop within 10 to 20 minutes or sometimes even longer after surfacing. Do not ignore these symptoms – get medical help immediately.\n\n【12】### Getting medical help\n\n【13】**Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you or someone you're with feels unwell after scuba diving.**\n\n【14】A diver with a suspected air or gas embolism should be transferred to an A&E department as soon as possible.\n\n【15】They should be laid down flat and given 100% oxygen until they reach hospital. Once stabilised, they'll be taken to a pressurised room called a hyperbaric chamber, either at the hospital or at another location.\n\n【16】### Why diving can lead to an air or gas embolism\n\n【17】If a diver surfaces too quickly, nitrogen bubbles can form in their tissues and bloodstream.

Use it at the same time each day.\n\n【4】It's important to use your tiotropium inhaler regularly to manage your condition. Keep using it, even if you do not have any symptoms.\n\n【5】You'll usually stay on the same dose. If the brand of tiotropium inhaler you use changes, the number of puffs you need to take may change. You'll still only use the inhaler once a day.\n\n【6】How to use it\n-------------\n\n【7】There are different types of tiotropium inhaler.\n\n【8】Before using your inhaler, read the information leaflet that came with it. This leaflet contains instructions and diagrams to show you how to use the inhaler, how to keep it clean, and how long to use it before getting a replacement.\n\n【9】It's very important to use your inhaler properly. This is so you get the right amount of tiotropium into your lungs and the most benefit from your medicine.\n\n【10】After using your inhaler, always put the lid back on to keep it clean.\n\n【11】Unlike steroid inhalers, after using your tiotropium inhaler you do not need to rinse your mouth with water.\n\n【12】### Inhalers with capsules\n\n【13】Some tiotropium inhalers use capsules that contain the medicine in a powder. Brands include:\n\n【14】*   Braltus capsules, used with the Zonda device\n*   Spiriva capsules, used with the HandiHaler device\n\n【15】Put a new capsule into the device each time you use it.\n\n【16】The inhaler has a button that makes a hole in the capsule. You then breathe in the powder from the capsule through the mouthpiece on the inhaler.\n\n【17】Inhale from the device twice to make sure that you've inhaled all of the medicine and the capsule is empty.\n\n【18】#### Important: Risk of choking\n\n【19】Always store your capsules in the screw-top bottle or blister pack that comes with the capsules. Do not store them inside the inhaler. Always check that the mouthpiece is clear before using your inhaler.\n\n【20】### Inhalers with cartridges\n\n【21】Tiotropium inhalers that use cartridges include:\n\n【22】*   Spiolto Respimat\n*   Spiriva Respimat\n*   Yanimo Respimat\n\n【23】The cartridge contains several doses, so you do not need to replace it each time you use your inhaler.\n\n【24】Check your inhaler technique\n----------------------------\n\n【25】To get the most from your inhaler, it's important to have your technique checked regularly.\n\n【26】If you're not sure how to use your inhaler, or your technique has not been checked for a year, ask your doctor, nurse or a pharmacist to watch you use it.\n\n【27】How long to use it for\n----------------------\n\n【28】You'll usually use your tiotropium inhaler for a long time, sometimes many years. It helps prevent your asthma or COPD getting worse.\n\n【29】It's important to keep using your inhaler even if you feel better.\n\n【30】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【31】If you forget a dose, use your inhaler as soon as you remember, unless you do not remember until the next day. In this case, skip the missed dose and have your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【32】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【33】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【34】If you use too much\n-------------------\n\n【35】Using too much tiotropium can cause a dry mouth, a faster heartbeat or blurred vision.\n\n【36】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【37】*   you use more than your prescribed dose of tiotropium and have a faster heartbeat or blurred vision.\n\n【38】Call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【39】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【40】Take the tiotropium inhaler and the packet or leaflet with you.\n删除11：<u>More in Tiotropium inhalers\n---------------------------\n\n【41】*   About tiotropium inhalers\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using them with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 October 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 October 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:25", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:29", "cost": 4.37}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:24"}

Overview\n2.  Why it's necessary\n3.  Considerations\n4.  How it's performed\n5.  Recovery\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**After having a hysterectomy, you may wake up feeling tired and in some pain. This is normal after this type of surgery.**\n\n【3】You'll be given painkillers to help reduce any pain and discomfort.\n\n【4】If you feel sick after the anaesthetic, your nurse can give you medicine to help relieve this.\n\n【5】You may have:\n\n【6】*   dressings placed over your wounds\n*   a drip in your arm\n*   a catheter – a small tube that drains urine from your bladder into a collection bag\n*   a drainage tube in your abdomen (if you have had an abdominal hysterectomy) to take away any blood from beneath your wound – these tubes usually stay in place for 1 to 2 days\n*   a gauze pack inserted into your vagina (if you have had a vaginal hysterectomy) to minimise the risk of bleeding – this usually stays in place for 24 hours\n\n【7】You may also be slightly uncomfortable and feel like you need to poo.\n\n【8】The day after your operation, you'll be encouraged to take a short walk.\n\n【9】This helps your blood to flow normally, reducing the risk of complications developing, such as blood clots in your legs (deep vein thrombosis).\n\n【10】A physiotherapist may show you how to do some exercises to help your mobility.\n\n【11】They may also show you some pelvic floor muscle exercises to help with your recovery.\n\n【12】After the catheter has been removed, you should be able to pass urine normally.\n\n【13】Any stitches that need to be removed will be taken out 5 to 7 days after your operation.\n\n【14】Your recovery time\n------------------\n\n【15】The length of time it'll take before you're well enough to leave hospital depends on your age and your general level of health.\n\n【16】If you have had a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, you may be able to leave between 1 and 4 days later. \n\n【17】If you have had an abdominal hysterectomy, it'll usually be up to 5 days before you're discharged.\n\n【18】You may be asked to see your GP who will check how well you're recovering.\n\n【19】It can take about 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover after having an abdominal hysterectomy.\n\n【20】Recovery times are often shorter after a vaginal or laparoscopy hysterectomy.\n\n【21】During this time, you should rest as much as possible and not lift anything heavy, such as bags of shopping.\n\n【22】Your abdominal muscles and the surrounding tissues need time to heal.\n\n【23】If you live by yourself, you may be able to get help from your local NHS authority while you're recovering from your operation.\n\n【24】Hospital staff should be able to advise you further about this.\n\n【25】Side effects\n------------\n\n【26】After having a hysterectomy, you may have some temporary side effects.\n\n【27】### Bowel and bladder disturbances\n\n【28】After your operation, there may be some changes in your bowel and bladder functions when going to the toilet.\n\n【29】Some women develop urinary tract infections or constipation. Both can easily be treated.\n\n【30】It's recommended that you drink plenty of fluids and increase the fruit and fibre in your diet to help with your bowel and bladder movements.\n\n【31】For the first few bowel movements after a hysterectomy, you may need laxatives to help you avoid straining.\n\n【32】Some people find it more comfortable to hold their abdomen to provide support while passing a stool.\n\n【33】### Vaginal discharge\n\n【34】After a hysterectomy, you'll experience some vaginal bleeding and discharge.\n\n【35】This will be less discharge than during a period, but it may last up to 6 weeks.\n\n【36】Visit your GP if you experience heavy vaginal bleeding, start passing blood clots or have a strong-smelling discharge.\n\n【37】### Menopausal symptoms\n\n【38】If your ovaries are removed, you'll usually experience severe menopausal symptoms after your operation.\n\n【39】These may include:\n\n【40】*   hot flushes\n*   anxiety\n*   weepiness\n*   sweating\n\n【41】You may have hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after your operation.\n\n【42】This can be given in the form of an implant, injections or tablets.\n\n【43】### Emotional effects\n\n【44】You may feel a sense of loss and sadness after having a hysterectomy.\n\n【45】These feelings are particularly common in women with advanced cancer, who have no other treatment option.\n\n【46】Some women who have not yet experienced the menopause may feel a sense of loss because they're no longer able to have children. Others may feel less \"womanly\" than before.\n\n【47】In some cases, having a hysterectomy can be a trigger for depression.\n\n【48】See your GP if you have feelings of depression that will not go away, as they can advise you about the available treatment options.\n\n【49】Talking to other women who have had a hysterectomy may help by providing emotional support and reassurance.\n\n【50】Your GP or the hospital staff may be able to recommend a local support group.\n\n【51】Getting back to normal\n----------------------\n\n【52】### Returning to work\n\n【53】How long it will take for you to return to work depends on how you feel and what sort of work you do.\n\n【54】If your job does not involve manual work or heavy lifting, it may be possible to return after 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor will advise you when you can return to work.\n\n【55】### Driving\n\n【56】Do not drive until you're comfortable wearing a seatbelt and can safely perform an emergency stop.\n\n【57】This can be anything from 2 to 6 weeks after your operation.\n\n【58】You may want to check with your GP that you're fit to drive before you start.\n\n【59】Some car insurance companies require a certificate from a GP stating that you're fit to drive. Check this with your car insurance company.\n\n【60】### Exercise and lifting\n\n【61】After a hysterectomy, the hospital where you were treated should give you information and advice about suitable forms of exercise while you recover.\n\n【62】Walking is always recommended, and you can swim after your wounds have healed.\n\n【63】Do not try to do too much as you'll probably feel more tired than usual.\n\n【64】Do not lift any heavy objects during your recovery period.\n\n【65】If you have to lift light objects, make sure your knees are bent and your back is straight.\n\n【66】### Sex\n\n【67】After a hysterectomy, it's generally recommended that you do not have sex until your scars have healed and any vaginal discharge has stopped, which usually takes at least 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n【68】As long as you're comfortable and relaxed, it's safe to have sex after that. \n\n【69】You may experience some vaginal dryness, particularly if you have had your ovaries removed and you're not taking HRT.\n\n【70】Many women also experience an initial loss of sexual desire (libido) after the operation, but this usually returns once they have fully recovered.\n\n【71】### Contraception\n\n【72】You no longer need to use contraception to prevent pregnancy after having a hysterectomy.\n\n【73】But you'll still need to use condoms to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : How it's performed</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:06:23", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:07:16", "cost": 52.928}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:07:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:06:22"}

Talk to the GP or nurse if you're feeling uncomfortable.\n\n【21】You can have a friend, family member or another member of staff in the room with you during the examination if you want.\n\n【22】You can ask to stop the examination at any time.\n\n【23】Referral to a specialist\n------------------------\n\n【24】The GP may refer you for more tests or to see a specialist in hospital if they think you have a condition that needs to be investigated.\n\n【25】This may be an urgent referral, usually within 2 weeks, if you have certain symptoms.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver.**\n\n【3】This is because the condition causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages.\n\n【4】If a doctor suspects ARLD, they'll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption.\n\n【5】It's important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol. This is to avoid further unnecessary testing, which could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.\n\n【6】Blood tests\n-----------\n\n【7】Blood tests used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests.\n\n【8】But liver function tests can be normal at many stages of liver disease.\n\n【9】Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver.\n\n【10】A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver is not functioning properly.\n\n【11】A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage.\n删除7：<u>Find more information on liver blood tests on the Lab Tests Online website</u>\n\n【12】Further testing\n---------------\n\n【13】If your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD (either alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis), you may need further tests.\n\n【14】### Imaging tests\n\n【15】Scans may be needed to produce detailed images of your liver.\n\n【16】This may include:\n\n【17】*   an ultrasound scan\n*   a CT scan\n*   an MRI scan\n\n【18】Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.\n\n【19】### Liver biopsy\n\n【20】During a liver biopsy, a fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs).\n\n【21】A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.\n\n【22】The biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital.\n\n【23】Your liver tissue will be examined to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.\n\n【24】### Endoscopy\n\n【25】An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end. \n\n【26】During an endoscopy, the instrument is passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach.\n\n【27】Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:05", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:28:20", "cost": 15.322}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:28:05"}

Overview\n2.  Diagnosis\n3.  Treatment\n4.  Reducing the risk</u>\n\n【2】**Paget's disease of the nipple, also known as Paget's disease of the breast, is a rare condition associated with breast cancer**.\n\n【3】It causes eczema-like changes to the skin of the nipple and the area of darker skin surrounding the nipple (areola). It's usually a sign of breast cancer in the tissue behind the nipple.\n\n【4】About 1 to 4% of women with breast cancer have Paget's disease of the nipple. It can also affect men, but this is extremely rare.\n\n【5】The term Paget's disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget's disease of the bone (where bones become weak and deformed).\n\n【6】Symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola.\n\n【8】The affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated.\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【9】CID, ISM /SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/459439/view</u>\n\n【10】The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over.\n\n【11】If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor.\n\n【12】Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer.\n\n【13】Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump.\n\n【14】However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer.\n\n【15】This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread.\n\n【16】Causes of Paget's disease of the nipple\n---------------------------------------\n\n【17】The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown. Some women appear to be more at risk of developing breast cancer, but not specifically Paget's disease. There are no known causes that lead to a specific type of breast cancer.\n\n【18】In terms of risk factors, you're more likely to develop breast cancer if you:\n\n【19】*   are older – the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age\n*   have close relatives with breast cancer\n*   have had breast cancer before\n*   have had a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease before – certain types of benign breast disease may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but this is only seen in a very small number of women\n*   are overweight or living with obesity, particularly if you've been through the menopause (you can use the BMI calculator to check if you're a healthy weight)\n*   drink a lot of alcohol – your risk can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink\n删除7：<u>Read more about the risk factors for breast cancer.</u>\n\n【20】Diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple\n----------------------------------------\n\n【21】You should see your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola.\n\n【22】As Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\n\n【23】Also see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out.\n\n【24】A biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous.\n\n【25】If the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray) to investigate further.\n删除7：<u>Read more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple.</u>\n\n【26】Treating Paget's disease of the nipple\n--------------------------------------\n\n【27】Surgery is the main treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple. Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision).\n\n【28】If the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast.\n\n【29】You may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of:\n\n【30】*   chemotherapy – where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells\n*   radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells\n*   targeted or hormone therapy – which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body\n\n【31】If Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating Paget's disease of the nipple.</u>\n\n【32】Reducing the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and making sure you exercise regularly, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer.\n\n【34】Breast cancer screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. In the UK, the NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women aged 50 to 70.\n\n【35】In some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a study looking at whether the age range for breast screening should be extended.\n删除7：<u>Read more about reducing the risks of breast cancer.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:52", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:58", "cost": 6.805}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:52", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:51"}

After this time, they usually develop an arch.\n\n【11】Flat feet:\n\n【12】*   do not usually cause any problems\n*   should not stop you doing any activities, including sports\n*   are rarely a sign of anything serious\n\n【13】But sometimes, you may have pain around your ankle or the arch of your foot may ache.

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Complications of stomach ulcers are relatively uncommon, but they can be very serious if they happen.**\n\n【3】Internal bleeding\n-----------------\n\n【4】Internal bleeding is the most common complication of stomach ulcers. It can happen when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel.\n\n【5】The bleeding can either be:\n\n【6】*   slow, long-term bleeding, leading to anaemia – causing fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin and heart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats)\n*   rapid and severe bleeding – causing you to vomit blood or pass stools that are black, sticky and tar-like\n\n【7】You should visit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of anaemia. If they think you may have a stomach ulcer, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist for an examination and treatment.\n\n【8】Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if you have symptoms of more severe bleeding.\n\n【9】### Treating internal bleeding\n\n【10】A gastroscopy will be used to identify the cause of the bleeding and treatment can often be given during this to stop the bleeding.\n\n【11】Sometimes specialised procedures carried out under X-ray guidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers, although surgery may occasionally be required to repair the affected blood vessel.\n\n【12】Blood transfusions may also be needed to replace the blood you have lost.\n\n【13】Perforation\n-----------\n\n【14】A rarer complication of stomach ulcers is the lining of the stomach splitting open, known as perforation.\n\n【15】This can be very serious because it enables the bacteria that live in your stomach to escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). This is known as peritonitis.\n\n【16】In peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure and can be fatal if left untreated.\n\n【17】The most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain that gets steadily worse. \n\n【18】If you have this type of pain, contact your GP immediately. If this isn't possible, call NHS 111 or your local NHS out-of-hours service.\n\n【19】Peritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating peritonitis.</u>\n\n【20】Gastric outlet obstruction\n--------------------------\n\n【21】In some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can stop food from going through your digestive system. This is known as gastric outlet obstruction.\n\n【22】Symptoms can include:\n\n【23】*   repeated episodes of vomiting, with large amounts of vomit that contain undigested food\n*   a persistent feeling of bloating or fullness\n*   feeling very full after eating less food than usual\n*   unintentional weight loss\n\n【24】A gastroscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction. If the obstruction is caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down.\n\n【25】If the obstruction is caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed to treat it, although it can sometimes be treated by passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the obstruction.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 January 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:52", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:48:09", "cost": 17.579}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:48:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:52"}

About carvedilol\n--------------------\n\n【3】Carvedilol is a beta blocker.\n\n【4】It’s used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and helps prevent:\n\n【5】*   heart disease\n*   heart attacks\n*   strokes\n\n【6】It can also be given with other medicines to treat heart failure and to prevent chest pain caused by angina.\n\n【7】Carvedilol is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets.\n\n【8】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【9】*   Carvedilol slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n*   You’ll usually take carvedilol once or twice a day.\n*   It usually starts to work after about 1 hour. But it will take days or weeks for it to reach its full effect.\n*   Common side effects of carvedilol include headaches and feeling tired or dizzy.\n*   Do not stop taking carvedilol suddenly. This can make your condition worse, especially if you have heart disease.\n\n【10】3\\. Who can and cannot take carvedilol\n--------------------------------------\n\n【11】Carvedilol can be taken by most adults. It can sometimes be prescribed by a specialist for children aged 2 years and over.\n\n【12】Carvedilol is not suitable for some people. Tell your doctor before starting the medicine if you have:\n\n【13】*   ever had an allergic reaction to carvedilol or any other medicines\n*   lung disease or asthma\n*   heart failure that is getting worse\n*   have low blood pressure (hypotension) or a slow heart rate\n*   a liver problem\n*   serious circulation problems in your arms and legs, such as Raynaud’s\n\n【14】4\\. How and when to take carvedilol\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】When you start taking carvedilol, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose just before you go to bed. This is because it can make you feel dizzy.\n\n【16】After the first dose, if you do not feel dizzy, you can take your medicine in the morning. If you do feel dizzy, it’s best to keep taking your medicine at bedtime.\n\n【17】It’s best to take carvedilol at the same time each day.\n\n【18】If you take it twice a day, you’ll usually have 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose in the evening. Leave 10 to 12 hours between doses if you can.\n\n【19】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not chew or crush them.\n\n【20】Carvedilol does not usually upset your stomach, so you can take it with or without food. However, if you are taking carvedilol for heart failure, it’s best to take the tablets with food. This will help reduce the risk of you feeling dizzy or faint when you stand up.\n\n【21】If you find tablets difficult to swallow, some strengths have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if you can do this.\n\n【22】### Dosage\n\n【23】Carvedilol tablets come in 4 different strengths – 3.125mg, 6.25mg, 12.5mg and 25mg.\n\n【24】How much you take depends on why you need carvedilol.\n\n【25】The usual starting dose to treat:\n\n【26】*   **high blood pressure** is 12.5mg once a day for 2 days – this is increased to 25mg, taken once a day. If your blood pressure does not go down enough your doctor may increase your dose to up to 50mg a day. This can be taken as a single dose or split into 2 doses.\n*   **heart failure** is 3.125mg, taken twice a day for 2 weeks. Your doctor will then slowly increase the dose every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 25mg to 50mg (depending on your weight).\n*   **angina** is 12.5mg, taken twice a day for 2 days – this is increased to 25mg, taken twice a day.\n\n【27】If your child is prescribed carvedilol, the doctor will use their weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【28】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【29】If you miss a dose of carvedilol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it’s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.\n\n【30】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【31】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【32】### What if I take too much?\n\n【33】The amount of carvedilol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【34】Taking too much carvedilol can lower your blood pressure, slow your heart rate, and make it difficult to breathe.\n\n【35】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【36】*   you take too much carvedilol\n\n【37】Call 111 or go to 111.nhs.uk\n\n【38】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【39】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【40】Like all medicines, carvedilol can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.\n\n【41】Side effects usually improve as your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【42】### Common side effects\n\n【43】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They’re usually mild and last a few days after starting the medicine or increasing your dose.\n\n【44】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【45】*   feeling dizzy\n*   headaches\n*   feeling tired\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   cold fingers or toes\n\n【46】### Serious side effects\n\n【47】It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking carvedilol.\n\n【48】Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【49】*   nose bleeds that last for more than 10 minutes, unexplained bruising, or you bruise more easily than usual – these can be signs of low numbers of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)\n*   high temperature, sore throat, mouth sores, toothache, flu-like symptoms – these can be signs of a low number of white blood cells (leukopenia)\n*   shortness of breath with a cough that gets worse when you exercise (like walking up the stairs), swollen ankles or legs, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat – these may be signs of other heart problems\n*   shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest – these can be signs of lung problems\n*   yellow skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow – these can be signs of liver problems\n\n【50】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【51】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to carvedilol.\n\n【52】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【53】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【54】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【55】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【56】These are not all the side effects of carvedilol. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【57】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n删除12：<u>Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u></u>\n\n【58】6\\. How to cope with side effects of carvedilol\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【59】**What to do about:**\n\n【60】*   **feeling dizzy** – as your body gets used to carvedilol this side effect should wear off. If carvedilol makes you feel dizzy, stop what you’re doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive or operate machinery until you feel OK again. Try to avoid alcohol as it'll make you feel worse.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Do not drink too much alcohol. Headaches usually go away after the first week of taking carvedilol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last more than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired** – do not drive, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery if you’re feeling tired. Do not drink any alcohol as this will make you feel more tired.\n*   **feeling sick or being sick** – stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your carvedilol after a meal or snack. If you're being sick, try drinking small, frequent sips of water to avoid dehydration.\n*   **cold fingers or toes** – put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them, and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine, as this can make your blood vessels narrower and restrict your blood flow. It’s best not to wear tight watches or bracelets as well. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Speak to your doctor if this side effect bothers you.\n\n【61】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【62】### Carvedilol and pregnancy\n\n【63】Carvedilol is not usually recommended if you’re pregnant.\n\n【64】If you're trying to get pregnant or you're already pregnant, talk to your doctor about taking carvedilol. It may be possible to change to other medicines that are more suitable when you’re pregnant, such as labetalol or nifedipine.\n\n【65】### Carvedilol and breastfeeding\n\n【66】If your doctor or health visitor says that your baby is healthy, it's OK to take carvedilol while breastfeeding.\n\n【67】There is no information about whether carvedilol passes into breast milk, but it would only be expected to pass through in small amounts. It’s unlikely to cause any side effects in your baby.\n\n【68】If you notice that your baby isn't feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, then talk to your health visitor, midwife or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【69】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【70】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n删除7：<u>Find out more about high blood pressure and pregnancy.</u>\n\n【71】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【72】There are some medicines that can affect the way carvedilol works.\n\n【73】Tell your doctor if you’re taking:\n\n【74】*   other medicines for high blood pressure – when taken together with carvedilol, they can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much\n*   other medicines that can lower your blood pressure – these include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an enlarged prostate gland like tamsulosin, or levodopa (for Parkinson’s disease)\n*   medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainide\n*   medicines for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n*   medicines for diabetes, particularly insulin – carvedilol may make it more difficult to recognise the warning signs of low blood sugar. Speak to your doctor if you have low blood sugar levels without getting any warning signs. You should check your blood sugar after exercise, and follow usual advice about checking it before driving, or operating machinery.\n*   medicines that treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)\n*   medicines for allergies, such as ephedrine, noradrenaline or adrenaline\n*   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen – these medicines may increase your blood pressure\n\n【75】### Mixing carvedilol with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【76】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with carvedilol. However, some herbal products, such as cod liver oil, hawthorn and garlic tablets may cause low blood pressure (hypotension).\n\n【77】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【78】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【79】9\\. Common questions about carvedilol\n-------------------------------------\n\n【80】How does carvedilol work?\n\n【81】Carvedilol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker.\n\n【82】Like other beta blockers, carvedilol works by slowing down your heart rate and making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【83】It also works like an alpha blocker to widen some of your blood vessels. This helps lower your blood pressure.\n\n【84】For angina, carvedilol works by improving the blood supply to your heart. Angina is chest pain that comes on when not enough blood gets to the muscles of the heart. It usually happens because the arteries to the heart become hardened and narrowed.\n\n【85】Carvedilol widens the arteries so more oxygen gets to the heart and chest pain is prevented. It also slows your heart down and makes it beat more effectively. This reduces the amount of oxygen needed by your heart muscle and prevents angina.\n\n【86】How long does it take to work?\n\n【87】Carvedilol usually starts to work after about 1 hour. But it will take days or weeks to reach its full effect.\n\n【88】You may not feel any different when you take carvedilol for high blood pressure, but this does not mean it’s not working. It’s important to keep taking your medicine.\n\n【89】How long will I take it for?\n\n【90】Usually, treatment with carvedilol is long term. It may be for the rest of your life.\n\n【91】Can I take carvedilol for a long time?\n\n【92】Most people take carvedilol for a long time with no problems. In fact, it works best when you take it long term.\n\n【93】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【94】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking carvedilol. If you’re bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine instead.\n\n【95】How does it compare with other medicines for high blood pressure?\n\n【96】Carvedilol works as well as other beta blockers to reduce blood pressure, but it’s mainly used to prevent angina or heart failure because it also widens the blood vessels.\n\n【97】The main difference with carvedilol is that it can affect other parts of your body too, such as your lungs.\n\n【98】Other medicines used to lower blood pressure work in different ways to beta blockers. These include:\n\n【99】*   ACE inhibitors such as ramipril and lisinopril\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers like losartan\n*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) like indapamide\n\n【100】The medicine your doctor prescribes first depends on your age and ethnicity. If you’re under 55 years old, you’ll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If you’re 55 years old or over, or of African Caribbean or black African origin, you’ll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker.\n\n【101】If you are bothered by side effects, you may have to try a different blood pressure medicine. Many people need to take a combination.\n\n【102】How does it compare with other medicines for chest pain and angina?\n\n【103】There are lots of other medicines to prevent angina attacks.\n\n【104】They include:\n\n【105】*   calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and amlodipine\n*   nitrates like isosorbide mononitrate\n*   medicines such as ranolazine, nicorandil or ivabradine\n\n【106】If carvedilol does not work for you, or you cannot take carvedilol or other beta blockers because of side effects, you may be able to switch to another medicine.\n\n【107】Your doctor will be able to decide which medicine is best for you. Some people may need to take a combination of medicines to control their angina symptoms.\n\n【108】How does it compare with other medicines that treat heart failure?\n\n【109】Carvedilol is used with other medicines to treat heart failure and prevent complications, These can include ACE inhibitors (like ramipril and lisinopril) or angiotensin receptor blockers (like losartan).\n\n【110】Other beta blockers like bisoprolol and nebivolol can be used instead of carvedilol in a similar way.\n\n【111】Will I need to stop carvedilol before surgery?\n\n【112】Tell your doctor you’re taking carvedilol if you’re going to be put to sleep (using general anaesthetic) or have any kind of major operation.\n\n【113】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking carvedilol before surgery.\n\n【114】This is because carvedilol can lower your blood pressure too much when it’s combined with some general anaesthetics.\n\n【115】Can I drink alcohol?\n\n【116】Drinking alcohol can increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of carvedilol. This can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n【117】During the first few days of taking carvedilol, or after an increase in your dose, it is best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【118】If you find carvedilol makes you feel dizzy it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【119】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【120】You can eat and drink normally while taking carvedilol.\n\n【121】Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help your heart condition.\n\n【122】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【123】Carvedilol will not stop your contraception working.\n\n【124】But some types of combined hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended for women with high blood pressure.\n\n【125】Talk to your doctor if you’re taking a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【126】If carvedilol makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.</u>\n\n【127】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【128】There’s no clear evidence to suggest that taking carvedilol will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【129】If you're trying for a baby or having problems getting pregnant while on carvedilol, speak to your doctor.\n\n【130】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【131】Some people on carvedilol say their sex drive goes down and some men say they cannot get an erection.\n\n【132】There’s not enough evidence to say that carvedilol causes this.\n\n【133】If you’re having problems with your sex life, talk to your doctor.\n\n【134】Do I need to avoid playing sports?\n\n【135】You do not need to stop playing sports if you take carvedilol. But it’s a good idea not to push yourself too much.\n\n【136】Regular exercise is good for you because it lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\n\n【137】However, in some sports carvedilol may not be allowed if you’re competing at a very high level.\n\n【138】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【139】Carvedilol can make you feel tired or dizzy, especially when you first start taking it or after increasing your dose.\n\n【140】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery until you feel OK again.\n\n【141】Can lifestyle changes help heart problems?\n\n【142】If you have heart problems, you can boost the health of your heart by making some lifestyle changes.  \n\n【143】It's a good idea to:\n\n【144】*   quit smoking – not smoking will bring down your blood pressure and relieve heart failure symptoms.\n*   cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and makes heart failure worse. Drinking alcohol while you're taking carvedilol can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n*   exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. Even walking every day will help.\n*   eat well and lower the salt in your diet – aim to eat plenty of fruit and veg, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure – the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be.\n*   deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Finding ways to cope with stress will help to keep your blood pressure down.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【145】*   Angina\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart failure\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Stroke\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【146】*   HealthUnlocked: carvedilol forum\n*   Blood Pressure UK: charity\n*   British Heart Foundation: charity\n*   Heart attack: videos of real stories\n*   NHS Health Check: free health check-up\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 March 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:07:58", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:08:12", "cost": 14.081}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:08:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:07:58"}

Anyone with a cervix can get it.\n\n【8】You cannot get cervical cancer if you've had surgery to remove your womb and cervix (total hysterectomy).\n\n【9】You might also be more likely to get cervical cancer if:\n\n【10】*   you're under 45 – cervical cancer is more common in younger people\n*   you have a weakened immune system, like if you have HIV or AIDS\n*   you have given birth to multiple children or had children at an early age (under 17 years old)\n*   your mother took the hormonal medicine diethylstilbestrol (DES) while pregnant with you – your GP can discuss these risks with you\n*   you've had vaginal, vulval, kidney or bladder cancer in the past\n\n【11】How to lower your chance of getting cervical cancer\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】You cannot always prevent cervical cancer. But there are things you can do to lower your chances of getting cervical cancer.\n\n【13】Cervical screening and HPV vaccination are the best ways to protect yourself from cervical cancer.\n\n【14】*   All women and people with a cervix between the ages of 25 and 64 are invited for regular cervical screening. It helps find and treat any changes in the cells of the cervix before they can turn into cancer.\n*   All children aged 12 to 13 are offered the HPV vaccine. It helps protect against all cancers caused by HPV, as well as genital warts.\n\n【15】You can also lower your chance of getting cervical cancer by:\n\n【16】*   using condoms, which lower your chance of getting HPV – but they do not cover all the skin around your genitals so you're not fully protected\n*   quitting smoking – smoking can weaken your immune system and the chemicals in cigarettes can also cause cervical cancer\n*   eating a balanced diet to help support your immune system\n\n【17】Information:\n\n【18】It's important to get any symptoms of cervical cancer checked by a GP.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Tests and next steps</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:26", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:32", "cost": 6.233}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:26"}

This is called aspiration.\n\n【30】The test is simple. The person is given a few teaspoons of water to drink. If they can swallow this without choking and coughing, they'll be asked to swallow half a glass of water.\n\n【31】If they have any difficulty swallowing, they'll be referred to a speech and language therapist for a more detailed assessment.\n\n【32】They usually will not be allowed to eat or drink normally until they have seen the therapist.\n\n【33】Fluids or nutrients may need to be given directly into a vein in the arm (intravenously) or through a tube that's inserted through the nose and down into the stomach.\n\n【34】Heart and blood vessel tests\n----------------------------\n\n【35】Further tests on the heart and blood vessels might be done later to confirm what caused your stroke.\n\n【36】### Carotid ultrasound\n\n【37】A carotid ultrasound scan can help to show if there's narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.\n\n【38】An ultrasound scan involves using a small probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into your body.\n\n【39】When these sound waves bounce back, they can be used to create an image of the inside of your body.\n\n【40】When carotid ultrasonography is needed, it should happen within 48 hours.\n\n【41】### Echocardiography\n\n【42】An echocardiogram makes images of your heart to check for any problems that could be related to your stroke.\n\n【43】This usually involves moving an ultrasound probe across your chest (transthoracic echocardiogram).\n\n【44】An alternative type of echocardiogram called transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may sometimes be used.\n\n【45】An ultrasound probe is passed down your gullet (oesophagus), usually under sedation.\n\n【46】As this allows the probe to be placed directly behind the heart, it produces a clear image of blood clots and other abnormalities that may not be seen with a transthoracic echocardiogram.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:50:54", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:50:59", "cost": 5.233}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:50:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:50:54"}

You should discuss these with a GP or mental health professional.**\n\n【2】Interactions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【3】Antidepressants can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if there are any other medicines you should avoid.\n\n【4】If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you.\n\n【5】Pregnancy\n---------\n\n【6】As a precaution, antidepressants are not usually recommended for most pregnant women, especially during the early stages of a pregnancy.\n\n【7】This is because there might be risks for you or your baby.\n\n【8】But it's important that depression is well treated because it can affect both you and your baby's wellbeing. Depression and anxiety can sometimes get worse during pregnancy and after your baby is born.\n\n【9】Speak to your doctor, who will help you understand the risks and benefits so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby.\n\n【10】Breastfeeding\n-------------\n\n【11】Some antidepressants can be taken while breastfeeding if your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy.\n\n【12】Speak to your doctor, who will help you understand the risks and benefits so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby.\n\n【13】Children and young people\n-------------------------\n\n【14】The use of antidepressants is not usually recommended in children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there is some evidence that, in rare cases, they can trigger thoughts about suicide and acts of self-harm in this age group.\n\n【15】Antidepressants are not recommended for the initial treatment of mild depression in children and young people.\n\n【16】For moderate to severe depression, antidepressants may be used if both the following apply:\n\n【17】*   the person being treated will also receive talking therapies in combination with antidepressants\n*   the treatment is supervised by a child and adolescent psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions in children)\n\n【18】Alcohol\n-------\n\n【19】You should be wary of drinking alcohol if you're taking antidepressants, as alcohol is itself a depressant and drinking alcohol can make your symptoms worse.\n\n【20】If you drink alcohol while taking types of antidepressants called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), you may become drowsy and dizzy.\n\n【21】You're less likely to experience unpleasant or unpredictable effects if you drink alcohol while taking an SSRI or a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant, but avoiding alcohol is often still recommended.\n\n【22】Illegal drugs\n-------------\n\n【23】The use of illegal drugs is not recommended if you're taking antidepressants, particularly if you've been prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). This is because they can cause unpredictable and unpleasant effects.\n\n【24】In particular, you should avoid taking:\n\n【25】*   cannabis – smoking cannabis while taking a TCA can make you feel very ill\n*   amphetamines (speed)\n*   cocaine\n*   heroin\n*   ketamine\n\n【26】As with alcohol, illegal drugs can make symptoms of depression or other mental health conditions worse.\n\n【27】Other antidepressants\n---------------------\n\n【28】You should only take 2 different types of antidepressants, such as an SSRI and a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), if a doctor advises you to. This is because taking certain combinations of antidepressants can make you feel very ill and can be life-threatening.\n\n【29】If a decision is taken to switch you from a particular type to another, the dosage of the first antidepressant will usually be gradually reduced before the second is started.\n\n【30】St John's wort\n--------------\n\n【31】St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression.\n\n【32】While there's evidence of its effectiveness, many experts advise against its use, because the amount of active ingredient varies among individual brands and batches, making the effects unpredictable.\n\n【33】Taking St John's wort with other medicines, such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants and the contraceptive pill, can also cause serious health problems.\n\n【34】You shouldn't take St John's wort if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, as it's unclear whether it's safe.\n\n【35】Driving and operating machinery\n-------------------------------\n\n【36】Some antidepressants can cause dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them.\n\n【37】If you do experience these problems, you should not drive or use tools and machinery.\n\n【38】Cautions for specific antidepressants\n-------------------------------------\n\n【39】### SSRIs\n\n【40】SSRIs may not be suitable if you have:\n\n【41】*   bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period where you're extremely excitable), although they can be useful for depressive phases\n*   a bleeding disorder\n*   type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes\n*   epilepsy – SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and the medicine should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse\n*   kidney disease\n\n【42】### SNRIs\n\n【43】SNRIs may not be suitable if you have a history of heart disease or you have poorly controlled high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\n【44】### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n\n【45】TCAs may not be suitable if you have:\n\n【46】*   a history of heart disease\n*   recently had a heart attack\n*   liver disease\n*   an inherited blood disorder called porphyria\n*   bipolar disorder\n*   schizophrenia\n*   a growth on your adrenal glands that is causing high blood pressure (pheochromocytoma)\n*   an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostate enlargement)\n*   glaucoma – increased pressure in the eye\n*   epilepsy\n删除11：<u>More in Antidepressants\n-----------------------\n\n【47】*   Overview - Antidepressants\n*   Uses - Antidepressants\n*   Cautions - Antidepressants\n*   Dosage - Antidepressants\n*   Side effects - Antidepressants\n*   Alternatives - Antidepressants\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 November 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:40", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:46:12", "cost": 31.453}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:46:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:39"}

Some experts believe ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune condition (when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue).\n\n【5】The immune system normally fights off infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood to destroy the cause of the infection.\n\n【6】This results in swelling and redness (inflammation) of body tissue in the infected area.\n\n【7】In ulcerative colitis, a theory is that the immune system mistakes \"friendly bacteria\" in the colon, which aid digestion, as a harmful infection, leading to the colon and rectum becoming inflamed.\n\n【8】Alternatively, some researchers believe a viral or bacterial infection triggers the immune system, but for some reason it does not \"turn off\" once the infection has passed and continues to cause inflammation.\n\n【9】It's also been suggested that no infection is involved and the immune system may just malfunction, or that there's an imbalance between good and bad bacteria within the bowel.\n\n【10】Genetics\n--------\n\n【11】It also seems inherited genes may be a factor in the development of ulcerative colitis.\n\n【12】You may be more likely to have ulcerative colitis if you have a close relative with the condition.\n\n【13】Researchers have identified several genes that seem to make people more likely to develop ulcerative colitis.\n\n【14】It's believed many of these genes play a role in the immune system.\n\n【15】Environmental factors\n---------------------\n\n【16】Where and how you live also seems to affect your chances of developing ulcerative colitis, which suggests environmental factors are important.\n\n【17】For example, the condition is more common in urban areas of northern parts of western Europe and America.\n\n【18】Various environmental factors that may be linked to ulcerative colitis have been studied, including air pollution, medicine and certain diets.\n\n【19】Although no factors have so far been identified, countries with improved sanitation seem to have a higher population of people with the condition.\n\n【20】This suggests that reduced exposure to bacteria may be an important factor.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 01 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 01 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Ulcerative colitis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:51", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:55", "cost": 3.904}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:51"}

It means the body can't process certain amino acids (\"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine.**\n\n【2】Normally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body.\n\n【3】Babies with GA1 are unable to break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan.\n\n【4】Normally, these amino acids are broken down into a substance called glutaric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with GA1 don't have the enzyme that breaks down glutaric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this and other substances in the body.\n\n【5】Diagnosing GA1\n--------------\n\n【6】At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.\n\n【7】If GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications.\n\n【8】With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life.\n\n【9】Without treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing.\n\n【10】Symptoms of GA1\n---------------\n\n【11】Symptoms of GA1 usually don't appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly).\n\n【12】Children with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there's a risk of developing bleeding around their brain (subdural haematoma). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage).\n\n【13】Metabolic crisis\n----------------\n\n【14】Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include:\n\n【15】*   poor feeding or loss of appetite\n*   lack of energy\n*   abnormal movements\n*   vomiting\n*   irritability\n*   breathing difficulties\n\n【16】It's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs.\n\n【17】In some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing.\n\n【18】Treating GA1\n------------\n\n【19】### Diet\n\n【20】Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan.\n\n【21】High-protein foods need to be limited, including:\n\n【22】*   meat\n*   fish\n*   cheese\n*   eggs\n*   pulses\n*   nuts\n\n【23】Your dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.\n\n【24】Breastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.\n\n【25】People with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.\n\n【26】### Medication\n\n【27】Your child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid.\n\n【28】L-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor.\n\n【29】### Emergency treatment\n\n【30】If your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill.\n\n【31】Your dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal.\n\n【32】Your dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill.\n\n【33】Contact the metabolic team at the hospital when your baby becomes unwell, and let them know you have started the emergency diet.\n\n【34】If your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, has a high temperature that does not go down, or their symptoms are getting worse, take your baby straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department.\n\n【35】You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen GA1 before.\n\n【36】Once in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein).\n\n【37】You should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties.\n\n【38】How GA1 is inherited\n--------------------\n\n【39】The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.\n\n【40】The way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the affected gene to develop the condition – 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. If the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of GA1.\n\n【41】If you're a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:\n\n【42】*   a 25% chance of developing the condition\n*   a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1\n*   a 25% chance of receiving a pair of unaffected genes\n\n【43】Although it's not possible to prevent GA1, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition. Any further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.\n\n【44】You may also wish to consider genetic counselling for support, information and advice about genetic conditions.\n\n【45】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【46】If you or your child has GA1, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【47】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the NCARDRS on GOV.UK</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:24:38", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:24:48", "cost": 10.676}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:24:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:24:38"}

Other beta blocker eye drops include betaxolol and levobunolol which may be used instead of timolol.\n\n【8】There are other eye drops which work in different ways to timolol eye drops but can also be used to lower the pressure in your eye. They include:\n\n【9】*   prostaglandin analogues – for example, latanoprost and bimatoprost\n*   carbonic anhydrase inhibitors – for example brinzolamide and dorzolamide\n*   sympathomimetics – for e click angina xample brimonidine and apraclonidine\n*   miotics – for example pilocarpine\n\n【10】Sometimes you might have to try other eye drops if you get side effects with timolol.\n\n【11】Many people need to use a combination of different eye drops to reduce the pressure in the eye.\n\n【12】Can timolol eye drops make heart problems worse?\n\n【13】If you have an existing heart condition, there are no reports of timolol making it worse.\n\n【14】But in rare cases, side effects of timolol can include chest pain (angina) or an irregular heart rate (palpitations).\n\n【15】These side effects are unlikely to happen with timolol eye drops.

These are sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain that temporarily affect how it works.**\n\n【3】Seizures can affect people in different ways, depending on which part of the brain is involved.\n\n【4】Some seizures cause the body to jerk and shake (a \"fit\"), while others cause problems like loss of awareness or unusual sensations. They typically pass in a few seconds or minutes.\n\n【5】Seizures can occur when you're awake or asleep. Sometimes they can be triggered by something, such as feeling very tired.\n\n【6】Read about what to do if someone has a seizure\n\n【7】Types of seizures\n-----------------\n\n【8】### Simple partial (focal) seizures or 'auras'\n\n【9】A simple partial seizure can cause:\n\n【10】*   a general strange feeling that's hard to describe\n*   a \"rising\" feeling in your tummy – like the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride\n*   a feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu)\n*   unusual smells or tastes\n*   tingling in your arms and legs\n*   an intense feeling of fear or joy\n*   stiffness or twitching in part of your body, such as an arm or hand\n\n【11】You remain awake and aware while this happens.\n\n【12】These seizures are sometimes known as \"warnings\" or \"auras\" because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is about to happen.\n\n【13】### Complex partial (focal) seizures\n\n【14】During a complex partial seizure, you lose your sense of awareness and make random body movements, such as:\n\n【15】*   smacking your lips\n*   rubbing your hands\n*   making random noises\n*   moving your arms around\n*   picking at clothes or fiddling with objects\n*   chewing or swallowing\n\n【16】You will not be able to respond to anyone else during the seizure and you will not have any memory of it.\n\n【17】### Tonic-clonic seizures\n\n【18】A tonic-clonic seizure, previously known as a \"grand mal\", is what most people think of as a typical epileptic fit.\n\n【19】They happen in 2 stages – an initial \"tonic\" stage, shortly followed by a second \"clonic\" stage:\n\n【20】1.  **tonic stage** – you lose consciousness, your body goes stiff, and you may fall to the floor\n2.  **clonic stage** – your limbs jerk about, you may lose control of your bladder or bowel, you may bite your tongue or the inside of your cheek, and you might have difficulty breathing\n\n【21】The seizure normally stops after a few minutes, but some last longer. Afterwards, you may have a headache or difficulty remembering what happened and feel tired or confused.\n\n【22】### Absences\n\n【23】An absence seizure, which used to be called a \"petit mal\", is where you lose awareness of your surroundings for a short time. They mainly affect children, but can happen at any age.\n\n【24】During an absence seizure, a person may:\n\n【25】*   stare blankly into space\n*   look like they're \"daydreaming\"\n*   flutter their eyes\n*   make slight jerking movements of their body or limbs\n\n【26】The seizures usually only last up to 15 seconds and you will not be able to remember them. They can happen several times a day.\n\n【27】### Myoclonic seizures\n\n【28】A myoclonic seizure is where some or all of your body suddenly twitches or jerks, like you've had an electric shock. They often happen soon after waking up.\n\n【29】Myoclonic seizures usually only last a fraction of a second, but several can sometimes occur in a short space of time. You normally remain awake during them.\n\n【30】### Clonic seizures\n\n【31】Clonic seizures cause the body to shake and jerk like a tonic-clonic seizure, but you do not go stiff at the start.\n\n【32】They typically last a few minutes and you might lose consciousness.\n\n【33】### Tonic seizures\n\n【34】Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff, like the first stage of a tonic-clonic seizure.\n\n【35】This might mean you lose balance and fall over.\n\n【36】### Atonic seizures\n\n【37】Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly relax, so you may fall to the ground.\n\n【38】They tend to be very brief and you'll usually be able to get up again straight away.\n\n【39】### Status epilepticus\n\n【40】Status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts a long time, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between.\n\n【41】It's a medical emergency and needs to be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【42】You can be trained to treat it if you look after someone with epilepsy. If you have not had any training, call 999 for an ambulance immediately if someone has a seizure that has not stopped after 5 minutes.\n\n【43】Seizure triggers\n----------------\n\n【44】For many people with epilepsy, seizures seem to happen randomly.\n\n【45】But sometimes they can have a trigger, such as:\n\n【46】*   stress\n*   a lack of sleep\n*   waking up\n*   drinking alcohol\n*   some medicines and illegal drugs\n*   in women, monthly periods\n*   flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger)\n\n【47】Keeping a diary of when you have seizures and what happened before them can help you identify and avoid some possible triggers.\n\n【48】Read more advice about living with epilepsy.\n删除6：<u>**Want to know more?**\n\n【49】*   Epilepsy Action: common seizure triggers\n*   Epilepsy Action: epileptic seizures explained\n*   Epilepsy Society: epileptic seizures\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 September 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 September 2023</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Epilepsy</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:01", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:51", "cost": 50.487}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:01"}

However, the more partners you have, the greater the risk of catching an infection.\n\n【3】STIs commonly caught through oral sex are:\n\n【4】*   gonorrhoea\n*   genital herpes\n*   syphilis\n*   human papillomavirus (HPV)\n\n【5】Infections less frequently passed on through oral sex include:\n\n【6】*   chlamydia\n*   HIV\n*   hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C\n*   genital warts\n*   pubic lice\n\n【7】Symptoms of STIs\n----------------\n\n【8】The symptoms of an STI vary depending on the type of infection. However, most STIs are treatable if detected early enough.\n\n【9】If you think you may have an infection, or if you have had unprotected sex, it's important to visit your GP or local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic as soon as possible.\n\n【10】If left untreated, STIs not only are uncomfortable and embarrassing but also can seriously affect your health and fertility.\n\n【11】Preventing STIs\n---------------\n\n【12】You can reduce the risk of STI transmission during oral sex by making sure you or your partner wears a condom.\n\n【13】You can use a dental dam to cover the anus or female genitals during oral sex.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Mastocytosis is a rare condition caused by an excess number of mast cells gathering in the body's tissues.**\n\n【3】There are 2 main types of mastocytosis:\n\n【4】*   **cutaneous mastocytosis, which mainly affects children** – where mast cells gather in the skin, but are not found in large numbers elsewhere in the body\n*   **systemic mastocytosis, which mainly affects adults** – where mast cells gather in body tissues, such as the skin, internal organs and bones\n\n【5】There are also several subtypes of systemic mastocytosis, depending on the symptoms.\n\n【6】Mast cells\n----------\n\n【7】Mast cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue found in the hollow centres of some bones, and live longer than normal cells. They're an important part of the immune system and help fight infection.\n\n【8】When mast cells detect a substance that triggers an allergic reaction (an allergen), they release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream.\n\n【9】Histamine makes the blood vessels expand and the surrounding skin itchy and swollen. It can also create a build-up of mucus in the airways, which become narrower.\n\n【10】Symptoms of mastocytosis\n------------------------\n\n【11】The symptoms of mastocytosis can vary depending on the type.\n\n【12】### Cutaneous mastocytosis\n\n【13】The most common symptom of cutaneous mastocytosis is abnormal growths (lesions) on the skin, such as bumps and spots, which can form on the body and sometimes blister.\n\n【14】### Systemic mastocytosis\n\n【15】Some people with systemic mastocytosis may experience episodes of severe symptoms, often with specific triggers such as physical exertion or stress. Many people do not have any problems.\n\n【16】During an episode you may have:\n\n【17】*   skin reactions – such as itching and flushing\n*   gut symptoms – such as diarrhoea and vomiting\n*   muscle and joint pain\n*   mood changes, headaches and tiredness (fatigue)\n\n【18】There are 3 main subtypes of systemic mastocytosis. They are:\n\n【19】*   **indolent systemic mastocytosis** – symptoms are usually mild to moderate and vary from person to person; indolent systemic mastocytosis accounts for around 90% of adult systemic mastocytosis cases\n*   **aggressive mastocytosis** – where mast cells multiply in organs, such as the spleen, liver and digestive system; the symptoms are more wide-ranging and severe, although skin lesions are less common\n*   **systemic mastocytosis with associated blood (haematological) disease** – where a condition that affects the blood cells, such as chronic leukaemia, also develops\n\n【20】### Severe allergic reaction\n\n【21】People with mastocytosis have an increased risk of developing a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. This is known as anaphylaxis.\n\n【22】The increased risk of anaphylaxis is caused by the abnormally high number of mast cells and their potential to release large amounts of histamine into the blood.\n\n【23】If you or your child has mastocytosis, you may need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector, which can be used to treat the symptoms of anaphylaxis. \n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of mastocytosis.</u>\n\n【24】Causes of mastocytosis\n----------------------\n\n【25】The cause or causes of mastocytosis are not fully known, but there's thought to be an association with a change in genes known as the KIT mutation.\n\n【26】The KIT mutation makes the mast cells more sensitive to the effects of a signalling protein called stem cell factor (SCF).\n\n【27】SCF plays an important role in stimulating the production and survival of certain cells, such as blood cells and mast cells, inside the bone marrow.  \n\n【28】In very few cases of mastocytosis it appears the KIT mutation is passed down through families. However, in most cases the mutation happens for no apparent reason.\n\n【29】Diagnosing mastocytosis\n-----------------------\n\n【30】A physical examination of the skin is the first stage in diagnosing cutaneous mastocytosis.\n\n【31】Your GP or skin specialist (dermatologist) may rub the affected areas of skin to see if they become red, inflamed and itchy. This is known as Darier's sign.\n\n【32】It's usually possible to confirm a diagnosis by carrying out a biopsy, where a small skin sample is taken and checked for mast cells.\n\n【33】The following tests are commonly used to look for systemic mastocytosis:\n\n【34】*   blood tests – including a full blood count (FBC) and measuring blood tryptase levels\n*   an ultrasound scan to look for enlargement of the liver and spleen if it seems likely\n*   a DEXA scan to measure bone density\n*   a bone marrow biopsy test – where a local anaesthetic is used and a long needle is inserted through the skin into the bone underneath, usually in the pelvis\n\n【35】A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy.\n\n【36】Treating mastocytosis\n---------------------\n\n【37】There's no cure for mastocytosis, so the aim of treatment is to try to relieve the symptoms.\n\n【38】Treatment options will depend on the type of mastocytosis and the severity of the symptoms.\n\n【39】Mild to moderate cases of cutaneous mastocytosis can be treated with steroid cream (topical corticosteroids) for a short time.\n\n【40】Steroid cream reduces the number of mast cells that can release histamine and trigger swelling (inflammation) in the skin.\n\n【41】Antihistamines can also be used to treat the symptoms of cutaneous or indolent mastocytosis, such as red skin and itchiness.\n\n【42】Antihistamines are a type of medicine that block the effects of histamine and are often used to treat allergic conditions.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating mastocytosis.</u>\n\n【43】Complications of mastocytosis\n-----------------------------\n\n【44】In children, the symptoms of cutaneous mastocytosis usually improve over time, but remain stable in adults.\n\n【45】In many cases the condition gets better on its own by the time a child has reached puberty.\n\n【46】The outlook for systemic mastocytosis can vary, depending on the type you have.\n\n【47】Indolent systemic mastocytosis should not affect life expectancy, but other types can. \n\n【48】A few people develop a serious blood condition, such as chronic leukaemia, over their lifetime.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 30 December 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 30 December 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:27", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:34", "cost": 7.047}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:27"}

Cautions with other medicines\n8.  Common questions about levothyroxine</u>\n\n【2】1\\. About levothyroxine\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Levothyroxine is a medicine used to treat an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\n\n【4】The thyroid gland makes thyroid hormones which help to control energy levels and growth. Levothyroxine is taken to replace the missing thyroid hormone thyroxine.\n\n【5】Levothyroxine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【6】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【7】*   Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of a hormone called thyroxine. It replaces thyroxine if your thyroid gland cannot produce it and prevents the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n*   Levothyroxine starts working straight away, but it may be several weeks before your symptoms start to improve.\n*   The most common side effects of levothyroxine are caused by taking a bigger dose than you need. Your doctor can lower your dose to help reduce any side effects.\n*   Before you start taking levothyroxine, your doctor will do a blood test. Once you start taking the medicine you'll have regular blood tests to see how well it's working.\n*   Levothyroxine doses need to be carefully monitored during pregnancy. If you're planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant, it's important to talk to your doctor to get the right care for you and your baby.\n\n【8】3\\. Who can and cannot take levothyroxine\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【9】Levothyroxine can be taken by most adults and children. However, it’s not suitable for some people.\n\n【10】Check with your doctor before taking levothyroxine if you:\n\n【11】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to levothyroxine or any other medicine\n*   you have an overactive thyroid that produces too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)\n*   have a health problem that affects your adrenal glands (your doctor will be able to tell you if you're not sure)\n*   have a heart problem including angina, heart disease or heart failure\n*   have high blood pressure\n*   have ever had a heart attack\n*   have diabetes – the dose of your diabetes medicine may need to change because levothyroxine can raise blood sugar levels\n\n【12】4\\. How and when to take levothyroxine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【13】Take levothyroxine once a day in the morning, ideally at least 30 minutes before having breakfast or a drink containing caffeine, like tea or coffee.\n\n【14】Food and caffeinated drinks can both stop your body taking in levothyroxine properly so it does not work as well.\n\n【15】If you stop taking levothyroxine, your symptoms are likely to come back.\n\n【16】### Dosage and strength\n\n【17】The dose of levothyroxine varies from person to person.\n\n【18】You may need to take several different tablets to make up your dose. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take each day.\n\n【19】Levothyroxine comes in 12.5 microgram, 25 microgram, 50 microgram, 75 microgram and 100 microgram tablets.\n\n【20】If you're taking levothyroxine as a liquid, 5ml can have 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 125micrograms in it.\n\n【21】Although starting doses are usually the same, the dose of levothyroxine you end up taking, or how quickly the dose is increased, depends on your symptoms, hormone levels, age and whether you have any other health problems.\n\n【22】Adults usually start with a dose between 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms taken once a day. This may be increased gradually over a few weeks to between 100 micrograms and 200 micrograms taken once a day.\n\n【23】Some people, such as over-50s or people with heart disease, may start on a lower dose.\n\n【24】### How to take levothyroxine\n\n【25】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.\n\n【26】Levothyroxine is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets. It’s available in different strengths.\n\n【27】If you or your child are taking levothyroxine as a liquid, it will usually come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose.\n\n【28】If you do not have a syringe or measuring spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.\n\n【29】### If you forget to take it\n\n【30】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. In this case just skip the forgotten dose and take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【31】Do not take 2 doses together to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【32】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【33】### If you take too much\n\n【34】Taking more than your prescribed dose of levothyroxine can give you symptoms such as a racing heartbeat (palpitations).\n\n【35】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【36】*   you take more than 1 extra dose of levothyroxine\n\n【37】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【38】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 if:\n\n【39】*   you get chest pains – these may not happen immediately, it can be several days before they begin\n\n【40】### Having regular blood tests\n\n【41】Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check the levels of thyroid hormones in your body before and after starting levothyroxine.\n\n【42】These will allow your doctor to adjust the dose to suit you.\n\n【43】At the start of treatment you can expect to have blood tests quite often but once your hormone levels are stable and your symptoms are under control, your levels will usually be checked once a year.\n\n【44】You may need blood tests more often if you:\n\n【45】*   are pregnant\n*   start or stop a medicine that can affect the way levothyroxine works\n*   have any symptoms that could mean your dose is not quite right\n\n【46】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【47】Like all medicines, levothyroxine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Once you are on the right dose of levothyroxine, side effects should go away.\n\n【48】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have switched to a different brand of levothyroxine and start to get:\n\n【49】*   symptoms of an underactive thyroid including feeling tired, weight gain or feeling depressed\n*   symptoms of an overactive thyroid (similar to the common side effects below)\n\n【50】You may be sensitive to the new brand of levothyroxine you have been prescribed and may need to stay on the one you were taking before.\n\n【51】### Common side effects\n\n【52】The common side effects of levothyroxine usually happen because the dose you're taking is more than you need. These side effects usually go away after you go on to a lower dose of levothyroxine or stop treatment.\n\n【53】Common side effects are the same as the symptoms of an overactive thyroid. There are things you can do to help cope with them.\n\n【54】Feeling sick (nausea)\n\n【55】Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food.\n\n【56】Being sick (vomiting)\n\n【57】If you're being sick try to take small, frequent sips of fluids, such as water or squash, to prevent dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. If you are vomiting due to a stomach bug or illness, tell your doctor. Do not take any other medicines to treat vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【58】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【59】Diarrhoea\n\n【60】Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. If you get severe diarrhoea from a stomach bug or illness, tell your doctor. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【61】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for over 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【62】Headaches\n\n【63】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【64】Feeling restless or excitable, or problems sleeping\n\n【65】These symptoms should improve as your body gets used to levothyroxine. If it does not go away, or if it's causing you problems, contact your doctor.\n\n【66】Flushing or sweating\n\n【67】Try cutting down on coffee, tea and alcohol. It might help to keep the room cool and use a fan. You could also spray your face with cool water or sip cold or iced drinks. If it does not go away, contact your doctor as they may need to review your dose .\n\n【68】Muscle cramps\n\n【69】If you get unusual muscle aches, which is not from exercise or hard work, talk to your doctor. You may need a blood test to find the cause.\n\n【70】Shaking, usually of the hands\n\n【71】Talk to your doctor as you may need to have your dose reduced.\n\n【72】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away.\n\n【73】### Serious side effects\n\n【74】It happens rarely, but some people may have serious side effects when taking levothyroxine.\n\n【75】Tell your doctor or call 111 now if:\n\n【76】*   you get fast or irregular heartbeats (palpitations)\n\n【77】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【78】*   you get chest pain\n\n【79】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【80】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【81】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to levothyroxine.\n\n【82】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【83】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【84】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【85】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【86】These are not all the side effects of levothyroxine. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【87】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n删除12：<u>Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u></u>\n\n【88】6\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【89】### Levothyroxine and pregnancy\n\n【90】Levothyroxine is safe to take in pregnancy.\n\n【91】It's important to carry on taking levothyroxine throughout your pregnancy. Having too low or too high levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby.\n\n【92】You'll need to have regular blood tests during pregnancy to make sure you're on the right dose of levothyroxine. Your doctor may need to increase your dose of levothyroxine while you’re pregnant.\n\n【93】### Levothyroxine and breastfeeding\n\n【94】It's OK to breastfeed while you're on levothyroxine. Thyroid hormones are a normal part of breast milk. When taken as a supplement they only pass into breast milk in tiny amounts that are too small to affect your baby.\n\n【95】If you're breastfeeding, it's important that you continue to take levothyroxine, as this is replacing what your body would normally be making. Your body needs good levels of thyroid hormones to make enough breast milk for your baby.\n\n【96】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your midwife, health visitor, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【97】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【98】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【99】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【100】Some medicines can affect thyroid hormones, so the dose of levothyroxine may need to be changed. They include:\n\n【101】*   epilepsy medicines like carbamazepine and phenytoin\n*   rifampicin\n*   amiodarone\n*   oestrogens – such as in combined contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\n【102】Levothyroxine can affect how other medicines work, so their doses may need to be changed. These medicines include:\n\n【103】*   medicines for diabetes – either insulin or tablets\n*   warfarin, used to prevent blood blots\n\n【104】Some medicines should not be taken at the same time of day as levothyroxine as they can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in, including:\n\n【105】*   antacids\n*   calcium salts\n*   iron salts\n*   orlistat, a medicine used for weight loss\n*   sucralfate, a medicine used to treat stomach ulcers\n*   some cholesterol-lowering medicines such as colestyramine, colestipol or colesevelem\n删除7：<u>Find out more from the information leaflets that come with the medicines. Or get your pharmacist's advice on how much time to leave between taking these medicines and taking levothyroxine.</u>\n\n【106】### Mixing levothyroxine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【107】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with levothyroxine.\n\n【108】However, biotin supplements can affect the accuracy of thyroid function tests. Do not take biotin without talking to your doctor.\n\n【109】Kelp (a type of seaweed) can contain high levels of iodine, which sometimes makes an underactive thyroid worse. Do not take supplements containing kelp if you're taking levothyroxine.\n\n【110】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【111】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【112】8\\. Common questions about levothyroxine\n----------------------------------------\n\n【113】How does levothyroxine work?\n\n【114】The thyroid gland in your neck makes a hormone called thyroxine. Thyroxine controls how much energy your body uses (the metabolic rate). It's also involved in digestion, how your heart and muscles work, brain development and bone health.\n\n【115】When the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroxine (called hypothyroidism), many of the body's functions slow down. Some of the most common symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland are:\n\n【116】*   tiredness\n*   feeling cold\n*   difficulty concentrating\n*   weight gain\n*   feeling depressed\n\n【117】Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of thyroxine. You take levothyroxine tablets to replace the thyroxine that your thyroid gland cannot produce and prevent the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n\n【118】How long does levothyroxine take to work?\n\n【119】Levothyroxine starts working straight away, but it may be several weeks before your symptoms start to improve and you feel any different.\n\n【120】How long will I take levothyroxine for?\n\n【121】Treatment with levothyroxine is usually lifelong. If you stop taking levothyroxine your symptoms are likely to come back.\n\n【122】Are there any long term side effects?\n\n【123】Yes, it's safe to take levothyroxine for a long time, even many years. However, high doses of levothyroxine over a long time can sometimes cause weakening of the bones (osteoporosis).\n\n【124】This should not happen if you are on the right dose. It's important to have regular blood tests to make sure your dose is not too high.\n\n【125】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【126】There's no evidence to suggest that taking levothyroxine reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【127】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant as they may want to review your treatment.\n\n【128】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【129】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking levothyroxine. Alcohol does not affect how this medicine works.\n\n【130】However, if you have side effects such as headaches, flushing or sweating with levothyroxine, alcohol may make these worse.\n\n【131】Will it make me lose weight?\n\n【132】One of the symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland is weight gain. So, once you start taking levothyroxine, you may lose weight as your body's hormones rebalance. Losing weight can also be a sign that your dose of levothyroxine is too high.\n\n【133】Once your thyroid hormone levels have returned to normal, your tendency to gain or lose weight is the same as for people who do not have thyroid problems.\n\n【134】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【135】Yes, levothyroxine does not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【136】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【137】There are some foods and drinks that do not mix well with levothyroxine:\n\n【138】*   **drinks containing caffeine**, like coffee, tea and some fizzy drinks, can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in. Leave at least 30 minutes after taking levothyroxine before you drink them.\n*   **calcium-rich foods**, such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and broccoli, can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in. Leave at least 4 hours between taking levothyroxine and eating calcium-rich foods.\n*   **soya in food and supplements** may stop levothyroxine working properly. If you regularly eat soya or take soya supplements your doctor might need to do extra blood tests to make sure you're getting enough levothyroxine.\n*   **kelp (a type of seaweed)** can contain high levels of iodine, which sometimes makes an underactive thyroid worse. Do not take supplements containing kelp if you're taking levothyroxine.\n\n【139】Can I get thyroid medicines for free?\n\n【140】If you have an underactive thyroid, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your levothyroxine). To claim your free prescriptions you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【141】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【142】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【143】Levothyroxine does not affect any types of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【144】However, the combined pill contains oestrogen which can reduce the amount of levothyroxine in your body.\n\n【145】Speak to your doctor if you start or stop taking the Pill as your dose of levothyroxine may need to change.\n\n【146】If levothyroxine makes you sick (vomit) or you have severe diarrhoea for over 24 hours while you’re taking levothyroxine, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【147】If this happens, follow the instructions in the leaflet that comes with your contraceptive pills.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or you have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【148】Will I lose my hair?\n\n【149】It's having an underactive thyroid that causes hair loss – not treatment with levothyroxine.\n\n【150】Because the natural hair growth cycle takes several months, hair loss related to thyroid disease might only be seen months after the condition has begun. If treatment with levothyroxine has already started, it may seem like the medicine – rather than the underlying illness – is causing the hair loss.\n\n【151】Hair usually regrows after treatment with levothyroxine, but it may take many months.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【152】*   Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【153】*   British Thyroid Foundation: charity\n*   Thyroid UK: charity\n*   You and your hormones: medical information\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:38:23", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:38:38", "cost": 15.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:38:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:38:23"}

It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance.\n\n【6】These may be:\n\n【7】*   what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible – including whether you might need care at home or in a nursing home\n*   whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in\n*   whether you need any financial assistance\n删除7：<u>Read more about care plans.</u>\n\n【8】Medicine\n--------\n\n【9】Medicines cannot stop frontotemporal dementia getting worse, but it can help reduce some of the symptoms for some people.\n\n【10】The following medicines may help:\n\n【11】*   antidepressants – antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may help control the loss of inhibitions, overeating and compulsive behaviours seen in some people\n*   antipsychotics – these are rarely used, but are sometimes needed if SSRIs have not worked, as they can help control severely challenging behaviour that's putting the person with dementia or others around them at risk of harm\n\n【12】Support and other therapies\n---------------------------\n\n【13】In addition to medicines, there are a number of therapies and practical measures that can help make everyday living easier for someone with dementia.\n\n【14】These include:\n\n【15】*   occupational therapy – to identify problem areas in everyday life, such as getting dressed, and help work out practical solutions\n*   speech and language therapy – to help improve any communication or swallowing problems\n*   physiotherapy – to help with movement difficulties\n*   relaxation techniques – such as massage, and music or dance therapy\n*   social interaction, leisure activities and other dementia activities – such as memory cafes, which are drop-in sessions for people with memory problems and their carers to get support and advice\n*   **s**trategies for challenging behaviour – such as distraction techniques, a structured daily routine, and activities like doing puzzles or listening to music\n*   incontinence products if needed\n\n【16】It may also be helpful to get in touch with a support group, such as Rare Dementia Support, the Alzheimer's Society or Dementia UK.\n删除7：<u>Read more about living well with dementia.</u>\n\n【17】End of life and legal issues\n----------------------------\n\n【18】If you've been diagnosed with dementia, you might want to make arrangements for your care that take into account the decline in your mental abilities.\n\n【19】This may include ensuring your wishes are upheld if you're not able to make decisions for yourself.\n\n【20】You may want to consider:\n\n【21】*   drawing up an advance decision – this makes your treatment preferences known in case you're unable to do this in the future\n*   having a plan for where you want to receive treatment as your condition becomes more advanced\n*   giving a relative lasting power of attorney – this is the power to make decisions about you if you're unable to\n删除7：<u>Read more about managing legal affairs for someone with dementia and end of life planning.</u>\n\n【22】Help and advice for carers\n--------------------------\n\n【23】If you care for someone with dementia, you may find it helpful to read more about:\n\n【24】*   Looking after someone with dementia\n*   Respite care – this can allow you to take breaks from caring\n*   Benefits for carers – such as allowances and tax credits that may be available\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 29 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 29 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:56:23", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:56:34", "cost": 11.704}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:51", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:56:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:56:23"}

Contact your GP or the transplant centre for advice if you're struggling to cope emotionally with the demands of waiting for a transplant.\n\n【16】You may also find it useful to contact a support group, such as the British Heart Foundation or Little Hearts Matter, a charity for children with heart defects.\n\n【17】Getting the call\n----------------\n\n【18】When a suitable donor heart is found, the transplant centre will contact you and ask you to go to the centre.\n\n【19】When you hear from the transplant centre:\n\n【20】*   do not eat or drink anything\n*   take all current medicines with you\n*   take a bag of clothes and essentials for your hospital stay\n\n【21】At the transplant centre, you'll be reassessed quickly to make sure no new medical conditions have developed.\n\n【22】When the medical team has confirmed that you and the donor heart are suitable, you'll be given a general anaesthetic.\n\n【23】The procedure must be carried out as quickly as possible to have the best chance of success.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what happens during a heart transplant</u>\n\n【24】Transplant centres\n------------------\n\n【25】Heart transplants are carried out at a specialist heart transplant centre.\n\n【26】UK heart transplant centres are located in:\n\n【27】*   Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital in London\n*   Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge\n*   University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust\n*   Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester\n*   Freeman Hospital in Newcastle\n*   Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Glasgow\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Who can have one</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : What happens</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:13", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:38", "cost": 24.165}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:13"}

This usually wears off after a few weeks, but speak to your doctor if it bothers you. A lower dose may help reduce your symptoms.\n\n【4】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【5】These common side effects of sertraline happen in more than 1 in 100 people. There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【6】Feeling sick (nausea)\n\n【7】Try taking sertraline with or after food. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food.\n\n【8】Headaches\n\n【9】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. It's best not to drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should usually go away after the first week of taking sertraline. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【10】Being unable to sleep\n\n【11】Take sertraline first thing in the morning.\n\n【12】Feeling sleepy\n\n【13】Take sertraline in the evening and cut down the amount of alcohol you drink. Do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery if you're feeling sleepy. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n\n【14】Diarrhoea\n\n【15】Drink plenty of water or other fluids to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual and having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【16】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【17】Dry mouth\n\n【18】Chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n\n【19】Feeling dizzy\n\n【20】If sertraline makes you feel dizzy, stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better.\n\n【21】Feeling tired or weak\n\n【22】If sertraline makes you feel tired or weak, stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery if you're feeling tired.\n\n【23】It's best not to drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse. If these symptoms do not go away after 1 or 2 weeks, ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\n【24】Keep taking the medicine, but speak to a doctor or pharmacist if the advice on how to cope does not help and a side effect is still bothering you or does not go away.\n\n【25】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【26】It happens rarely (in less than 1 in 100 people), but some people may have serious side effects when taking sertraline.\n\n【27】Book an appointment with your doctor if you get:\n\n【28】*   changes in your periods, such as heavy bleeding, spotting or bleeding between periods\n*   weight gain or weight loss without trying\n\n【29】Call a doctor or call 111 now if:\n\n【30】*   you have feelings of overwhelming happiness (euphoria), excessive enthusiasm or excitement, or a feeling of restlessness that means you cannot sit or stand still\n*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, or your skin turns yellow (this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin) – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you cough up blood or have blood in your pee\n*   you have black or red poo or blood in your vomit – these can be signs of bleeding from the gut\n*   you are bleeding from the gums, or get bruises that appear without a reason or that get bigger\n\n【31】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if you:\n\n【32】*   get chest pain or pressure, or shortness of breath\n*   get headaches, have trouble focusing, have memory problems, cannot think clearly, have weakness, have a seizure or fit, or lose your balance – these can be signs of low sodium levels\n*   have thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life\n*   get severe dizziness or pass out\n*   get painful erections that last longer than 2 hours – this may happen even when you're not having sex\n*   get any heavy bleeding or bleeding that you cannot stop, such as cuts or nosebleeds that do not stop within 10 minutes\n\n【33】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【34】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to sertraline.\n\n【35】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【36】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【37】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【38】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【39】**Long-term side effects**\n--------------------------\n\n【40】A few people may get sexual side effects, such as problems getting an erection or a lower sex drive. In some cases these can continue even after stopping the medicine. Speak to your doctor if you are worried.\n\n【41】If you have diabetes, sertraline can affect your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may monitor you to check that you're on the right dose of diabetes medicine.\n\n【42】**Other side effects**\n----------------------\n\n【43】These are not all the side effects of sertraline.

Overview\n2.  When it's used\n3.  How it's performed\n4.  Recovery\n5.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Like all surgical procedures, lumbar decompression surgery carries some risk of complications.**\n\n【3】Recurrent or continuing symptoms\n--------------------------------\n\n【4】Lumbar decompression surgery is generally effective in relieving symptoms such as leg pain and numbness. However, some people continue to have symptoms after surgery, or develop symptoms again within a few years of surgery.\n\n【5】Recurrent symptoms can be caused by a weakened spine, another slipped disc, or the formation of new bone or thickened ligament that puts pressure on your spinal cord. Scarring around the nerves can also sometimes develop after surgery, which can cause similar symptoms to nerve compression.\n\n【6】Non-surgical treatments, such as physiotherapy, will usually be tried first if your symptoms recur, but further surgery may sometimes be needed. Repeat operations have a higher risk of complications than first-time operations.\n\n【7】Unfortunately, there's no effective treatment for scarring around the nerves. However, you can reduce your risk of scarring by doing regular exercises as advised by your physiotherapist after surgery.\n\n【8】Infection\n---------\n\n【9】One of the most common complications is an infection where the incision was made. It can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics. Infection can be more likely in patients who have diabetes or use steroids.\n\n【10】Blood clots\n-----------\n\n【11】There's a risk of developing a blood clot after lumbar decompression surgery, particularly in your leg. This is known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  \n\n【12】DVT can cause pain and swelling in your leg and, in rare cases, may lead to a serious problem called a pulmonary embolism. This is where a piece of the blood clot breaks off and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs.\n\n【13】The risk of developing a blood clot can be significantly reduced by staying active during your recovery or wearing compression stockings to help improve your blood flow.删除7：<u>Read more about preventing DVT.</u>\n\n【14】Dural tear\n----------\n\n【15】There's a risk of a dural tear occurring during all types of spinal surgery, including lumbar decompression surgery. The dura is a watertight sac of tissue that covers the spinal cord and spinal nerves.\n\n【16】If the tear isn't identified and repaired at the time of surgery, it can lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaking after the procedure.\n\n【17】Your surgeon will be aware of the risk of a dural tear, and if it does occur they will close the tear with stitches. In most cases, the repair is successful and no further problems or issues arise. However, further corrective surgery may be required in a small number of cases.\n\n【18】Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid\n------------------------------\n\n【19】During lumbar decompression surgery, there's a risk of accidental damage to the lining of the nerve, which can lead to the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \n\n【20】If this is discovered during the operation, it will be patched and repaired. However, small leaks can sometimes only become apparent after the operation, causing problems such as a headache and the wound to leak. Further surgery to repair this may be needed.\n\n【21】Facial sores and loss of vision\n-------------------------------\n\n【22】As you're positioned face down during lumbar decompression surgery, you'll be resting on your forehead and chin while the operation is carried out.\n\n【23】The anaesthetist will check regularly to make sure this isn't causing any problems, but many people will wake up with a slightly puffed up face. In some cases, a red sore can develop over the forehead or chin, which could last several days.\n\n【24】Nerve injury and paralysis\n--------------------------\n\n【25】Some patients who have lumbar decompression surgery will develop new numbness or weakness in one or both legs as a result of the operation.\n\n【26】Paralysis is an uncommon, but serious, complication that can occur as a result of lumbar decompression surgery.\n\n【27】Nerve injuries and paralysis can be caused by a number of different problems, including:\n\n【28】*   bleeding inside the spinal column (extradural spinal haematoma)\n*   leaking of spinal fluid (incidental durotomy)\n*   accidental damage to the blood vessels that supply the spinal cord with blood\n*   accidental damage to the nerves when they're moved during surgery\n\n【29】Death\n-----\n\n【30】As with all types of surgery, there's a risk of dying during or after lumbar decompression surgery, although this is rare. A blood clot, a bad reaction to the anaesthetic and blood loss can all be life-threatening.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 April 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:01", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:16", "cost": 14.137}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:01"}

Always read the instructions that come with your medicine.\n\n【6】It's important to use latanoprost every day for it to work properly.\n\n【7】How to use eye drops\n--------------------\n\n【8】It's best to use your eye drops in the evening as latanoprost works better then.\n\n【9】If you wear contact lenses, make sure you remove them before using your eye drops. Wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in.\n\n【10】1.  Wash your hands.\n2.  If you're using a bottle, remove the lid. If you're using the single-use dropper, twist off the tip.\n3.  Use your finger to gently pull down your lower eyelid and tilt your head back.\n4.  Make sure the tip of the dropper does not touch your eye, eyelashes, eyelid.\n5.  Hold the dropper over your eye, and squeeze the bottle or single dose dropper gently so one drop goes into your eye.\n6.  Release your lower eyelid and close your eye. Gently press your finger over the inside corner of your eye (over the eyelid) for about a minute. This helps keep the drops in your eye.\n7.  Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.\n8.  Repeat in your other eye if the doctor has told you to do this. There is enough liquid in 1 single-dose dropper to put a drop in both eyes if needed.\n9.  Put the cap back on the bottle or if you're using the single-dose dropper, throw it away.\n\n【11】If you use latanoprost with other eye drops wait at least 5 minutes before using the other eye drops. The second eye drops can wash the latanoprost out and it may not work as well.\n\n【12】### Expiry dates\n\n【13】Use the latanoprost eye drops within the expiry date on the bottle and within 4 weeks of opening. This will help to prevent the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working as they should.\n\n【14】Using your eye drops within their expiry dates is important to help reduce the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working as well as they should.\n\n【15】The single-dose droppers come in sachets. Once you open the packet, use the droppers within 10 days. Do not use the droppers after the expiry date.\n\n【16】You could write the date you opened the bottle or packet on the label or the box. This will help you know when you need to start using a new one.\n\n【17】How long to use it for\n----------------------\n\n【18】You'll usually use latanoprost for the rest of your life. However, if it does not work well enough, your doctor may recommend a different or additional treatment.\n\n【19】It's important to use your eye drops regularly and go for check-ups, to stop your eyesight getting worse.\n\n【20】If you stop using latanoprost, the pressure inside your eye may go up. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before stopping latanoprost.\n\n【21】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【22】If you forget to use your drops at the usual time, skip the missed dose and use your eyedrops as usual the next day.\n\n【23】Never use 2 doses at the same time. Never use an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【24】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.\n\n【25】If you use too much\n-------------------\n\n【26】Using too many drops can irritate your eye and make it water and turn red. If you get too much latanoprost in your eye, rinse it all out with water. Do not put any more drops in until it’s time for your next dose.\n\n【27】Any irritation, watering or redness should get better, but if you're worried about it ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【28】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【29】*   you swallow latanoprost and feel unwell\n\n【30】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111. Call 111 if you're asking about a child under the age of 5 years.\n\n【31】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【32】Take the medicine packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n删除11：<u>More in Latanoprost\n-------------------\n\n【33】*   About latanoprost\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using latanoprost with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:32", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:52:38", "cost": 5.727}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:52:32"}

Your doctor will take a quick look to rule out other conditions, like an infection.\n\n【17】It's unlikely they'll need to perform an internal examination of your vagina.\n\n【18】If your doctor thinks you have vaginismus, you may be referred to a specialist, such as a sex therapist.\n\n【19】Treatment for vaginismus\n------------------------\n\n【20】Treatment usually focuses on:\n\n【21】*   managing your feelings around penetration\n*   exercises to gradually get you used to penetration\n\n【22】Treatments for vaginismus\n\n| Possible treatment | What treatment covers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Psychosexual therapy | A type of talking therapy that aims to help you understand and change your feelings about your body and sex |\n| Relaxation techniques | Mindfulness, breathing and gentle touching exercises to help you learn to relax the vaginal muscles |\n| Pelvic floor exercises | Squeezing and releasing exercises to gain control of the vaginal muscles |\n| Sensate focus | Exercises to help with your relaxation during sex and increase your sex drive (libido) |\n| Vaginal trainers | Tampon-shaped objects in different sizes to help you gradually get used to having something put into your vagina |\n\n【24】Treatment is initially done under the guidance of specialised therapists.

Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Living with\n4.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**The main risk of using a urinary catheter is that it can sometimes allow bacteria to enter your body.**\n\n【3】This can cause an infection in the urethra, bladder or, less commonly, in the kidneys. These types of infection are known as urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\n【4】Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】UTIs caused by using a catheter are one of the most common types of infection that affect people staying in hospital. This risk is particularly high if your catheter is left in place continuously (an indwelling catheter).\n\n【6】Symptoms of a UTI associated with using a catheter include:\n\n【7】*   pain low down in your tummy or around your groin\n*   a high temperature\n*   feeling cold and shivery\n*   confusion\n\n【8】Contact your GP or community nurse if you think you have a UTI. You may need a course of antibiotics.\n\n【9】Other risks and side effects\n----------------------------\n\n【10】Bladder spasms, which feel like stomach cramps, are quite common when you have a catheter in your bladder. The pain is caused by the bladder trying to squeeze out the balloon. You may need medicine to reduce the frequency and intensity of the spasms.\n\n【11】Leakage around the catheter is another problem associated with indwelling catheters. This can happen as a result of bladder spasms or when you poo. Leakage can also be a sign that the catheter is blocked, so it's essential to check that it's draining.\n\n【12】Blood or debris in the catheter tube is also common with an indwelling catheter. This could become a problem if the catheter drainage system becomes blocked.\n\n【13】Get medical advice as soon as possible if you think your catheter may be blocked, or if you're passing large pieces of debris or blood clots.\n\n【14】Other (less common) potential problems include:\n\n【15】*   injury to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) when the catheter is inserted\n*   narrowing of the urethra because of scar tissue caused by repeated catheter use\n*   injury to the bladder caused by incorrectly inserting the catheter\n*   bladder stones (although these usually only develop after years of using a catheter)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:13:33", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:13:44", "cost": 11.119}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:13:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:13:32"}

However, do not regularly use super-size tampons to prevent sudden leaks if you have stress incontinence.\n\n【13】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend using tampons for the routine management of urinary incontinence in women.\n\n【14】However, tampons can be used occasionally, when necessary, to prevent leaks. For example, during exercise.\n\n【15】Appliances and bedding\n----------------------\n\n【16】Other useful incontinence products for more severe leaks include urinals (devices that collect urine), or sheaths and drainage systems (if you have a penis).\n\n【17】A variety of incontinence bedding is also available, such as washable bed pads that sit on top of the mattress and soak up any overnight leaks. The pads stay dry to the touch and they can be useful for trips away from home.\n\n【18】Can I get incontinence products on the NHS?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【19】You may be able to get incontinence products on the NHS depending on your local integrated care board (ICB). Ask your GP for details of your local continence service. To qualify for NHS products you may need to be assessed by a healthcare professional.\n\n【20】Where to buy incontinence products\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】The charity Bladder & Bowel UK gives independent advice on products that can help manage bladder and bowel problems.\n\n【22】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information on products and how to order them, call its helpline on 0161 214 4591 or visit the Bladder & Bowel UK website.</u>\n\n【23】The Continence Product Advisor gives independent and evidence-based advice on how to choose and use suitable incontinence products.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Surgery and procedures</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : 10 ways to stop leaks</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:19", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:33", "cost": 13.918}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:19"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**It's important to be assessed by a healthcare professional as soon as possible if you think you've had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).**\n\n【3】After an initial assessment, you will be referred to a specialist for further tests to help determine the cause of the TIA. You should be referred to see a specialist within 24 hours of the start of your symptoms.\n\n【4】Initial assessment\n------------------\n\n【5】TIAs are often over very quickly, so you may not have any symptoms by the time you see a doctor.\n\n【6】If they suspect you've had a TIA, you'll be given aspirin to take straight away to prevent a stroke, unless there’s a medical reason why you cannot take aspirin. You'll also be referred to a specialist for further tests.\n\n【7】Specialist assessment\n---------------------\n\n【8】You'll usually be seen by a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the brain and spine (neurologist), or a consultant who specialises in strokes. This may be in a specialist stroke or TIA clinic, or an acute stroke unit.\n\n【9】You'll be asked about the symptoms you experienced during the TIA and how long they lasted. This will help to rule out other conditions that may have caused your symptoms.\n\n【10】Even if you no longer have symptoms, you may still need a neurological examination. This involves simple tasks designed to check your strength, sensation and co-ordination skills.\n\n【11】Tests\n-----\n\n【12】Several tests may be done to confirm a TIA and look for problems that may have caused it. Some of these tests include:\n\n【13】### Blood pressure tests\n\n【14】Your blood pressure will be checked, because high blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to TIAs.\n\n【15】### Blood tests\n\n【16】You might need blood tests to check whether you have high cholesterol or diabetes.\n\n【17】### Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n\n【18】An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures your heart's electrical activity using a number of electrodes (small, sticky patches) attached to your skin.\n\n【19】An ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions such as where your heart beats irregularly (atrial fibrillation), which can increase your risk of TIAs.\n\n【20】### Carotid ultrasound\n\n【21】A carotid ultrasound scan can show if there is narrowing or any blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain.\n\n【22】A small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they can be used to create an image of the inside of your body.\n\n【23】### Brain scans\n\n【24】Brain scans are not always necessary if you've had a TIA. They're usually only done if it's not clear which part of your brain was affected.\n\n【25】An MRI scan is most often used. This type of scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:27", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:35", "cost": 7.832}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:27"}

It can cause joint pain and stiffness, and affect how a tendon moves. You can treat a mild tendon injury yourself and it should feel better within 2 to 3 weeks.**\n\n【2】How to treat tendonitis yourself\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】Follow these steps for 2 to 3 days to help manage pain and support the tendon.\n\n【4】*   Rest: try to avoid moving the tendon for 2 to 3 days.\n*   Ice: put an ice pack (or try a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel on the tendon for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours.\n*   Support: wrap an elastic bandage around the area, use a tube bandage, or use a soft brace. You can buy these from pharmacies. It should be snug, not tight.\n\n【5】It's important to take a bandage or brace off before going to bed.\n\n【6】When you're able to move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint does not become stiff.\n\n【7】To help prevent further injury or pain, try to avoid:\n\n【8】*   heavy lifting, strong gripping or twisting actions that make the symptoms worse\n*   playing any sport until the tendon has recovered\n\n【9】### A pharmacist may be able to help with tendonitis\n\n【10】A pharmacist can recommend the best painkiller for you. Paracetamol and ibuprofen can help to ease pain.\n\n【11】They may also recommend an ibuprofen gel to rub on your skin.\n\n【12】Find a pharmacy\n\n【13】Symptoms of tendonitis\n----------------------\n\n【14】There are tendons all over your body. They connect your muscles to bones in your joints, for example, in your knees, elbows and shoulders.\n\n【15】The main symptoms of tendonitis are:\n\n【16】*   pain in a tendon that gets worse when you move\n*   difficulty moving the joint\n*   feeling a grating or crackling sensation when you move the tendon\n*   swelling, sometimes with heat or redness\n\n【17】If the pain is sudden and severe, and happened during an accident or activity, you may have torn (ruptured) a tendon.\n\n【18】You might have heard a popping or snapping sound when the pain started.\n\n【19】### Urgent advice: Get help from NHS 111 if:\n\n【20】*   you have injured a joint and your symptoms do not improve within a few weeks\n*   you're in a lot of pain\n*   you think you have ruptured a tendon\n\n【21】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【22】You could also go to your nearest urgent treatment centre.\n\n【23】Treatment for tendonitis\n------------------------\n\n【24】If you need treatment for tendonitis a GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller or suggest you use an ibuprofen gel on your skin to ease the pain.\n\n【25】If the pain is severe, lasts a long time, or your movement is limited, you may be referred for physiotherapy. You can also see a physiotherapist privately.\n\n【26】If physiotherapy does not help, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in muscles and bones (orthopaedic specialist) or a local musculoskeletal clinic.\n\n【27】Some people with severe tendonitis may be offered:\n\n【28】*   steroid injections, which may provide short-term pain relief\n*   surgery to remove damaged tissue or repair a ruptured tendon\n\n【29】Find a physiotherapist\n\n【30】Information:\n\n【31】### Self-refer for treatment\n\n【32】If you have tendonitis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.\n\n【33】To find out if there are any services in your area:\n\n【34】*   ask the reception staff at your GP surgery\n*   check your GP surgery's website\n*   contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB\n*   search online for NHS treatment for tendonitis near you\n\n【35】Preventing tendon problems\n--------------------------\n\n【36】Tendonitis is usually caused by sudden, sharp movements or repetitive exercise, such as running, jumping or throwing.\n\n【37】It can also be caused by repetitive movements, or having poor posture or technique while at work or when playing a sport. This is known as repetitive strain injury (RSI).\n\n【38】You cannot always prevent tendonitis. But there are things you can do to help reduce the chance of a tendon injury.\n\n【39】### Do\n\n【40】*   warm up before exercising and gently stretch afterwards\n\n【41】*   wear supportive shoes or insoles for exercise\n\n【42】*   take regular breaks from repetitive exercises\n\n【43】### Don’t\n\n【44】*   do not overexercise tired muscles\n\n【45】*   do not start a new sport without some training or practice\n\n【46】*   do not do the same repetitive exercises\n\n【47】删除3：<u>Video: What is tendonitis?\n--------------------------\n\n【48】This animation explains what tendonitis is and what causes it.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 09 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 09 June 2026</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:03", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:43", "cost": 40.39}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:03"}

If you do have an MRI scan, the radiographers will make sure it's as safe as possible for you and your baby.\n\n【9】Metal implants or fragments\n---------------------------\n\n【10】Having something metallic in your body doesn't necessarily mean you can't have an MRI scan, but it's important for medical staff carrying out the scan to be aware of it.\n\n【11】They can decide on a case-by-case basis if there are any risks, or if further measures need to be taken to ensure the scan is as safe as possible.\n\n【12】For example, it may be possible to make a pacemaker or defibrillator MRI-safe, or to monitor your heart rhythm during the procedure.\n\n【13】You may need to have an X-ray if you're unsure about any metal fragments in your body.\n\n【14】Examples of metal implants or fragments include:\n\n【15】*   **a** **pacemaker** – a small electrical device used to control an irregular heartbeat\n*   **an** **implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)** – a similar device to a pacemaker that uses electrical shocks to regulate heartbeats\n*   **metal plates, wires, screws or rods** – used during surgery for bone fractures\n*   **a nerve stimulator** – an electrical implant used to treat long-term nerve pain\n*   **a cochlear implant** – a device similar to a hearing aid that's surgically implanted inside the ear\n*   **a drug pump implant** – used to treat long-term pain by delivering painkilling medication directly to an area of the body, such as the lower back\n*   **brain aneurysm clips** – small metal clips used to seal blood vessels in the brain that would otherwise be at risk of rupturing (bursting)\n*   **stents, filters and vascular coils** – small metal devices that are surgically implanted in blood vessels\n*   **metallic fragments** in or near your eyes or blood vessels (common in people who do welding or metalwork for a living)\n*   **prosthetic (artificial) metal heart valves**\n*   **penile implants** – used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence)\n*   **eye implants** – such as small metal clips used to hold the retina in place\n*   **an** **intrauterine device (IUD)** or coil – a contraceptive device made of plastic and copper that fits inside the womb\n*   **artificial joints** – such as those used for a hip replacement or knee replacement\n*   **dental fillings and bridges**\n*   **tubal ligation clips** – used in female sterilisation\n*   **surgical clips or staples** – used to close wounds after an operation\n*   **tattoos or permanent make-up**\n*   **objects such as bullets or shrapnel**\n*   **breast expanders** – used after a mastectomy\n*   **insulin pumps** **and** **glucose monitors** – electronic devices used by some people with diabetes\n\n【16】Tattoos\n-------\n\n【17】Some tattoo ink contains traces of metal, but most tattoos are safe in an MRI scanner.\n\n【18】Tell the radiographer immediately if you feel any discomfort or heat in your tattoo during the scan.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 July 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : How it's performed</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 11:15:16", "endTime": "2024/09/05 11:15:22", "cost": 6.813}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 19:15:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 19:15:14"}

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**After chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has been carried out, the sample of cells will be sent to a laboratory to be tested.**\n\n【3】The number of chromosomes (bundles of genes) in the cells can be counted, and the structure of the chromosomes can be checked.\n\n【4】If CVS is being carried out to test for a specific genetic condition, the cells in the sample can also be tested for this.\n\n【5】Getting the results\n-------------------\n\n【6】The first results of the test should be available in about 3 days. This is known as the rapid CVS result.\n\n【7】A more detailed set of CVS results will be available within 2 weeks.\n\n【8】If the rapid CVS result and a previous ultrasound scan both indicate your baby has a condition, your doctor will discuss your options with you straightaway.\n\n【9】If your previous ultrasound did not find anything unexpected, it’s recommended you wait until the more detailed set of CVS results before making a decision about ending your pregnancy.\n\n【10】If the results of these tests suggest that it is highly likely your baby will have a genetic condition, a specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.\n\n【11】There's no cure for most of the conditions found by CVS, so you'll need to consider your options carefully.\n\n【12】You may decide to continue with your pregnancy while gathering information about the condition so you're fully prepared.\n\n【13】You can usually choose whether to get the results over the phone or during a face-to-face meeting at the hospital or at home.\n\n【14】You'll also receive written confirmation of the results.\n\n【15】How reliable are the results?\n-----------------------------\n\n【16】CVS is estimated to give a definitive result in 99 out of every 100 women having the test.\n\n【17】But it cannot test for every condition and it's not always possible to get a conclusive result.\n\n【18】In a very small number of cases, the results of CVS cannot establish with certainty if your baby will have the condition the test is looking for.\n\n【19】This might be because the sample of cells removed was too small.\n\n【20】Or there's a possibility there's a change in the structure of the chromosomes in the placenta and not in the baby.\n\n【21】If this happens, it may be necessary to have amniocentesis, an alternative test where a sample of amniotic fluid is taken from the womb.\n\n【22】This is done a few weeks later to confirm a diagnosis.\n\n【23】What the results mean\n---------------------\n\n【24】Many women who have CVS will have a \"normal\" result. This means that none of the conditions that were tested for were found in the baby.\n\n【25】But as the test only checks for conditions caused by certain genes, it cannot exclude any conditions not tested for.\n\n【26】If a test result is \"positive\", in 99 out of 100 positive results the baby will have the condition tested for.\n\n【27】In this instance, the implications will be fully discussed with you and you'll need to decide how to proceed.\n\n【28】What happens if a condition is likely\n-------------------------------------\n\n【29】If your test results shows it is highly likely that your baby will be born with a condition, you can speak to a number of specialists about what this means.\n\n【30】These could include a midwife, a doctor who specialises in children's health (consultant paediatrician), a geneticist and a genetic counsellor.\n\n【31】They'll be able to give you detailed information about the condition, including the possible symptoms your child may have, the treatment and support they might need, and whether their life expectancy will be affected, to help you decide what to do.\n\n【32】A baby born with 1 of these conditions will always have the condition, so you'll need to consider your options carefully.\n\n【33】Your options are to:\n\n【34】*   continue with your pregnancy – it can help to find out as much as you can about the condition your baby may have\n*   end your pregnancy (have a termination) \n\n【35】This can be a very difficult decision, but you do not have to make it on your own.\n\n【36】As well as discussing it with specialist healthcare professionals, it can help to talk things over with your partner and speak to close friends and family.\n\n【37】You can also get support and more information from charities like:\n\n【38】*   Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)\n*   Down's Syndrome Association\n*   Sickle Cell Society\n*   SOFT UK (Support Organisation for Trisomy 13 and 18)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:18:51", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:19:00", "cost": 8.49}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:18:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:18:50"}

One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood.\n\n【15】Pads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is.\n\n【16】You can also get reusable washable pads.\n\n【17】Pantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of sanitary pad that can be used on days when your period is very light.\n\n【18】### Tampons\n\n【19】Tampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body.\n\n【20】There are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it.\n\n【21】Tampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly.\n\n【22】It is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood.\n\n【23】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, read:</u>\n\n【24】*   Can a tampon get lost inside me?\n*   What if I forget to remove my tampon?\n\n【25】### Menstrual cups\n\n【26】Menstrual cups are an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina.\n\n【27】Menstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most sanitary pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again.\n\n【28】### Period underwear\n\n【29】Period underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as sanitary pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused.\n\n【30】PMS (premenstrual syndrome)\n---------------------------\n\n【31】Changes in your body's hormone levels before your period can cause physical and emotional changes.\n\n【32】This is known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or PMT (premenstrual tension).\n\n【33】There are many possible symptoms of PMS, but typical symptoms include:\n\n【34】*   feeling bloated\n*   breast tenderness\n*   mood swings\n*   feeling irritable\n*   spotty skin\n*   low sex drive (loss of libido)\n\n【35】These symptoms usually improve when your period starts and disappear a few days afterwards. Not all women who have periods get PMS.\n\n【36】Getting pregnant\n----------------\n\n【37】Working out when you can get pregnant – your fertile time – can be difficult. It's around the time you ovulate, which is about 12 to 16 days before the start of your next period.\n\n【38】But sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to 7 days before ovulation occurs. This means your fertile time extends back earlier in your cycle.\n\n【39】You can calculate when your period will start and your peak ovulation times using an online period calendar.\n\n【40】You cannot get pregnant if you do not ovulate. Some hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch and contraceptive injection, work by preventing ovulation.\n删除7：<u>Read more about periods and fertility in the menstrual cycle, infertility, contraception and trying to get pregnant.</u>\n\n【41】Changes in your periods\n-----------------------\n\n【42】Your periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated.\n\n【43】You can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic.\n\n【44】Bleeding between periods, bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause needs to be checked by a doctor.\n\n【45】It might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer.\n\n【46】You could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods.\n\n【47】They will investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment.\n删除7：<u>Read more about stopped or missed periods.</u>\n\n【48】When do periods stop?\n---------------------\n\n【49】Your periods will continue until you reach the menopause, which usually happens when you are in your mid-40s to mid-50s. In the UK the average age of menopause is 51.\n\n【50】Your periods will not usually stop suddenly when you go through the menopause. They may start to become less frequent over a few months or years before stopping altogether.\n删除3：<u>Video: Menstrual cycle\n----------------------\n\n【51】This animation explains in detail how the menstrual cycle works.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 21 October 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 21 October 2026</u>\n\n【52】</u>删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【53】Can you answer a few questions about your visit today?\n\n【54】Click here to take our survey\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Starting your periods</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:00:10", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:05:20", "cost": 310.049}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:05:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:57:19"}

Do this even if you feel better. It will help stop the infection coming back.\n\n【81】What if I do not get better?\n\n【82】Tell your doctor if you do not start feeling better after taking amoxicillin for 3 days. Also tell them if, at any time, you start to feel worse.\n\n【83】Will it give me thrush?\n\n【84】Some people get a fungal infection called thrush after taking a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin.

If you think you have thrush, speak to your pharmacist or ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【85】How does amoxicillin compare with other antibiotics?\n\n【86】Amoxicillin and other penicillins, like phenoxymethylpenicillin, are antibiotics that are widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin, dental, throat and chest infections.\n\n【87】Not all antibiotics are suitable for every infection. Your doctor will choose an antibiotic that's suitable for the type of infection you have. Speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions.\n\n【88】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【89】Amoxicillin does not stop contraceptive pills working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【90】However, if amoxicillin makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【91】Find about more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.\n\n【92】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【93】There's no evidence to suggest that taking amoxicillin reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【94】Does it stain teeth?\n\n【95】If you or your child take amoxicillin as a liquid medicine, it can stain your teeth. This does not last and should go after brushing your teeth well.\n\n【96】Amoxicillin capsules do not stain teeth.\n\n【97】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【98】Yes. Amoxicillin should not affect you being able to drive or cycle.\n\n【99】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【100】You can eat and drink normally while taking amoxicillin.\n\n【101】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【102】Yes, you can drink alcohol with amoxicillin.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【103】*   Chest infection\n*   Dental abscess\n*   Ear infections\n*   Stomach ulcer\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【104】*   HealthUnlocked: amoxicillin forum\n*   British Lung Foundation: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 November 2024</u>", "index": 0, "show": true, "start": 0, "end": 7, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:29", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:23", "cost": 54.105}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:29"}

Overview\n2.  How it's performed\n3.  Recovery\n4.  Risks\n5.  Alternatives</u>\n\n【2】**A coronary angioplasty is a procedure used to widen blocked or narrowed coronary arteries (the main blood vessels supplying the heart).**\n\n【3】The term \"angioplasty\" means using a balloon to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery. However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\n\n【4】Coronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n【5】When a coronary angioplasty is used\n-----------------------------------\n\n【6】Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries.\n\n【7】In some people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease.\n\n【8】If the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress.\n\n【9】While angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective.\n\n【10】Coronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack.\n\n【11】What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.\n\n【13】If you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future.\n\n【14】How a coronary angioplasty is performed\n---------------------------------------\n\n【15】A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out.\n\n【16】A thin, flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video.\n\n【17】When the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed.\n\n【18】If a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed.\n\n【19】A coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week.\n\n【20】If you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home.\n删除7：<u>Read more about: </u>\n\n【21】*   What happens during a coronary angioplasty\n*   Recovering from a coronary angioplasty\n\n【22】How safe is a coronary angioplasty?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】A coronary angioplasty is 1 of the most common types of treatment for the heart.\n\n【24】As the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people. Doctors refer to this as a minimally invasive form of treatment.\n\n【25】The risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is generally small, but this depends on factors such as:\n\n【26】*   your age\n*   your general health\n*   whether you've had a heart attack\n\n【27】Serious problems that can occur as a result of the procedure include:\n\n【28】*   excessive bleeding\n*   a heart attack\n*   a stroke\n删除7：<u>Read more about the possible complications of a coronary angioplasty.</u>\n\n【29】Are there any alternatives?\n---------------------------\n\n【30】If many coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed, or the structure of your arteries is abnormal, a coronary artery bypass graft may be considered.\n\n【31】This is a type of invasive surgery where sections of healthy blood vessel are taken from other parts of the body and attached to the coronary arteries. Blood is diverted through these vessels, so it bypasses the narrowed or clogged parts of the arteries.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the alternatives to a coronary angioplasty.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : How it's performed</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:11", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:36:24", "cost": 13.542}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:36:05"}

But there's very little evidence these work.\n\n【16】There are some treatments that may help make stretch marks look better, but they will not get rid of them.\n\n【17】They include:\n\n【18】*   retinoid (often called tretinoin) creams or hyaluronic acid – these may help if used on new stretch marks, but you should not use retinoid creams if you're pregnant as they may harm your baby\n*   light or laser treatments\n*   microdermabrasion, which removes a thin layer of skin\n\n【19】You would need to pay for these treatments as they're not available on the NHS.\n\n【20】Information:\n\n【21】It's not always possible to prevent stretch marks. The best way to reduce your chance of getting them is by maintaining a healthy weight.\n\n【22】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】You have large stretch marks and:\n\n【24】*   more fat on your chest and tummy, but slim arms and legs\n*   a build-up of fat on the back of your neck and shoulders\n*   a red, puffy, rounded face\n\n【25】These could be symptoms of Cushing's syndrome.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:54:03", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:54:21", "cost": 17.901}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:54:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:54:03"}

If the prescribed dose proves ineffective, it can be gradually increased.\n\n【3】SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. Depending on the type of SSRI prescribed and the severity of your depression, you'll usually have to take 1 to 3 tablets, once a day.\n\n【4】It will usually take 2 to 4 weeks before you begin to notice the effects of SSRIs. You'll have regular meetings with your doctor when you first start taking SSRIs and you should let them know if you haven't noticed any improvement after 4 to 6 weeks. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant.\n\n【5】It's usually recommended that a course of SSRIs continues for at least 6 months after you feel better, to prevent your condition coming back when you stop. However, if you've experienced previous episodes of depression, a 2-year course may be recommended. Some people with recurring problems are advised to carry on taking medicine indefinitely.\n\n【6】Missed or extra doses\n---------------------\n\n【7】It's important not to miss any of your doses, because this could make your treatment less effective.\n\n【8】If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time to take your next dose, in which case you should just skip the missed dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for the one you missed.\n\n【9】If you take more tablets than prescribed, contact your GP as soon as possible for advice. If this isn't possible, contact your local out of hours service, or call NHS 111.\n\n【10】Taking a double dose is unlikely to be harmful, but you should only do so if advised by a medical professional.\n\n【11】Stopping SSRIs\n--------------\n\n【12】You shouldn't suddenly stop taking SSRIs, even if you feel better. Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as:\n\n【13】*   stomach ache\n*   flu-like symptoms \n*   anxiety\n*   dizziness\n*   sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks\n*   seizures (fits)\n\n【14】If your GP or mental health specialist decides to stop your course of SSRIs, they'll reduce the dose gradually over a few weeks.\n删除11：<u>More in Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】*   Overview - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Cautions - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Dosage - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Side effects - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 8 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 8 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:07:15", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:07:26", "cost": 10.847}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:07:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:07:15"}

head.\n\n【4】You may get other symptoms just before a migraine, such as:\n\n【5】*   feeling very tired and yawning a lot\n*   craving certain foods or feeling thirsty\n*   changes in your mood\n*   a stiff neck\n*   peeing more\n\n【6】You may also get warning signs you're about to have a migraine (called an aura), such as:\n\n【7】*   problems with your sight, such as seeing zigzag lines or flashing lights\n*   numbness or a tingling that feels like pins and needles\n*   feeling dizzy\n*   difficulty speaking\n\n【8】Aura symptoms should not last for longer than an hour.\n\n【9】There are different types of migraine with different symptoms.\n\n【10】Types of migraine\n\n| Symptoms | Migraine type |\n| --- | --- |\n| SymptomsNo warning signs  | Migraine typeMigraine without aura  |\n|

like flashing lights, but no headache  | Migraine typeMigraine aura without headache (silent migraine)  |\n\n【12】Migraines usually last between 2 hours and 3 days, with some symptoms (such as feeling very tired) starting up to 2 days before the head pain starts and finishing after the headache stops.\n\n【13】Some people have migraines several times a week, while others do not have them very often.\n\n【14】Most people find their migraines slowly get better as they get older.\n\n【15】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【16】*   your migraines are severe or

temperature and symptoms of meningitis\n*   cannot move or have weakness in the arms or legs on 1 side of your body, or 1 side of your face\n\n【30】Treatment for migraines\n-----------------------\n\n【31】Migraine treatments include:\n\n【32】*   painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol\n*   medicines called triptans\n*   medicines that stop you feeling sick or being sick\n\n【33】You may have to try a combination of medicines before you find something that works.\n\n【34】A GP may also recommend making changes to your lifestyle to help manage your migraines, such as eating at regular times and drinking less caffeine.\n\n【35】If your migraines are severe, you might be offered other things to help, such as learning relaxation techniques and acupuncture.\n\n【36】If these treatments do not manage your migraines or they're getting worse, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment.\n\n【37】### Important\n\n【38】Try not to take high doses of painkillers too often as this could make it harder to treat your migraines.\n\n【39】Causes of migraines\n-------------------\n\n【40】It's not known what causes migraines.\n\n【41】You're more likely to get them if you have a close family member who gets them.\n\n【42】Some people find certain triggers can cause migraines, such as:\n\n【43】*   starting their period\n*   anxiety and depression\n*   stress and tiredness\n*   not eating regularly or skipping meals\n*   too much caffeine\n*   not getting enough exercise\n\n【44】It can help to keep a migraine

If you become pregnant, keep taking carbamazepine, but talk to your doctor straight away. It is likely that you will need to be seen in a specialist epilepsy clinic, and they may want to change your medicine.\n\n【5】If you're trying to get pregnant or have become pregnant while taking carbamazepine, it's recommended you take a high dose of folic acid (5mg a day). You can get this from your doctor or midwife.\n\n【6】Ideally, it's best to take high dose folic acid for 3 months before you start trying to get pregnant and for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Do not worry if you have not taken it before you get pregnant, but start taking it as soon as possible once you know that you are pregnant. It helps your baby to grow normally.\n\n【7】Your baby may need extra monitoring for a few days after they're born. This is because they can sometimes have withdrawal symptoms from carbamazepine.\n\n【8】Carbamazepine and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, it's OK to take carbamazepine while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【10】Carbamazepine does pass into breast milk. Most babies do not get any side effects, but some babies might be more sleepy or not feed as well as usual. Taking other medicines while you're taking carbamazepine may mean your baby gets side effects, although this is still rare.\n\n【11】It's important to keep taking carbamazepine to keep you well. Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【12】Talk to your doctor, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible if:\n\n【13】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby seems unusually sleepy\n*   your baby has an upset stomach\n*   the whites or your baby's eyes turn yellow, or their skin turns yellow (this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin) – this could be a sign of jaundice\n*   you have any other concerns about your baby\n\n【14】Carbamazepine and fertility\n---------------------------\n\n【15】Carbamazepine does not affect female fertility, however, there have been rare reports of problems with male fertility.\n\n【16】Speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.\n\n【17】Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【18】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【19】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how carbamazepine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, visit the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Carbamazepine\n---------------------\n\n【20】*   About carbamazepine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking carbamazepine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:08:27", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:08:35", "cost": 8.066}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:08:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:08:26"}

It can be difficult to stop smoking, but it's never too late to quit.\n\n【3】Every cigarette you smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of which are dangerous, so smoking when you are pregnant harms your unborn baby. Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to your baby. As a result, their heart must beat harder every time you smoke.\n\n【4】Benefits of stopping smoking in pregnancy\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Stopping smoking will help both you and your baby immediately. Harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, and other damaging chemicals will clear from your body. When you stop smoking:\n\n【6】*   you will reduce the risk of complications in pregnancy and birth\n*   you are more likely to have a healthier pregnancy and a healthier baby\n*   you will reduce the risk of stillbirth\n*   your baby is less likely to be born too early and have to face the breathing, feeding and health problems that often go with being premature\n*   your baby is less likely to be born with a low birth weight. Babies of smokers are, on average, lighter than other babies, which can cause problems during and after labour. For example, they are more likely to have problems keeping warm and are more likely to get infections\n*   you will reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as \"cot death\"\n\n【7】Stopping smoking now will also help your baby later in life. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to suffer from asthma and other serious illnesses that may need hospital treatment.\n\n【8】The sooner you stop smoking, the better. But even if you stop in the last few weeks of your pregnancy this will benefit you and your baby.\n\n【9】Secondhand (passive) smoke harms your baby\n------------------------------------------\n\n【10】If your partner or anyone else who lives with you smokes, their smoke can affect you and your baby before and after their birth. You may also find it more difficult to stop if someone around you smokes.\n\n【11】Secondhand smoke can also reduce your baby's birthweight and increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as \"cot death\". Babies whose parents smoke are more likely to be admitted to hospital for bronchitis and pneumonia during their first year.\n\n【12】To find out more about quitting and to get support, your partner can call the National Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\n【13】Nicotine replacement therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【14】You can use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during pregnancy if it will help you stop smoking and you're unable to stop without it. Stop smoking tablets such as bupropion (Zyban) are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n【15】NRT contains only nicotine and none of the damaging chemicals found in cigarettes, so it is a much better option than continuing to smoke. It helps you by giving you the nicotine you would have had from a cigarette.\n\n【16】You can be prescribed NRT during pregnancy by a GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser. You can also buy it over the counter without a prescription from a pharmacy.\n\n【17】NRT is available as:\n\n【18】*   patches\n*   gum\n*   inhalator\n*   nasal spray\n*   mouth spray\n*   oral strips\n*   lozenges\n*   microtabs\n\n【19】If you have pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, patches may be a better solution.\n\n【20】NRT patches should be used for no more than 16 hours in any 24-hour period. The best way to remember this is to remove the patch at bedtime.\n\n【21】Before using any of these products, speak to a midwife, GP, a pharmacist or a specialist stop smoking adviser.\n\n【22】By getting this specialist advice you can be sure that you're doing the best for your baby and for you.\n\n【23】Call the National Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\n【24】Remember, you are twice as likely to be successful at quitting if you get some support from a trained adviser.\n\n【25】### Liquorice-flavoured nicotine products\n\n【26】Pregnant women are advised to avoid liquorice-flavoured nicotine products. Although there is no known risk with small amounts of liquorice flavouring, the manufacturers advise caution.\n\n【27】This caution is based on information about the adverse effects associated with excessive amounts of liquorice root. As other flavours are available, pregnant women are advised to choose an alternative, such as fruit or mint.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about stop smoking treatments.</u>\n\n【28】E-cigarettes in pregnancy\n-------------------------\n\n【29】E-cigarettes are fairly new and there are still some things we do not know. However, current evidence on e-cigarettes indicates they are much less risky than smoking.\n\n【30】Cigarettes deliver nicotine along with thousands of harmful chemicals. E-cigarettes allow you to inhale nicotine through a vapour rather than smoke. By itself, nicotine is relatively harmless.\n\n【31】E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, the 2 main toxins in cigarette smoke.

It can be difficult to stop smoking, but it's never too late to quit.\n\n【3】Every cigarette you smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of which are dangerous, so smoking when you are pregnant harms your unborn baby. Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to your baby. As a result, their heart must beat harder every time you smoke.\n\n【4】Benefits of stopping smoking in pregnancy\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Stopping smoking will help both you and your baby immediately. Harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, and other damaging chemicals will clear from your body. When you stop smoking:\n\n【6】*   you will reduce the risk of complications in pregnancy and birth\n*   you are more likely to have a healthier pregnancy and a healthier baby\n*   you will reduce the risk of stillbirth\n*   your baby is less likely to be born too early and have to face the breathing, feeding and health problems that often go with being premature\n*   your baby is less likely to be born with a low birth weight. Babies of smokers are, on average, lighter than other babies, which can cause problems during and after labour. For example, they are more likely to have problems keeping warm and are more likely to get infections\n*   you will reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as \"cot death\"\n\n【7】Stopping smoking now will also help your baby later in life. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to suffer from asthma and other serious illnesses that may need hospital treatment.\n\n【8】The sooner you stop smoking, the better. But even if you stop in the last few weeks of your pregnancy this will benefit you and your baby.\n\n【9】Secondhand (passive) smoke harms your baby\n------------------------------------------\n\n【10】If your partner or anyone else who lives with you smokes, their smoke can affect you and your baby before and after their birth. You may also find it more difficult to stop if someone around you smokes.\n\n【11】Secondhand smoke can also reduce your baby's birthweight and increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as \"cot death\". Babies whose parents smoke are more likely to be admitted to hospital for bronchitis and pneumonia during their first year.\n\n【12】To find out more about quitting and to get support, your partner can call the National Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\n【13】Nicotine replacement therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【14】You can use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during pregnancy if it will help you stop smoking and you're unable to stop without it. Stop smoking tablets such as bupropion (Zyban) are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n【15】NRT contains only nicotine and none of the damaging chemicals found in cigarettes, so it is a much better option than continuing to smoke. It helps you by giving you the nicotine you would have had from a cigarette.\n\n【16】You can be prescribed NRT during pregnancy by a GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser. You can also buy it over the counter without a prescription from a pharmacy.\n\n【17】NRT is available as:\n\n【18】*   patches\n*   gum\n*   inhalator\n*   nasal spray\n*   mouth spray\n*   oral strips\n*   lozenges\n*   microtabs\n\n【19】If you have pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, patches may be a better solution.\n\n【20】NRT patches should be used for no more than 16 hours in any 24-hour period. The best way to remember this is to remove the patch at bedtime.\n\n【21】Before using any of these products, speak to a midwife, GP, a pharmacist or a specialist stop smoking adviser.\n\n【22】By getting this specialist advice you can be sure that you're doing the best for your baby and for you.\n\n【23】Call the National Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\n【24】Remember, you are twice as likely to be successful at quitting if you get some support from a trained adviser.\n\n【25】### Liquorice-flavoured nicotine products\n\n【26】Pregnant women are advised to avoid liquorice-flavoured nicotine products. Although there is no known risk with small amounts of liquorice flavouring, the manufacturers advise caution.\n\n【27】This caution is based on information about the adverse effects associated with excessive amounts of liquorice root. As other flavours are available, pregnant women are advised to choose an alternative, such as fruit or mint.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about stop smoking treatments.</u>\n\n【28】E-cigarettes in pregnancy\n-------------------------\n\n【29】E-cigarettes are fairly new and there are still some things we do not know. However, current evidence on e-cigarettes indicates they are much less risky than smoking.\n\n【30】Cigarettes deliver nicotine along with thousands of harmful chemicals. E-cigarettes allow you to inhale nicotine through a vapour rather than smoke. By itself, nicotine is relatively harmless.\n\n【31】E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, the 2 main toxins in cigarette smoke. Carbon monoxide is particularly harmful to developing babies. The vapour from an e-cigarette does contain some of the potentially harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.\n\n【32】If using an e-cigarette helps you to stop smoking, it is much safer for you and your baby than continuing to smoke.\n\n【33】Unlike nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as patches or gum, e-cigarettes are not available on an NHS prescription. If you want to use an e-cigarette, you can still get free expert help from a stop smoking adviser.\n\n【34】Call the National Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044 for more information, or ask a midwife to refer you.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about using e-cigarettes to stop smoking.</u>\n\n【35】National Smokefree helpline\n---------------------------\n\n【36】The National Smokefree helpline offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking and can give you details of local support services.\n\n【37】You can also sign up to receive ongoing advice and support at a time that suits you.\n\n【38】Information:\n\n【39】National Smokefree helpline: 0300 123 1044\n\n【40】9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.\n\n【41】To find your nearest NHS Stop Smoking service talk to:\n\n【42】*   a midwife\n*   a health visitor\n*   a nurse at your GP surgery\n*   a pharmacist\n\n【43】NHS Stop Smoking services can offer 1-to-1 or group sessions with trained stop smoking advisers and may have a pregnancy stop smoking specialist.\n\n【44】They can also offer advice about dealing with stress, weight gain and support the use of NRT (such as patches or gum), if appropriate, to help you manage your cravings.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the effects of smoking in pregnancy, and getting support to quit, at Better Health: Start for Life</u>\n\n【45】Find stop smoking services near you.\n\n【46】Get Better Health: Start for Life's pregnancy and baby emails\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Sign up for Better Health: Start for Life’s emails for expert advice, videos and tips on pregnancy, birth and beyond.\n删除3：<u>Video: should I give up smoking?\n--------------------------------\n\n【48】In this video, a midwife explains how smoking can harm your baby.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 February 2026</u>\n\n【49】</u>删除11：<u>More in Keeping well in pregnancy\n---------------------------------\n\n【50】*   Have a healthy diet in pregnancy\n*   Vegetarian or vegan and pregnant\n*   Foods to avoid in pregnancy\n*   Vitamins, supplements and nutrition in pregnancy\n*   Exercise in pregnancy\n*   Medicines in pregnancy\n*   Mental health in pregnancy\n*   Depression in pregnancy\n*   Sex in pregnancy\n*   Travelling in pregnancy\n*   Work and pregnancy\n*   Your baby's movements\n*   Reducing the risk of stillbirth\n*   Drinking alcohol while pregnant\n*   Stop smoking in pregnancy\n*   Illegal drugs in pregnancy\n*   Vaccinations in pregnancy\n*   The flu jab in pregnancy\n*   Whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy\n*   Infections in pregnancy that may affect your baby\n*   Pregnancy and COVID-19\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 January 2026</u>", "index": 0, "show": true, "start": 0, "end": 7, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:53:14", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:22", "cost": 547.392}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:50", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:53:13"}

Lots of people at risk of Huntington's disease decide they'd rather not know until any symptoms appear.\n\n【6】If you do want to know, ask your GP for a referral to a genetic counsellor. You'll have several appointments with the counsellor. It's only done once all the benefits and risks have been explained.\n\n【7】The test involves checking a sample of your blood for the genetic fault that causes the condition. It can take a few weeks to get the result删除7：<u>\n\n【8】The Huntington's Disease Association has more information about genetic testing for Huntington's disease.</u>\n\n【9】Tests before or during pregnancy\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】Speak to your GP if you're planning a pregnancy and:\n\n【11】*   you have a family history of Huntington's disease\n*   a test has shown you have the genetic fault that causes the condition\n\n【12】This might mean your child is at risk of developing Huntington's disease.\n\n【13】Your GP can refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options.\n\n【14】These may include:\n\n【15】*   having a child with a donor egg or sperm\n*   adopting a child\n*   having a test during pregnancy (chorionic villus sampling) to see if your baby will get Huntington's disease\n*   pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and tested to make sure they don't have the Huntington's disease gene, before being implanted into the womb\n\n【16】Tests to diagnose Huntington's disease\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】If you have symptoms of Huntington's disease, your GP may refer you to a specialist for tests.\n\n【18】The specialist will ask about your symptoms to see if it's likely you have Huntington's disease and rule out similar conditions.\n\n【19】They may examine you and test things like your thinking, balance and walking ability. Sometimes you might also have a brain scan.\n\n【20】A blood test to check for the Huntington's disease gene can confirm if you have the condition.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 29 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 29 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment and support</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:49", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:01", "cost": 11.171}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:49"}

If you stop taking it too soon, the infection can come back.\n\n【2】Dosage for nystatin liquid\n--------------------------\n\n【3】The usual dose of nystatin for adults, babies and children is:\n\n【4】*   to treat oral thrush – 1ml, taken 4 times a day. Leave at least 3 hours between doses. If your doctor gives you different instructions, follow their advice\n*   to prevent oral thrush – 1ml, taken once or twice a day\n\n【5】How to take nystatin liquid\n---------------------------\n\n【6】It's best to take nystatin liquid after a meal or some food. However, do not mix it with food or water or any other drink.\n\n【7】1.  Shake the bottle well.\n2.  Take the lid off and measure out the right amount using an oral syringe, medicine spoon or dropper. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n3.  Put the medicine in your mouth.\n4.  Keep it in your mouth for at least 30 seconds if possible, swilling it around your mouth like a mouthwash before you swallow it.\n5.  Do not eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after taking it. This stops you washing the medicine out of your mouth too soon.\n\n【8】It may be difficult to get your child to keep it in their mouth, but encourage them to do this if they can. Do not worry if they cannot. The medicine will still help even if they swallow it quickly.\n\n【9】Nystatin cream or ointment\n--------------------------\n\n【10】Nystatin is also available mixed with other ingredients in creams and ointments. Your doctor will advise you on which is best for you.\n\n【11】You'll usually apply a cream or ointment 2 or 3 times a day. The amount you use will depend on the skin condition you have. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much to use.\n\n【12】How long to take or use it for\n------------------------------\n\n【13】It usually takes nystatin liquid around a week to treat oral thrush, but you'll need to continue taking it for 2 days after this to make sure all the fungus has been killed. Take it for as long as your doctor advises.\n\n【14】If you're using nystatin to prevent oral thrush, your doctor will tell you how long to take it for.\n\n【15】If you're using cream or ointment containing nystatin mixed with other ingredients, you may only need to use it for 7 to 14 days but it will depend on your skin condition. Your doctor will tell you how long to use it for.\n\n【16】If you forget to take or use it\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】If you forget a dose, take or use it as soon as you remember, unless it's less than 3 hours until your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and have your next one at the usual time.\n\n【18】Do not take or use 2 doses to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【19】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.\n\n【20】If you take or use too much\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Nystatin is generally very safe. Taking too much liquid or using too much cream or ointment is unlikely to harm you or your child.\n\n【22】If you're worried, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【23】If your nystatin cream or ointment contains a strong steroid called clobetasol, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. They'll be able to tell you if you've used too much.\n删除11：<u>More in Nystatin\n----------------\n\n【24】*   About nystatin\n*   Who can and cannot take or use it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking or using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 1 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 1 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:13", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:49", "cost": 36.221}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:11"}

It can be heavy or light and last from a few seconds to more than 10 minutes.\n\n【4】Nosebleeds can happen when you're asleep.

This will drain blood down your nose instead of down the back of your throat.\n*   Sit or stand upright, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the veins of your nose and will discourage further bleeding.\n*   Holding a covered ice pack, or a packet of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, on the top of your nose may help reduce blood flow.

Overview\n2.  What happens\n3.  Side effects</u>\n\n【2】**Chemotherapy can cause unpleasant side effects, although many can be treated or prevented, and most will pass once your treatment stops.**\n\n【3】It's difficult to predict what side effects you'll get.\n\n【4】Here's a list of many of the common side effects, but it's unlikely you'll have all of these.\n\n【5】Tiredness\n---------\n\n【6】Tiredness (fatigue) is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n【7】Many people having treatment feel tired a lot of the time or get tired very easily doing everyday tasks.\n\n【8】It can help to:\n\n【9】*   get plenty of rest\n*   avoid doing tasks or activities that you do not feel up to\n*   do light exercise, such as walking or yoga, if you're able to – this can boost your energy level, but be careful not to push yourself too hard\n*   ask your friends and family for help with everyday tasks\n\n【10】If you're working, you may want to ask your employer for time off or arrange to work part-time until your treatment has finished.\n\n【11】Contact your care team if you suddenly feel very tired and out of breath. This can be a sign of anaemia.\n\n【12】Feeling and being sick\n----------------------\n\n【13】Many people having chemotherapy will have periods where they feel sick (nausea) or are sick (vomit).\n\n【14】Your care team can give you anti-sickness (antiemetic) medicine to reduce or prevent this.\n\n【15】This is available as:\n\n【16】*   tablets or capsules that you swallow\n*   tablets that dissolve in your mouth\n*   injections or a drip into a vein\n*   suppositories – capsules you put into your bottom\n*   a skin patch\n\n【17】Side effects of anti-sickness medicines include constipation, indigestion, problems sleeping (insomnia) and headaches.\n\n【18】Tell your care team if your medicine does not help, or it causes too many side effects. There may be a different one that works better for you.\n\n【19】Hair loss\n---------\n\n【20】Hair loss is a common side effect of chemotherapy, although it does not happen to everyone. Ask your care team if it's likely to be a side effect of the medicines you're taking.\n\n【21】If you do lose hair, it usually starts within a few weeks of your first treatment session. If you lose lots of hair, this typically happens within 1 to 2 months.\n\n【22】It's most common to lose hair from your head, but you can also lose it from other parts of your body, including your arms, legs and face.\n\n【23】The hair loss is almost always temporary. Your hair should start to grow back soon after your treatment has finished.\n\n【24】But sometimes the hair that grows back is a slightly different colour or it may be curlier or straighter than it used to be.\n\n【25】### Coping with hair loss\n\n【26】Hair loss can be upsetting. Talk to your care team if you're finding it difficult to cope with losing your hair.\n\n【27】They understand how distressing it can be and can support you and discuss your options with you.\n\n【28】For example, you may decide you want to wear a wig. Synthetic wigs are available free of charge on the NHS for some people, but you'll usually have to pay for a wig made from real hair.\n\n【29】Other options include headwear, such as a headscarf.\n删除7：<u>Read more about advice about cancer and hair loss.</u>\n\n【30】### Preventing hair loss\n\n【31】It may be possible to reduce the chances of hair loss by wearing a cold cap while you're having chemotherapy.\n\n【32】A cold cap looks like a bicycle helmet and is designed to cool your scalp during a treatment session. This reduces blood flow to your scalp, reducing the amount of medicine that reaches it.\n\n【33】Whether you can use a cold cap depends on the type of cancer you have. Cold caps also work better with certain types of chemotherapy medicine, and they do not always work.\n\n【34】Ask your care team whether a cold cap might help you.\n\n【35】Infections\n----------\n\n【36】Chemotherapy can reduce your body's ability to fight infection. This makes you more likely to get infections that could make you seriously ill.\n\n【37】It's a good idea to take precautions to protect yourself against infection by:\n\n【38】*   washing your hands regularly with soap and water – particularly after going to the toilet, before preparing food and eating, and after touching pets or other animals (as they can have infections that can be dangerous)\n*   trying to avoid close contact with people who have an infection – such as chickenpox or flu\n*   having the annual flu jab\n*   getting vaccinated against COVID-19 – your specialist can give more advice\n\n【39】A course of antibiotics may sometimes be prescribed to reduce your risk of getting an infection.\n\n【40】Anaemia\n-------\n\n【41】Chemotherapy lowers your amount of red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body.\n\n【42】If your red blood cell count drops too low, you'll develop anaemia.\n\n【43】Symptoms of anaemia include:\n\n【44】*   tiredness and lack of energy – this tends to be more severe than the general fatigue associated with chemotherapy\n*   shortness of breath\n*   noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)\n*   a pale complexion\n\n【45】Contact your care team as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms. You may need treatment to increase your number of red blood cells.\n\n【46】### Preventing anaemia\n\n【47】Including a high amount of iron in your diet can help reduce your risk of anaemia, as iron helps the body make red blood cells.\n\n【48】Foods high in iron include:\n\n【49】*   meat, such as beef, pork and lamb\n*   beans and nuts\n*   dried fruit, such as dried apricots\n*   wholegrains, such as brown rice\n*   fortified breakfast cereals\n*   dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\n删除7：<u>Read more about iron deficiency anaemia.</u>\n\n【50】Bruising and bleeding\n---------------------\n\n【51】Chemotherapy can reduce the number of cells called platelets in your blood. These help stop severe bleeding when you cut or injure yourself.\n\n【52】If you have a low number of platelets, you may have:\n\n【53】*   skin that bruises easily\n*   severe nosebleeds\n*   bleeding gums\n\n【54】Tell your care team if you experience these problems. You may need treatment to increase the number of platelets in your blood.\n\n【55】Sore mouth\n----------\n\n【56】Sometimes chemotherapy can make the lining of the mouth sore and irritated. This is known as mucositis.\n\n【57】Symptoms tend to develop a few days after treatment starts and include:\n\n【58】*   the inside of your mouth feeling sore, as if you've burned it by eating very hot food\n*   mouth ulcers, which can become infected\n*   discomfort when eating, drinking and/or talking\n*   a dry mouth\n*   reduced sense of taste\n*   bad breath\n\n【59】Tell your care team if you have any of these problems. They may recommend painkillers or a special mouthwash that can help.\n\n【60】Avoiding spicy, salty or sharp foods can also help.\n\n【61】Laser therapy, where low-levels lasers are used to stimulate healing, have proved effective in treating or preventing mucositis. But as this is a new type of treatment, access to it may be limited.\n\n【62】Mucositis usually gets better a few weeks after chemotherapy finishes.\n\n【63】Loss of appetite\n----------------\n\n【64】You may lose your appetite while you're having chemotherapy, but you should try to drink plenty of fluids and eat what you can.\n\n【65】It may help to:\n\n【66】*   eat smaller meals more often instead of 3 larger meals each day\n*   eat healthy snacks regularly\n*   eat light meals on the day of your treatment\n*   sip drinks slowly through a straw, rather than drinking them straight from a glass\n\n【67】Tell your care team if you're worried about your diet or lack of appetite.\n\n【68】Skin and nail changes\n---------------------\n\n【69】Some chemotherapy medicines can cause temporary changes to your skin.\n\n【70】For example, it may become:\n\n【71】*   dry\n*   slightly discoloured (this may be patchy)\n*   more sensitive to sunlight\n*   red and sore\n*   itchy\n\n【72】Talk to your care team if you have any problems with your skin. They can advise you about creams that can help and how to protect your skin from the sun.\n\n【73】Chemotherapy can also make your nails become brittle or flaky, and white lines may develop across them. This should go back to normal after your treatment has finished.\n\n【74】Using moisturiser on your nails may help and nail varnish can be used to cover your nails during treatment if you like. Avoid using quick drying varnish or false nails as these have an increased risk of infection.\n\n【75】Memory and concentration problems\n---------------------------------\n\n【76】Some people have problems with their short-term memory, concentration and attention span during chemotherapy. You may find that routine tasks take much longer than usual.\n\n【77】It's unclear why this happens, but the symptoms usually improve once treatment is finished.\n\n【78】Things such as using lists, post-it notes, calendars and your mobile phone for reminders can help. Doing some mental exercises, eating well, and getting enough rest may also be useful.\n\n【79】Sleep problems\n--------------\n\n【80】Some people having chemotherapy have difficulty falling asleep, or wake up in the middle of the night and cannot get back to sleep. This is known as insomnia.\n\n【81】The following may help to improve your sleep:\n\n【82】*   set regular times for going to bed and waking up\n*   relax before bedtime – try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\n*   use thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\n*   avoid caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed\n*   avoid watching TV or using a phone, tablet or computer shortly before going to bed\n*   write a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before going to bed, to help you forget about them until the morning\n\n【83】Contact your care team if this advice does not work, as you may need additional treatment.\n删除7：<u>Read more about insomnia.</u>\n\n【84】Sex and fertility issues\n------------------------\n\n【85】Many people find that they lose interest in sex during chemotherapy. This is usually temporary, and your sex drive should gradually return after your treatment has finished.\n\n【86】Some chemotherapy medicines can also reduce fertility in men and women. This is often temporary, but it can be permanent in some cases.\n\n【87】Before starting treatment, ask your care team whether your fertility may be affected. If you're at risk of infertility, they will discuss your options with you.\n\n【88】Women may be able to have their eggs frozen to be used later in IVF. Men may be able to have a sample of their sperm frozen so it can be used for artificial insemination at a later date.\n\n【89】You should avoid becoming pregnant or fathering a child during your treatment, as chemotherapy medicines could harm the baby. Use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom.\n\n【90】Diarrhoea and constipation\n--------------------------\n\n【91】You may have diarrhoea or constipation a few days after you begin chemotherapy.\n\n【92】Your care team can recommend suitable medicines and diet changes that can help.\n\n【93】Emotional issues\n----------------\n\n【94】Having chemotherapy can be a frustrating, stressful and traumatic experience. It's natural to feel anxious and to wonder if your treatment will be successful.\n\n【95】Stress and anxiety can also increase your risk of getting depression.\n\n【96】Speak to your care team if you're struggling to cope emotionally. They can offer support and discuss possible treatment strategies.\n\n【97】Joining a cancer support group may also help. Talking to other people in a similar situation can often reduce feelings of isolation and stress.\n\n【98】The charity Macmillan Cancer Support has a directory of local support groups. You can also call the Macmillan Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am-8pm).\n\n【99】When to get urgent medical advice\n---------------------------------\n\n【100】While the side effects of chemotherapy can be distressing, most are not serious.\n\n【101】Infections can be very serious if not treated immediately. Contact your care team immediately if you have any symptoms of an infection, these include:\n\n【102】*   a temperature of above 37.5C or below 36C\n*   your skin feels warm to touch, or you feel hot and shivery\n*   breathing difficulties\n*   flu-like symptoms, such as muscle aches and pain\n*   a sore mouth\n*   pain when swallowing\n*   being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   pain, swelling, redness, heat and /or a discharge of liquid at the site of a wound (such as a surgical scar) or where an intravenous or catheter line has been put into one of your veins (usually your upper arm)\n\n【103】You should have been given a card with emergency phone numbers to call. Contact a GP or use NHS 111 if you do not have a card or cannot find it.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:09:41", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:13:04", "cost": 203.651}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:13:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:09:40"}

The NHS offers a range of screening tests to different sections of the population.\n\n【5】The aim is to offer screening to the people who are most likely to benefit from it. For example, some screening tests are only offered to newborn babies, while others such as breast screening and abdominal aortic aneurysm screening are only offered to older people.\n\n【6】### Screening results\n\n【7】If you get a normal result (a screen negative result) after a screening test, this means you are at low risk of having the condition you were screened for. This does not mean you will never develop the condition in the future, just that you are low risk at the moment.\n\n【8】If you have a higher-risk result (a screen positive result), it means you may have the condition that you've been tested for. At this point, you will be offered further tests (called diagnostic tests) to confirm if you have the condition. You can then be offered treatment, advice and support.\n\n【9】Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective. However, screening tests are not perfect and they can lead to difficult decisions about having further tests or treatment.\n\n【10】Read on to find out about the benefits, risks and limitations of screening.\n\n【11】What types of screening are offered by the NHS in England?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】An independent expert group called the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the NHS, in all 4 UK countries, on which screening programmes to offer.\n\n【13】The NHS screening programmes currently offered in England are listed below. For more detailed information on each type of screening, follow the links.\n\n【14】You can view screening timelines.\n\n【15】Information:\n\n【16】You can also watch animations about NHS screening:\n\n【17】*   female lifetime NHS screening pathway (Youtube)\n*   male lifetime NHS screening pathway (Youtube)\n\n【18】### Screening in pregnancy\n\n【19】The screening tests offered in pregnancy are:\n\n【20】*   screening for infectious diseases (hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis)\n*   screening for Down's syndrome, Patau's syndrome and Edwards' syndrome\n*   screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia\n*   screening to check the physical development of the baby (known as the 20-week scan or mid-pregnancy scan)\n*   diabetic eye screening if you are pregnant and have type 1 or type 2 diabetes\n\n【21】### Screening for newborn babies\n\n【22】Newborn babies are offered:\n\n【23】*   a physical examination, which includes the eyes, heart, hips and testes\n*   a hearing test\n*   a blood spot test to check if the baby has any of 9 rare conditions\n\n【24】### Diabetic eye screening\n\n【25】From the age of 12, all people with diabetes are offered an annual diabetic eye test to check for early signs of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n【26】### Cervical screening\n\n【27】Cervical screening is offered to all women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 to check the health of cells in the cervix. It is offered every 3 years for those aged 25 to 49, and every 5 years from the ages of 50 to 64.\n\n【28】### Breast screening\n\n【29】Breast screening is offered to women aged 50 to 70 to detect early signs of breast cancer. Women over 70 can self-refer.\n\n【30】### Bowel cancer screening\n\n【31】Everyone aged 60 to 74 is offered a bowel cancer screening home test kit every 2 years.\n\n【32】If you're 75 or over, you can ask for a kit every 2 years by phoning the free bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 60 60.\n\n【33】### Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening\n\n【34】AAA screening is offered to men during the screening year (1 April to 31 March) that they turn 65 to detect abdominal aortic aneurysms (a dangerous swelling in the aorta). Men over 65 can self-refer.\n\n【35】Benefits, risks and limitations of screening\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】### Making an informed choice\n\n【37】Before having any screening test, it's worth finding out about the test itself and what would happen next if you found out you have a higher risk of a particular condition.\n\n【38】Deciding whether or not to have a screening test is a personal choice and one which only you can make. When you are invited for screening, you will receive an information leaflet about the screening test.\n\n【39】You can discuss any aspect of the screening test with your health professional and decide whether or not it's right for you.\n\n【40】Different types of screening have different benefits and risks. Some of these are listed below.\n\n【41】### The benefits of having a screening test include:\n\n【42】*   Screening can detect a problem early, before you have any symptoms.\n*   Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective.\n*   Finding out you have a health problem or an increased chance of a health problem can help people make better informed decisions about their health.\n*   Screening can reduce the chance of developing a condition or its complications.\n*   Some deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms, bowel cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer can be prevented.\n\n【43】### The risks and limitations of screening include:\n\n【44】*   Screening tests are not 100% accurate. You could be told you have a problem when you do not – this is called a \"false positive\" and may lead to some people having unnecessary further tests or treatment as a result of screening. A screening test could also miss a problem – this is called a \"false negative\" and could lead to people ignoring symptoms in the future.\n*   Some screening tests can lead to difficult decisions. For example, if a pregnancy screening test tells you your baby has a higher chance of having a particular condition, you may then be faced with a decision about having further diagnostic tests that involve a risk to your pregnancy. If the diagnostic test is positive, you may then need to decide whether to continue with your pregnancy.\n*   Finding out you may have a health problem can cause considerable anxiety.\n*   Even if your screening test result is normal or negative (meaning you are not at high risk), you could still go on to develop the condition.\n\n【45】### How does the NHS decide which types of screening to offer?\n\n【46】An expert group called the UK National Screening Committee **(**UK NSC) advises the NHS on which screening programmes to offer.\n\n【47】When considering who to screen and which conditions to screen for, the benefits of offering a screening programme are weighed up against the harms. The UK NSC only recommends screening when it believes the benefits to the group offered screening outweigh the harms.\n\n【48】The UK NSC regularly reviews its recommendations on screening for different conditions as new research becomes available. This is usually done every 3 years.\n\n【49】Find out how the UK NSC reviews evidence and monitors the quality of screening programmes.\n\n【50】### Private screening\n\n【51】All screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Private companies offer a range of screening tests that you have to pay for. Some of the tests on offer are not recommended by the UK NSC because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms.\n\n【52】The UK NSC has produced a downloadable leaflet on private screening.\n\n【53】Confidentiality and use of data\n-------------------------------\n\n【54】By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe. The NHS Constitution sets out how the NHS should handle your records to protect your privacy. There are also laws in place to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.\n\n【55】Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them, such as technicians carrying out screening, your GP and any clinicians involved in follow-up tests and treatment. They are also shared with the Government who uses them to check that local screening services are safe and effective. Screening records are sometimes also shared with researchers looking at how to improve the screening programmes.\n删除7：<u>Read more about screening data and confidentiality.</u>\n\n【56】Further information about screening\n-----------------------------------\n\n【57】### Questions about screening results\n\n【58】*   For pregnancy or baby screening results, contact your midwife or health visitor.\n*   For abdominal aortic aneurism or diabetic eye screening, contact a GP or your local screening programme.\n*   For breast screening, cervical screening or bowel cancer screening, contact a GP, who should receive a copy of your results. You can also contact your local breast screening unit, or call the bowel cancer screening helpline on 0800 707 6060.\n\n【59】### Questions about symptoms\n\n【60】Speak to a GP if you have any concerns about your health or need to ask about a family history of cancer.\n\n【61】### Questions about screening practice and policy (England only)\n\n【62】Contact the national screening helpdesk using the online enquiry form, or email PHE.screeninghelpdesk@nhs.net\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 July 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【62】Contact the national screening helpdesk using the online enquiry form, or email PHE.screeninghelpdesk@nhs.net\n", "content": "【0】NHS screening\n=============\n\n【1】**Screening is a way of finding out if people have a higher chance of having a health problem, so that early treatment can be offered or information given to help them make informed decisions.**\n\n【2】This page gives an overview of screening, with links to the different types of screening offered by the NHS in England.\n\n【3】What is screening?\n------------------\n\n【4】Screening is a way of identifying apparently healthy people who may have an increased risk of a particular condition.

If the diagnostic test is positive, you may then need to decide whether to continue with your pregnancy.\n*   Finding out you may have a health problem can cause considerable anxiety.\n*   Even if your screening test result is normal or negative (meaning you are not at high risk), you could still go on to develop the condition.\n\n【45】### How does the NHS decide which types of screening to offer?\n\n【46】An expert group called the UK National Screening Committee **(**UK NSC) advises the NHS on which screening programmes to offer.\n\n【47】When considering who to screen and which conditions to screen for, the benefits of offering a screening programme are weighed up against the harms. The UK NSC only recommends screening when it believes the benefits to the group offered screening outweigh the harms.\n\n【48】The UK NSC regularly reviews its recommendations on screening for different conditions as new research becomes available. This is usually done every 3 years.\n\n【49】Find out how the UK NSC reviews evidence and monitors the quality of screening programmes.\n\n【50】### Private screening\n\n【51】All screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Private companies offer a range of screening tests that you have to pay for. Some of the tests on offer are not recommended by the UK NSC because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms.\n\n【52】The UK NSC has produced a downloadable leaflet on private screening.\n\n【53】Confidentiality and use of data\n-------------------------------\n\n【54】By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe. The NHS Constitution sets out how the NHS should handle your records to protect your privacy. There are also laws in place to ensure that confidentiality is maintained.\n\n【55】Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them, such as technicians carrying out screening, your GP and any clinicians involved in follow-up tests and treatment. They are also shared with the Government who uses them to check that local screening services are safe and effective. Screening records are sometimes also shared with researchers looking at how to improve the screening programmes.\n删除7：<u>Read more about screening data and confidentiality.</u>\n\n【56】Further information about screening\n-----------------------------------\n\n【57】### Questions about screening results\n\n【58】*   For pregnancy or baby screening results, contact your midwife or health visitor.\n*   For abdominal aortic aneurism or diabetic eye screening, contact a GP or your local screening programme.\n*   For breast screening, cervical screening or bowel cancer screening, contact a GP, who should receive a copy of your results.

Their external genitals will either appear as female or have an appearance that is not usual for a boy or girl.**\n\n【3】There are 2 main types of AIS, which affect people in different ways:\n\n【4】*   complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS)\n*   partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS)\n\n【5】Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【6】CAIS is not usually obvious from birth because affected babies have female genitals, including a vagina and labia (folds of skin either side of the vaginal opening).\n\n【7】They'll also have undescended testicles, but this will usually go unnoticed unless they cause a hernia (where they push through a weakness in the surrounding tissue).\n\n【8】The first signs usually begin at puberty, which starts at around the age of 11 or 12.\n\n【9】When a girl with CAIS reaches puberty, she will:\n\n【10】*   develop breasts and have growth spurts as normal, although she may end up slightly taller than usual for a girl\n*   not start having periods\n*   develop little or no pubic and underarm hair\n\n【11】Girls with CAIS do not have a womb or ovaries, so are unable to get pregnant. Their vagina will also be shorter than normal, which may make some sexual acts difficult.\n\n【12】Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The development of children with PAIS can vary.\n\n【14】In many cases, the genitalia at birth is the first sign and affected babies may have:\n\n【15】*   an enlarged clitoris (the sexual organ that allows women to have an orgasm)\n*   partially undescended testicles\n*   hypospadias – where the hole through which urine passes out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end\n\n【16】Children with PAIS are often raised as boys, although they will continue to have a small penis and may develop some breast tissue at puberty.\n\n【17】Some children with PAIS are raised as girls.\n\n【18】Like those with CAIS, people with PAIS do not have a womb or ovaries and will be infertile.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Androgen insensitivity syndrome</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:08:17", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:08:26", "cost": 9.069}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:08:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:08:17"}

It can appear on your tummy, chest, back or neck, and less often on your face or scalp, or near your genitals.\n\n【10】### Widespread rash\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【11】ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/694054/view</u>\n\n【12】Up to 2 weeks after the herald patch appears, a more widespread rash develops, which may continue to spread over the following 2 to 6 weeks.\n\n【13】This rash is small, raised, scaly patches that usually range in size up to 1.5cm. Most people get many patches on their chest, back, tummy, neck, upper arms and upper thighs. The face is not usually affected.\n\n【14】The rash is not painful, but it can be itchy.\n\n【15】In light-skinned people the patches are usually a pinkish-red. In dark-skinned people the patches can sometimes be grey, dark brown or black.\n\n【16】Both the herald patch and rash usually last for 2 to 12 weeks, although they can last for up to 5 months.\n\n【17】After the rash has gone, you may have some darker or lighter areas of skin. These should return to normal within a few months and will not leave permanent scarring.\n\n【18】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【19】See a GP if you have an unexplained rash. They'll usually be able to confirm whether it's pityriasis rosea, or another skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis or ringworm.\n\n【20】If the GP is uncertain, they may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).\n\n【21】Treating pityriasis rosea\n-------------------------\n\n【22】Pityriasis rosea usually gets better without treatment within 12 weeks. Treatment is not needed unless you experience discomfort and itching.\n\n【23】Possible treatments for pityriasis rosea include:\n\n【24】*   emollients – creams that moisturise and soothe the skin. Some emollients can be used as soap, and are often recommended, because normal soap can irritate the rash. You can buy these over the counter from most pharmacists\n*   steroid creams or ointments – such as hydrocortisone and betamethasone cream. These are prescribed by a GP and can reduce swelling and relieve itching\n*   antihistamines – if you're having trouble sleeping because of the itching, a GP may prescribe an antihistamine that will make you feel sleepy, such as hydroxyzine or chlorphenamine\n*   UVB light therapy – if other treatments do not work, you may be referred for UVB light therapy\n\n【25】What causes pityriasis rosea?\n-----------------------------\n\n【26】It's not known what causes pityriasis rosea. One theory is that the rash may be caused by a viral infection.\n\n【27】Pityriasis rosea is not contagious and cannot be spread to other people through physical contact.\n\n【28】Pityriasis versicolor\n---------------------\n\n【29】Pityriasis versicolor is another common skin condition that can be confused with pityriasis rosea, as the rash may look similar.\n\n【30】But there are important differences between these 2 conditions. Pityriasis versicolor is caused by a yeast infection and can be treated with antifungal medicines, including antifungal creams and antifungal shampoos.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 March 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 March 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:13:09", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:13:21", "cost": 12.669}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:13:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:13:08"}

Iron helps make healthy red blood cells, which carry oxygen around your body.\n\n【3】When your body does not have enough iron (iron deficiency anaemia), you can feel tired and lacking in energy. Other symptoms may include paler than usual skin, feeling out of breath and heart palpitations.\n\n【4】Taking ferrous sulfate will increase the iron levels in your blood and improve or prevent the symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】Most people begin to feel better after 3 to 4 weeks, but it may take up to 2 to 4 months for the medicine to work fully.\n\n【7】If you're taking ferrous sulfate to prevent anaemia you probably will not feel any different but that does not mean it's not working.\n\n【8】If you're taking ferrous sulfate on prescription, it's important to take it for as long as your doctor tells you to.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】It's safe to take ferrous sulfate for as long as you need to, provided your doctor has said that it's OK and you are not having any side effects.\n\n【11】How does it compare with other medicines for iron deficiency anaemia?\n\n【12】There are other types of iron, including ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate. There is little difference in how well they work when you take the same dose of iron.\n\n【13】If you have a side effect with one type of iron, it may not happen with another type.\n\n【14】Iron injections can also be used if tablets or drops do not help, or if your iron levels are very low. These would usually be given in hospital.\n\n【15】Your doctor or pharmacist can advise you on the right treatment for you.\n\n【16】Will it give me more energy?\n\n【17】Lack of energy is a common symptom when you have iron deficiency anaemia. Having too little iron means your blood cannot carry enough oxygen around your body. This makes you feel tired.\n\n【18】Taking ferrous sulfate can give you more energy by boosting your iron levels. Your doctor may recommend a blood test within the first 4 weeks to see if it's working.\n\n【19】If you feel tired, but have not been diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia, it's important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking ferrous sulfate. This is because there may be other reasons why you lack energy.\n\n【20】A simple blood test will confirm whether you are anaemic, and your doctor will be able to discuss your results and any treatment with you.\n\n【21】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【22】Ferrous sulfate will not stop any type of contraception working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【23】However, if ferrous sulfate makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【24】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【25】Yes, you can. Ferrous sulfate does not affect you being able to drive or cycle.\n\n【26】Can I drink alcohol while taking ferrous sulfate?\n\n【27】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking ferrous sulfate.\n\n【28】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【29】Some food and drink can make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include:\n\n【30】*   tea and coffee\n*   milk and dairy products – such as yoghurt and cheese\n*   eggs\n\n【31】When you take ferrous sulfate (or when you eat foods that are high in iron), make sure you leave a 2 hour gap before having tea or coffee or any of these foods.\n\n【32】This will help your body take in the iron from ferrous sulfate or from food.\n\n【33】Can lifestyle changes help with iron deficiency?\n\n【34】If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, eating more foods that are rich in iron can help.\n\n【35】Good sources of iron include:\n\n【36】*   dark-green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale\n*   fortified cereals and bread (with added iron)\n*   meat\n*   pulses such as beans, peas and lentils\n*   nuts\n*   dried fruit such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins\n*   wholegrains such as brown rice\n删除11：<u>More in Ferrous sulfate\n-----------------------\n\n【37】*   About ferrous sulfate\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:31", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:35:58", "cost": 26.891}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:35:30"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms in the early stages, but eventually leads to a wide range of problems. It's often diagnosed after a routine blood test or, sometimes, a urine test.**\n\n【3】See a GP if you have any of the symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\n\n【4】Bone pain\n---------\n\n【5】Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones – usually the back, ribs or hips.\n\n【6】The pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement.\n\n【7】Bone fractures and spinal cord compression\n------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and long bones (arms and legs) are most often affected.\n\n【9】Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and, occasionally, compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).\n\n【10】Compression of the spinal cord can cause:\n\n【11】*   pins and needles\n*   numbness and weakness in the legs and feet\n*   problems controlling your bladder and bowels\n\n【12】You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression. It's an emergency and needs immediate investigation and treatment.\n\n【13】Anaemia\n-------\n\n【14】Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in the bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.\n\n【15】If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.\n\n【16】Repeated infections\n-------------------\n\n【17】People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system, the body's natural defence against infection and illness.\n\n【18】You may find you get frequent infections that last for a long time.\n\n【19】Raised calcium levels in the blood\n----------------------------------\n\n【20】A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.\n\n【21】Symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include:\n\n【22】*   extreme thirst\n*   feeling sick\n*   stomach pain\n*   needing to urinate frequently\n*   constipation\n*   confusion and drowsiness\n\n【23】You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of hypercalcaemia, as they need quick investigation and treatment.\n\n【24】Unusual bleeding\n----------------\n\n【25】Some people with multiple myeloma have bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage), such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods.\n\n【26】This is because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood-clotting cells called platelets from being made.\n\n【27】Thickened blood\n---------------\n\n【28】In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is due to the excess proteins that myeloma cells often produce.\n\n【29】This is known as hyperviscosity and can cause problems such as:\n\n【30】*   blurred vision\n*   headaches\n*   dizziness\n*   bleeding from the gums or nose\n*   shortness of breath\n\n【31】Kidney problems\n---------------\n\n【32】Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma. Eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly.\n\n【33】This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure.\n\n【34】Signs of kidney failure can include:\n\n【35】*   weight loss and poor appetite\n*   swollen ankles, feet or hands\n*   tiredness and a lack of energy\n*   shortness of breath\n*   itchy skin\n*   feeling sick\n*   hiccups that won't go away\n\n【36】You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of kidney failure. It's an emergency and needs quick investigation and treatment.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 June 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Multiple myeloma</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:56:09", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:56:19", "cost": 10.48}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:56:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:56:09"}

It usually improves without treatment.\n\n【9】But further tests may be recommended if the condition lasts this long, to check for any underlying health problems.\n\n【10】If your baby's jaundice does not improve over time, or tests show high levels of bilirubin in their blood, they may be admitted to hospital and treated with phototherapy or an exchange transfusion.\n\n【11】These treatments are recommended to reduce the risk of a rare but serious complication of newborn jaundice called kernicterus, which can cause brain damage.\n\n【12】Phototherapy\n------------\n\n【13】Phototherapy is treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight). \n\n【14】It's sometimes used to treat newborn jaundice by making it easier for your baby's liver to break down and remove the bilirubin from your baby's blood.\n\n【15】Phototherapy aims to expose your baby's skin to as much light as possible.\n\n【16】Your baby will be placed under a light either in a cot or incubator with their eyes covered.\n\n【17】It will usually be stopped for 30 minutes so you can feed your baby, change their nappy and give them a cuddle.\n\n【18】If your baby's jaundice does not improve, intensified phototherapy may be offered. \n\n【19】This involves increasing the amount of light used or using another source of light, such as a light blanket, at the same time.\n\n【20】Treatment cannot be stopped for breaks during intensified phototherapy, so you will not be able to breastfeed or hold your baby. But you can give your baby expressed milk.\n\n【21】During phototherapy, you baby's temperature will be monitored to make sure they're not getting too hot, and they'll be checked for signs of dehydration.\n\n【22】Intravenous fluids may be needed if your baby is becoming dehydrated and they are not able to drink enough.\n\n【23】The bilirubin levels will be tested every 4 to 6 hours after phototherapy has started, to check if the treatment is working.\n\n【24】Once your baby's bilirubin levels have stabilised or started to fall, they will be checked every 6 to 12 hours.\n\n【25】Phototherapy will be stopped when the bilirubin levels fall to a safe level, which usually takes a day or two.\n\n【26】Phototherapy is generally very effective for newborn jaundice and has few side effects.\n\n【27】Exchange transfusion\n--------------------\n\n【28】If your baby has a very high level of bilirubin in their blood or phototherapy has not been effective, they may need a complete blood transfusion, known as an exchange transfusion.\n\n【29】During an exchange transfusion, your baby's blood will be removed through a thin plastic tube placed in blood vessels in their umbilical cord, arms or legs.\n\n【30】The blood is replaced with blood from a suitable matching donor (someone with the same blood group).\n\n【31】As the new blood will not contain bilirubin, the overall level of bilirubin in your baby's blood will fall quickly.\n\n【32】Your baby will be closely monitored throughout the transfusion process, which can take several hours to complete. Any problems that may arise, such as bleeding, will be treated.\n\n【33】Your baby's blood will be tested within 2 hours of treatment to check if it's been successful.\n\n【34】If the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood remains high, the procedure may need to be repeated.\n\n【35】Other treatments\n----------------\n\n【36】If jaundice is caused by an underlying health problem, such as an infection, this usually needs to be treated.\n\n【37】If the jaundice is caused by rhesus disease (when the mother has rhesus-negative blood and the baby has rhesus-positive blood), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used.\n\n【38】IVIG is usually only used if phototherapy alone has not worked and the level of bilirubin in the blood is continuing to rise.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 February 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Kernicterus</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:55:51", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:56:03", "cost": 12.076}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:56:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:55:51"}

Reducing the risk</u>\n\n【2】**A number of things may help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer.**\n\n【3】Diet and lifestyle\n------------------\n\n【4】Exercising regularly and eating a healthy, balanced diet are known to help prevent many forms of cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\n【5】Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, take regular exercise and who have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.</u>\n\n【6】If you've experienced the menopause (when your monthly periods stop), it's very important you're not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\n删除7：<u>Read more about preventing breast cancer.</u>\n\n【7】Breastfeeding\n-------------\n\n【8】Studies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who do not.\n\n【9】The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it could be because women do not ovulate as regularly while they're breastfeeding and their oestrogen levels remain stable.\n\n【10】Medicine\n--------\n\n【11】Medicines called tamoxifen and raloxifene are available on the NHS for women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. They are usually only given by breast cancer specialists.\n\n【12】These medicines may not be suitable if you've had blood clots or womb cancer in the past, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. If you've already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts you will not be offered these medicines because your risk of developing breast cancer is very small.\n\n【13】Either tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who've had the menopause.\n\n【14】A course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.\n\n【15】Raloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting.\n\n【16】Tamoxifen and raloxifene can increase your risk of developing blood clots, so you should stop taking them before any planned surgery.\n\n【17】Raloxifene is not currently licensed for reducing the chances of getting breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing it. However, it can still be given by a specialist.\n\n【18】Breast screening\n----------------\n\n【19】Breast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. The procedure uses mammograms, where X-rays are taken, to create an image of the inside of your breasts.\n\n【20】The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are aged 50 years to 70. In some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a trial looking at whether the screening age range should be extended.\n\n【21】NHS breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. This is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue, which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities.\n\n【22】Speak to your GP if you're below screening age and worried about changes in your breasts, or you have a family history of breast cancer.\n删除7：<u>Read more about breast cancer screening.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:24:56", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:03", "cost": 7.151}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:24:56"}

You may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your care team.\n\n【7】For example, you may want to find out:\n\n【8】*   what the aim of treatment is, for example, is it being used to cure the cancer, relieve your symptoms or make other treatments more effective\n*   about possible side effects and what can be done to prevent or relieve them\n*   how effective chemotherapy is likely to be\n*   whether any other treatments could be tried instead\n\n【9】If you agree with your care team's recommendation, they'll start to plan your treatment once you've given your consent to treatment.\n\n【10】### Tests and checks\n\n【11】Before chemotherapy begins, you'll have tests to check your general health and make sure the treatment is suitable for you.\n\n【12】The tests you'll have may include:\n\n【13】*   blood tests to check things such as how well your liver and kidneys are working, and how many blood cells you have\n*   X-rays and scans to check the size of your cancer\n*   measurements of your height and weight to help your team work out the correct dose\n\n【14】During treatment you'll also have tests to monitor your progress.\n\n【15】### Your treatment plan\n\n【16】Chemotherapy involves several treatment sessions, typically spread over a few months.\n\n【17】Before treatment starts, your care team will make a plan that outlines:\n\n【18】*   the type of chemotherapy you'll have\n*   how many treatment sessions you'll need\n*   how often you'll need treatment – after each treatment you'll have a break before the next session, to allow your body to recover\n\n【19】Your treatment plan will depend on things such as the type of cancer you have and what the aim of treatment is.\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【20】*   Cancer Research UK: planning chemotherapy\n*   Macmillan: chemotherapy explained\n\n【21】</u>\nHow chemotherapy is given\n-------------------------\n\n【22】### Into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy)\n\n【23】In most cases, chemotherapy is given directly into a vein. This is known as intravenous chemotherapy.\n\n【24】This usually involves medicine being given slowly from a bag of fluid that's attached with a tube to one of your veins.\n\n【25】This can be done using:\n\n【26】*   a cannula – a small tube that's placed into a vein in the back of your hand or lower arm for a short time\n*   a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line – a small tube inserted into a vein in your arm that usually stays in place for several weeks or months\n*   a central line – similar to a PICC, but inserted into your chest and connected to one of the veins near your heart\n*   an implanted port – a small device inserted under your skin that's kept in place until your treatment course finishes; medicine is given using a needle inserted into the device through the skin\n\n【27】The time it takes to get a dose of intravenous chemotherapy can range from a few minutes, to several hours, to several days.\n\n【28】You usually go into hospital for the treatment and go home when it's finished.\n\n【29】### Tablets (oral chemotherapy)\n\n【30】Sometimes chemotherapy is given as tablets. This is known as oral chemotherapy.\n\n【31】You'll need to go into hospital at the start of each treatment session to get the tablets and have a check-up, but you can usually take the medicine at home.\n\n【32】Make sure you follow the instructions given by your care team. Taking too much or not enough medicine may reduce its effectiveness and could be dangerous.\n\n【33】Contact your care team if you have any problems with your medicine, such as forgetting to take a tablet or being sick shortly after taking one.\n\n【34】### Other types of chemotherapy\n\n【35】Less commonly, chemotherapy may be given as:\n\n【36】*   injections under the skin, known as subcutaneous chemotherapy\n*   injections into a muscle, known as intramuscular chemotherapy\n*   injections into the spine, known as intrathecal chemotherapy\n*   a skin cream\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【37】*   Cancer Research UK: how you have chemotherapy\n*   Macmillan: how chemotherapy can be given\n\n【38】</u>\nIssues during treatment\n-----------------------\n\n【39】During chemotherapy treatment, there are some important things to be aware of.\n\n【40】### Pregnancy and contraception\n\n【41】Women should avoid becoming pregnant while having chemotherapy, as many chemotherapy medicines can cause birth defects.\n\n【42】Use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, and contact your care team immediately if you think you may have become pregnant.\n\n【43】Men having chemotherapy should use condoms throughout their course of treatment, even if their partner is using contraception删除7：<u>\n\n【44】Cancer Research UK has more about sex and chemotherapy.</u>\n\n【45】### Taking other medicines\n\n【46】While you're having chemotherapy, check with your care team before you take any other medicine – including over-the-counter medicines and herbal remedies.\n\n【47】Other medicines could react unpredictably with your chemotherapy medicine, which may affect how well it works and could cause dangerous side effects.\n\n【48】### Side effects\n\n【49】Chemotherapy can cause a range of unpleasant side effects.\n\n【50】### Deciding to stop treatment\n\n【51】Some people decide that the benefits of chemotherapy are not worth the poor quality of life due to the side effects.\n\n【52】If you're struggling with the treatment and are having doubts about whether to continue, it's a good idea to speak to your care team.\n\n【53】Your care team can give you advice about the likely benefits of continuing with treatment, but the final decision to continue or stop is yours.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Chemotherapy</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Side effects</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:19:04", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:21:31", "cost": 147.017}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:21:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:19:03"}

It may eventually require treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\n\n【13】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【14】See a GP if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease.\n\n【15】The symptoms of kidney disease can be caused by many less serious conditions, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis.\n\n【16】If you do have CKD, it's best to get it diagnosed as soon as possible.

This increases the amount of pee that your bladder can hold and reduces your need to pee as frequently or as urgently.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】Mirabegron starts to work after about 3 to 4 hours to relax the muscles around your bladder.\n\n【6】However, it can take up to 4 to 8 weeks for you to notice any improvements in your symptoms.\n\n【7】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【8】Mirabegron is generally safe to take long term, as long as you're not bothered by side effects.\n\n【9】Many people take it for several months or even years without any problems.\n\n【10】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【11】Do not stop taking mirabegron without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【12】If you stop taking this medicine, it will take about 10 days for it to be completely out of your body.\n\n【13】Your symptoms of an overactive bladder may come back or get worse.\n\n【14】How does mirabegron compare with other medicines for bladder problems?\n\n【15】Mirabegron is not usually the first choice of treatment for an overactive bladder.\n\n【16】Your doctor will usually try you on a type of medicine called an antimuscarinic first.\n\n【17】Antimuscarinics include:\n\n【18】*   darifenacin\n*   fesoterodine\n*   oxybutynin\n*   propiverine\n*   solifenacin\n*   tolterodine\n*   trospium\n\n【19】If antimuscarinics are not suitable for you, do not help, or give you side effects, your doctor may want to try you on mirabegron. It works in a slightly different way to antimuscarinics.\n\n【20】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【21】Mirabegron does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【22】But if mirabegron makes you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【23】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【24】Yes, you can usually drive or cycle while taking mirabegron.\n\n【25】However, if you feel dizzy, do not drive, ride a bike or operate machinery until you feel OK again.\n\n【26】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【27】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking mirabegron删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【28】Can I drink alcohol while taking mirabegron?\n\n【29】Drinking alcohol does not affect the way mirabegron works.\n\n【30】However, drinking alcohol can make your symptoms worse, such as needing to pee more often or needing to pee urgently. It can also affect your sleep and make you more likely to have to get up in the night to pee.\n\n【31】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【32】You can eat normally while taking mirabegron.\n\n【33】However, some drinks may irritate your bladder and make your urinary symptoms worse.\n\n【34】These drinks include:\n\n【35】*   drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, hot chocolate, cola and energy drinks\n*   alcohol\n*   fizzy drinks\n*   drinks with artificial sweeteners including diet drinks\n*   citrus fruit juices, such as orange, grapefruit and lime juice\n\n【36】Cutting back on or avoiding these drinks may help your urinary symptoms.\n\n【37】Can lifestyle changes help with an overactive bladder?\n\n【38】There are a number of lifestyle changes that may help your symptoms. It's a good idea to:\n\n【39】*   cut back on or avoid drinks that can irritate your bladder, such as drinks containing caffeine\n*   not drink too much or too little fluid during the day, as this can make incontinence worse\n*   lose any excess weight if you need to, by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly\n\n【40】Treatments for urinary incontinence such as bladder training and pelvic floor muscle training can help with your symptoms.\n\n【41】There are also incontinence products to help you manage your symptoms while you're waiting for treatment to start working.\n\n【42】Speak to your doctor if you'd like more information about these treatments or products.\n删除11：<u>More in Mirabegron\n------------------\n\n【43】*   About mirabegron\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 July 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 July 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:18", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:25:32", "cost": 13.958}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:25:18"}

Several tests will be needed to check for these features.\n\n【4】Finding out about your family's medical history is also important because tuberous sclerosis can sometimes run in families.\n\n【5】Tests for tuberous sclerosis\n----------------------------\n\n【6】Tests you may have to check for tuberous sclerosis include:\n\n【7】*   an eye examination – to check for eye tumours\n*   a skin examination – to look for abnormal growths or patches of pale or thickened skin\n*   an MRI scan – to detect tumours in the brain or kidneys\n*   a CT scan or ultrasound scan – to detect tumours in the kidneys, heart or lungs\n*   an electroencephalogram (EEG) – to detect abnormal electrical activity within the brain associated with epilepsy\n*   an electrocardiogram (ECG) – to detect abnormal electrical activity in the heart that could be caused by heart tumours\n\n【8】A genetic blood test to look for the faulty genes that cause tuberous sclerosis can also help make a diagnosis, although it isn't always reliable.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 09 August 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 09 August 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Features</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:23", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:32:46", "cost": 22.853}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:49", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:32:23"}

That's because it takes around a week for mirtazapine levels to build up in your body, and then a few weeks longer for your body to adapt and get used to it.\n\n【6】Do not stop taking mirtazapine just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.\n\n【7】How will it make me feel?\n\n【8】Antidepressants like mirtazapine help to gradually lift your mood so you feel better.\n\n【9】You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. You'll hopefully be more relaxed about things that used to worry you.\n\n【10】Mirtazapine will not change your personality, it will simply help you feel like yourself again.\n\n【11】Do not expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.\n\n【12】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【13】Mirtazapine is generally safe to take for a long time. There do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months or years.\n\n【14】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【15】If you've been feeling better for 6 months or more, your doctor may suggest coming off mirtazapine.\n\n【16】Your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks, or longer if you've been taking mirtazapine for a long time.\n\n【17】This is to help prevent you getting any withdrawal symptoms as you come off the medicine.\n\n【18】Side effects can include:\n\n【19】*   feeling anxious, dizzy or sick\n*   numbness or tingling in your hands or feet\n*   headaches\n*   shaking\n\n【20】### Important\n\n【21】Do not stop taking mirtazapine suddenly, or without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【22】How does mirtazapine compare with other antidepressants?\n\n【23】Mirtazapine is not any better or worse than other antidepressants. Sometimes people get on better with one antidepressant than another.\n\n【24】If you're not feeling any better after 6 weeks, talk to your doctor. They may suggest that you try a different medicine.\n\n【25】Are there other treatments for depression?\n\n【26】Taking antidepressants, including mirtazapine, is just one of many ways to treat depression.\n\n【27】Other treatments that may help include:\n\n【28】*   talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy\n*   exercise programmes\n*   help to get a good night's sleep\n\n【29】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【30】*   how long you've had depression\n*   your symptoms\n*   whether you've had depression before\n*   whether previous treatment has worked\n*   how likely you are to stick with your treatment\n*   the potential side effects\n*   your preferences and priorities\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Mirtazapine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】However, if mirtazapine makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【34】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【35】Some people cannot concentrate properly while they are taking mirtazapine. It can also make you feel sleepy.\n\n【36】When you first start taking mirtazapine, it's a good idea to stop driving and cycling for the first few days until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\n【37】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【38】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking mirtazapine删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【39】Can I drink alcohol while taking mirtazapine?\n\n【40】You can drink alcohol while taking mirtazapine but it may make you feel sleepy and unsteady on your feet.\n\n【41】It might be best to stop drinking alcohol for the first few days of treatment until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【42】Drinking alcohol every day or in large amounts can make your symptoms worse. It also makes it harder for mirtazapine to work properly.\n\n【43】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【44】You can eat and drink normally while taking mirtazapine.\n\n【45】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【46】Mirtazapine can make you feel more hungry than usual, so you may put on weight.\n\n【47】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking mirtazapine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【48】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【49】Taking cannibis with mirtazapine can make you feel very sleepy, especially if you've just started taking mirtazapine.\n\n【50】It can be dangerous to take mirtazapine with:\n\n【51】*   methadone\n*   stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine\n*   hallucinogens like LSD\n*   novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone\n\n【52】Find out about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【53】### Important\n\n【54】Mirtazapine has not been properly tested with recreational drugs.

This causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips.\n\n【8】Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   you think you might have temporal arteritis\n\n【10】It can lead to serious problems like stroke and blindness if not treated quickly.\n\n【11】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【12】Tests for temporal arteritis\n----------------------------\n\n【13】If you see a GP about temporal arteritis, they’ll ask about your symptoms and examine your temples.\n\n【14】After having some blood tests, you'll be referred to a specialist.\n\n【15】They may carry out further tests to help diagnose temporal arteritis.\n\n【16】You may have:\n\n【17】*   an ultrasound scan of your temples\n*   a biopsy under local anaesthetic – where a small piece of the temporal artery is removed and checked for signs of temporal arteritis\n\n【18】If you have problems with your vision, you should have a same-day appointment with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) at a hospital eye department.\n\n【19】Treatment for temporal arteritis\n--------------------------------\n\n【20】Temporal arteritis is treated with steroid medicine, usually prednisolone.\n\n【21】Treatment will be started before temporal arteritis is confirmed because of the risk of vision loss if it's not dealt with quickly.\n\n【22】There are 2 stages of treatment:\n\n【23】1.  An initial high dose of steroids for a few weeks to help bring your symptoms under control.\n2.  A lower steroid dose (after your symptoms have improved) given over a longer period of time, possibly several years.\n\n【24】A small number of people may need to take steroids for the rest of their life.\n\n【25】You'll have regular follow-ups to see how you're doing and check for any side effects you may have.\n\n【26】### Important: Steroids\n\n【27】Do not suddenly stop taking steroids unless your doctor tells you to. Stopping a prescribed course of medicine could make you very ill.\n\n【28】### Other treatments\n\n【29】You may also need to take other types of medicine if you have temporal arteritis, including: :\n\n【30】*   **low-dose aspirin** – to reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack, which can happen if the arteries to your heart are affected\n*   **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** – to lower your risk of getting a stomach problem like indigestion or a stomach ulcer, which can be a side effect of taking prednisolone\n*   **bisphosphonate therapy** – to reduce the risk of osteoporosis when taking prednisolone\n*   **immunosuppressants** – to allow steroid medicine to be reduced and help prevent temporal arteritis coming back\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:16", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:47:29", "cost": 12.044}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:47:16"}

It's not a steroid.\n\n【3】Bronchodilators work by relaxing the muscles of the airways into the lungs. This makes it easier to breathe.\n\n【4】Tiotropium may also be called an anticholinergic (or antimuscarinic), which is a type of bronchodilator. Anticholinergics widen the airways by blocking certain nerves that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】A tiotropium inhaler does not work straight away.\n\n【7】You'll usually start to find it easier to breathe after using a tiotropium inhaler for 3 to 7 days.\n\n【8】It's a long-acting medicine, which means that once you use your inhaler, the medicine is slowly released in your body. This means that you can use the inhaler just once a day. It's important to use it regularly to help prevent symptoms.\n\n【9】Once your symptoms have improved, you may find you need to use your other inhaler (called a reliever) less often.\n\n【10】If your shortness of breath or wheezing does not get better after 7 days of using a tiotropium inhaler, or if it gets worse, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Tiotropium is a safe medicine. There's no evidence that it causes any lasting problems even if you use it for many years.\n\n【13】What will happen if I stop using it?\n\n【14】Do not stop using your tiotropium inhaler without speaking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】If you have an inhaler to control your asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your breathing problems may return if you suddenly stop using it.\n\n【16】You might feel wheezy or short of breath. Your chest may feel tight and you could start to cough.\n\n【17】How does it compare with other medicines for breathing problems?\n\n【18】As well as tiotropium inhalers there are other preventer inhalers that contain a similar type of medicine, such as glycopyrronium and umeclidinium. There are also other types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers such as formoterol and salmeterol.\n\n【19】Other types of inhalers that can help prevent symptoms of COPD or asthma are steroid inhalers, such as beclometasone or fluticasone.\n\n【20】They may be used in different combinations to help you breathe more easily and prevent other symptoms.\n\n【21】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【22】Tiotropium does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【23】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【24】For most people, using a tiotropium inhaler will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n\n【25】However, if your eyesight is affected in any way or you are dizzy, do not drive or cycle.\n\n【26】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【27】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while using tiotropium删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【28】Can I drink alcohol while using tiotropium inhalers?\n\n【29】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using tiotropium inhalers.\n\n【30】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【31】You can eat and drink normally while using tiotropium inhalers.\n\n【32】Can lifestyle changes help with asthma or COPD?\n\n【33】There are several things you can do to help your condition when you're living with asthma or living with COPD. These include:\n\n【34】*   quitting smoking – not smoking can significantly reduce how severe and frequent your symptoms are\n*   exercising regularly – exercise is unlikely to trigger your symptoms once you're on appropriate treatment\n*   eating healthily – aim for a healthy, balanced diet and lose excess weight if you need to\n*   getting vaccinated – it's a good idea to have the annual flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine when offered, and the COVID-19 vaccine if you're eligible\n*   trying an air filter – they do not remove all the allergens but some people find they help their symptoms\n删除11：<u>More in Tiotropium inhalers\n---------------------------\n\n【35】*   About tiotropium inhalers\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using them with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 October 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 October 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:42:58", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:09", "cost": 10.755}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:42:58"}

Overview\n2.  Diagnosis\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other lung conditions, such as** **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)****.**\n\n【3】A GP can refer you to hospital specialists for a number of tests to help rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【4】Medical history and examination\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】Your doctor will ask about your medical history and whether there are other factors that could be causing a problem with your lungs, such as whether you:\n\n【6】*   smoke or have smoked in the past\n*   have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos\n*   have other medical conditions\n\n【7】They may also:\n\n【8】*   check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis)\n*   look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing)\n*   ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless\n\n【9】Breathing and blood tests\n-------------------------\n\n【10】Lung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests) assess how well your lungs work and can help indicate what the problem may be.\n\n【11】These tests measure:\n\n【12】*   how quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs\n*   how much air your lungs can hold\n*   how well your lungs transfer oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide from it (this can be checked using a blood test)\n\n【13】A commonly used lung function test is spirometry. During the test, you breathe into a mouthpiece that's attached to a monitor.\n\n【14】Chest X-ray and CT scan\n-----------------------\n\n【15】A chest X-ray does not show the lungs in much detail, but can help doctors spot some more obvious problems that could be causing your symptoms, such as cancer or a build-up of fluid.\n\n【16】If IPF is suspected, the chest X-ray will be followed by a CT scan.\n\n【17】A CT scan is similar to an X-ray, but lots more images are taken and these are put together by a computer to create a more detailed image of your lungs.\n\n【18】This can help your doctor spot signs of scarring in your lungs.\n\n【19】Bronchoscopy\n------------\n\n【20】If doctors are still not sure what the problem is after these tests, they may suggest having a bronchoscopy.\n\n【21】This is a test where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera (bronchoscope) is passed down into your airways.\n\n【22】Your doctor will look for anything abnormal and may take small tissue samples for testing.\n\n【23】You'll usually be awake during a bronchoscopy and it may cause coughing.\n\n【24】Local anaesthetic will be used to numb your throat so it does not hurt, and you may also be given a sedative injection that will make you feel sleepy during the procedure.\n\n【25】Lung biopsy\n-----------\n\n【26】If other tests are not conclusive, a lung biopsy may need to be carried out.\n\n【27】This involves keyhole surgery to remove a small sample of lung tissue so it can be analysed for signs of scarring.\n\n【28】This is performed under a general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. \n\n【29】Your surgeon makes several small cuts in your side and an endoscope, a thin tube with a camera and a light at the end, is inserted into the area between the lungs and the chest wall.\n\n【30】The surgeon can see the lung tissue through the endoscope and is able to obtain a small sample.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:33:28", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:33:55", "cost": 26.78}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:33:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:33:28"}

Around 8 out of every 10 pregnant women feel sick (nausea), are sick (vomiting) or both during pregnancy. This does not just happen in the morning.\n\n【2】For most women, this improves or stops completely by around weeks 12 to 20, although for some women it can last longer.\n\n【3】Some pregnant women experience very bad nausea and vomiting. They might be sick many times a day and be unable to keep food or drink down, which can impact on their daily life.\n\n【4】This excessive nausea and vomiting is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and often needs hospital treatment.\n\n【5】Exactly how many pregnant women get HG is not known as some cases may go unreported, but it's thought to be around 1 to 3 in every 100.\n\n【6】If you are being sick frequently and cannot keep food down, tell your midwife or doctor, or contact the hospital as soon as possible. There is a risk you may become dehydrated, and your midwife or doctor can make sure you get the right treatment.\n\n【7】Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum\n----------------------------------\n\n【8】HG is much worse than the normal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.\n\n【9】Signs and symptoms of HG include:\n\n【10】*   prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting\n*   dehydration – symptoms include feeling thirsty, tired, dizzy or lightheaded, not peeing very much, and having dark yellow and strong-smelling pee\n*   weight loss\n\n【11】Unlike regular pregnancy sickness, HG may not get better by 16 to 20 weeks. It may not clear up completely until the baby is born, although some symptoms may improve at around 20 weeks.\n\n【12】See your GP or midwife if you have severe nausea and vomiting. Getting help early can help you avoid dehydration and weight loss.\n\n【13】There are other conditions that can cause nausea and vomiting, and your doctor will need to rule these out first.\n\n【14】See videos and written interviews of women talking about their experiences of hyperemesis gravidarum on the healthtalk website.\n\n【15】What causes hyperemesis gravidarum?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】It's not known exactly what causes HG, or why some women get it and others do not. There is evidence that it is linked to the changing hormones in your body that occur during pregnancy.\n\n【17】There is some evidence that it runs in families, so if you have a mother or sister who has had HG in a pregnancy, you may be more likely to get it yourself.\n\n【18】If you have had HG in a previous pregnancy, you are more likely to get it in your next pregnancy than women who have never had it before, so it's worth planning in advance.\n\n【19】Treating hyperemesis gravidarum\n-------------------------------\n\n【20】There are medicines that can be used in pregnancy, including the first 12 weeks, to help improve the symptoms of HG. These include anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs, steroids, or a combination of these.\n\n【21】You may need to try different types of medicine until you find what works best for you.\n\n【22】You can visit the Bumps website to find out which medicines are safe to use in pregnancy.\n\n【23】If your nausea and vomiting cannot be controlled, you may need to be admitted to hospital. This is so doctors can assess your condition and give you the right treatment to protect the health of you and your baby.\n\n【24】Treatment can include intravenous fluids, which are given directly into a vein through a drip. If you have severe vomiting, the anti-sickness drugs may also need to be given into a vein or a muscle.\n\n【25】The charity Pregnancy Sickness Support has information and tips on coping with nausea and vomiting, including HG.\n\n【26】Will hyperemesis gravidarum harm my baby?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【27】HG can make you feel very unwell, but it's unlikely to harm your baby if treated effectively.\n\n【28】However, if it causes you to lose weight during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that your baby may be born smaller than expected (have a low birthweight).\n\n【29】How you might feel\n------------------\n\n【30】The nausea and vomiting of HG can impact your life at a time when you were expecting to be enjoying pregnancy and looking forward to the birth of your baby.\n\n【31】It can affect you both emotionally and physically. The symptoms can be hard to cope with. Without treatment HG may also lead to further health complications, such as depression or tears in your oesophagus.\n\n【32】Severe sickness can be exhausting and stop you doing everyday tasks, such as going to work or even getting out of bed.\n\n【33】In addition to feeling very unwell and tired, you might also feel:\n\n【34】*   anxious about going out or being too far from home in case you need to vomit\n*   isolated because you do not know anyone who understands what it's like to have HG\n*   confused as to why this is happening to you\n*   unsure about how to cope with the rest of the pregnancy if you continue to feel very ill\n\n【35】If you feel any of these, do not keep it to yourself. Talk to your midwife or doctor, and explain the impact HG is having on your life and how it is making you feel. You could also talk to a partner, family members and friends if you want to.\n\n【36】If you want to talk to someone who has been through HG, you can contact Pregnancy Sickness Support's help section. They have a support network across the UK and can put you in touch with someone who has had HG.\n\n【37】Bear in mind that HG is much worse than regular pregnancy sickness. It is not the result of anything you have or have not done, and you do need treatment and support.\n\n【38】Another pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【39】If you have had HG before, it's likely you will get it again in another pregnancy.\n\n【40】If you decide on another pregnancy, it can help to plan ahead, such as arranging child care so you can get plenty of rest.\n\n【41】You could try doing things that helped last time.\n\n【42】Talk to your doctor about starting medicine early.\n\n【43】Blood clots and hyperemesis gravidarum\n--------------------------------------\n\n【44】Because HG can cause dehydration, there's also an increased risk of having a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis), although this is rare. \n\n【45】If you are dehydrated and immobile, there is treatment that you can be given to prevent blood clots.\n删除7：<u>Read more about how to prevent deep vein thrombosis.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Pregnancy complications\n-------------------------------\n\n【46】*   Deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension) and pregnancy\n*   Itching and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy\n*   Severe vomiting in pregnancy\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:18:28", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:18:49", "cost": 21.398}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:18:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:18:26"}

Insulin is the hormone that controls the level of sugar in your blood.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】You may not feel any different when taking glimepiride as you may not have any symptoms with type 2 diabetes. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【6】Glimepiride reduces blood sugar levels in 2 to 3 hours.\n\n【7】It helps keep your blood sugar level stable and will reduce your chance of getting health problems due to diabetes in the future.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Glimepiride is safe to take for a long time. There's no evidence that it harms your general health or your pancreas.\n\n【10】However, glimepiride may stop working properly after a while. Your doctor may want to try you on a different medicine, or start prescribing another diabetes medicine along with glimepiride.\n\n【11】Are there other medicines that treat type 2 diabetes?\n\n【12】Glimepiride belongs to a group of medicines called sulfonylureas. These include gliclazide, glibenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide.\n\n【13】There are several other types of medicines that also treat type 2 diabetes including:\n\n【14】*   metformin\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors, like saxagliptin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, like exenatide (given by injection)\n*   insulin (given by injection)\n\n【15】Metformin is usually the first choice of medicine used for treating type 2 diabetes.\n\n【16】Glimepiride can be prescribed on its own or together with other diabetes medicines.\n\n【17】It's usually prescribed if you cannot take metformin, or if metformin on its own is not keeping your blood sugar under control.\n\n【18】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【19】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【20】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate (FP92A). You can get an application form at your GP surgery. Once you've filled in the form, ask your doctor to sign it.\n\n【21】Can I take glimepiride before surgery?\n\n【22】If you're going to have an operation, tell your doctor beforehand that you're taking glimepiride.\n\n【23】They may switch you to insulin for a few days before and after your surgery.\n\n【24】This is because glimepiride increases your risk of low blood sugar during the operation. Low blood sugar can be difficult to detect when you're put to sleep with general anaesthetic.\n\n【25】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【26】Glimepiride does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【27】But talk to your doctor before starting to take contraceptive pills if you're already taking glimepiride. They may change your dose of glimepiride. This is because contraceptive pills change how your body handles sugar.\n\n【28】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【29】If your blood sugar levels are stable, taking glimepiride should not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machinery or tools.\n\n【30】However, if your blood sugar levels become too low, this can reduce your concentration. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle, or use machines or tools until you feel better.\n\n【31】If your eyesight if affected by changes in your blood sugar, do not drive or use machinery until you can see clearly again. See your doctor or optician if your vision does not get better.\n\n【32】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【33】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking glimepiride删除7：<u> GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【34】Can I drink alcohol while taking glimepiride?\n\n【35】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking glimepiride. But it's best to drink no more than 2 units a day. Drinking more than this can increase your risk of low blood sugar.\n\n【36】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【37】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar, such as:\n\n【38】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【39】However, it's important to always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners will not help.\n\n【40】You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.\n\n【41】Be careful when eating food and drink that contains karela (also called bitter gourd). This is because it can lower your blood sugar levels which means your diabetes is not controlled as well as it should be. Karela is used to flavour foods such as curries. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.\n\n【42】Will I put on weight or lose weight?\n\n【43】Glimepiride can make you feel more hungry and some people find they put on weight.\n\n【44】Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes. Regular exercise will also help you to keep your weight stable.\n\n【45】If you are already overweight, talk to your doctor about the best way to avoid putting on any more weight.\n\n【46】Glimepiride will not help you lose weight.\n\n【47】Can lifestyle changes help to control diabetes?\n\n【48】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These include:\n\n【49】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing any excess weight\n*   not smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol\n*   exercising – 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal\n\n【50】Glimepiride is usually prescribed when diet and exercise alone have not been enough to control your blood sugar levels.\n删除11：<u>More in Glimepiride\n-------------------\n\n【51】*   About glimepiride\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking glimepiride with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 15:02:47", "endTime": "2024/09/05 15:03:00", "cost": 12.811}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 23:02:46"}

It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as:\n\n【6】*   what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible, including whether you might need care at home or in a care home\n*   whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in\n*   whether you need any financial assistance\n删除7：<u>Read more about care plans</u>\n\n【7】Medicine\n--------\n\n【8】Medicine cannot stop dementia with Lewy bodies getting worse, but for some people it can help reduce some of the symptoms.\n\n【9】### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n\n【10】Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Reminyl), may help improve hallucinations, confusion and sleepiness in some people.\n\n【11】These work by increasing levels of a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain, which improves the ability of the brain cells to send signals to each other.\n\n【12】Common side effects include feeling and being sick, diarrhoea, headaches, tiredness and muscle cramps.\n\n【13】### Memantine\n\n【14】This medicine is not an AChE inhibitor. It works by blocking the effects of a large amount of a chemical in the brain called glutamate.\n\n【15】Memantine is used for moderate or severe dementia with Lewy bodies.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along your nerves. The tumours are usually non-cancerous (benign) but may cause a range of symptoms.**\n\n【3】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is covered separately because it has different symptoms and causes. It's also much more common than NF2.\n\n【4】Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】Almost everyone with NF2 develops tumours along the nerves responsible for hearing and balance. These usually cause symptoms such as:\n\n【6】*   hearing loss that gradually gets worse over time\n*   hearing ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus)\n*   balance problems – particularly when moving in the dark or walking on uneven ground\n\n【7】You can also get other tumours inside the brain or spinal cord, or along the nerves to the arms and legs. This can lead to symptoms such as weakness in the arms and legs, and persistent headaches.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of NF2</u>\n\n【8】Causes of neurofibromatosis type 2\n----------------------------------\n\n【9】Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is caused by a faulty gene. If the NF2 gene is faulty, it leads to uncontrolled growths (tumours) developing in the nervous system.\n\n【10】In half of all cases of NF2, the faulty gene is passed from a parent to their child. Only 1 parent needs to have the faulty gene for their child to be at risk of developing the condition.\n\n【11】If either the mother or father has the faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance that each child they have will develop NF2.\n\n【12】In other cases, the faulty gene appears to develop spontaneously. It's unclear why this happens.\n\n【13】If you have a child who develops NF2 spontaneously, it's highly unlikely any further children you have will also develop the condition. However, your child with NF2 could pass on the condition to any children that they have.\n\n【14】### Mosaic NF2\n\n【15】About 1 in 3 people with NF2 have a form of the disease called mosaic NF2. The symptoms of mosaic NF2 are milder and often restricted to a certain area or side of the body.\n\n【16】People with mosaic NF2 have lower than the usual 50% risk of having a child with NF2. However, if their child does have NF2, it will be the more common type and not mosaic NF2.\n\n【17】Diagnosing neurofibromatosis type 2\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】It's usually easy to diagnose NF2 in adults and older children by checking for the typical symptoms.\n\n【19】It may be diagnosed in babies who show symptoms of NF2 from birth. However, it's not always possible to make a firm diagnosis before a child is 5 years old because some symptoms take years to develop.\n\n【20】If NF2 is suspected, further tests – such as scans, hearing tests, sight tests or blood tests – may be recommended. This is to assess whether your child has other symptoms or conditions associated with NF2.\n\n【21】If there's uncertainty about the diagnosis, your child may be able to have a blood test to see whether they have the faulty NF2 gene. However, the test is not completely reliable and may not find an alteration in the NF2 gene in all people with NF2 symptoms.\n\n【22】### Before and during pregnancy\n\n【23】Couples with a family history of NF2 may wish to consider their options before having a baby. A GP can refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options, which may include:\n\n【24】*   having a child with a donor egg or sperm\n*   adopting a child\n*   having a test during pregnancy – either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis to see if your baby will have NF2\n*   pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – where eggs are fertilised and tested in a laboratory, and only eggs without the faulty NF2 gene are implanted in the womb.\n\n【25】Treatment for neurofibromatosis type 2\n--------------------------------------\n\n【26】There's currently no cure for NF2. Treatment involves regular monitoring and treating any problems as they occur.\n\n【27】Surgery can be used to remove most tumours, although it carries a risk of causing problems, such as complete deafness or facial weakness. Therefore, the risks and potential benefits need to be carefully considered before treatment.\n\n【28】Most people with NF2 eventually develop significant hearing loss and often benefit from using a hearing aid or learning to lip read. Special implants can sometimes be inserted to improve a person's hearing.\n\n【29】NF2 tends to get worse over time, although the speed at which this happens varies considerably. However, most people with NF2 eventually lose their hearing completely, and some people require a wheelchair or other type of mobility device.\n\n【30】Tumours developing inside the brain and spinal cord can place a strain on the body and shorten life expectancy.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating NF2</u>\n\n【31】Support from Nerve Tumours UK\n-----------------------------\n\n【32】Nerve Tumours UK is a charity that aims to improve the lives of people with either type of neurofibromatosis.\n\n【33】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, you can visit the Nerve Tumours UK website, call its helpline on 07939 046 030 or email info@nervetumours.org.uk.</u>\n\n【34】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【35】If you or your child has NF2, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Recovery</u>\n\n【2】**After being treated for a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.**\n\n【3】Follow-up appointments\n----------------------\n\n【4】Non-cancerous brain tumours can sometimes grow back after treatment, so you'll have regular follow-up appointments to check for signs of this.\n\n【5】Your appointments may include a discussion of any new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and, occasionally, a brain scan.\n\n【6】It's likely you'll have follow-up appointments at least every few months to start with, but they'll probably be needed less frequently if no problems develop.\n\n【7】Side effects of treatment\n-------------------------\n\n【8】Some people who have had a brain tumour can develop side effects of treatment months or years later, such as:\n\n【9】*   cataracts\n*   problems with thinking, memory, language or judgement\n*   epilepsy\n*   hearing loss\n*   infertility\n*   migraine attacks\n*   a tumour developing somewhere else\n*   numbness, pain, weakness or loss of vision resulting from nerve damage (but these complications are rare)\n*   a stroke (this is rare)\n\n【10】If you or someone you care for has any worrying symptoms that develop after brain tumour treatment, see your doctor.\n\n【11】If you think it's a stroke, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\n\n【12】Supportive treatment\n--------------------\n\n【13】Problems caused by a brain tumour do not always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated.\n\n【14】For example, some people have persistent weakness, epileptic fits (seizures), difficulty walking and speech problems.\n\n【15】Extra support may be needed to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have.\n\n【16】This may include therapies such as:\n\n【17】*   **physiotherapy** to help with any movement problems you have\n*   **occupational therapy** to identify any problems you're having with daily activities, and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help\n*   **speech and language therapy** to help you with communication or swallowing problems\n\n【18】Some people may also need to continue taking medicine for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.\n\n【19】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations about the standards of care people with brain tumours should receive.\n删除8：<u>See the NICE guidance about improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.</u>\n\n【20】Driving and travelling\n----------------------\n\n【21】You may not be allowed to drive for a while after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.\n\n【22】How long you'll be unable to drive will depend on factors such as:\n\n【23】*   whether you have had epileptic fits (seizures)\n*   the type of brain tumour you have\n*   where it is in your brain\n*   what symptoms you have\n*   what type of surgery you have had\n\n【24】If you're unsure whether or not you should be driving, do not drive until you have had clarification from the DVLA, your GP or specialist. \n\n【25】Driving against medical advice is both dangerous and against the law.\n\n【26】If you need to give up your driving licence, the DVLA will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again.\n\n【27】With up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive after an agreed period.\n\n【28】This is usually after you have successfully completed medical tests to determine your ability to control a vehicle, and when the risk of having seizures is low删除7：<u>\n\n【29】The Cancer Research UK website has more information about brain tumours and driving.</u>\n\n【30】Flying is usually possible when you have recovered from surgery, but you should let your travel insurance company know about your condition.\n\n【31】Lifestyle advice\n----------------\n\n【32】If you have had radiotherapy, it's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.\n\n【33】This means stopping smoking if you smoke, eating a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n\n【34】However, there are limits to the exercise you should do.\n\n【35】### Sports and activities\n\n【36】After being treated for a brain tumour, you might be advised to permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing.\n\n【37】You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\n\n【38】Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for about a year after treatment because there's a risk you could have a seizure while in the water.\n\n【39】Sex and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【40】It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.\n\n【41】Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. \n\n【42】If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\n\n【43】Going back to work\n------------------\n\n【44】Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.\n\n【45】Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.\n\n【46】If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.\n\n【47】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【48】A brain tumour is often life changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained.\n\n【49】Your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker or counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\n\n【50】There are also a number of organisations that can provide help and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:44:57", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:45:10", "cost": 12.184}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:45:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:44:57"}

Overview\n2.

They're also available on prescription from a doctor.\n\n【5】Types of laxatives\n------------------\n\n【6】There are 4 main types of laxatives.\n\n【7】### Bulk-forming laxatives\n\n【8】Bulk-forming laxatives work by increasing the \"bulk\" or weight of poo, which in turn stimulates your bowel.\n\n【9】They take 2 or 3 days to work.\n\n【10】Bulk-forming laxatives include:\n\n【11】*   Fybogel (ispaghula husk)\n*   methylcellulose\n\n【12】### Osmotic laxatives \n\n【13】Osmotic laxatives draw water from the rest of the body into your bowel to soften poo and make it easier to pass.\n\n【14】They take 2 or 3 days to work.\n\n【15】They include:\n\n【16】*   lactulose (also called by the brand names Duphalac and Lactugal)\n*   macrogol (also called by the brand names Movicol, Laxido, CosmoCol, Molaxole and Molative)\n*   polyethylene glycol\n\n【17】### Stimulant laxatives\n\n【18】These stimulate the muscles that line your gut, helping them to move poo along to your back passage.\n\n【19】They take 6 to 12 hours to work.\n\n【20】They include:\n\n【21】*   bisacodyl (also called by the brand name Dulcolax)\n*   senna (also called by the brand name Senokot)\n*   sodium picosulfate\n\n【22】### Poo-softener laxatives\n\n【23】This type of laxative works by letting water into poo to soften it and make it easier to pass.\n\n【24】They include:\n\n【25】*   arachis oil\n*   docusate\n\n【26】Which laxative should I use?\n----------------------------\n\n【27】It's difficult to know whether a particular laxative will work better than another. It depends on the person.\n\n【28】Unless there's a reason why a type of laxative may be more suitable for you than another:\n\n【29】*   start with a bulk-forming laxative\n*   if your poo remains hard, try using an osmotic laxative in addition to, or instead of, a bulk-forming laxative\n*   if your poo is soft but is still difficult to pass, try taking a stimulant laxative in addition to a bulk-forming laxative\n\n【30】Speak to a GP or pharmacist if you're unsure which laxative to use.\n\n【31】Also see a GP if you're still constipated after trying all of the different types of laxative, or you think your child might benefit from taking laxatives.\n\n【32】Things to consider\n------------------\n\n【33】Laxatives are not suitable for everyone.\n\n【34】They're not usually recommended for:\n\n【35】*   children (unless advised by a doctor)\n*   people with certain health conditions, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\n\n【36】Before using a laxative, read about it in our Medicines guide or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to make sure it's safe for you to take.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the considerations about laxatives</u>\n\n【37】How to take laxatives\n---------------------\n\n【38】How you take a laxative depends on the form it comes in.\n\n【39】They're commonly available as:\n\n【40】*   tablets or capsules you swallow\n*   sachets of powder you mix with water and then drink\n*   a capsule you place inside your bottom (rectum), where it'll dissolve (suppositories)\n*   liquids or gels that you place directly into your bottom\n\n【41】Some laxatives have to be taken at certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning or last thing at night.\n\n【42】Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure how to take your laxative.\n\n【43】If you're taking bulk-forming or osmotic laxatives, it's important to drink plenty of fluids. This is because these laxatives can cause dehydration.\n\n【44】Never take more than the recommended dose of laxatives as this can be harmful and cause side effects.\n\n【45】How long should I take laxatives for?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【46】Ideally, only take laxatives occasionally and for up to a week at a time.\n\n【47】Stop taking a laxative when your constipation improves.\n\n【48】If your constipation has not improved after taking laxatives for a week, speak to a GP.\n\n【49】After taking a laxative, you can make certain lifestyle changes to help stop getting constipated again, such as:\n\n【50】*   drinking plenty of water\n*   exercising regularly\n*   including more fibre in your diet\n\n【51】These are better ways of preventing constipation than using laxatives.\n\n【52】Do not take laxatives every day to ease your constipation as this can be harmful.\n\n【53】Speak to a GP if you're still constipated after making lifestyle changes.\n\n【54】In some cases, you may be prescribed a laxative to use regularly, but this should always be supervised by a GP or gastroenterologist (a specialist in gut problems).\n\n【55】The side effects of laxatives\n-----------------------------\n\n【56】Like most medicines, laxatives can cause side effects. They're usually mild and should pass once you stop taking the laxative.\n\n【57】The side effects you may get will depend on the type of laxative you're taking, but common side effects of most laxatives include:\n\n【58】*   bloating\n*   farting\n*   tummy cramps\n*   feeling sick\n*   dehydration, which can make you feel lightheaded, have headaches and have pee that's a darker colour than normal\n\n【59】Ask a GP for advice if you get any particularly troublesome or persistent side effects while taking laxatives.\n\n【60】Using laxatives too often or for too long can also cause diarrhoea, the bowel becoming blocked by large, dry poo (intestinal obstruction), and unbalanced salts and minerals in your body.\n\n【61】Self-help alternatives to laxatives\n-----------------------------------\n\n【62】It's often possible to improve constipation without using laxatives.\n\n【63】It may help to:\n\n【64】*   increase your daily intake of fibre – try to eat about 30g of fibre a day; read about how to increase the fibre in your diet\n*   add bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet – these will help make your poo softer and easier to pass, although bran and fibre can sometimes make bloating worse\n*   drink plenty of water\n*   exercise regularly\n删除7：<u>Find out more about preventing constipation</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Considerations</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:03", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:17", "cost": 13.787}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:03"}

A lower than normal level indicates a deficiency in growth hormone.\n\n【20】A brain scan will be needed to look at the pituitary gland (which produces growth hormone) if blood tests show low levels of growth hormone.\n\n【21】If one or both parents have a family history of a condition that causes short stature, their baby can be tested for this during pregnancy (prenatal diagnosis).\n删除7：<u>Read more about screening tests in pregnancy.</u>\n\n【22】Treatment for restricted growth\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】Treatment with growth hormone injections may benefit some people with restricted growth and can help a child with the condition grow more than they otherwise would.\n\n【24】In cases of DSS where the legs are particularly short, a leg-lengthening procedure is sometimes used, but there's some uncertainty about its safety and effectiveness.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treatments for restricted growth.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 30 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 30 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:49:55", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:50:01", "cost": 6.358}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:50:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:49:55"}

Babies who are very floppy at birth may also be tested.\n删除7：<u>Read more about diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome.</u>\n\n【15】Managing Prader-Willi syndrome\n------------------------------\n\n【16】There's no cure for Prader-Willi syndrome, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and associated difficulties.\n\n【17】This includes managing the person's excessive appetite and behavioural challenges.\n\n【18】One of the most important parts of caring for someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is to try to maintain a normal weight.\n\n【19】They should have a healthy, balanced diet, avoiding sweet treats and high-calorie items right from the start.\n\n【20】If someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is allowed to eat as much as they want, they'll quickly become dangerously overweight.\n\n【21】Someone with the syndrome can eat much more than other people and still feel hungry.\n\n【22】Limiting food intake can be very challenging. People with Prader-Willi syndrome may become frustrated when they want extra food, and their hunger can make them hide or steal food.\n删除7：<u>Read more about managing Prader-Willi syndrome.</u>\n\n【23】Long-term problems caused by Prader-Willi syndrome\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Prader-Willi syndrome itself is not life-threatening. But compulsive eating and weight gain can cause young adults with the syndrome to develop serious obesity-related conditions such as:\n\n【25】*   type 2 diabetes\n*   heart failure\n*   breathing difficulties\n\n【26】If their diet is well controlled and they do not become overweight, adults can have a good quality of life and probably a normal life expectancy.\n\n【27】Many adults with Prader-Willi syndrome take part in activities such as voluntary or part-time work but it's unlikely they'll be able to live fully independent lives.\n\n【28】The increased appetite also means there's a higher risk of choking on food, so carers are advised to learn what to do if someone is choking.\n\n【29】PWSA UK\n-------\n\n【30】The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association UK (PWSA UK) provides information and support for people whose lives are affected by the syndrome.

Overview\n2.  Living with arthritis</u>\n\n【2】**Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.**\n\n【3】In the UK, millions of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints.\n\n【4】Arthritis affects people of all ages, including children.\n\n【5】Types of arthritis\n------------------\n\n【6】Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis.\n\n【7】### Osteoarthritis\n\n【8】Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK.\n\n【9】It most often develops in people in their mid-40s or older.\n\n【10】It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. \n\n【11】But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【12】Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.\n\n【13】Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder.\n\n【14】This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes.\n\n【15】Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.\n\n【16】The most commonly affected joints are those in the:\n\n【17】*   hands\n*   spine\n*   knees\n*   hips\n删除7：<u>Find out more about osteoarthritis</u>\n\n【18】### Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【19】Rheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis.\n\n【20】It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men.\n\n【21】In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. \n\n【22】The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected.\n\n【23】This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.\n\n【24】People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about rheumatoid arthritis</u>\n\n【25】### Other types of arthritis and related conditions\n\n【26】*   **ankylosing spondylitis** – a long-term inflammatory condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together. Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints\n*   **cervical spondylosis** – also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness\n*   **fibromyalgia** – causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons\n*   **lupus** – an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues\n*   **gout** – a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe), but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness and swelling\n*   **psoriatic arthritis** – an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with psoriasis\n*   **enteropathic arthritis** – a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 2 main types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The most common areas affected by inflammation are the lower limb joints and the spine\n*   **reactive arthritis** – this can cause pain and swelling of the joints, sore eyes and extreme tiredness. It develops shortly after an infection of the gut, bowel or throat\n*   **secondary arthritis** – a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards\n*   **polymyalgia rheumatica** – a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause joint inflammation\n\n【27】Symptoms of arthritis\n---------------------\n\n【28】There are lots of different types of arthritis.\n\n【29】The symptoms you experience will vary depending on the type you have.\n\n【30】This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:\n\n【31】*   joint pain, tenderness and stiffness\n*   inflammation in and around the joints\n*   restricted movement of the joints\n*   warm red skin over the affected joint\n*   weakness and muscle wasting\n\n【32】Arthritis and children\n----------------------\n\n【33】Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children.\n\n【34】Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\n\n【35】JIA causes pain and inflammation in 1 or more joints for at least 6 weeks.\n\n【36】Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.\n\n【37】### Oligo-articular JIA (oligoarthritis)\n\n【38】Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects up to 4 joints in the body, most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.\n\n【39】Oligo-articular JIA often goes away without causing long-term joint damage.\n\n【40】But there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an eyecare specialist called an ophthalmologist are recommended.\n\n【41】### Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)\n\n【42】Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, is the second most common type of JIA and affects 5 or more joints.\n\n【43】It can affect a child of any age and may come on suddenly or develop gradually.\n\n【44】The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【45】A child with the condition may also feel unwell and may occasionally have a high temperature of 38C or above.\n\n【46】### Systemic onset JIA\n\n【47】Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, a lack of energy and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed.\n\n【48】Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.\n\n【49】### Enthesitis-related arthritis\n\n【50】Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that often affects the joints of the leg and spine, causing inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone.\n\n【51】It can cause stiffness in the neck and lower back in the teenage years.\n\n【52】It's also linked to a painful eye condition called acute uveitis.\n删除6：<u>### Find out more\n\n【53】Versus Arthritis: juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n\n【54】</u>\nTreating arthritis\n------------------\n\n【55】There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow it down.\n\n【56】Osteoarthritis treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery.\n\n【57】Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation. This helps prevent joint damage.\n\n【58】Treatments include medicine, physiotherapy and surgery.\n\n【59】Information:\n\n【60】### Self-refer for treatment\n\n【61】If you have arthritis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.\n\n【62】To find out if there are any services in your area:\n\n【63】*   ask the reception staff at your GP surgery\n*   check your GP surgery's website\n*   contact your integrated care board (ICB) – find your local ICB\n*   search online for NHS treatment for arthritis near you\n\n【64】Further information, help and support\n-------------------------------------\n\n【65】Versus Arthritis provides help and support for people in the UK with arthritis, plus their families and friends.\n\n【66】They have a free helpline you can call for further information and support on 0800 5200 520, Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm.

But in people at risk of heart attacks and stroke, platelets can stick together inside already narrowed blood vessels to form a clot. The clot can stop blood flowing to the heart or brain and cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\n【4】If you take it every day, low-dose aspirin stops platelets clumping together to form unwanted blood clots, and helps to prevent heart attacks and stroke.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】You may not notice any difference in how you feel after you start taking low-dose aspirin. This does not mean that it's not working.\n\n【7】Carry on taking daily low-dose aspirin even if you feel well, as you'll still be getting the benefits.\n\n【8】Are there any long term side effects?\n\n【9】Low-dose aspirin is generally safe to take for a long time. In fact, it works best if you take it for many months or years.\n\n【10】Occasionally, low-dose aspirin can cause an ulcer in your stomach or gut if you take it for a long time.\n\n【11】If you're at risk of getting a stomach ulcer, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help protect your stomach.\n\n【12】Does aspirin cause stomach ulcers?\n\n【13】Aspirin can cause ulcers in your stomach or gut, especially if you take it for a long time or in big doses.\n\n【14】Your doctor may tell you not to take aspirin if you have a stomach ulcer, or if you've had one in the past.\n\n【15】If you're at risk of getting a stomach ulcer and you need a painkiller, take paracetamol instead of aspirin as it's gentler on your stomach.\n\n【16】Are there other medicines like low-dose aspirin?\n\n【17】If you cannot take low-dose aspirin, you may be able to take another medicine that helps prevent blood clots, such as clopidogrel, instead.\n\n【18】Like aspirin, these medicines prevent blood clots from forming and reduce the chances of heart attack and stroke in people at high risk of them.\n\n【19】Can we all take low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks and strokes?\n\n【20】No, this is not recommended.\n\n【21】If you have had a heart attack or stroke, or you're at high risk of either, studies have shown that the benefits of taking daily low-dose aspirin far outweigh the risk of side effects.\n\n【22】But if you do not have heart disease and are not considered to be at high risk of developing it, the risk of side effects (particularly the risk of bleeding) outweighs the benefit of preventing blood clots.\n\n【23】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【24】Aspirin does not affect any contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【25】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【26】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking low-dose aspirin.\n\n【27】But drinking too much alcohol while you're taking aspirin can irritate your stomach.\n\n【28】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【29】You can eat and drink normally while taking low-dose aspirin.\n\n【30】Can lifestyle changes help my health?\n\n【31】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure and increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. Try to avoid secondhand smoke, too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise keeps your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day is enough.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and veg, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to cut down on salt, too. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily, and your blood pressure often goes up. This raises your risk of heart attack and stroke. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help keep stress at bay.\n*   Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you’ve had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.\n删除11：<u>More in Low-dose aspirin\n------------------------\n\n【32】*   About low-dose aspirin\n*   Who can and cannot take low-dose aspirin\n*   How and when to take low-dose aspirin\n*   Side effects of low-dose aspirin\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility while taking low-dose aspirin\n*   Taking low-dose aspirin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions about low-dose aspirin\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:04", "endTime": "2024/09/05 14:43:11", "cost": 7.379}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-04 18:52:48", "update_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-04 22:43:03"}
