Your baby may need extra time in hospital for observation.\n\n【4】It's important to treat pain in pregnancy. For some pregnant women with pain that lasts a long time or is difficult to treat, fentanyl might be the best option. Your doctor is the best person to help you decide what's right for you and your baby.\n\n【5】Fentanyl and breastfeeding\n--------------------------\n\n【6】Fentanyl can be used if you're breastfeeding. It's important that your pain is controlled.\n\n【7】Only very small amounts of fentanyl pass into breast milk, but there's still a small risk that it may cause side effects in your baby. Your doctor may recommend different painkillers first.\n\n【8】If you do take fentanyl while breastfeeding, it's best to take it in low doses and only for a short time if possible. This reduces the risk of your baby getting side effects.\n\n【9】It's also important not to stop breastfeeding suddenly so your baby does not get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【10】Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife as soon as possible if you have any concerns about your baby, including if you notice your baby:\n\n【11】*   is not feeding as well as usual\n*   has constipation\n*   seems unusually pale\n\n【12】### Urgent advice: Call 111 for advice or go to A&E now if:\n\n【13】*   your baby is unusually sleepy\n*   your baby has breathing problems\n\n【14】However, these effects are very rare.\n\n【15】If you need to go to A&E, take the fentanyl packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【16】Fentanyl and fertility\n----------------------\n\n【17】There's no evidence that fentanyl affects fertility in either men or women.\n\n【18】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications\n\n【3】**Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions.**\n\n【4】Reduced flexibility\n-------------------\n\n【5】Although most people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, some people with the condition eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine.\n\n【6】This usually only affects the lower back and is the result of the bones in the spine joining up (fusing).\n\n【7】Fusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your posture becomes fixed in 1 position, although it does not lead to severe disability in most cases.\n\n【8】In rare cases surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine.\n\n【9】Joint damage\n------------\n\n【10】AS can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed. This can damage the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move.\n\n【11】If a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial joint.\n\n【12】Iritis\n------\n\n【13】Iritis, also known as acute anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with AS where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. It usually only affects 1 eye, rather than both.\n\n【14】If you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). Your vision may also become blurred or cloudy.\n\n【15】You should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly.\n\n【16】If your GP thinks you have iritis, they'll refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist, a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems, for treatment.\n\n【17】Iritis can usually be treated with corticosteroid eyedrops.\n\n【18】Osteoporosis and spinal fractures\n---------------------------------\n\n【19】Osteoporosis is where the bones become weak and brittle. In AS osteoporosis can develop in the spine and increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone. The longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases.\n\n【20】If you do develop osteoporosis, you'll usually need to take medicine to help strengthen your bones.\n\n【21】There are a number of medicines that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection.\n\n【22】Read about treating osteoporosis.\n\n【23】Cardiovascular disease\n----------------------\n\n【24】If you have AS, you may also have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke.\n\n【25】Because of this increased risk, it's important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing CVD.\n\n【26】Your rheumatologist, a specialist in treating muscle and joint conditions, can advise about lifestyle changes you should make to minimise your risk of developing CVD.\n\n【27】These changes may include:\n\n【28】*   stopping smoking – if you smoke\n*   losing weight – if you are overweight or obese\n*   taking regular exercise – 150 minutes of exercise a week can greatly improve your health\n*   making changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control – such as diabetes or high blood pressure\n\n【29】You may also be prescribed medicine to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level.\n\n【30】Cauda equina syndrome\n---------------------\n\n【31】Cauda equina syndrome is a very rare complication of AS that occurs when nerves at the bottom of your spine become compressed (compacted).\n\n【32】Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome include:\n\n【33】*   sciatica on both sides of your body\n*   weakness or numbness in both legs that is severe or getting worse\n*   numbness around or under your genitals, or around your anus\n*   finding it hard to start peeing, being unable to pee or being unable to control when you pee – and this is not normal for you\n*   not noticing when you need to poo or not being able to control when you poo – and this is not normal for you\n\n【34】Go to A&E or call 999 if you have AS and you develop any of these symptoms.\n\n【35】Psoriasis\n---------\n\n【36】It's common for people with AS to also have psoriasis, a skin condition that causes flaky patches of skin.\n\n【37】There's no cure for psoriasis, but your GP can recommend treatments that can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.\n\n【38】Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】Some people with AS also have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n【40】Symptoms of IBD include:\n\n【41】*   pain, cramps or swelling in the tummy\n*   recurring or bloody diarrhoea\n*   weight loss\n*   extreme tiredness\n\n【42】There are treatments that can relieve the symptoms and prevent them returning, including specific diets, lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery.\n\n【43】See your GP if you have symptoms of IBD.\n\n【44】Page last reviewed: 05 January 2023  \nNext review due: 05 January 2026\n\n【45】*   Previous : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

These medicines are sometimes called \"water tablets\" because they make you pee more.\n\n【2】It is also an anti-androgen, which means it stops male hormones, such as testosterone, from working.\n\n【3】Spironolactone is used to treat build-up of fluid in your body (oedema) caused by:\n\n【4】*   heart failure\n*   liver disease – it treats build-up of fluid in your abdomen, called ascites\n*   kidney disease – it treats a condition that causes your kidneys to leak large amounts of protein into your pee, called nephrotic syndrome\n*   high levels of aldosterone (a hormone made by the adrenal glands)\n\n【5】It can also be used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) when other medicines have not worked.\n\n【6】Spironolactone is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets.\n\n【7】Spironolactone also comes as tablets that contain other diuretics. When it's mixed with furosemide it's called by the brand name Lasilactone. When it's mixed with hydroflumethiazide it's called by the brand name Aldactide.\n\n【8】Key facts\n---------\n\n【9】*   You'll usually take spironolactone once a day in the morning. Some people need to take it twice a day. If you're taking it twice a day, take the second dose before 4pm.\n*   Take spironolactone with food, to help stop you feeling or being sick.\n*   The most common side effect of spironolactone is high potassium levels. Your doctor will give you blood tests while you're taking spironolactone to make sure your potassium levels are stable.\n*   Do not have low-sodium salt or salt substitutes, like Lo-Salt, because they contain a lot of potassium. Using these with spironolactone can cause your potassium levels to become too high.\n*   Try to limit other food and drink that contain a lot of potassium, including bananas, avocados, pulses, nuts and salmon.\n\n【10】More in Spironolactone\n----------------------\n\n【11】*   About spironolactone\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking spironolactone with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【12】Page last reviewed: 6 July 2022  \nNext review due: 6 July 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It can also affect other areas of skin, such as the armpits, top of the inner thighs (groin) and between the fingers. Clotrimazole works by killing the fungus (yeast) that is causing the infection.\n\n【4】Clotrimazole comes as an external cream, an internal cream and a tablet you insert into your vagina (pessary).\n\n【5】For vaginal thrush you can use either pessaries or cream, or both at the same time. The pessaries and internal cream are sometimes sold together.\n\n【6】For thrush on the penis, breasts, armpits, groin or between the fingers you would use the external cream.\n\n【7】Some Canesten products combine clotrimazole with other medicines. These include Canesten Thrush Duo Oral Capsule and External Cream. The capsule contains fluconazole, and Canesten cream contains clotrimazole.\n\n【8】Clotrimazole for thrush is available to buy in pharmacies and shops. Some stronger treatments are only available with a prescription.\n\n【9】Clotrimazole is also available as a cream, spray and solution to treat other fungal infections such as athlete’s foot, ringworm and nappy rash.\n\n【10】Key facts\n---------\n\n【11】*   Clotrimazole works by killing the yeast that causes the fungal infection.\n*   It usually treats thrush within 7 days but it's best to treat the infection for at least 2 weeks to stop it coming back.\n*   The most common side effect is an itching or burning feeling in the area being treated. Clotrimazole cream can damage the latex used in condoms and diaphragms. This can mean your contraception will not work as well as it should.\n*   Do not use clotrimazole for more than 14 days, unless a doctor tells you to.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications\n\n【3】**Kawasaki disease is treated in hospital as it can cause serious complications. Treatment should begin as soon as possible.**\n\n【4】It may take longer for your child to recover if Kawasaki disease isn't treated promptly.\n\n【5】Their risk of developing complications will also be increased.\n\n【6】The 2 main treatments for Kawasaki disease are:\n\n【7】*   aspirin\n*   intravenous immunoglobulin\n\n【8】Aspirin\n-------\n\n【9】Your child may be prescribed aspirin if they have Kawasaki disease.\n\n【10】This is one of the few occasions where aspirin may be recommended for a child under 16 years old.\n\n【11】Never give your child aspirin, unless it's prescribed by a healthcare professional. It can cause side effects, including Reye's syndrome.\n\n【12】Aspirin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n\n【13】It's used to treat Kawasaki disease because:\n\n【14】*   it can ease pain and discomfort\n*   it can help reduce a high temperature\n*   at high doses, aspirin is an anti-inflammatory (it reduces swelling)\n*   at low doses, aspirin is an antiplatelet (it prevents blood clots forming)\n\n【15】The dose of aspirin your child is prescribed and how long they need to take it for depends on their symptoms. \n\n【16】They'll probably be given high-dose aspirin until their temperature subsides.\n\n【17】They may then be prescribed low-dose aspirin until 6 to 8 weeks after the start of their symptoms.\n\n【18】This is to reduce blood clots if there are problems developing in the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.\n\n【19】Intravenous immunoglobulin\n--------------------------\n\n【20】Intravenous immunoglobulin is also called IVIG. Immunoglobulin is a solution of antibodies taken from healthy donors. Intravenous means it's injected directly into a vein.\n\n【21】Antibodies are proteins the immune system produces to fight disease-carrying organisms.\n\n【22】Research has shown IVIG can reduce fever and the risk of heart problems.\n\n【23】The immunoglobulin used to treat Kawasaki disease is called gamma globulin.\n\n【24】After your child is given IVIG, their symptoms should improve within 36 hours.\n\n【25】If their high temperature doesn't improve after 36 hours, they may be given a second dose of IVIG.\n\n【26】Corticosteroids\n---------------\n\n【27】Corticosteroids are a type of medicine that contain hormones, which are powerful chemicals that have a wide range of effects on the body.\n\n【28】They may be recommended if IVIG hasn't been effective, or if your child is found to have a high risk of heart problems.\n\n【29】Read more about corticosteroids.\n\n【30】After treatment\n---------------\n\n【31】When your child is discharged from hospital, you should be given advice about how to care for them at home.\n\n【32】This may include making sure they're as comfortable as possible and they drink plenty of fluids.\n\n【33】Make sure your child continues taking any medicine that's been prescribed for them and look out for any side effects.\n\n【34】Your child will be given a follow-up appointment and their heart will continue to be monitored.\n\n【35】Once an ultrasound scan of the heart (echocardiogram) has confirmed that your child doesn't have any heart abnormalities, they can usually stop taking aspirin.\n\n【36】Full recovery could take around 6 weeks, but may take longer in some children.\n\n【37】Follow-up treatment may be needed if your child develops further complications.\n\n【38】Support\n-------\n\n【39】The Kawasaki Support Group and Societi, the UK Foundation for Kawasaki Disease can give you further information and advice about your child's condition.\n\n【40】Aspirin side effects\n--------------------\n\n【41】Aspirin isn't usually given to children under the age of 16 because it can cause side effects, including Reye's syndrome.\n\n【42】Reye's syndrome is rare, but it can cause serious liver and brain damage, and be fatal if not treated quickly.\n\n【43】The symptoms of Reye's syndrome include persistent vomiting and a lack of energy.\n\n【44】Get medical help immediately if your child experiences either of these symptoms.\n\n【45】See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.\n\n【46】Page last reviewed: 26 October 2021  \nNext review due: 26 October 2024\n\n【47】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Complications", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

If there's a problem with the mucus, it can make it harder to conceive.\n\n【14】### Fibroids\n\n【15】Non-cancerous growths called fibroids in or around the womb can affect fertility. In some cases, they may prevent a fertilised egg attaching itself in the womb, or they may block a fallopian tube.\n\n【16】### Endometriosis\n\n【17】Endometriosis is a condition where tissue, similar to the lining of the womb (the endometrium), grows in other places outside of the womb.\n\n【18】This can damage the ovaries or fallopian tubes and cause fertility problems.\n\n【19】### Pelvic inflammatory disease\n\n【20】Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper female genital tract, which includes the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries.\n\n【21】It's often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). PID can damage and scar the fallopian tubes, making it virtually impossible for an egg to travel down into the womb.\n\n【22】### Sterilisation\n\n【23】Some women choose to be sterilised if they do not want to have any more children.\n\n【24】Sterilisation involves blocking the fallopian tubes to make it impossible for an egg to travel to the womb.\n\n【25】It's rarely reversible – if you do have a sterilisation reversed, you will not necessarily be able to have a child.\n\n【26】### Medicines and drugs \n\n【27】The side effects of some types of medicines and drugs can affect your fertility. These include:\n\n【28】*   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – the long-term use or a high dosage of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or aspirin, can make it more difficult to conceive\n*   chemotherapy – medicines used for chemotherapy can sometimes cause ovarian failure, which means your ovaries will no longer be able to function properly\n*   neuroleptic medicines – antipsychotic medicines, often used to treat psychosis, can sometimes cause missed periods or infertility\n*   spironolactone – a type of medicine used to treat fluid retention (oedema); fertility should recover around 2 months after you stop taking spironolactone\n\n【29】Illegal drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, can affect fertility and make ovulation more difficult.\n\n【30】Infertility in men\n------------------\n\n【31】### Semen and sperm\n\n【32】A common cause of infertility in men is poor-quality semen, the fluid containing sperm that's ejaculated during sex.\n\n【33】Possible reasons for abnormal semen include:\n\n【34】*   a lack of sperm – you may have a very low sperm count or no sperm at all\n*   sperm that are not moving properly – this will make it harder for sperm to swim to the egg\n*   abnormal sperm – sperm can sometimes be an abnormal shape, making it harder for them to move and fertilise an egg\n\n【35】Many cases of abnormal semen are unexplained.\n\n【36】There's a link between increased temperature of the scrotum and reduced semen quality, but it's uncertain whether wearing loose-fitting underwear improves fertility. \n\n【37】### Testicles\n\n【38】The testicles produce and store sperm. If they're damaged, it can seriously affect the quality of your semen.\n\n【39】This can happen as a result of:\n\n【40】*   an infection of your testicles\n*   testicular cancer\n*   testicular surgery\n*   a problem with your testicles you were born with (a congenital defect)\n*   when 1 or both testicles has not descended into the scrotum (the loose sac of skin that contains your testicles (undescended testicles))\n*   injury to your testicles\n\n【41】### Sterilisation\n\n【42】Some men choose to have a vasectomy if they do not want children or any more children. \n\n【43】It involves cutting and sealing off the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles (the vas deferens) so your semen will no longer contain any sperm.\n\n【44】A vasectomy can be reversed, but reversals are not usually successful.\n\n【45】### Ejaculation disorders\n\n【46】Some men experience ejaculation problems that can make it difficult for them to release semen during sex (ejaculate).\n\n【47】### Hypogonadism\n\n【48】Hypogonadism is an abnormally low level of testosterone, the male sex hormone involved in making sperm.\n\n【49】It could be caused by a tumour, taking illegal drugs, or Klinefelter syndrome (a rare syndrome involving an extra female chromosome).\n\n【50】### Medicines and drugs\n\n【51】Certain types of medicines can sometimes cause infertility problems. These include:\n\n【52】*   sulfasalazine – an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis; sulfasalazine can decrease the number of sperm, but its effects are temporary and your sperm count should return to normal when you stop taking it\n*   anabolic steroids – are often used illegally to build muscle and improve athletic performance; long-term misuse of anabolic steroids can reduce sperm count and sperm mobility\n*   chemotherapy – medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes severely reduce sperm production\n*   herbal remedies – some herbal remedies, such as root extracts of the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, can affect the production of sperm or reduce the size of your testicles\n\n【53】Illegal drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, can also affect semen quality.\n\n【54】Unexplained infertility\n-----------------------\n\n【55】In the UK, unexplained infertility accounts for around 1 in 4 cases of infertility. This is when no cause can be identified in either partner.\n\n【56】If a cause for your fertility problems has not been found, talk to your doctor about the next steps.\n\n【57】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that women with unexplained infertility who have not conceived after 2 years of having regular unprotected sex should be offered IVF treatment.\n\n【58】The NICE guidance has more about unexplained infertility.\n\n【59】Find out more about fertility tests and how problems are diagnosed.\n\n【60】Page last reviewed: 09 August 2023  \nNext review due: 09 August 2026\n\n【61】*   Previous : Infertility\n*   Next : Diagnosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment\n5.  Complications\n\n【3】**Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a family of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children.**\n\n【4】When you get mumps, the virus moves from your respiratory tract (your nose, mouth and throat) into your parotid glands (saliva-producing glands found either side of your face), where it begins to reproduce. This causes the glands to swell.\n\n【5】The virus can also enter your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spine. Once the virus has entered the CSF, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain, pancreas, testicles (in boys and men) and ovaries (in girls and women).\n\n【6】How mumps is spread\n-------------------\n\n【7】Mumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by:\n\n【8】*   an infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person\n*   an infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract\n*   sharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person\n\n【9】People with mumps are usually most infectious from a few days before their parotid glands swell until a few days afterwards. For this reason, it's advisable to avoid work or school for 5 days after your symptoms first develop if you're diagnosed with mumps.\n\n【10】Mumps can also be passed on by people who are infected with the virus but don't have any obvious symptoms.\n\n【11】Page last reviewed: 24 September 2021  \nNext review due: 24 September 2024\n\n【12】*   Previous : Symptoms\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It works by affecting a calming chemical in your brain called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n\n【3】Zopiclone comes as tablets. It also comes as a liquid for people who find it hard to swallow tablets, but your doctor will have to order this specially.\n\n【4】This medicine is only available on prescription.\n\n【5】Key facts\n---------\n\n【6】*   Zopiclone takes around 1 hour to work.\n*   It's usually prescribed for just 2 to 4 weeks. This is because your body gets used to it quickly and after this time it's unlikely to have the same effect. Your body can also become dependent on it.\n*   Common side effects are a metallic taste in your mouth, a dry mouth, and daytime sleepiness.\n*   Do not drink alcohol while you're on zopiclone.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about acrivastine\n\n【3】1\\. About acrivastine\n---------------------\n\n【4】Acrivastine is an antihistamine medicine that helps the symptoms of allergies.\n\n【5】It's used to treat hay fever, conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes), eczema and hives (urticaria).\n\n【6】It's also used for reactions to insect bites and stings and for some food allergies.\n\n【7】Acrivastine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's less likely to make you feel sleepy than some other antihistamines.\n\n【8】Acrivastine is available on prescription. You can also buy it from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【9】It comes as capsules. Sometimes it's combined with a decongestant called pseudoephedrine to unblock your nose and sinuses.\n\n【10】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【11】*   It's usual to take acrivastine as you need it, up to 3 times a day.\n*   Acrivastine is classed as non-drowsy antihistamine, but some people still find it makes them feel quite sleepy.\n*   Common side effects include a dry mouth and dizziness.\n*   Do not drink grapefruit juice while you're taking acrivastine – it might make you more likely to get side effects.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking acrivastine as it can make you feel sleepy.\n*   When acrivastine is mixed with pseudoephedrine, it's called Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant. Some Benadryl products do not contain acrivastine, but a different antihistamine such as cetirizine.\n\n【12】3\\. Who can and cannot take acrivastine\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】Acrivastine capsules that you buy from pharmacies and supermarkets can be taken by adults under the age of 65, and children aged 12 years and over.\n\n【14】Acrivastine is not recommended for people over 65 because very little research on the medicine has been done in this age group.\n\n【15】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you're over 65 and want to take acrivastine.\n\n【16】Acrivastine is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:\n\n【17】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to acrivastine or any other medicine\n*   have kidney disease\n*   have epilepsy or another health problem that puts you at risk of seizures or fits\n*   have a rare illness called porphyria\n*   are due to have an allergy test – taking acrivastine may affect the results, so you might need to stop taking it a few days before the test\n\n【18】4\\. How and when to take acrivastine\n------------------------------------\n\n【19】If you or your child have been prescribed acrivastine, follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to take it.\n\n【20】If you bought acrivastine from a pharmacy or shop, follow the instructions that come with the packet.\n\n【21】### Dosage\n\n【22】Acrivastine comes as capsules (8mg). The usual dose in adults and children aged 12 and over is 1 capsule 3 times a day.\n\n【23】When it's mixed with a decongestant, each capsule contains 8mg of acrivastine and 60mg of pseudoephedrine. The usual dose in adults and children aged 12 and over is 1 capsule 3 times a day.\n\n【24】Do not take more than 3 acrivastine capsules, or 3 acrivastine mixed with pseudoephedrine capsules, in 24 hours.\n\n【25】### How to take it\n\n【26】Acrivastine does not usually upset your stomach. You can take it with or without food.\n\n【27】Swallow the capsules whole. Do not chew them.\n\n【28】Always take acrivastine capsules with a drink of water, milk or juice (but do not drink grapefruit juice with acrivastine as you may be more likely to get side effects).\n\n【29】### When to take it\n\n【30】You may only need to take acrivastine on a day you have symptoms, such as when you've been near to something you're allergic to, like animal hair.\n\n【31】Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as to stop hay fever during spring and summer.\n\n【32】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【33】Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【34】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose. Do not take more than 3 capsules in 24 hours.\n\n【35】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【36】### What if I take too much?\n\n【37】Acrivastine is generally very safe. Taking more than your prescribed dose is unlikely to harm you. If you take an extra dose, you might get some of the common side effects.\n\n【38】If this happens or you're concerned, contact your doctor.\n\n【39】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【40】*   you take more than your usual dose of acrivastine and pseudoephedrine (Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant) and experience side effects\n\n【41】These include:\n\n【42】*   getting the shakes\n*   changes in your heart rate\n\n【43】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【44】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【45】Take the acrivastine packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【46】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【47】Like all medicines, acrivastine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【48】### Common side effects\n\n【49】There are some differences between the side effects of medicines that only contain acrivastine, and medicines that combine acrivastine with pseudoephedrine.\n\n【50】The most common side effect of acrivastine is feeling sleepy and tired. This happens in more than 1 in 10 people.\n\n【51】Other common side effects of acrivastine happen in more than 1 in 100 people. These include:\n\n【52】*   dry mouth\n*   feeling dizzy\n\n【53】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away.\n\n【54】The common side effects of acrivastine when mixed with pseudoephedrine happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They include:\n\n【55】*   difficulty sleeping\n*   feeling sick (nausea)\n*   headaches\n*   feeling nervous\n*   difficulty peeing (for men), especially those with an enlarged prostate\n\n【56】If you experience any of these, stop taking it and talk to your doctor or pharmacist about trying an acrivastine-only medicine.\n\n【57】### Serious side effects\n\n【58】Call a doctor straight away if:\n\n【59】*   you start seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)\n*   you get a rash\n*   you get pain or discomfort in the chest, neck, back or shoulders – these could be signs of angina, or a heart attack\n*   your skin gets more red than usual or you get small, pus-filled blisters on the skin – these could be signs of a condition called acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).

For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n\n【69】Information:\n\n【70】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【71】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【72】6\\. How to cope with side effects of acrivastine\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【73】**What to do about:**\n\n【74】*   **feeling sleepy** – try a different non-drowsy antihistamine. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n*   **dry mouth** – chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n*   **feeling dizzy** – lie down until the dizziness passes, then get up slowly. Move slowly and carefully. It's best to avoid coffee, cigarettes, alcohol and recreational drugs. If the dizziness does not get better within a couple of days, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【75】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【76】### Acrivastine and pregnancy\n\n【77】Acrivastine is not usually recommended during pregnancy because there is very little information about its use in pregnancy. Other antihistamines that we know more about may be more suitable.\n\n【78】If you think you need to take acrivastine in pregnancy, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. They will be able to help you decide, or may suggest other medicines for you.\n\n【79】### Acrivastine and breastfeeding\n\n【80】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can use acrivastine while breastfeeding, but it is better to take occasional doses or only for a short time.\n\n【81】We do not know how much acrivastine gets into breast milk, so it is better to take an antihistamine which we know more about.\n\n【82】If you're breastfeeding, or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor. They may prescribe similar antihistamines, called loratadine or cetirizine, that are more suitable while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【83】Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, midwife or health visitor if your baby is not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy, seems irritable, or if you have any other concerns about your baby.\n\n【84】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【85】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【86】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【87】Some medicines affect how acrivastine works or can increase the chances of you having side effects.\n\n【88】Check with your pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\n【89】*   ketoconazole, a medicine to treat fungal infections\n*   erythromycin, an antibiotic\n*   any medicine that makes you sleepy, gives you a dry mouth, or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking acrivastine might make these side effects worse\n\n【90】Acrivastine mixed with pseudoephedrine (Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant) affects lots of medicines. Check with your pharmacist or doctor before you take it.\n\n【91】### Mixing acrivastine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【92】There might be a problem taking some herbal remedies and supplements alongside acrivastine, especially ones that cause sleepiness, a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee.\n\n【93】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【94】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【95】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【96】9\\. Common questions about acrivastine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【97】How does acrivastine work?\n\n【98】Acrivastine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine.\n\n【99】When you come into contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen, animal hair or if you're bitten or stung by an insect, your body produces a chemical called histamine.\n\n【100】Usually histamine is a useful substance, but in an allergic reaction it causes unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watery eyes, a running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.\n\n【101】Acrivastine blocks the effects of histamine and reduces these symptoms.\n\n【102】When will I feel better?\n\n【103】You should start to feel better within 1 to 2 hours of taking acrivastine.\n\n【104】How long should I take acrivastine for?\n\n【105】It depends on why you're taking acrivastine.\n\n【106】You may only need to take it as a one-off dose or for 1 or 2 days – for example, if you have a reaction to an insect bite.\n\n【107】You may need to take acrivastine for longer if you're taking it to prevent symptoms – for example, to stop hay fever when the pollen count is high.\n\n【108】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure how long you need to take acrivastine for.\n\n【109】Is it safe to take acrivastine for a long time?\n\n【110】Acrivastine is unlikely to do you any harm if you take it for a long time. But it's best to take it only for as long as you need to.\n\n【111】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【112】It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking acrivastine as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【113】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【114】Do not drink grapefruit juice when you're taking acrivastine. It might make you more likely to have side effects.\n\n【115】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【116】Acrivastine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine, but it's still possible to feel sleepy after taking it.\n\n【117】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike or operate machinery until you feel awake and not tired anymore.\n\n【118】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【119】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking acrivastine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【120】Can I use acrivastine to help me sleep?\n\n【121】Do not use acrivastine to help you sleep. It's not meant to be used this way and probably will not work either.\n\n【122】If you take the recommended dose, acrivastine causes little or no sleepiness in most people.\n\n【123】If you do feel sleepy after taking acrivastine, it usually wears off after a few days of treatment.\n\n【124】Speak to your doctor if you're having difficulty sleeping.\n\n【125】Does acrivastine make you put on weight?\n\n【126】There's no evidence that acrivastine makes you put on weight.\n\n【127】What's the difference between acrivastine and other antihistamines?\n\n【128】Acrivastine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. That's because it's less likely to make you feel sleepy than other so-called sedating antihistamines, such as Piriton (chlorphenamine).\n\n【129】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine instead of a sedating one.\n\n【130】An exception is when you want the medicine to make you sleepy – for example, if you have itchy skin that's keeping you awake.\n\n【131】What's the difference between acrivastine and other non-drowsy antihistamines?\n\n【132】Other non-drowsy antihistamines like cetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine seem to work just as well as acrivastine.\n\n【133】But you need to take acrivastine 3 times a day, whereas other non-drowsy antihistamines are only taken once a day.\n\n【134】If one non-drowsy antihistamine has not worked for you, it's worth trying another one.\n\n【135】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【136】Yes, you can take acrivastine together with paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【137】Can I take more than 1 type of antihistamine in the same day?\n\n【138】Sometimes doctors recommend that people with a severe itchy skin rash take 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【139】As well as taking a non-drowsy antihistamine during the day (such as acrivastine, cetirizine or loratadine), your doctor may advise that you take a sedating antihistamine at night if the itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【140】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless you have been advised to by your doctor.\n\n【141】Can I take acrivastine with other hay fever treatments?\n\n【142】Yes, it's fine to take acrivastine together with some other hay fever treatments – for example, steroid nasal sprays (such as Beconase, Rhinocort Aqua and Flixonase Nasules) or eye drops.\n\n【143】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【144】There's no evidence to suggest that taking acrivastine will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【145】But speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【146】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【147】Acrivastine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【148】Can lifestyle changes relieve hay fever?\n\n【149】It'll help if you don't spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【150】### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【151】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【152】### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【153】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n\n【154】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【155】*   Atopic eczema\n*   Conjunctivitis\n*   Food allergy\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n\n【156】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【157】*   HealthUnlocked: acrivastine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n\n【158】Page last reviewed: 13 October 2021  \nNext review due: 13 October 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Liquid omeprazole comes labelled as either 2mg/1ml or 4mg/1ml.\n\n【4】The usual dose to treat:\n\n【5】*   indigestion is 10mg to 20mg a day\n*   heartburn and acid reflux is 20mg to 40mg a day\n*   stomach ulcers is 20mg to 40mg a day\n*   Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is 20mg to 120mg a day\n\n【6】Doses are usually lower for children and people with liver problems.\n\n【7】### Changes to your dose\n\n【8】Sometimes your doctor will increase your dose of omeprazole if it is not working well enough.\n\n【9】Depending on the reason you take omeprazole, you may take a higher dose to begin with, usually for a few weeks.\n\n【10】After this, your doctor may recommend that you take a lower dose.\n\n【11】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【12】You’ll usually take omeprazole once a day, first thing in the morning. It will not affect your stomach, so you can take it with or without food.\n\n【13】If you take omeprazole twice a day, take 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose in the evening.\n\n【14】Swallow tablets and capsules whole with a drink of water or squash.\n\n【15】If you have problems swallowing capsules, most brands of omeprazole capsules are easy to open. This means you can empty the granules inside and mix them into a small amount of water or squash. You could also sprinkle them on soft food, such as yoghurt or apple puree.\n\n【16】Talk to your pharmacist if you're not sure whether you can open your capsules.\n\n【17】Omeprazole also comes as a tablet that melts in your mouth.\n\n【18】You can buy omeprazole 20mg tablets from pharmacies and supermarkets. You cannot buy omeprazole capsules, they are prescription only.\n\n【19】Omeprazole tablets that you buy from pharmacies or supermarkets can be taken by adults for up to 14 days.\n\n【20】Liquid omeprazole can be prescribed by a doctor for children and people who cannot swallow capsules or tablets.\n\n【21】If you or your child is taking omeprazole as a liquid, it will usually be made up for you by your pharmacist. It will come with a syringe or spoon to help you take the right amount. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon because it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【22】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【23】If you bought the medicine yourself from a pharmacy or supermarket, you can take it for up to 14 days. If you feel no better after taking omeprazole for 14 days, tell your doctor. They may want to do tests to find out what's causing your symptoms or change you to a different medicine.\n\n【24】Depending on your condition or the reason you're taking omeprazole, you may only need it for a few weeks or months. Sometimes, you might need to take it for longer, even for many years.\n\n【25】Some people do not need to take omeprazole every day and take it only when they have symptoms.\n\n【26】Once you feel better (often after a few days or weeks), you can stop taking it.\n\n【27】But taking omeprazole for a short time to treat symptoms is not suitable for everyone. Talk to your doctor about what's best for you.\n\n【28】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【29】If you usually take it once a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it’s 12 hours or less to your next dose, do not take it.\n\n【30】If you usually take it twice a day, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it’s 4 hours or less to your next dose, do not take it.\n\n【31】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【32】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【33】Stopping omeprazole\n-------------------\n\n【34】Usually, you can stop taking omeprazole without reducing your dose first. But if you've been taking omeprazole for a long time, speak to your doctor before you stop taking it. Stopping suddenly could make your stomach produce a lot more acid, and make your symptoms come back.\n\n【35】Reducing the dose gradually before stopping completely will prevent this happening.\n\n【36】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【37】It's very unlikely that taking 1 or 2 extra doses by accident will cause any problems.\n\n【38】But you should check if you are worried.\n\n【39】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【40】You take more than your prescribed dose and have any of the following symptoms:\n\n【41】*   feeling sick\n*   being sick\n*   feeling dizzy\n*   stomach pain\n*   diarrhoea\n*   headache\n\n【42】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【43】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【44】More in Omeprazole\n------------------\n\n【45】*   About omeprazole\n*   Who can and cannot take omeprazole\n*   How and when to take omeprazole\n*   Side effects of omeprazole\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility while taking omeprazole\n*   Taking omeprazole with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions about omeprazole\n\n【46】Page last reviewed: 18 November 2021  \nNext review due: 18 November 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

How it's performed\n3.  Safety and regulation\n\n【3】**Osteopathy is a way of detecting, treating and preventing health problems by moving, stretching and massaging a person's muscles and joints.**\n\n【4】Osteopathy is based on the principle that the wellbeing of an individual depends on their bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue functioning smoothly together.\n\n【5】Osteopaths use physical manipulation, stretching and massage with the aim of:\n\n【6】*   increasing the mobility of joints\n*   relieving muscle tension\n*   reducing pain\n*   enhancing the blood supply to tissues\n*   helping the body to heal\n\n【7】They use a range of techniques, but not medicines or surgery.\n\n【8】In the UK, osteopathy is a health profession regulated by UK law.\n\n【9】Read about how osteopathy is performed.\n\n【10】When it's used\n--------------\n\n【11】Most people who see an osteopath do so for help with conditions that affect the muscles, bones and joints, such as:\n\n【12】*   lower back pain\n*   uncomplicated neck pain (as opposed to neck pain after an injury such as whiplash)\n*   shoulder pain and elbow pain (for example, tennis elbow)\n*   arthritis\n*   problems with the pelvis, hips and legs\n*   sports injuries\n*   muscle and joint pain associated with driving, work or pregnancy\n\n【13】If you're pregnant, make sure you seek advice from a GP or midwife about your symptoms before you see an osteopath. You should also make sure you see an osteopath who specialises in muscle or joint pain during pregnancy.\n\n【14】Effectiveness of osteopathy\n---------------------------\n\n【15】Most research into techniques used in osteopathy tends to focus on general \"manual therapy\" techniques, such as spinal manipulation. Manual therapy techniques are used by physiotherapists and chiropractors, as well as osteopaths.\n\n【16】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on managing lower back pain and sciatica recommend manual therapy alongside exercise as a treatment option.\n\n【17】NICE also recommends manual therapy as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis, although osteopathy is not specifically mentioned.\n\n【18】There's some evidence to suggest that osteopathy may be effective for some types of neck, shoulder or lower-limb pain, some types of headache, and recovery after hip or knee operations.\n\n【19】There's only limited or no scientific evidence that it's an effective treatment for conditions unrelated to the bones and muscles (musculoskeletal system), including:\n\n【20】*   asthma\n*   period pain\n*   digestive disorders\n*   depression\n*   excessive crying in babies (colic)\n*   glue ear\n*   problems affecting the jaw (temporomandibular disorder)\n*   abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)\n\n【21】Accessing osteopathy\n--------------------\n\n【22】Osteopathy is available in some areas on the NHS. Your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) should be able to tell you whether it's available in your area.\n\n【23】Most people pay for osteopathy treatment privately. Treatment costs vary, but typically range from £40 to £55 for a 30- to 40-minute session.\n\n【24】You do not need to be referred by your GP to see an osteopath privately. Most private health insurance providers also provide cover for osteopathic treatment.\n\n【25】Only people registered with the General Osteopathic Council (GOsC) are allowed to practise as or call themselves osteopaths.\n\n【26】You can find a nearby registered osteopath on the GOsC website.\n\n【27】Read more about how osteopathy is regulated.\n\n【28】Page last reviewed: 09 August 2021  \nNext review due: 09 August 2024\n\n【29】*   Next : How it's performed", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Constipation is more common at the end of pregnancy and just after having a baby.\n\n【3】If you're pregnant, your doctor or midwife may advise you to first try to treat constipation without taking a medicine.\n\n【4】You can do this by eating more fibre (like potatoes, high-fibre cereals, wholemeal bread, brown rice or wholewheat pasta, fruit and vegetables) and drinking plenty of fluids. You'll also be encouraged to do gentle exercise.\n\n【5】If dietary and lifestyle changes do not work, your doctor or midwife may recommend a laxative such as macrogol.\n\n【6】Macrogol and breastfeeding\n--------------------------\n\n【7】It is always better to treat constipation without taking a medicine first. If diet and lifestyle changes do not work, your doctor or midwife may recommend a laxative.\n\n【8】You can take macrogol while breastfeeding. It does not pass into breast milk so it's very unlikely to cause any side effects in your baby.\n\n【9】If you have any concerns about your baby, talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【10】Macrogol and fertility\n----------------------\n\n【11】There's no good evidence to suggest that taking macrogol reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【12】Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【14】Find out more about how laxatives such as macrogol can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.\n\n【15】More in Macrogol\n----------------\n\n【16】*   About macrogol\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【17】Page last reviewed: 21 October 2022  \nNext review due: 21 October 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

If you think someone is experiencing massive haemoptysis, call 999 for an ambulance.\n\n【10】A person with massive haemoptysis needs to be admitted to hospital. A tube may need to be placed into their throat to assist them with their breathing.\n\n【11】A procedure called a bronchial artery embolisation (BAE) will be required to stop the bleeding.\n\n【12】During a BAE, a special dye is injected into your arteries so they show up clearly on X-rays.\n\n【13】Then, using X-ray scans as a guide, the source of the bleeding is located and injected with tiny particles, around the size of a grain of sand, that will help clog the vessel up and stop the bleeding.\n\n【14】Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021  \nNext review due: 27 July 2024\n\n【15】*   Previous : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Of these, around 340,000 are registered as blind or partially sighted.**\n\n【2】Being told you have a visual impairment that can't be treated can be difficult to come to terms with.\n\n【3】Some people go through a process similar to bereavement, where they experience a range of emotions including shock, anger, and denial, before eventually coming to accept their condition.\n\n【4】Specialist referral\n-------------------\n\n【5】If you're blind or partially sighted, you may be referred to a specialist low-vision clinic, which is often located within a hospital. Staff at the clinic can help you understand your condition and come to terms with your diagnosis.\n\n【6】They can also advise you about practical things, such as lighting and vision aids, and let you know about further sources of help and support.\n\n【7】Ask your local hospital if they have an Eye Clinic Liaison Officer (ECLO), whose role involves providing support to people with vision loss in eye clinics.\n\n【8】Support groups\n--------------\n\n【9】If you're blind or partially sighted, you may find it helpful to contact a support group for people with vision loss.\n\n【10】### Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)\n\n【11】The RNIB is the UK's leading charity for people with vision loss. The RNIB website offers useful information, such as coming to terms with sight loss.\n\n【12】The RNIB's helpline is open Monday to Friday from 8am to 8pm and Saturday from 9am to 1pm. The number is 0303 123 9999, with calls costing no more than a standard rate call to an 01 or 02 number. You can also email helpline staff (helpline@rnib.org.uk).\n\n【13】The RNIB's website is specially designed for people with sight loss and provides a wide range of useful information and resources, including an online community and RNIB online shop.\n\n【14】### Other national charities\n\n【15】Other national charities that specialise in vision loss and you may find useful include:\n\n【16】*   The Macular Society – helpline: 0300 303 0111\n*   Glaucoma UK – helpline: 01233 648170 or email helpline@glaucoma.uk\n*   Retina UK – helpline: 0300 111 4000 or email: helpline@retinauk.org.uk\n*   Diabetes UK – 0345 123 2399 or email: info@diabetes.org.uk\n*   Blind Veterans UK – 0800 389 7979\n*   Royal Society for Blind Children\n*   SeeAbility\n*   Thomas Pocklington Trust\n\n【17】### Local organisations\n\n【18】There are also many local voluntary organisations around the country that help and support people with vision problems. You can find local support organisations on the RNIB's Sightline Directory.\n\n【19】Registering as blind or partially sighted\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【20】If your vision has deteriorated to a certain level, you may choose to register as visually impaired. Depending on the severity of your vision loss you'll either be registered as sight impaired (previously \"partially sighted\") or severely sight impaired (previously \"blind\").\n\n【21】Your eye specialist (ophthalmologist) will measure your ability to see detail at a distance (visual acuity) and how much you can see from the side of your eye when looking straight ahead (your field of vision).\n\n【22】These measurements will help your ophthalmologist determine whether you're eligible to be certified as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. If you are, they will complete an official certificate with the results of your eye examination.\n\n【23】In England and Wales this certificate is called the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI), in Scotland it's called the CVI (Scotland) form, and in Northern Ireland it's called an A655.\n\n【24】Your ophthalmologist will send a copy of the certificate to you, a copy to your GP and a copy to your local social services department. Upon receiving the certificate, your local social services team will contact you to ask whether you want to be added to its register of visually impaired people. If you say \"yes\" then you become registered.\n\n【25】After you're registered, social services will contact you again to arrange for an assessment to be carried out. The aim is to assess your needs and find out what help you require to remain independent, such as help with cleaning and cooking, or help with mobility and transport.\n\n【26】Registering as visually impaired isn't compulsory, but it can help you to get a range of benefits, including:\n\n【27】*   benefits to help with any costs relating to your disability or illness\n*   a reduction in the TV licence fee\n*   help with NHS costs\n*   help with Council Tax and tax allowances\n*   reduced fees on public transport\n*   parking concessions\n\n【28】Find out more:\n\n【29】*   RNIB: registering as sight impaired\n*   GOV.UK: registering vision impairment as a disability\n\n【30】Changes to your home\n--------------------\n\n【31】Most visually impaired people can continue to live at home. However, you'll probably need to make some changes to your home, particularly if you live on your own.\n\n【32】Below is a list of some important pieces of equipment you may find useful.\n\n【33】*   Big-button telephone – both landline and mobile phones are available from the RNIB online shop.\n*   Computer, smartphone or tablet – the internet can provide a real sense of connection to friends and family as well as other people with a visual impairment. It's also a practical way of finding out information and obtaining goods and services. Big-button keyboards, screen display software and text readers are available from the RNIB.\n*   Community alarm – this small, wearable device has an alarm button which, if pressed, sends an alarm signal to a response centre, which will alert a nominated friend or carer. Your local authority should be able to provide you with further information.\n*   Bright lighting – bright light bulbs and adjustable lights are essential for your home, particularly in the kitchen and the stairs (areas where you're most likely to have an accident). Fluorescent bulbs are recommended because they produce the most light and tend to be cheaper in the long term than conventional bulbs. Lighting in and around the home: A guide to better lighting for people with visual impairment by the Thomas Pocklington Trust, contains more information on the importance of lighting.\n\n【34】The way your house is painted can also make it easier to find your way around. Using a two-tone contrast approach, such as black and white, can make it easier to tell the difference between nearby objects, such as a door and its handle or the stairs and its handrail.\n\n【35】Read more from the RNIB about adapting your home\n\n【36】Reading and writing\n-------------------\n\n【37】There are several options available if you're having problems reading standard text in books, newspapers and magazines.\n\n【38】One of the simplest options is to use a magnifying device that can make print appear bigger to help you read. These can be obtained from a number of places including hospital low-vision services, optometrists, local voluntary organisations, and the RNIB.\n\n【39】The RNIB also has a collection of large-print publications you can borrow, as do most libraries.\n\n【40】You could also use an e-reader to help you read. E-readers are handheld devices that allow you to download books and subscribe to newspapers and magazines on the internet. You can choose a setting that allows you to display text at a larger size. Or you can use text-to-speech software.\n\n【41】The RNIB has more information on text-to-speech in eBooks\n\n【42】If you're unable to read at all you could listen to audio recordings. You can sign up to the:\n\n【43】*   RNIB's Newsagent scheme, which provides more than 200 magazine and newspaper titles in different formats, such as online or on CD.\n*   RNIB Talking Books Service, where you can download audio books to listen to on your smartphone, tablet or computer or on a device known as a DAISY player. You can also get books on CD or USB stick, delivered to your door.\n\n【44】You can also install screen-reading software on your computer that will read out emails, documents and text on the internet.\n\n【45】The RNIB has more information about using screen-reading software\n\n【46】There are also voice recognition programmes where you speak into a microphone and the software translates what you say into writing. These programmes can also be used to issue commands, such as closing down the internet and moving from one website to another.\n\n【47】### Braille\n\n【48】Some people with severe sight loss, particularly those who've had the problem from a young age, choose to learn Braille. Braille is a writing system where raised dots are used as a substitute for written letters.\n\n【49】As well as Braille versions of books and magazines, you can buy Braille display units, which can be attached to computers that allow you to read the text displayed on a computer screen. Braille computer keyboards are also available.\n\n【50】The RNIB website has more information about reading and Braille\n\n【51】Getting around\n--------------\n\n【52】There are several different methods you can use to get around independently if you have a problem with your vision.\n\n【53】### Long cane\n\n【54】You may find a long cane useful when travelling. These canes are usually foldable and can help you get around by detecting objects in your path. The cane will also make drivers and other pedestrians aware that you have sight loss.\n\n【55】To get the most from a long cane, it's a good idea to attend a training course that will teach you how to use it.\n\n【56】The charity Guide Dogs has more information about getting around safely with a long cane\n\n【57】### Guide dogs\n\n【58】Guide Dogs has been providing guide dogs for people with vision loss for many years. Guide dogs can help you get around, and provide both a sense of independence and companionship.\n\n【59】If you apply for a guide dog, Guide Dogs provide all the essential equipment free of charge and can also offer financial assistance if needed for things like food or vet costs.\n\n【60】You don't need to have lost all your sight to benefit from a guide dog and you don't have to be officially registered as blind or partially sighted to apply for one.\n\n【61】Guide Dogs has more on applying for a guide dog\n\n【62】Guide Dogs also offer a number of other services for people with a visual impairment (even if you don't have a guide dog), such as Help for children and families and mobility training.\n\n【63】The Guide Dogs' Sighted guiding service aims to reduce the isolation that many people with sight loss experience, helping to rebuild their confidence and regain their independence.\n\n【64】### Global positioning system (GPS)\n\n【65】A global positioning system (GPS) is a navigational aid that uses signals from satellites to tell you where you are and help plan your journeys.\n\n【66】GPS devices are available as standalone units that can be programmed using a Braille keyboard, which tell you your current location and give you directions to where you want to go.\n\n【67】If you have a smartphone, there are a number of GPS apps you can download.\n\n【68】The RNIB website has more information about using GPS\n\n【69】### Driving\n\n【70】If you're diagnosed with a condition that affects your vision, you have a legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Failure to do so is a crime and can result in a fine of up to £1,000.\n\n【71】GOV.UK has more on driving with a disability or a health condition\n\n【72】If you're registered as having a sight impairment, the DVLA will assume your driving licence is no longer valid and you'll no longer be able to drive.\n\n【73】Exceptions are occasionally made for people with mild vision impairment. If you think this applies to you, then your doctor will need to fill in a DVLA medical information questionnaire.\n\n【74】You're only legally allowed to drive if you can read a number plate from a distance of 20 metres (65 feet), and an eye test shows your visual acuity is at least 6/12. You're allowed to wear glasses or contact lenses when reading the plate or letter chart.\n\n【75】There are also standards relating to your visual field and driving. If you have a condition that may reduce your visual field, the DVLA may ask you to complete a visual field test to demonstrate you're safe to drive.\n\n【76】Technology\n----------\n\n【77】Technology to help you live well and safely with sight loss is developing all the time. You can read:\n\n【78】*   the RNIB's information on technology and useful products\n*   the Guide Dogs' information on technology for visual impairment\n\n【79】Employment\n----------\n\n【80】If you're currently employed and have recently been diagnosed with a visual impairment, you should contact the GOV.UK: Access to Work scheme.\n\n【81】Access to Work is a scheme run by Jobcentre Plus that provides advice and support about what equipment and adjustments may be required to enable you to do your job.\n\n【82】They also offer a grant to contribute towards the costs of any equipment or training you may need, such as voice recognition software, a Braille keyboard and display unit and a printer that can convert text into Braille (Braille embossers).\n\n【83】Depending on the size of the company you work for, the grant can pay for 80% to 100% of costs, up to £10,000.\n\n【84】Find out more:\n\n【85】*   RNIB: equality, rights and employment\n*   GOV.UK: Jobcentre Plus\n*   The Thomas Pocklington Trust: employment\n\n【86】You don't have to disclose that you have a visual impairment when applying for a job, but it's usually recommended that you do.\n\n【87】If you feel you've been turned down for a job because of your disability, and you were capable of doing the job, you can make a complaint under the Equality Act 2010.\n\n【88】Some people with a visual impairment decide to become self-employed, often because it allows them the flexibility to work at home for hours they choose.\n\n【89】The RNIB website has more information and advice about equality, rights and employment\n\n【90】### Regular sight tests\n\n【91】If you have vision loss, it's still important to have regular sight tests so your optometrist (eye specialist) can check for further changes in your eyes and give you advice about how to make the best use of your vision.\n\n【92】Find an optician or more about NHS eyes services.\n\n【93】Page last reviewed: 22 December 2021  \nNext review due: 22 December 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "8e69a949-5674-44ac-87c7-97db951e955d", "title": "Acupuncture", "text": "【0】Acupuncture\n===========\n\n【1】**Acupuncture is a treatment derived from ancient Chinese medicine. Fine needles are inserted at certain sites in the body for therapeutic or preventative purposes.**\n\n【2】It is used in many NHS GP practices, as well as in most pain clinics and hospices in the UK.\n\n【3】Acupuncture is often seen as a form of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM).\n\n【4】How acupuncture works\n---------------------\n\n【5】Western medical acupuncture (dry needling) is the use of acupuncture following a medical diagnosis. It involves stimulating sensory nerves under the skin and in the muscles.\n\n【6】This results in the body producing natural substances, such as pain-relieving endorphins. It's likely that these naturally released substances are responsible for the beneficial effects experienced with acupuncture.\n\n【7】A course of acupuncture is usually recommended because it can take a few sessions for you to see improvements.\n\n【8】Traditional acupuncture is based on the belief that an energy, or \"life force\", flows through the body in channels called meridians. This life force is known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\").\n\n【9】Practitioners who use acupuncture in the traditional way believe that when Qi does not flow freely through the body, this can cause illness. They also believe acupuncture can restore the flow of Qi, and so restore health.\n\n【10】Uses of acupuncture\n-------------------\n\n【11】Acupuncture practitioners – sometimes called acupuncturists – use acupuncture to treat a wide range of health conditions. However, the use of acupuncture is not always based on rigorous scientific evidence.\n\n【12】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides guidelines for the NHS on the use of treatments and care of patients.\n\n【13】Currently, NICE only recommends considering acupuncture as a treatment option for:\n\n【14】*   chronic (long-term) pain\n*   chronic tension-type headaches\n*   migraines\n*   prostatitis symptoms\n*   hiccups\n\n【15】Acupuncture is also often used to treat other conditions and symptoms, including:\n\n【16】*   joint and muscle pain\n*   jaw pain\n*   cancer symptoms such as pain\n*   side effects of cancer treatment such as feeling or being sick from chemotherapy\n*   feeling sick or being sick after surgery\n\n【17】However, the evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture compared with other treatments is unclear.\n\n【18】Acupuncture on the NHS\n----------------------\n\n【19】Acupuncture is sometimes available on the NHS, most often from GP surgeries or physiotherapists, although access is limited.\n\n【20】Most acupuncture patients pay for private treatment. The cost of acupuncture varies widely between practitioners.\n\n【21】If you're being treated by an acupuncture practitioner for a health condition or are considering having acupuncture, it's advisable to discuss this with your GP.\n\n【22】How acupuncture is performed\n----------------------------\n\n【23】An initial acupuncture session usually lasts 20 minutes to 1 hour and involves an assessment of your general health, medical history and a physical examination, followed by insertion of the acupuncture needles.\n\n【24】Courses of treatment often involve several separate sessions, but this can vary.\n\n【25】### Insertion of the needles\n\n【26】Credit:\n\n【27】Picture Partners / Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/acupuncturist-performing-acupuncture-on-a-clients-back-image8055273.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=5854BCDD-3312-49E1-937D-808EC258854F&p=11630&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dAG51JA%26qt\\_raw%3dAG51JA%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d195878%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d0%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d\n\n【28】The needles are inserted into specific places on the body, which practitioners call acupuncture points.\n\n【29】During the session, you'll usually be asked to sit or lie down. You may also be asked to remove some clothes so the practitioner can access certain parts of your body.\n\n【30】The needles used are very fine and are usually a few centimetres long. They should be single-use, pre-sterilised needles that are disposed of immediately after use.\n\n【31】Acupuncture practitioners choose specific points to place the needles based on your condition. Several points may be used during a typical session, depending on the number of symptoms you have.\n\n【32】The needles may be inserted just under the skin, or deeper so they reach muscle. Once the needles are in place, they may be left in position for a length of time lasting from a few minutes up to around 30 minutes.\n\n【33】You may feel a tingling or a dull ache when the needles are inserted but you should not experience any significant pain. If you do, let your practitioner know straight away.\n\n【34】Acupuncture safety and regulation\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】There's no statutory regulation of acupuncture in England.\n\n【36】If you choose to have acupuncture, it is recommended that you check the acupuncture practitioner is either a regulated healthcare professional such as a doctor, nurse or physiotherapist or a member of a national acupuncture organisation.\n\n【37】You can find an accredited acupuncturist on the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care website.\n\n【38】When it's done by a qualified practitioner, acupuncture is generally very safe.\n\n【39】Some people experience mild, short-term side effects such as:\n\n【40】*   pain where the needles puncture the skin\n*   bleeding or bruising where the needles puncture the skin\n*   drowsiness\n*   feeling sick\n*   feeling dizzy or faint\n\n【41】Serious side effects such as a punctured lung or infection are very rare.\n\n【42】If you have a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia, or are taking any medicines such as anticoagulant medicine, talk to your GP or acupuncture practitioner before you have acupuncture. \n\n【43】Acupuncture is also not usually advised if you have a metal allergy or an infection in the area where needles may be inserted.\n\n【44】It's generally safe to have acupuncture when you're pregnant. However, let your acupuncture practitioner know if you're pregnant because certain acupuncture points cannot be used safely during pregnancy.\n\n【45】Read more about the safety of complementary therapies in pregnancy.\n\n【46】Page last reviewed: 28 February 2023  \nNext review due: 28 February 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

About ketoconazole\n2.  Key facts\n3.  Who can and cannot use ketoconazole\n4.  How and when to use ketoconazole\n5.  Side effects of ketoconazole\n6.  How to cope with side effects of ketoconazole\n7.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about ketoconazole\n\n【3】1\\. About ketoconazole\n----------------------\n\n【4】Ketoconazole is an antifungal medicine. It's used to treat skin infections caused by a fungus (yeast). It can also prevent them coming back.\n\n【5】It treats different types of fungal infections including:\n\n【6】*   athlete's foot\n*   jock itch, an infection in the groin area\n*   sweat rash (intertrigo), a rash that usually appears in folds of skin\n*   dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis, where your scalp or other areas of your skin become scaly and dry or greasy\n*   pityriasis versicolor, sometimes called tinea versicolour, where small patches of skin become scaly and change colour\n\n【7】Ketoconazole is available as a cream or shampoo.\n\n【8】You can buy most ketoconazole creams and shampoos in pharmacies and supermarkets, or get them on prescription. For treating pityriasis versicolor, you will need a prescription.\n\n【9】Ketoconazole also comes as tablets but these usually only treat a rare condition called Cushing's syndrome. The tablets are available on prescription only, and they are not covered here.\n\n【10】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【11】*   Ketoconazole usually works within 2 to 3 weeks for most fungal infections, but it can take 6 weeks for athlete's foot to get better.\n*   It works by killing the yeasts (fungi) that cause the infections.\n*   The most common side effects of the cream and shampoo are irritated or red skin.\n*   For most infections, you'll usually use the cream once or twice a day and the shampoo once or twice a week.\n*   Some people use ketoconazole shampoo every 1 to 2 weeks to help stop dandruff coming back.\n\n【12】3\\. Who can and cannot use ketoconazole\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】Ketoconazole creams and shampoos can be used by most adults and children aged 12 years and over.\n\n【14】Ketoconazole is not suitable for everyone. To make sure it's safe for you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using it if you have ever had an allergic reaction to ketoconazole or any other medicine.\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to use ketoconazole\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Always follow the instructions that come with your medicine, or your doctor's advice.\n\n【17】How long you use ketoconazole for and how often depends on the type of skin problem you have.\n\n【18】### How often to use cream for athlete's foot, jock itch and sweat rash\n\n【19】Use the cream once or twice a day on the infected skin and surrounding area. For athlete's foot, you need to use it twice a day regularly.\n\n【20】Carry on using the cream for 3 days after your symptoms have cleared up, to stop the infection coming back.\n\n【21】### How often to use shampoo or cream for seborrhoeic dermatitis\n\n【22】Use the shampoo twice a week for 2 to 4 weeks until your symptoms have cleared. Then use it once every 1 to 2 weeks, to stop them coming back.\n\n【23】Alternatively, you can use the cream once or twice a day, for 2 to 4 weeks, and then use the shampoo once every 1 to 2 weeks to stop your symptoms coming back.\n\n【24】### How often to use shampoo for dandruff\n\n【25】Use the shampoo twice a week for 2 to 4 weeks, then once every 1 to 2 weeks to stop your dandruff coming back.\n\n【26】### How often to use cream or shampoo for pityriasis versicolor\n\n【27】Use the shampoo once a day, for up to 5 days.\n\n【28】For treating small areas of skin, you can use the cream instead. Put the cream on once or twice a day for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\n【29】If your symptoms tend to return in sunlight, use the shampoo once a day for up to 3 days before going out in the sun.\n\n【30】### How to use ketoconazole cream\n\n【31】1.  Wash and dry the infected area of skin. If you're treating your feet, make sure you dry between your toes.\n2.  Use your own towel or flannel. This stops you passing the infection on to anyone else.\n3.  Gently rub the cream into the infected area and surrounding skin. You'll usually need a small amount, depending on the size of the area you're treating. Be careful not to let the cream get into your eyes or mouth. If it does get into your eyes or mouth, rinse them with water.\n4.  Wash your hands afterwards. This stops you spreading the infection to other parts of your body or other people.\n\n【32】If you're using any other creams, ointments or lotions on the same area of skin, do not put them on at the same time as ketoconazole cream. After putting on the ketoconazole cream, wait 30 minutes before you use different products on the same area. This gives the ketoconazole time to be absorbed into your skin.\n\n【33】### How to use ketoconazole shampoo\n\n【34】1.  Rinse your hair or the infected area of skin with water.\n2.  Shake the shampoo bottle, then squeeze a small amount onto the infected area.\n3.  If you're treating your scalp, massage the shampoo into your scalp until it makes a lather.\n4.  Leave the shampoo on for 3 to 5 minutes, then wash it off with water. Try not to get the shampoo into your eyes or mouth. If it gets into your eyes or mouth, rinse them with water.\n5.  Wash your hands afterwards. This stops you spreading the infection to other parts of your body or other people.\n\n【35】### What if I forget to use it?\n\n【36】If you forget to use your ketoconazole cream or shampoo, just skip the missed dose and then keep to your usual routine.\n\n【37】### What if I use too much?\n\n【38】If you use too much ketoconazole shampoo or cream, or use it more often than you need to, it may make your skin irritated or red. If this happens, use less the next time.\n\n【39】5\\. Side effects of ketoconazole\n--------------------------------\n\n【40】Like all medicines, ketoconazole cream and shampoo can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them.\n\n【41】Most side effects are minor. You can try using a smaller amount of the cream or shampoo to see if that helps.\n\n【42】### Common side effects\n\n【43】You're unlikely to have common side effects when using the right amount of ketoconazole shampoo.\n\n【44】With ketoconazole cream, common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They usually affect your skin where you've applied the cream.\n\n【45】Talk to a pharmacist or doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away, or if they spread beyond the area of skin you've treated:\n\n【46】*   itching or redness\n*   a burning feeling on your skin\n\n【47】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【48】Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but can happen with ketoconazole cream or shampoo.\n\n【49】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【50】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【51】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【52】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【53】These are not all the side effects of ketoconazole. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n\n【54】Information:\n\n【55】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【56】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【57】6\\. How to cope with side effects of ketoconazole\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】**What to do about:**\n\n【59】*   **itching, redness, or a burning feeling on your skin** – try using less cream. Apply it carefully, just to the area you need to treat. Rub it in gently. Try wearing loose clothing to reduce sweat. If the itching, redness or burning feeling is no better after a few days, or it gets worse at any time, stop using the cream and speak to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【60】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【61】### Ketoconazole and pregnancy\n\n【62】You can use ketoconazole cream or shampoo if you're pregnant. Only tiny amounts are absorbed into your body so it will not affect your baby.\n\n【63】### Ketoconazole and breastfeeding\n\n【64】If you want to breastfeed and are using ketoconazole on your chest, wash any cream off your breasts and nipples and then wash your hands before feeding your baby.\n\n【65】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【66】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【67】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【68】Only tiny amounts of ketoconazole are absorbed into your body when you use it as a cream or shampoo. You can usually use ketoconazole skin treatments while taking most medicines.\n\n【69】### Using ketoconazole with other skin treatments\n\n【70】If you're using a mild steroid cream (such as hydrocortisone) to help with swelling or inflammation caused by the skin infection, put the steroid cream on in the morning and the ketoconazole cream in the evening.\n\n【71】If you're using ketoconazole twice a day, make sure you wait at least 30 minutes after putting it on before using the steroid cream.\n\n【72】### Mixing ketoconazole with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【73】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while using ketoconazole. They are not tested in the same way as other medicines.\n\n【74】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【75】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【76】9\\. Common questions about ketoconazole\n---------------------------------------\n\n【77】How does ketoconazole work?\n\n【78】Ketoconazole is an antifungal medicine. It works on the fungus (yeast) that is causing the infection.\n\n【79】Ketoconazole causes holes to appear in the fungus's cell membrane and the contents to leak out. This kills the fungus and treats the infection.\n\n【80】How long does ketoconazole take to work?\n\n【81】Ketoconazole cream and shampoo usually take 2 to 4 weeks to work for dandruff, scaly and dry or greasy skin (seborrhoeic dermatitis), jock itch and sweat rash.\n\n【82】Athlete's foot and some other skin infections can take up to 6 weeks to get better.\n\n【83】Pityriasis versicolor (a fungal infection that causes skin to become scaly and discoloured) gets better within 5 days of treatment with ketoconazole shampoo, or after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with the cream. However, it can take several weeks or months for your skin colour to return to normal.\n\n【84】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if your symptoms are no better after 4 weeks.\n\n【85】After your skin infection has cleared up, continue to use the cream for a few days, to stop your symptoms coming back.\n\n【86】What if ketoconazole does not work?\n\n【87】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if:\n\n【88】*   your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks\n*   your symptoms have not improved after 2 weeks after you used ketoconazole shampoo for pityriasis versicolor.\n\n【89】You may need to use a different treatment.\n\n【90】If your symptoms get worse at any time, speak to your doctor.\n\n【91】What do I do if the infection comes back after treatment?\n\n【92】#### Dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis\n\n【93】Dandruff and other types of seborrhoeic dermatitis can come back. You can usually use ketoconazole again if it worked well before.\n\n【94】When the infection is under control again, you can continue to use ketoconazole shampoo less often, so the skin infection does not come back.\n\n【95】Some people use ketoconazole shampoo every 1 to 2 weeks for months, or even for years, to stop dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis returning.\n\n【96】#### Athlete’s foot, jock itch, sweat rash\n\n【97】Athlete's foot, jock itch and sweat rash can come back.\n\n【98】You can usually use ketoconazole cream again if it worked well before and as long as the infection is mild and has not spread.\n\n【99】#### Pityriasis versicolor\n\n【100】Pityriasis versicolor (a fungal infection that causes skin to become scaly and discoloured) can come back. Warm, damp conditions or being in the sun sometimes bring it back.\n\n【101】You can usually use ketoconazole again in the same way as before.\n\n【102】If your symptoms tend to return in sunlight, use the shampoo once a day for up to 3 days before going out in the sun.\n\n【103】You can then use ketoconazole shampoo 1 to 4 times a month to stop symptoms coming back.\n\n【104】Are there other treatments for fungal infections?\n\n【105】There are many different antifungal medicines. Some are available to buy from a pharmacy, and others are available on prescription.\n\n【106】They can come as creams, gels, sprays, tablets, capsules and liquid.\n\n【107】Your doctor or a pharmacist will be able to recommend the best treatment for you, based on your condition.\n\n【108】Antifungal medicines include:\n\n【109】*   clotrimazole\n*   econazole\n*   fenticonazole\n*   fluconazole\n*   itraconazole\n*   miconazole\n*   terbinafine\n\n【110】Can I drink alcohol?\n\n【111】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using ketoconazole cream or shampoo.\n\n【112】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【113】No, you can eat and drink normally while using ketoconazole cream or shampoo.\n\n【114】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【115】When ketoconazole is used as a cream or shampoo, only tiny amounts are absorbed into the body. There's no evidence that it affects the fertility of men or women.\n\n【116】Will ketoconazole affect my contraception?\n\n【117】When it's used as a cream or shampoo, ketoconazole does not affect any type of contraceptive, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【118】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【119】Yes, you can drive or ride a bike while using ketoconazole cream or shampoo.\n\n【120】What else can I do to help fungal infections?\n\n【121】If you have a fungal skin infection, these tips may help:\n\n【122】*   always wash your hands after treating the infection to stop it from spreading\n*   do not scratch the area with the infection, as this can make the infection worse\n*   keep the affected areas of your skin clean and dry\n*   do not share towels, bedsheets or combs with other people as you could spread the infection to them\n*   wash towels and bedding regularly\n\n【123】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【124】*   Athlete's foot\n*   Dandruff\n*   Fungal nail infection\n*   Pityriasis versicolor\n\n【125】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【126】*   HealthUnlocked: ketoconazole forum\n*   British Association of Dermatologists: patient information leaflets\n\n【127】Page last reviewed: 24 June 2021  \nNext review due: 24 June 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Children learn by example. You can encourage your child to be active and eat healthily by doing so yourself.\n\n【8】Set a good example by going for a walk or bike ride instead of watching TV or surfing the internet.\n\n【9】Playing in the park or swimming with your children shows them being active is fun. It's also a great opportunity for you all to spend time together.\n\n【10】Any changes you make to your child's diet and lifestyle are much more likely to be accepted if the changes are small and involve the whole family.\n\n【11】Find easy ways to eat well and move more as a family on the Better Health website\n\n【12】If you're not sure what activities you'd like to try as a family, head to the exercise section on the NHS website.\n\n【13】Get active\n----------\n\n【14】School-aged children need about 60 minutes of physical activity a day for good health.\n\n【15】Activity does not need to be all at once, it can be spread throughout the day. It could include riding a bike, skateboarding, walking to school, skipping, swimming, dancing and martial arts.\n\n【16】Children under 5 years old need more than 3 hours' activity a day. It can take the form of active play, such as ball games, chasing games like \"it\" and \"tag\", riding a bike or scooter, using playground swings, climbing frames and see-saws.\n\n【17】Activities should make children breathe faster and feel warmer.\n\n【18】Walking or cycling short distances instead of using the car or bus is a great way to be active together as a family. And you'll save money, too.\n\n【19】Find out about physical activity guidelines for children under 5 years\n\n【20】Find out about physical activity guidelines for children and young people aged 5 to 18\n\n【21】Child-size portions\n-------------------\n\n【22】There's very little official guidance on precisely how much food children require, so you'll need to use your own judgement on child-size portions.\n\n【23】A good rule of thumb is to start meals with small servings and let your child ask for more if they're still hungry.\n\n【24】Avoid making your child finish everything on the plate or eat more than they want to.\n\n【25】Use smaller plates for younger children, as adult-size plates could encourage them to eat oversized portions.\n\n【26】It may also help if you encourage your child to eat slowly and have set mealtimes. You can use mealtimes as an opportunity to catch up on what's happened during the day.\n\n【27】Explain to your child how to get the balance of their diet right using the Eatwell Guide. It shows how much we should all eat from each food group.\n\n【28】Read more about how to eat a balanced diet.\n\n【29】Get ideas for healthier lunchbox recipes and healthier food swaps on the Better Health website.\n\n【30】Eat a healthy balanced diet\n---------------------------\n\n【31】Children, just like adults, should aim to eat 5 or more portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They're a great source of fibre and vitamins and minerals.\n\n【32】Getting 5 A Day should not be too difficult. Almost all fruit and vegetables count towards your child's 5 A Day, including fresh, tinned, frozen and dried.\n\n【33】Juices, smoothies, beans and pulses also count.\n\n【34】Be aware that unsweetened 100% fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies only count as a maximum of 1 portion of their 5 A Day. For example, if they have 2 glasses of fruit juice and a smoothie in 1 day, that still only counts as 1 portion.\n\n【35】Their combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.\n\n【36】If they have 150ml of orange juice and a 150ml smoothie in 1 day, for example, they'll have exceeded the recommendation by 150ml.\n\n【37】When fruit is blended or juiced, it releases the sugars. This increases the risk of tooth decay, so it's best to drink fruit juice or smoothies at mealtimes.\n\n【38】Discourage your child from having sugary or high-fat foods like sweets, cakes, biscuits, crisps, chocolate, some sugary cereals, and sugar-sweetened soft and fizzy drinks. These foods and drinks tend to be high in calories.\n\n【39】Aim for your child to get most of their calories from foods like fruit and vegetables, and starchy foods like bread, potatoes, pasta and rice (preferably wholegrain versions).\n\n【40】They should also have some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein foods, and some dairy or dairy alternatives.\n\n【41】And swap sugary soft drinks, juice and flavoured milks for water, lower-fat milks and diet, sugar-free or no added sugar drinks.\n\n【42】Find out more about healthier food swaps on the Better Health website\n\n【43】Less screen time and more sleep\n-------------------------------\n\n【44】Help your children avoid sitting and lying around too much, as it makes it more likely for them to put on weight.\n\n【45】Limit the amount of time your child spends on inactive pastimes such as watching television, playing video games and playing on electronic devices.\n\n【46】There's no hard and fast advice on how much is too much, but experts say children should have no more than 2 hours of screen time each day.\n\n【47】And remove all screens (including mobile phones) from their bedroom at night.\n\n【48】It also helps children stay trim if they sleep well. It's been shown children who don't have the recommended amount of sleep are more likely to be overweight.\n\n【49】The less children sleep, the greater the risk of them becoming overweight. Lack of sleep can also affect their mood and behaviour.\n\n【50】More in Children's weight\n-------------------------\n\n【51】*   The National Child Measurement Programme\n*   Advice for parents of overweight children\n*   Advice for parents of healthy-weight children\n*   How to help your child gain weight\n\n【52】Page last reviewed: 4 October 2023  \nNext review due: 4 October 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

They'll try to find out what's causing it.\n\n【9】Diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica can be difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【10】These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed.\n\n【11】Causes of polymyalgia rheumatica\n--------------------------------\n\n【12】The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible.\n\n【13】Polymyalgia rheumatica is an age-related condition. Most people diagnosed with it are over 65, and it's very rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men.\n\n【14】Treating polymyalgia rheumatica\n-------------------------------\n\n【15】A steroid medicine called prednisolone is the main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. It's used to help relieve the symptoms.\n\n【16】To start with, you may be prescribed a moderate dose of prednisolone, which will be gradually reduced over time.\n\n【17】Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need a course of steroid treatment that lasts for 12 months to 2 years to prevent their symptoms returning.\n\n【18】Temporal arteritis\n------------------\n\n【19】Up to 1 in 5 people with polymyalgia rheumatica develop a more serious condition called temporal arteritis (also known as giant cell arteritis), where the arteries in the head and neck become inflamed.\n\n【20】Symptoms of temporal arteritis can include:\n\n【21】*   a new or frequent headache that usually develops suddenly (your scalp may also feel sore or tender)\n*   pain in the jaw muscles or tongue when eating or talking\n*   problems with sight, such as double vision or loss of vision in 1 or both eyes\n\n【22】If you have any of these symptoms, contact a GP immediately, go to 111.nhs.uk or call NHS 111.\n\n【23】Unlike polymyalgia rheumatica, temporal arteritis requires immediate medical attention.

It also comes as a gel for mouth ulcers and cold sores.\n\n【6】If you've had a stroke or heart attack, or are at high risk of a heart attack, your doctor may recommend that you take a daily low-dose aspirin. Some women may also be prescribed low-dose aspirin while they’re pregnant.\n\n【7】This is different to taking aspirin for pain relief. Only take low-dose aspirin if your doctor recommends it. Read our information on low-dose aspirin.\n\n【8】Key facts\n---------\n\n【9】*   It's best to take aspirin with food. That way, you'll be less likely to get an upset stomach or stomach ache.\n*   Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16 (unless their doctor prescribes it). It can make children more likely to develop a very rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.\n*   You should start to feel better 20 to 30 minutes after taking aspirin.\n*   Aspirin is an ingredient in combined medicines such as Anadin Original, Anadin Extra, Alka-Seltzer Original, Alka-Seltzer XS and Beechams Powders.\n*   Aspirin as a mouth gel has the brand name Bonjela. Like other aspirin products, it's only for people aged 16 and over. Bonjela Teething Gel and Bonjela Junior Gel do not contain aspirin, so you can give them to children under 16.\n\n【10】More in Aspirin for pain relief\n-------------------------------\n\n【11】*   About aspirin for pain\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking aspirin with other medicines\n*   Common questions\n\n【12】Page last reviewed: 10 December 2021  \nNext review due: 10 December 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "e2fb84e7-eae7-4183-afc4-a48f189d12d8", "title": "Antidepressants", "text": "【0】Overview - Antidepressants\n==========================\n\n【1】**Antidepressants are a type of medicine used to treat** **clinical depression****.**\n\n【2】They can also be used to treat a number of other conditions, including:\n\n【3】*   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\n*   generalised anxiety disorder\n*   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\n【4】Antidepressants are also sometimes used to treat people with long-term (chronic) pain.\n\n【5】Read more about when antidepressants are used.\n\n【6】How antidepressants work\n------------------------\n\n【7】It's not known exactly how antidepressants work.\n\n【8】It's thought they work by increasing levels of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and noradrenaline, are linked to mood and emotion.\n\n【9】Neurotransmitters may also affect pain signals sent by nerves, which may explain why some antidepressants can help relieve long-term pain.\n\n【10】While antidepressants can treat the symptoms of depression, they do not always address its causes. This is why they're usually used in combination with therapy to treat more severe depression or other mental health conditions.\n\n【11】How effective are antidepressants?\n----------------------------------\n\n【12】Research suggests that antidepressants can be helpful for people with moderate or severe depression.\n\n【13】They're not usually recommended for mild depression, unless other treatments like talking therapy have not helped.\n\n【14】Doses and duration of treatment\n-------------------------------\n\n【15】Antidepressants are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms.\n\n【16】Antidepressants usually need to be taken for 1 or 2 weeks (without missing a dose) before the benefit starts to be felt. It's important not to stop taking them if you get some mild side effects early on, as these effects usually wear off quickly.\n\n【17】If you take an antidepressant for 4 weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying a different medicine.\n\n【18】A course of treatment usually lasts for at least 6 months after you start to feel better. Some people with recurrent depression may be advised to take them indefinitely.\n\n【19】Read more about antidepressant dosages.\n\n【20】Side effects\n------------\n\n【21】Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Always check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see what the possible side effects are.\n\n【22】The most common side effects of antidepressants are usually mild. Side effects should improve within a few days or weeks of treatment, as the body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【23】Read more about:\n\n【24】*   possible side effects of antidepressants\n*   cautions and interactions of antidepressants\n\n【25】Coming off antidepressants\n--------------------------\n\n【26】Talk to your doctor before you stop taking antidepressants. It's important that you do not stop taking antidepressants suddenly.\n\n【27】Once you're ready to come off antidepressants, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks – or longer, if you have been taking them for a long time.\n\n【28】This is to help prevent any withdrawal symptoms you might get as a reaction to coming off the medicine.\n\n【29】Read more about stopping or coming off antidepressants.\n\n【30】Types of antidepressants\n------------------------\n\n【31】There are several different types of antidepressants.\n\n【32】### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n\n【33】SSRIs are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressants. They're usually preferred over other antidepressants, as they cause fewer side effects. An overdose is also less likely to be serious.\n\n【34】Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral).\n\n【35】### Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n【36】SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs.\n\n【37】Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and venlafaxine (Efexor).\n\n【38】### Noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs)\n\n【39】NASSAs may be effective for some people who are unable to take SSRIs. The side effects of NASSAs are similar to those of SSRIs, but they're thought to cause fewer sexual problems. However, they may also cause more drowsiness at first.\n\n【40】The main NASSA prescribed in the UK is mirtazapine (Zispin).\n\n【41】### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n\n【42】TCAs are an older type of antidepressant. They're no longer usually recommended as the first treatment for depression because they can be more dangerous if an overdose is taken. They also cause more unpleasant side effects than SSRIs and SNRIs.\n\n【43】Exceptions are sometimes made for people with severe depression that fail to respond to other treatments. TCAs may also be recommended for other mental health conditions, such as OCD and bipolar disorder.\n\n【44】Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin, imipramine, lofepramine and nortriptyline.\n\n【45】Some types of TCAs, such as amitriptyline, can also be used to treat chronic nerve pain.\n\n【46】### Serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs)\n\n【47】SARIs are not usually the first choice of antidepressant, but they may be prescribed if other antidepressants have not worked or have caused side effects.\n\n【48】The main SARI prescribed in the UK is trazodone (Molipaxin).\n\n【49】### Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)\n\n【50】MAOIs are an older type of antidepressant that are rarely used nowadays.\n\n【51】They can cause potentially serious side effects so should only be prescribed by a specialist doctor.\n\n【52】Examples of MAOIs include tranylcypromine, phenelzine and isocarboxazid.\n\n【53】Other treatments for depression\n-------------------------------\n\n【54】Other treatments for depression include talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\n\n【55】People with moderate to severe depression are usually treated using a combination of antidepressants and CBT. Antidepressants work quickly in reducing symptoms, whereas CBT takes time to deal with causes of depression and ways of overcoming it.\n\n【56】Regular exercise has also been shown to be useful for those with mild depression.\n\n【57】Read more about alternatives to antidepressants.\n\n【58】Yellow Card Scheme\n------------------\n\n【59】The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\n【60】See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.\n\n【61】<a>Community content from HealthUnlocked</a>\n\n【62】More in Antidepressants\n-----------------------\n\n【63】*   Overview - Antidepressants\n*   Uses - Antidepressants\n*   Cautions - Antidepressants\n*   Dosage - Antidepressants\n*   Side effects - Antidepressants\n*   Alternatives - Antidepressants\n\n【64】Page last reviewed: 4 November 2021  \nNext review due: 4 November 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

About flucloxacillin\n------------------------\n\n【4】Flucloxacillin is an antibiotic.\n\n【5】It's used to treat:\n\n【6】*   skin and wound infections\n*   bone infections (osteomyelitis)\n*   ear infections in children\n\n【7】Flucloxacillin is only available on prescription.\n\n【8】It comes as capsules or as a liquid that you swallow. It can also be given by injection, but this is usually done in hospital.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Take flucloxacillin on an empty stomach. This means at least 30 to 60 minutes before a meal or snack, and at least 2 hours after.\n*   For most infections, you should start to feel better within a few days.\n*   The most common side effects are feeling sick (nausea) and diarrhoea.\n*   You can drink alcohol while taking flucloxacillin.\n*   You can take flucloxacillin during pregnancy or while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take flucloxacillin\n------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Flucloxacillin can be taken by adults, including throughout pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Flucloxacillin can also be taken by children.\n\n【13】To make sure flucloxacillin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【14】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to penicillin, flucloxacillin or any other medicine\n*   have liver or kidney problems\n*   have recently had, or are due to have, any vaccinations\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take flucloxacillin\n---------------------------------------\n\n【16】### Dosage\n\n【17】The usual dose of flucloxacillin is 250mg to 500mg, taken 4 times a day. For children, the dose may be lower.\n\n【18】Try to space your doses evenly throughout the day. For example, first thing in the morning (before breakfast), at around midday (before lunch), late in the afternoon (before tea) and at bedtime.\n\n【19】### Important\n\n【20】Carry on taking this medicine until you've finished all your tablets, capsules or liquid, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, your symptoms could come back.\n\n【21】### How to take it\n\n【22】Swallow flucloxacillin capsules whole with a drink of water. Do not chew or break them.\n\n【23】It's best to take flucloxacillin on an empty stomach. That means taking it at least 30 to 60 minutes before a meal or snack, and at least 2 hours after.\n\n【24】Liquid flucloxacillin is available for children, and people who find it difficult to swallow capsules.\n\n【25】If you or your child are taking liquid flucloxacillin, it will usually be made up for you by your pharmacist. The medicine will come with a syringe or spoon to help you take the right amount. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon because it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【26】### If you forget to take it\n\n【27】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. If this happens, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【28】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【29】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【30】### If you take too much\n\n【31】Try to take the right number of doses each day, leaving at least 3 hours between doses.\n\n【32】Taking an extra dose of flucloxacillin is unlikely to harm you or your child.\n\n【33】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried or if you take more than 1 extra dose.\n\n【34】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【35】Like all medicines, flucloxacillin can cause side effects in some people, although not everyone will get them.\n\n【36】### Common side effects\n\n【37】Common side effects of flucloxacillin happen in more than 1 in 100 people. Keep taking the medicine, but tell your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【38】*   feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)\n*   diarrhoea\n*   bloating and indigestion\n\n【39】### Serious side effects\n\n【40】Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 1,000 people.\n\n【41】Call a doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【42】*   you get diarrhoea (possibly with muscle cramps) that contains blood or mucus, or severe diarrhoea that lasts more than 4 days\n*   you have pale poo with dark pee, and the whites of your eyes or skin turn yellow (this may be less obvious on black or brown skin) – this can be a sign of liver problems\n*   you get bruising or discoloured skin\n*   you have joint or muscle pain that starts happening after 2 days of taking the medicine\n\n【43】Some of these serious side effects may not happen for up to 2 months after finishing the course of flucloxacillin.\n\n【44】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【45】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to flucloxacillin.\n\n【46】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【47】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【48】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【49】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【50】These are not all the side effects of flucloxacillin. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n\n【51】Information:\n\n【52】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【53】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【54】6\\. How to cope with side effects of flucloxacillin\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】**What to do about:**\n\n【56】*   **feeling sick or being sick** – stick to simple meals and try not to eat rich or spicy food. If you are being sick, take small, frequent sips of fluids such as water or squash to stop getting dehydrated. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink lots of fluids such as water or squash to stop getting dehydrated. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor. If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n*   **bloating and indigestion** – try not to eat foods that cause farting (flatulence), like lentils, peas, beans and onions. You could also try eating smaller meals, eating and drinking more slowly, and exercising regularly.\n\n【57】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【58】### Flucloxacillin and pregnancy\n\n【59】It's safe to take flucloxacillin during pregnancy.\n\n【60】### Flucloxacillin and breastfeeding\n\n【61】It is OK to take flucloxacillin while breastfeeding.\n\n【62】Information shows that only tiny amounts of flucloxacillin get into breast milk, which would not be expected to cause any side effects in your baby.\n\n【63】Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife if:\n\n【64】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   they have sickness or diarrhoea\n*   your baby has oral thrush or a skin rash\n*   you have any other concerns about your baby\n\n【65】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【66】Some medicines can affect the way that flucloxacillin works and increase the chance of you having side effects.\n\n【67】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines before you start flucloxacillin:\n\n【68】*   methotrexate, an anti-inflammatory medicine for arthritis and similar conditions\n*   warfarin, a medicine to prevent blood clots\n*   other antibiotics\n\n【69】Tell your doctor if you've recently had, or are due to have, an oral typhoid vaccination. Flucloxacillin can make it less effective.\n\n【70】### Mixing flucloxacillin with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【71】There is little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with flucloxacillin.\n\n【72】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【73】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【74】9\\. Common questions about flucloxacillin\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【75】How does flucloxacillin work?\n\n【76】Flucloxacillin is one of a group of antibiotics called penicillins. It works by killing harmful bacteria.\n\n【77】When will I feel better?\n\n【78】For most infections, you should feel better within a few days. But even if you feel better, it's very important to carry on taking flucloxacillin until you've finished the course. This helps to stop the infection coming back.\n\n【79】What if I do not get better?\n\n【80】Tell your doctor if you do not start feeling better after taking flucloxacillin for 3 days. Also tell them if, at any time, you start to feel worse.\n\n【81】Will it give me thrush?\n\n【82】Some people get a fungal infection called thrush after taking a course of antibiotics like flucloxacillin. If you think you have thrush, speak to your pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\n【83】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【84】Flucloxacillin does not stop any type of contraception working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【85】However, if flucloxacillin makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【86】Find out about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.\n\n【87】Will it reduce my fertility?\n\n【88】There's no clear evidence to suggest that taking flucloxacillin will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【89】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【90】Yes. Flucloxacillin should not affect being able to drive or cycle.\n\n【91】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【92】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking flucloxacillin.\n\n【93】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【94】You do not need to avoid any foods or drinks while taking flucloxacillin. However, make sure to take it on an empty stomach.\n\n【95】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【96】*   Chest infection\n*   Ear infections\n*   Osteomyelitis\n*   Pneumonia\n\n【97】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【98】*   HealthUnlocked: flucloxacillin forum\n*   British Lung Foundation: charity\n*   British Skin Foundation: charity\n*   RNID: charity – ear health\n\n【99】Page last reviewed: 12 November 2021  \nNext review due: 12 November 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's widely used to treat heartburn, acid reflux and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD is when you keep getting acid reflux.\n\n【2】Rabeprazole is also taken to prevent and treat stomach ulcers.\n\n【3】Sometimes, it is also prescribed for a rare condition caused by a tumour in the pancreas or gut, called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n\n【4】Rabeprazole is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets.\n\n【5】Key facts\n---------\n\n【6】*   You’ll usually take rabeprazole once a day in the morning.\n*   If you are prescribed a higher dose, you can take it twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. It starts to work within 2 to 3 days, but it may take up to 4 weeks for rabeprazole to work fully.\n*   Common side effects include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling or being sick, constipation, stomach pain. These tend to be mild and go away when you stop taking the medicine.\n*   Rabeprazole is not usually recommended during pregnancy but you may be able to take while breastfeeding if your doctor says it’s OK.

Most experts recommend that people with moderate to severe depression are treated with a combination of CBT and antidepressants.\n\n【5】However, if you're unable or unwilling to take antidepressants, you have the option of receiving CBT on its own.\n\n【6】CBT helps you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. It helps you recognise that events in your past may have affected you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It also teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts.\n\n【7】CBT is usually available on the NHS, although the waiting lists are usually long. You normally have a short course of sessions, usually 6 to 8 sessions, over 10 to 12 weeks, on a 1-to-1 basis with a therapist trained in CBT. In some cases, you may be offered group CBT.\n\n【8】### Online CBT\n\n【9】Computerised or online CBT is a form of CBT that works through a computer screen, rather than face-to-face with a therapist.\n\n【10】These therapies can be prescribed by your GP or a mental health specialist and are carried out with their advice and support.\n\n【11】Ask your GP for more information or read more about self-help therapies.\n\n【12】### Interpersonal therapy (IPT)\n\n【13】Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with other people and on problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.\n\n【14】A course of IPT is usually structured in the same way as a course of CBT.\n\n【15】There's some evidence that IPT can be as effective as antidepressants or CBT, but more research is needed.\n\n【16】### Counselling\n\n【17】Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life to find new ways of dealing with them. Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems but do not tell you what to do.\n\n【18】Counselling on the NHS usually consists of 6 to 12 sessions lasting an hour each. You talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice.\n\n【19】Counselling is ideal for people who are generally healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger, relationship issues, bereavement, redundancy, infertility or the onset of a serious illness.\n\n【20】### Talking therapies on the NHS\n\n【21】You can get talking therapies like counselling for depression and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS.\n\n【22】You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.\n\n【23】Read more about NHS talking therapies\n\n【24】Exercise\n--------\n\n【25】Research suggests that regular exercise may be a more effective treatment for mild depression than antidepressants.\n\n【26】Exercise helps boost levels of chemicals called serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which can lift your mood.\n\n【27】Exercising on a regular basis can boost self-esteem and confidence, which can help to relieve symptoms of depression.\n\n【28】Read about starting exercise and exercise for depression.\n\n【29】Self-help groups\n----------------\n\n【30】Talking through your feelings can be helpful. You can either talk to a friend or relative, or you can ask your GP to suggest a local self-help group. There are also chat rooms on the internet that offer support.\n\n【31】Read more about depression support groups.\n\n【32】Lithium\n-------\n\n【33】If you've tried several different antidepressants and seen no improvement, your doctor may offer you a medicine called lithium, in addition to your current treatment.\n\n【34】If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. So, you'll need blood tests every few months to check your lithium levels while you're taking it.\n\n【35】You'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet.\n\n【36】Side effects of lithium include:\n\n【37】*   dry mouth\n*   a metallic taste in your mouth\n*   some mild shaking of your hands\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【38】These side effects usually pass with time once your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【39】Electric shock treatment\n------------------------\n\n【40】Sometimes a treatment called electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended if you have severe depression and other treatments have not worked, as it can be highly effective.\n\n【41】During ECT, you'll first be given an anaesthetic and medicine to relax your muscles. Then you'll receive an electric current to your brain through electrodes placed on your head.\n\n【42】You may be given a series of ECT sessions. It's usually given twice a week for 3 to 6 weeks.\n\n【43】It's not exactly clear how ECT works, but recent studies suggest it may help reduce connections in an area of the brain linked to depression.\n\n【44】For most people, ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effect tends to wear off after several months.\n\n【45】Some people get unpleasant side effects, including short-term headaches, memory problems, nausea and muscle aches.\n\n【46】But these risks need to be balanced against the risks of other treatments and the effects of not treating depression.\n\n【47】More in Antidepressants\n-----------------------\n\n【48】*   Overview - Antidepressants\n*   Uses - Antidepressants\n*   Cautions - Antidepressants\n*   Dosage - Antidepressants\n*   Side effects - Antidepressants\n*   Alternatives - Antidepressants\n\n【49】Page last reviewed: 4 November 2021  \nNext review due: 4 November 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Recovery\n\n【3】**Benign (non-cancerous) brain tumours can usually be successfully removed with surgery and do not usually grow back.**\n\n【4】It often depends on whether the surgeon is able to safely remove all of the tumour.\n\n【5】If there's some left, it can either be monitored with scans or treated with radiotherapy.\n\n【6】Rarely, some slow-growing non-cancerous tumours grow back after treatment and can change into malignant brain tumour (brain cancer), which are fast growing and likely to spread.\n\n【7】You'll usually have follow-up appointments after finishing your treatment to monitor your condition and look for signs of the tumour returning.\n\n【8】Your treatment plan\n-------------------\n\n【9】There are a number of different treatments for non-cancerous brain tumours.\n\n【10】Some people only need repeated scans to monitor the tumour and assess any growth. This is usually the case when a tumour is found by chance.\n\n【11】Some people will need surgery, particularly if they have severe or progressive symptoms, but sometimes non-surgical treatments are an option.\n\n【12】A group of different specialists will be involved in your care. They will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours.\n\n【13】Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you'd like to ask. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\n\n【14】Surgery\n-------\n\n【15】Surgery is the main treatment for non-cancerous brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much of the tumour as safely as possible without damaging the surrounding brain tissue.\n\n【16】In most cases, a procedure called a craniotomy will be performed. Most operations are carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the procedure.\n\n【17】But in some cases you may need to be awake and responsive, in which case a local anaesthetic will be used.\n\n【18】An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of skull cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.\n\n【19】The surgeon will remove the tumour and fix the bone flap back into place with metal screws. The skin is closed with either sutures or staples.\n\n【20】If it is not possible to remove the entire tumour, you may need further treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\n【21】The Cancer Research UK website has more information about brain tumour surgery.\n\n【22】Radiosurgery\n------------\n\n【23】Some tumours are located deep inside the brain and are difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. In these cases, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiosurgery may be used.\n\n【24】During radiosurgery, tiny beams of high-energy radiation are focused on the tumour to kill the abnormal cells.\n\n【25】Treatment consists of one session, recovery is quick, and you can usually go home on the same day.\n\n【26】Radiosurgery is only available in a few specialised centres in the UK. It's only suitable for some people, based on the characteristics, locations and size of their tumour.\n\n【27】Chemotherapy and radiotherapy\n-----------------------------\n\n【28】Conventional chemotherapy is occasionally used to shrink non-cancerous brain tumours or kill any cells left behind after surgery. \n\n【29】Radiotherapy involves using controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually X-rays, to kill the tumour cells.\n\n【30】Chemotherapy is less frequently used to treat non-cancerous brain tumours. It's a powerful medicine that kills tumour cells, and can be given as a tablet, injection or drip.\n\n【31】Side effects of these treatments can include tiredness, hair loss, nausea, and reddening of your skin.\n\n【32】Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy and the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n【33】Medicine to treat symptoms\n--------------------------\n\n【34】You may also be given medicine to help treat some of your symptoms before or after surgery, including:\n\n【35】*   anticonvulsants to prevent epileptic fits (seizures)\n*   steroids to reduce swelling around the tumour, which can relieve some of your symptoms and make surgery easier\n*   painkillers to treat headaches\n*   anti-emetics to prevent vomiting\n\n【36】Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  \nNext review due: 21 April 2023\n\n【37】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Recovery", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment\n\n【3】**Glaucoma is usually picked up during a routine eye test, often before it causes any noticeable symptoms. Other tests are usually needed afterwards to diagnose and monitor the condition.**\n\n【4】It's important to have regular eye tests so problems such as glaucoma can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Early treatment can help stop your vision becoming severely affected.\n\n【5】You should have an eye test at least every 2 years. If you're at a higher risk of glaucoma – for example, if you have a close relative with it – you may be advised to have more frequent tests.\n\n【6】You can get an eye test at a local opticians, and the tests are carried out by an optometrist. Find an optician near you.\n\n【7】Some people can receive free eye tests on the NHS. Find out if you're entitled to free NHS eye tests.\n\n【8】Tests to diagnose and monitor glaucoma\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】There are different tests that can be carried out by an optometrist if they suspect you have glaucoma after a routine eye test.\n\n【10】### Eye pressure test\n\n【11】An eye pressure test (tonometry) uses an instrument called a tonometer to measure the pressure inside your eye.\n\n【12】The optometrist will put a small amount of painkilling medicine (anaesthetic) and dye into the front of your eye. They will then shine a light into your eye and gently touch the surface of it with the tonometer.\n\n【13】Some optometrists use a different instrument, which uses a puff of air and doesn't touch the eye, to check pressure.\n\n【14】### Gonioscopy\n\n【15】Gonioscopy is an examination to look at the front part your eye – the fluid-filled space between the coloured part (iris) and the clear window of the front of the eye (cornea). This is where the fluid should drain out of your eye.\n\n【16】A gonioscopy can help to determine whether this area (the \"angle\") is open or closed (blocked), which can affect how fluid drains out of your eye. It will tell your optometrist what type of glaucoma you have.\n\n【17】### Visual field test\n\n【18】A visual field test (sometimes called perimetry) checks for missing areas of vision.\n\n【19】You may be shown a sequence of light spots and asked to press a button to indicate which ones you can see. Some dots will appear at the edges of your vision (your peripheral vision), which is often the first area to be affected by glaucoma.\n\n【20】If you can't see the spots in the periphery, it may mean glaucoma has damaged your vision.\n\n【21】### Optic nerve assessment\n\n【22】The optic nerve, which connects your eye to your brain, can become damaged in glaucoma, so an assessment may be carried out to see if it's healthy.\n\n【23】For the test, eyedrops will be used to enlarge your pupils. Your eyes are then examined using either:\n\n【24】*   a slit lamp (a microscope with a bright light)\n*   optical coherence tomography – a type of scan where special rays of light are used to scan the back of your eye and produce an image of it\n\n【25】The eyedrops used to widen your pupils could temporarily affect your ability to drive, so you'll need to make arrangements for getting home after your appointment.\n\n【26】Referral to a specialist\n------------------------\n\n【27】If glaucoma is picked up during an eye test, you should be referred to a specialist eye doctor (ophthalmologist) for further tests. They will confirm your diagnosis and find out:\n\n【28】*   how far the condition has developed\n*   how much damage the glaucoma has done to your eyes\n*   what may have caused the glaucoma\n\n【29】They will then be able to advise on treatment. See treating glaucoma for more information.\n\n【30】In some cases, your ophthalmologist will continue to treat you. But for less serious types of glaucoma, you may be referred back to the opticians.\n\n【31】Page last reviewed: 26 February 2021  \nNext review due: 26 February 2024\n\n【32】*   Previous : Glaucoma\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

However, these tests vary in accuracy, so it's recommended that you go to your local sexual health service.\n\n【15】All tests are free through the NHS, but you'll have to pay if you go to a private clinic.\n\n【16】If you go to your GP practice, you may have to pay a prescription charge for any treatment.\n\n【17】Testing for gonorrhoea\n----------------------\n\n【18】There are a number of different ways to test for gonorrhoea. In many cases, a swab will be used to remove a sample for testing, although men may only be asked to provide a urine sample.\n\n【19】A swab looks a bit like a cotton bud, but it's smaller and rounded. It's wiped over parts of the body that may be infected to pick up samples of discharge. This only takes a few seconds and is not painful, although it may be a little uncomfortable.\n\n【20】### Testing women\n\n【21】For women, a doctor or nurse will usually take a swab to collect a sample from the vagina or cervix (entrance to the womb) during an internal examination. In some cases, a sample may also be taken from the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).\n\n【22】Sometimes, you may be asked to use a swab or tampon to collect a sample from inside your vagina yourself.\n\n【23】Women are not usually asked to provide a urine sample to check for gonorrhoea because this is a less-accurate test for women.\n\n【24】### Testing men\n\n【25】Men will normally be asked to provide a urine sample or a swab may be used to pick up a sample of discharge from the end of the penis.\n\n【26】If you're asked to provide a urine sample, it's important not to urinate for about 2 hours beforehand because this can wash the bacteria away and affect the results of the test.\n\n【27】### Infections of the rectum, throat and eyes\n\n【28】If there's a possibility that your rectum or throat is infected, the doctor or nurse may need to use a swab to collect a sample from these areas.\n\n【29】If you have symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as red, inflamed eyes with discharge, a sample of the discharge may be collected from your eye.\n\n【30】Getting the results\n-------------------\n\n【31】Some clinics may be able to carry out rapid tests, when the doctor can view the sample through a microscope and give you your test results straight away.\n\n【32】Otherwise, you'll have to wait up to 2 weeks to get the results.\n\n【33】Young people and sexual health clinics\n--------------------------------------\n\n【34】You can attend a sexual health clinic at any age and all results will be treated confidentially.\n\n【35】If you're 13 to 16 years old, nobody in your household will be contacted without your permission. However, you may be encouraged to talk to your parents, guardian or another trusted adult.\n\n【36】The situation is different for people under 13, because the law says that people of this age cannot consent (say yes) to sexual activity.\n\n【37】If I use a sexual health service, will they tell my parents?\n\n【38】Page last reviewed: 15 September 2021  \nNext review due: 15 September 2024\n\n【39】*   Previous : Symptoms\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  How it's performed\n3.  Recovery\n4.  Risks\n5.  Alternatives\n\n【3】**Following a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), you may need to recover in hospital for1 to 3 days before you can go home.**\n\n【4】While in hospital, you may be given fluids directly into a vein (intravenously) until you've recovered from the anaesthetic and are able to eat and drink.\n\n【5】You shouldn't experience any severe pain, but there may be some discomfort and bladder spasms (contractions) from the catheter, which is left in place because your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) will be swollen and sore.\n\n【6】Before you're discharged, you'll be given advice about your recovery. A follow-up appointment to check your progress should be made for a few weeks later.\n\n【7】Peeing after TURP\n-----------------\n\n【8】You won't be able to pee normally at first because your urethra will be swollen.\n\n【9】The catheter used to flush out your bladder during the operation will be left in place for a while to allow you to pee until the swelling goes down.\n\n【10】During the day after the operation, water may be pumped through the catheter to clean your bladder and get rid of any blood clots and other debris.\n\n【11】This usually is not painful, but may make your bladder feel uncomfortably full.\n\n【12】The catheter may be removed to check if you can pee before going home.\n\n【13】It's normal to find peeing uncomfortable and difficult to control for at least a few days after the catheter is removed.\n\n【14】If you still cannot pee, a catheter may need to be put back in.\n\n【15】You'll be able to go home with the catheter still in place, and an appointment will be made to remove it a few days or weeks later. \n\n【16】See living with a urinary catheter for information about looking after your catheter.\n\n【17】Recovering at home\n------------------\n\n【18】It's common to feel tired and under the weather for a week or two after having a TURP. Most men are up and about after 3 to 4 weeks recovery.\n\n【19】For the first 3 to 4 weeks, you shouldn't lift or move any heavy objects (including shopping) or do any strenuous exercise. If possible, ask friends or family members if they can help around the house.\n\n【20】Once you feel able, gentle exercise such as walking will help keep your blood circulating and lower your risk of getting a blood clot in your legs.\n\n【21】Drinking plenty of water while you're recovering may help reduce the risk of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) and can help clear any blood from your pee.\n\n【22】You may also be advised to do some pelvic floor exercises to help improve your bladder control.\n\n【23】Any pain can usually be treated by taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【24】Returning to your normal activities\n-----------------------------------\n\n【25】It usually takes between 3 and 4 weeks to fully recover from a TURP. Your surgeon or GP will advise you about when it's safe to return to your normal activities.\n\n【26】### Work\n\n【27】When you can return to work will largely depend on your job. For example, someone who works in an office may be able to return to work sooner than someone who does heavy manual work.\n\n【28】In most cases, you'll be advised to take around 3 or 4 weeks off work.\n\n【29】### Driving\n\n【30】Ask your surgeon or GP for advice on when it's safe for you to drive again.\n\n【31】You should also speak to your insurer before driving again after having surgery.\n\n【32】### Having sex\n\n【33】It will probably be around 3 or 4 weeks after your operation before you feel comfortable enough to have sex.\n\n【34】Blood in your pee\n-----------------\n\n【35】After having a TURP, it's normal to occasionally notice some blood in your urine. Around a week or two after the operation, the amount of blood may increase as the scab on your prostate falls off.\n\n【36】Drinking plenty of fluids will help flush any blood or small blood clots out of your bladder.\n\n【37】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【38】While you're recovering, you should contact a GP immediately or call 111 if:\n\n【39】*   you have a high temperature\n*   you have severe pain when peeing\n*   you cannot pee\n*   there's a lot of blood in your pee or this gets worse\n*   there are blood clots in your pee\n\n【40】These symptoms can be a sign of a problem, such as internal bleeding or a urinary infection, that needs to be treated.\n\n【41】Page last reviewed: 14 September 2021  \nNext review due: 14 September 2024\n\n【42】*   Previous : How it's performed\n*   Next : Risks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "bc38e64f-e5af-4bb1-b8d1-c9b51f2ea8ad", "title": "Apixaban", "text": "【0】How and when to take apixaban\n=============================\n\n【1】It's important to take apixaban as your doctor has told you.\n\n【2】Dosage and strength\n-------------------\n\n【3】Apixaban comes as 2.5mg and 5mg tablets.\n\n【4】Your dose of apixaban depends on why you're taking it. If you're unsure what dose you need to take, check with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【5】The usual dose in adults if you:\n\n【6】*   have a heart condition called atrial fibrillation is one 5mg tablet, taken twice a day. Your doctor may prescribe a lower dose of one 2.5mg tablet twice a day if you're over 80 years old, weigh less than 60kg (9st 6lb), or have kidney disease and are at higher risk of bleeding\n*   have recently had a blood clot (within the last 6 months) is two 5mg tablets taken twice a day, for the first 7 days. After that, you'll take one 5mg tablet twice a day\n*   need to reduce the risk of a future blood clot is one 2.5mg tablet taken twice a day\n*   have had a hip or knee replacement is one 2.5mg tablet, taken twice a day. You'll usually take your first dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery\n\n【7】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【8】You'll usually take apixaban tablets twice a day. Try to take it at the same time every day.\n\n【9】Swallow the tablet with a drink of water. Apixaban can be taken with or without food.\n\n【10】You can crush apixaban tablets and mix them with water, apple juice or apple purée. Swallow this mixture straight away.\n\n【11】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【12】How long you need to take apixaban will depend on why you're taking it. If you have had:\n\n【13】*   knee replacement surgery, you'll usually take it for 10 to 14 days\n*   a hip replacement, you'll usually take it for 32 to 38 days\n*   a blood clot (DVT or pulmonary embolism), you'll usually take it for at least 3 months\n\n【14】Depending on what caused the blood clot, you might need to take it for longer.\n\n【15】If you have a heart problem like atrial fibrillation, you might need to take apixaban long term or even for the rest of your life.\n\n【16】Do not stop taking apixaban without talking to your doctor.\n\n【17】If you stop taking apixaban, your risk of blood clots will return to what it was before. This can start happening again within a day or two of stopping. This means that you may be at increased risk of serious problems like stroke, heart attack, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.\n\n【18】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【19】Take your medicine as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【20】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a missed one.\n\n【21】It's very important that you remember to take apixaban every day. If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【22】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【23】Taking too much apixaban puts you at risk of bleeding.\n\n【24】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【25】*   you take more than your prescribed dose of apixaban\n\n【26】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【27】If you go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【28】Take the apixaban packet, or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【29】Anticoagulant alert card\n------------------------\n\n【30】Your doctor or pharmacist will give you an anticoagulant alert card.\n\n【31】Carry this with you all the time. It tells healthcare professionals that you're taking an anticoagulant. This can be useful for them to know in case of a medical emergency.\n\n【32】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your anticoagulant alert card to the nurse, doctor or dentist. This includes before you have vaccinations and routine sessions with the dental hygienist.\n\n【33】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking apixaban or reduce your dose for a short time.\n\n【34】Changes to your medicine\n------------------------\n\n【35】### Switching from apixaban to warfarin\n\n【36】If you need to switch from apixaban to warfarin, you may need to take both medicines together for a few days.\n\n【37】Your doctor, or anticoagulant clinic, will do a blood test called the international normalised ratio (INR) to check how quickly your blood's clotting.\n\n【38】This is to help decide exactly when you should stop taking apixaban.\n\n【39】### Switching from warfarin to apixaban\n\n【40】If you need to switch from warfarin to apixaban, your doctor will advise you when to stop taking warfarin. This will probably be a few days before you start apixaban.\n\n【41】Your doctor, or anticoagulant clinic, will do a blood test called the international normalised ratio (INR) to check how quickly your blood's clotting.\n\n【42】This is to help decide exactly when you should start taking apixaban.\n\n【43】More in Apixaban\n----------------\n\n【44】*   About apixaban\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking apixaban with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【45】Page last reviewed: 14 May 2022  \nNext review due: 14 May 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "7812217a-bda9-4898-8bd6-140af0b3b930", "title": "8 tips for healthy eating", "text": "【0】8 tips for healthy eating\n=========================\n\n【1】These 8 practical tips cover the basics of healthy eating and can help you make healthier choices.\n\n【2】The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.\n\n【3】If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.\n\n【4】You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.\n\n【5】It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).\n\n【6】Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories.\n\n【7】1\\. Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.\n\n【9】Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.\n\n【10】They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.\n\n【11】Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.\n\n【12】Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.\n\n【13】2\\. Eat lots of fruit and veg\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.\n\n【15】Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?\n\n【16】A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.\n\n【17】A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.\n\n【18】3\\. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.\n\n【20】Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.\n\n【21】Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. \n\n【22】Oily fish include:\n\n【23】*   salmon\n*   trout\n*   herring\n*   sardines\n*   pilchards\n*   mackerel\n\n【24】Non-oily fish include:\n\n【25】*   haddock\n*   plaice\n*   coley\n*   cod\n*   tuna\n*   skate\n*   hake\n\n【26】You can choose from fresh, frozen and canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in salt.\n\n【27】Most people should be eating more fish, but there are recommended limits for some types of fish.\n\n【28】Find out more about fish and shellfish\n\n【29】4\\. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】### Saturated fat\n\n【31】You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.\n\n【32】There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.\n\n【33】On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.\n\n【34】Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.\n\n【35】Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:\n\n【36】*   fatty cuts of meat\n*   sausages\n*   butter\n*   hard cheese\n*   cream\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   lard\n*   pies\n\n【37】Try to eat less saturated fat and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.\n\n【38】For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.\n\n【39】When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.\n\n【40】All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.\n\n【41】### Sugar\n\n【42】Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.\n\n【43】Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.\n\n【44】Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies.\n\n【45】This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.\n\n【46】Many packaged foods and drinks contain surprisingly high amounts of free sugars.\n\n【47】Free sugars are found in many foods, such as:\n\n【48】*   sugary fizzy drinks\n*   sugary breakfast cereals\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   pastries and puddings\n*   sweets and chocolate\n*   alcoholic drinks\n\n【49】Food labels can help. Use them to check how much sugar foods contain.\n\n【50】More than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g means the food is high in sugar, while 5g of total sugars or less per 100g means the food is low in sugar.\n\n【51】Find out how to cut down on sugar in your diet\n\n【52】5\\. Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adults\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.\n\n【54】Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much.\n\n【55】About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.\n\n【56】Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of salt per 100g means the food is high in salt.\n\n【57】Adults and children aged 11 and over should eat no more than 6g of salt (about a teaspoonful) a day. Younger children should have even less.\n\n【58】Get tips for a lower salt diet\n\n【59】6\\. Get active and be a healthy weight\n--------------------------------------\n\n【60】As well as eating healthily, regular exercise may help reduce your risk of getting serious health conditions. It's also important for your overall health and wellbeing.\n\n【61】Read more about the benefits of exercise and physical activity guidelines for adults.\n\n【62】Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease and stroke. Being underweight could also affect your health.\n\n【63】Most adults need to lose weight by eating fewer calories.\n\n【64】If you're trying to lose weight, aim to eat less and be more active. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help you maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【65】Check whether you're a healthy weight by using the BMI healthy weight calculator.\n\n【66】Lose weight with the NHS weight loss plan, a 12-week weight loss guide that combines advice on healthier eating and physical activity.\n\n【67】If you're underweight, see underweight adults. If you're worried about your weight, ask your GP or a dietitian for advice.\n\n【68】7\\. Do not get thirsty\n----------------------\n\n【69】You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. \n\n【70】All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices. \n\n【71】Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. \n\n【72】Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar.\n\n【73】Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.\n\n【74】Remember to drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising.\n\n【75】8\\.

Treatment\n\n【3】**Frostbite is damage to skin and tissue caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically any temperature below -0.55C (31F).**\n\n【4】Frostbite can affect any part of your body, but the extremities, such as the hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected.\n\n【5】The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful.\n\n【6】If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles before the area becomes numb as the tissues freeze.\n\n【7】When to get medical attention\n-----------------------------\n\n【8】If you think you or someone else may have frostbite, call your GP or NHS 111 for advice.\n\n【9】If the symptoms are more severe or there are signs of hypothermia, such as constant shivering or fast breathing (hyperventilation), go immediately to your nearest A&E.\n\n【10】A doctor will examine the affected area, check your vital signs, and ask how you got frostbite.\n\n【11】You may need a follow-up appointment or referral to a specialist, as the full extent of a frostbite injury often isn't apparent until a few days later.\n\n【12】Treating frostbite\n------------------\n\n【13】A person with frostbite should be taken to a warm environment as soon as possible. This is to limit the effects of the injury and because it's also likely they'll have hypothermia. Don't put pressure on the affected area.\n\n【14】The frostbitten area should be warmed up by a healthcare professional. This is usually done by immersing the affected area in warm – but not hot – water. \n\n【15】A bath of water at 37C to 39C (98.6F to 102.2F) is recommended for rewarming. The rewarming process is often painful, and regular strong painkillers may be needed.\n\n【16】It's important not to rewarm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, as this can lead to further tissue damage.\n\n【17】If frostbite is severe, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. Amputation may be needed if frostbite is severe.\n\n【18】Read more about treating frostbite.\n\n【19】What causes frostbite?\n----------------------\n\n【20】The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down so flow to the vital organs can be increased.\n\n【21】As the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.\n\n【22】The ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.\n\n【23】### At-risk groups\n\n【24】Certain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite.\n\n【25】They include:\n\n【26】*   people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers\n*   anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions\n*   anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers\n*   homeless people\n*   the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature\n*   people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such as diabetes and Raynaud's phenomenon\n*   anyone taking medicine that constricts the blood vessels, including beta blockers – smoking can also constrict the blood vessels\n\n【27】People who've taken drugs or drunk alcohol are also vulnerable to frostbite. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather.\n\n【28】As you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30 to 60 cases every winter.\n\n【29】Preventing frostbite\n--------------------\n\n【30】Most of the time frostbite can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather.\n\n【31】Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible. \n\n【32】It's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip.\n\n【33】Wear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as:\n\n【34】*   well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks\n*   mittens – they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves\n*   a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears – it's important to protect your head from the cold\n*   multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing – these act as insulation\n\n【35】You should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can. \n\n【36】If you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car in case you break down. \n\n【37】If you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall.\n\n【38】Be careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold, a common cause of frostbite. Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.\n\n【39】Smoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels.\n\n【40】Complications of frostbite\n--------------------------\n\n【41】If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply. This can make the affected body part very vulnerable to infection because your body relies on white blood cells to ward off infections.\n\n【42】People with frostbite are at risk of bacterial wound infections, such as tetanus. More seriously, this infection can spread into the blood (sepsis), which requires treatment with antibiotics. Both conditions require hospital admission. \n\n【43】Read more about treating tetanus and treating sepsis.\n\n【44】### Hypothermia\n\n【45】Severe frostbite is often associated with hypothermia, which is a dangerous drop in body temperature below 35C (95F).\n\n【46】Initial symptoms can include:\n\n【47】*   constant shivering\n*   tiredness\n*   low energy\n*   cold or pale skin\n*   fast breathing (hyperventilation)\n\n【48】Someone with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and have shallow breathing and a weak pulse. \n\n【49】Read more about how hypothermia is treated.\n\n【50】Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【51】Can you answer some questions about your visit today?\n\n【52】Take our survey\n\n【53】Page last reviewed: 24 August 2021  \nNext review due: 24 August 2024\n\n【54】*   Next : Symptoms", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "584ce4a5-83b8-4118-94dc-71bfedbe55ef", "title": "Mirtazapine", "text": "【0】Common questions about mirtazapine\n==================================\n\n【1】How does mirtazapine work?\n\n【2】Mirtazapine is a type of antidepressant medicine.\n\n【3】It works by increasing the activity of mood-enhancing chemicals called noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】You may see an improvement in your symptoms after a week although it usually takes between 4 and 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits. That's because it takes around a week for mirtazapine levels to build up in your body, and then a few weeks longer for your body to adapt and get used to it.\n\n【6】Do not stop taking mirtazapine just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.\n\n【7】How will it make me feel?\n\n【8】Antidepressants like mirtazapine help to gradually lift your mood so you feel better.\n\n【9】You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. You'll hopefully be more relaxed about things that used to worry you.\n\n【10】Mirtazapine will not change your personality, it will simply help you feel like yourself again.\n\n【11】Do not expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.\n\n【12】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【13】Mirtazapine is generally safe to take for a long time. There do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months or years.\n\n【14】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【15】If you've been feeling better for 6 months or more, your doctor may suggest coming off mirtazapine.\n\n【16】Your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks, or longer if you've been taking mirtazapine for a long time.\n\n【17】This is to help prevent you getting any withdrawal symptoms as you come off the medicine.\n\n【18】Side effects can include:\n\n【19】*   feeling anxious, dizzy or sick\n*   numbness or tingling in your hands or feet\n*   headaches\n*   shaking\n\n【20】### Important\n\n【21】Do not stop taking mirtazapine suddenly, or without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【22】How does mirtazapine compare with other antidepressants?\n\n【23】Mirtazapine is not any better or worse than other antidepressants. Sometimes people get on better with one antidepressant than another.\n\n【24】If you're not feeling any better after 6 weeks, talk to your doctor. They may suggest that you try a different medicine.\n\n【25】Are there other treatments for depression?\n\n【26】Taking antidepressants, including mirtazapine, is just one of many ways to treat depression.\n\n【27】Other treatments that may help include:\n\n【28】*   talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy\n*   exercise programmes\n*   help to get a good night's sleep\n\n【29】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【30】*   how long you've had depression\n*   your symptoms\n*   whether you've had depression before\n*   whether previous treatment has worked\n*   how likely you are to stick with your treatment\n*   the potential side effects\n*   your preferences and priorities\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Mirtazapine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】However, if mirtazapine makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【34】Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.\n\n【35】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【36】Some people cannot concentrate properly while they are taking mirtazapine. It can also make you feel sleepy.\n\n【37】When you first start taking mirtazapine, it's a good idea to stop driving and cycling for the first few days until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\n【38】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【39】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking mirtazapine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【40】Can I drink alcohol while taking mirtazapine?\n\n【41】You can drink alcohol while taking mirtazapine but it may make you feel sleepy and unsteady on your feet.\n\n【42】It might be best to stop drinking alcohol for the first few days of treatment until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【43】Drinking alcohol every day or in large amounts can make your symptoms worse. It also makes it harder for mirtazapine to work properly.\n\n【44】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【45】You can eat and drink normally while taking mirtazapine.\n\n【46】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【47】Mirtazapine can make you feel more hungry than usual, so you may put on weight.\n\n【48】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking mirtazapine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【49】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【50】Taking cannibis with mirtazapine can make you feel very sleepy, especially if you've just started taking mirtazapine.\n\n【51】It can be dangerous to take mirtazapine with:\n\n【52】*   methadone\n*   stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine\n*   hallucinogens like LSD\n*   novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone\n\n【53】Find out about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【54】### Important\n\n【55】Mirtazapine has not been properly tested with recreational drugs.

It takes a few days for it to start working and can take several weeks for it to reach its full effect.\n\n【8】If you bought the spray from a pharmacy or shop, check the leaflet that comes with it. This will tell you when to speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you feel no better after using the spray. This is usually after 7 to 14 days.\n\n【9】If you use the spray for hay fever, it's best to start using it at least a couple of weeks before the hay fever season starts. Many people notice they get symptoms around the same time each year.\n\n【10】If you use the spray for nasal polyps, it can take 1 to 2 months for your symptoms to improve.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Budesonide nasal spray is unlikely to have any lasting harmful effects if you follow the instructions that come with it, or use it as your doctor recommends.\n\n【13】However, children and teenagers need to have their height and weight monitored carefully if they're using budesonide nasal spray for a long time. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth.\n\n【14】The nasal spray delivers a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【15】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【16】You may need a steroid card if you're regularly using budesonide nasal spray with other steroids, such as a steroid inhaler. This can cause your adrenal glands to make less of the hormones your body needs, such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【17】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card).

MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/260961/view\n\n【17】Not everyone gets blisters. If you do, they may keep coming and going for months or years.\n\n【18】### Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n\n【19】*   you have an itchy rash that does not go away in a few weeks\n*   you have lots of blisters, or big, painful blisters\n*   you have blisters that keep coming back\n*   your skin is hot, swollen and red or a blister is filled with pus or blood\n\n【20】A GP can check what the cause might be.\n\n【21】If they think it could be bullous pemphigoid, they may refer you to a specialist for tests and treatment.\n\n【22】Treatment for bullous pemphigoid\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】Bullous pemphigoid eventually goes away on its own, but it can last a few years.\n\n【24】Treatment can help your skin heal, stop new patches or blisters appearing, and reduce the chance of your skin getting infected.\n\n【25】The main treatments are:\n\n【26】*   steroid creams\n*   steroid tablets\n*   antibiotics\n\n【27】Your skin should eventually heal without scarring, but it might be a bit darker than it was before.\n\n【28】### Important\n\n【29】Do not burst your blisters – your skin might get infected. If a blister is in an annoying place (like the bottom of your foot), your doctor can drain it with a needle.\n\n【30】#### Bullous pemphigoid can be serious\n\n【31】Even with treatment, bullous pemphigoid can sometimes cause serious problems. And it can sometimes be fatal in people with a weakened immune system or pre-existing condition.\n\n【32】The main risks are:\n\n【33】*   skin infections – these can be very serious if they get deeper into your body (sepsis)\n*   side effects of steroid treatment – including high blood pressure, weakened bones and a higher chance of getting infections\n\n【34】Steroids will be used as little as possible, and at the lowest possible dose, to help avoid side effects.\n\n【35】Make sure you attend any check-ups your doctor recommends so any problems can be found and treated early.\n\n【36】Causes of bullous pemphigoid\n----------------------------\n\n【37】Bullous pemphigoid is caused by a problem with the immune system (the body's defence against infection). Instead of attacking germs, it attacks and damages the skin.\n\n【38】It's not known why this happens. Sometimes it's been linked to skin damage (such as sunburn) or taking certain medicines.\n\n【39】Bullous pemphigoid is not:\n\n【40】*   contagious – it cannot be spread to other people\n*   caused by an allergy\n*   affected by diet or lifestyle\n\n【41】Page last reviewed: 19 July 2021  \nNext review due: 19 July 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This can feel uncomfortable but it only lasts a few seconds.\n\n【19】It's important to relax and not talk during this time, because this is when your blood pressure is measured.\n\n【20】If a healthcare professional is doing this for you, they may also use a stethoscope to record your blood pressure.\n\n【21】An automatic device usually picks up the measurements from sensors in the arm cuff, which are sent to a digital display.\n\n【22】You should get the results straight away.\n\n【23】How blood pressure is measured\n------------------------------\n\n【24】Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 numbers:\n\n【25】*   systolic pressure – the pressure when your heart pushes blood out around your body\n*   diastolic pressure – the pressure when your heart rests between beats and blood is pushed around your heart\n\n【26】The highest number is always the systolic pressure and it's always given first. For example, a blood pressure given as \"120 over 80\" or 120/80mmHg means a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg.\n\n【27】Understanding your blood pressure reading\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Your blood pressure reading can tell you how healthy your blood pressure is.\n\n【29】Information:\n\n【30】If you have a recent blood pressure reading use the NHS Check your blood pressure tool to understand what your reading means. You'll also get information about what to do next.\n\n【31】As a general guide:\n\n【32】*   normal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg (this applies if it's measured at home or at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic)\n*   high blood pressure is considered to be 135/85 or higher if your reading was taken at home, or 140/90mmHg or higher if your reading was taken at a pharmacy, GP surgery or clinic\n*   low blood pressure is considered to be 89/59mmHg or lower\n\n【33】If your reading is between 120/80mmHg and 140/90mmHg, you may be at risk of developing high blood pressure in the future. There are things you can do to help prevent high blood pressure.\n\n【34】Testing your blood pressure at home\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】Your GP may suggest 24-hour or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) if they think you may have high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\n【36】ABPM tests your blood pressure regularly over 24 hours, by using a cuff attached to a portable device that's worn on your waist.\n\n【37】You can continue with your daily activities during this time.\n\n【38】If you want to regularly check your blood pressure at home, you can buy a machine.\n\n【39】### Blood pressure devices for home use\n\n【40】If you want to check your blood pressure regularly at home, you can buy a digital blood pressure machine.\n\n【41】Choose a machine that measures your blood pressure at your upper arm, not your wrist or finger.\n\n【42】Let your GP know you're doing this.\n\n【43】Information:\n\n【44】Find out more:\n\n【45】*   The British Heart Foundation: How to choose a blood pressure monitor and measure your blood pressure at home\n*   Blood Pressure UK: How to measure your blood pressure at home\n\n【46】Page last reviewed: 11 July 2023  \nNext review due: 11 July 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  How it's performed\n3.  Recovery\n4.  Risks\n\n【3】**When you can return home after having hand surgery will depend on how badly your hand was damaged.**\n\n【4】You may be able to go home on the same day, after you have recovered from any anaesthetic and arrangements have been made for your aftercare.\n\n【5】After the operation\n-------------------\n\n【6】If you had a general anaesthetic, you'll wake up in the recovery room after your operation. You may have an oxygen mask on your face and feel a bit drowsy.\n\n【7】If you had a regional or local anaesthetic, you'll be able to go back to the ward sooner, but your arm will be numb and floppy for several hours.\n\n【8】It's normal for your hand to be elevated in a sling (a large, supportive bandage) to help reduce swelling.\n\n【9】Following the operation, your hand is likely to be bruised and swollen and, when the anaesthetic wears off, it'll be painful.\n\n【10】You may need to take painkillers, such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or codeine, for up to 2 weeks.\n\n【11】Before leaving hospital, you'll be advised to keep your hand above the level of your heart whenever possible to help reduce swelling.\n\n【12】For example, you may be advised to raise your arm on cushions while seated or to hold your arm up to your other shoulder while standing and walking.\n\n【13】You won't be able to drive for several weeks after the operation, so you'll need to arrange for someone to pick you up and take you home from the hospital.\n\n【14】If you live on your own and had a general anaesthetic, you may be advised to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【15】You may also need to stay overnight if you need hand therapy in hospital before you go home.\n\n【16】Recovery and rehabilitation\n---------------------------\n\n【17】Before you leave hospital, a hand therapist may replace the rigid plaster splint (a support designed to protect the hand) fitted during the operation with a lighter and more flexible plastic one.\n\n【18】This splint will help prevent the repaired tendons being overstretched.\n\n【19】You'll usually be advised to wear the splint at all times for 3 to 6 weeks, possibly followed by just wearing it at night for a further couple of weeks.\n\n【20】Your hand therapist will tell you how to look after your splint and what to do if you develop any problems with it.\n\n【21】It's important to avoid getting the splint wet, so covering it with a plastic bag while having a bath or shower will usually be recommended.\n\n【22】You'll be taught a number of different hand exercises after the operation, either before you leave hospital or at an appointment a few days later.\n\n【23】The exercises will help prevent the repaired tendons getting stuck to surrounding tissue, which would reduce your range of hand movements.\n\n【24】The specific exercises recommended by your hand therapist or surgeon will vary according to the type of tendon repair you had.\n\n【25】If you smoke, it's highly recommended that you stop. Smoking can impair the blood circulation in your hand and delay your recovery time.\n\n【26】Read more about stopping smoking.\n\n【27】Returning to work and activities\n--------------------------------\n\n【28】How quickly you can return to work and resume normal daily activities will depend on the nature of your job, as well as the type and location of your injury.\n\n【29】The repaired tendon will usually be back to full strength after about 12 weeks, but it can take up to 6 months to regain the full range of movement.\n\n【30】Some people may never be able to move the affected finger or thumb as much as before it was damaged.\n\n【31】In general, most people are able to:\n\n【32】*   resume light activities, such as using a keyboard or writing with a pen, after 6 to 8 weeks\n*   drive a car, motorcycle or heavy goods vehicle (HGV) after 8 to 10 weeks\n*   resume medium activities, such as light lifting or shelf stacking, after 8 to 10 weeks\n*   resume heavy activities, such as heavy lifting or building work, after 10 to 12 weeks\n*   resume sporting activities after 10 to 12 weeks\n\n【33】Your hand therapist or surgeon will be able to give you a more detailed estimate of your likely recovery time.\n\n【34】It's vital that you follow all the instructions and advice given to you regarding the use of your hands during your recovery period.\n\n【35】If you attempt to use the repaired tendons before they have fully healed, it could cause the repair to rupture (break or split).\n\n【36】Take care\n---------\n\n【37】After having hand surgery, you should be careful when carrying out everyday activities such as:\n\n【38】*   squeezing toothpaste tubes or shampoo bottles\n*   getting out of the bath\n*   opening doors\n*   getting dressed and undressed, as your hand can catch on your clothing\n\n【39】Page last reviewed: 06 September 2021  \nNext review due: 06 September 2024\n\n【40】*   Previous : How it's performed\n*   Next : Risks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.**\n\n【4】Weakened immune system\n----------------------\n\n【5】Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of AML.\n\n【6】Even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medicines that are used to treat AML can temporarily weaken your immune system.\n\n【7】This means you're more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual.\n\n【8】Complications arising from infection are very common in people with AML. But if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.\n\n【9】You may be advised to:\n\n【10】*   take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections\n*   maintain good personal and dental hygiene\n*   avoid contact with anyone who's known to have an infection – even if it's a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles\n*   check with your GP to make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date – you will not be able to have any vaccine that contains \"live\" viruses or bacteria, such as the shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\n\n【11】Report any possible symptoms of an infection to your treatment unit immediately as prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.\n\n【12】Symptoms of an infection can include:\n\n【13】*   a sore throat\n*   a high temperature, and feeling hot or shivery (fever)\n*   flu-like symptoms, such as headaches, aching muscles and tiredness\n*   breathlessness or a cough\n*   pain when peeing\n\n【14】Bleeding\n--------\n\n【15】If you have AML, you might bleed and bruise more easily because of the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive.\n\n【16】People with advanced AML are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body.\n\n【17】Serious bleeding can occur:\n\n【18】*   inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion\n*   inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, breathing difficulties and a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\n*   inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as vomiting blood and passing poos that are very dark or tar-like in colour\n\n【19】All these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies.\n\n【20】Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.\n\n【21】Infertility\n-----------\n\n【22】Most treatments used to treat AML can cause infertility. This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.\n\n【23】People particularly at risk of permanent infertility are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n\n【24】Your treatment team can talk to you about the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and discuss any fertility options before you begin your treatment.\n\n【25】Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  \nNext review due: 04 October 2025\n\n【26】*   Previous : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  How it's performed\n3.  Recovery\n4.  Risks\n\n【3】**If any of the tendons in your hand are damaged, surgery may be needed to repair them and help restore movement in the affected fingers or thumb.**\n\n【4】What are tendons?\n-----------------\n\n【5】Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.\n\n【6】When a group of muscles contract (tighten), the attached tendons will pull on certain bones, allowing you to make a wide range of movements.\n\n【7】There are 2 groups of tendons in the hand:\n\n【8】*   **extensor tendons** – which run from the forearm across the back of your hand to your fingers and thumb, allowing you to straighten your fingers and thumb\n*   **flexor tendons** – which run from your forearm through your wrist and across the palm of your hand, allowing you to bend your fingers\n\n【9】Surgery can often be used to repair damage to both these groups of tendons.\n\n【10】When hand tendon repair is needed\n---------------------------------\n\n【11】Hand tendon repair is needed when 1 or more tendons in your hand rupture (break or split) or are cut, leading to the loss of normal hand movements.\n\n【12】If your extensor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to straighten 1 or more fingers. If your flexor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to bend 1 or more fingers.\n\n【13】Tendon damage can also cause pain and swelling (inflammation) in your hand.\n\n【14】Sometimes, damage to the extensor tendons can be treated without the need for surgery, using a rigid support called a splint that's worn around the hand.\n\n【15】Common causes of tendon injuries include:\n\n【16】*   **cuts** – cuts across the back or palm of your hand can result in injury to your tendons\n*   **sports injuries** – extensor and flexor tendons can be injured when playing sports like rugby, and the pulleys holding flexor tendons can rupture if you do a lot of strenuous gripping like in rock climbing\n*   **animal and human bites** – these type of bites can cause tendon damage, and a person may damage their hand tendon after punching another person in the teeth\n*   **crushing injuries** – jamming a finger in a door or crushing a hand in a car accident can divide or rupture a tendon\n*   **rheumatoid arthritis** – rheumatoid arthritis can cause tendons to become inflamed which, if severe, can lead to them rupturing\n\n【17】Tendon repair surgery\n---------------------\n\n【18】Tendon repair may involve a surgeon making a cut (incision) in your wrist, hand or finger so they can locate the ends of the divided tendon and stitch them together.\n\n【19】Extensor tendons are easier to reach, so repairing them is relatively straightforward.\n\n【20】Read more about how hand tendon repair is performed.\n\n【21】Recovering from surgery\n-----------------------\n\n【22】Both types of tendon surgery require a lengthy period of recovery (rehabilitation) because the repaired tendons will be weak until the ends heal together.\n\n【23】Depending on the location of the injury, it can take up to 3 months for the repaired tendon to regain its previous strength.\n\n【24】Rehabilitation involves protecting your tendons from overuse using a hand splint. You'll usually need to wear a hand splint for several weeks after surgery.\n\n【25】You'll also need to perform hand exercises regularly during your recovery to stop the repaired tendons sticking to nearby tissue, which can prevent you being able to fully move your hand.\n\n【26】When you can return to work will depend on your job. Light activities can often be resumed after 6 to 8 weeks, and heavy activities and sport after 10 to 12 weeks.\n\n【27】Read more about recovering from hand tendon repair.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】After an extensor tendon repair you should have a working finger or thumb, but you may not regain full movement.\n\n【30】The outcome is often better when the injury is a clean cut to the tendon, rather than one that involves crushing or damage to the bones and joints.\n\n【31】A flexor tendon injury is generally more serious because they're often put under more strain than extensor tendons.\n\n【32】After a flexor tendon repair, it's quite common for some fingers to not regain full movement. But the tendon repair will still give a better result than not having surgery.\n\n【33】Complications can sometimes develop after surgery, such as infection or the repaired tendon snapping or sticking to nearby tissue. In these circumstances, further treatment may be required.\n\n【34】Page last reviewed: 06 September 2021  \nNext review due: 06 September 2024\n\n【35】*   Next : How it's performed", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

You may need to go back and talk to the doctor with your partner or someone close to you.\n\n【3】Spend some time thinking things through. The charity Antenatal Results and Choices offers information and support for people who have received a diagnosis after antenatal screening. Its helpline is answered by trained staff:\n\n【4】*   Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm\n*   on 020 7713 7486\n\n【5】You may be offered a termination to end the pregnancy. Some couples wish to continue with the pregnancy and prepare for the needs of their newborn baby, while others decide to terminate the pregnancy (have an abortion).\n\n【6】What happens\n------------\n\n【7】There are 2 main types of termination:\n\n【8】*   medical termination – taking medicine to end the pregnancy\n*   surgical termination – a procedure to remove the pregnancy\n\n【9】You should be offered a choice of which method you would prefer whenever possible.\n\n【10】A medical termination allows for a detailed examination of the baby (post-mortem) that can help find out the exact nature of the baby's abnormalities.\n\n【11】Tests can be done after both a medical and surgical termination to see if the baby was carrying a genetic disorder.\n\n【12】This may help your doctor to determine the chance of a future baby having a similar problem.\n\n【13】Medical termination\n-------------------\n\n【14】A medical termination involves taking medicine to end the pregnancy. It doesn't require surgery or an anaesthetic, and can be used at any stage of pregnancy.\n\n【15】It involves the following steps:\n\n【16】1.  Taking a medicine to stop an essential pregnancy hormone. Without this hormone, the pregnancy can't continue.\n2.  Usually 24 to 48 hours later, you have another appointment where you take a second medicine – either a tablet that you take by mouth or put inside your vagina. You may need more than 1 dose.\n3.  The lining of the womb breaks down, causing bleeding and loss of the pregnancy. This may take several hours.\n\n【17】When a medical termination is carried out after 9 weeks of pregnancy, you're more likely to need to stay overnight in the clinic or hospital.\n\n【18】Occasionally, the pregnancy doesn't pass and a small operation is needed to remove it.\n\n【19】Surgical termination\n--------------------\n\n【20】Surgical termination involves having a procedure with either:\n\n【21】*   local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed)\n*   conscious sedation (where you're relaxed but awake)\n*   general anaesthetic (where you're asleep)\n\n【22】There are 2 methods.\n\n【23】### Vacuum or suction aspiration\n\n【24】This can be used up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting a tube through the entrance to the womb (the cervix). The pregnancy is then removed using suction.\n\n【25】Vacuum aspiration takes 5 to 10 minutes, and you can usually go home a few hours later.\n\n【26】### Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)\n\n【27】This is used from after 14 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting special instruments called forceps through the cervix and into the womb to remove the pregnancy.\n\n【28】D&E is usually carried out under sedation or general anaesthetic.

Such treatments kill cancer cells but uric acid is then released from these cells. The build-up of uric acid into crystals can damage the kidneys.\n\n【5】Allopurinol can also help to treat kidney stones, when the waste products in the blood (including uric acid) make crystals that collect inside the kidneys.\n\n【6】Allopurinol reduces the symptoms caused by the build-up of uric acid in these conditions.\n\n【7】When will I feel better?\n\n【8】Allopurinol does not work straight away. It may take several weeks to reduce the level of uric acid. You may have more gout attacks for some time after starting allopurinol.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Allopurinol is considered very safe to take for a long period of time. There are unlikely to be any long-term effects.\n\n【11】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【12】If you stop allopurinol treatment suddenly, there's a high risk that your gout may get worse or you'll get serious side effects.\n\n【13】Only stop taking allopurinol if a doctor tells you to. A doctor will help you to reduce your dose slowly so you do not get serious side effects.\n\n【14】Are there any other medicines for gout?\n\n【15】There are 2 types of medicines used for gout treatment – some stop the gout attack and some prevent further gout attacks.\n\n【16】Medicines that treat an attack of gout include:\n\n【17】*   diclofenac\n*   etoricoxib\n*   indomethacin\n*   ketoprofen\n*   naproxen\n*   sulindac\n*   colchicine\n*   steroids\n*   canakinuma\n\n【18】Medicines that treat gout long-term in a similar way to allopurinol include:\n\n【19】*   febuxostat\n*   sulfinpyrazone\n*   benzbromarone\n\n【20】What happens if I take allopurinol when I'm having cancer treatment?\n\n【21】Some cancer treatments can cause an increase in uric acid levels in the blood which can then trigger gout attacks. Allopurinol should be started before these particular cancer treatments to prevent the build-up of uric acid.\n\n【22】However, some cancer treatments can cause changes in the blood which can be made worse if you take allopurinol. Your doctor will monitor you carefully and take blood tests if you are at risk.\n\n【23】What effect does allopurinol have on the kidneys and liver?\n\n【24】It's rare for allopurinol to affect the liver or kidneys.\n\n【25】However, if you have serious problems with your kidneys then you may be at greater risk of an allergic reaction to allopurinol. A doctor may prescribe a lower dose of allopurinol.\n\n【26】Allopurinol can also inflame the liver.\n\n【27】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【28】Allopurinol is not commonly known to affect sex.\n\n【29】However, rarely it can cause breasts to get larger (in both men and women) or erection problems (erectile dysfunction).\n\n【30】Talk to a doctor if you get any of these symptoms.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Allopurinol does not affect any type of contraception including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】But if allopurinol makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【34】Find out more about what to do if you're taking the pill and you're being sick\n\n【35】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【36】Some people may feel sleepy when taking allopurinol.\n\n【37】Do not drive a car, ride a bike, or operate machinery if allopurinol makes you feel sleepy or unable to concentrate or make decisions. This may be more likely when you first start taking allopurinol, but could happen at any time – for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【38】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【39】Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking allopurinol. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【40】Is there any food and drink I need to avoid?\n\n【41】There are no foods or drink you need to avoid while taking allopurinol. However, drinking alcohol can trigger an attack of gout.\n\n【42】Reducing certain types of food and drink may help to stop gout coming back. It's a good idea not to have too much:\n\n【43】*   red meat, kidneys, liver, or seafood\n*   sugary drinks and snacks\n*   fatty foods\n*   alcohol\n\n【44】Can I drink alcohol while taking allopurinol?\n\n【45】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking allopurinol. Alcohol does not affect how this medicine works.\n\n【46】However, drinking alcohol increases the level of uric acid in your blood. This can trigger an attack of gout or make it worse.\n\n【47】It's best to stick to the national guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n\n【48】Can lifestyle changes help gout?\n\n【49】There are lifestyle changes you can make to help stop getting further attacks of gout or reduce the chance of it returning:\n\n【50】*   make sure you're a healthy weight\n*   eat well – cut saturated fat and increase fibre, fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and fish\n*   quit smoking\n*   cut down on alcohol\n*   try to exercise every day\n\n【51】More in Allopurinol\n-------------------\n\n【52】*   About allopurinol\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking allopurinol with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【53】Page last reviewed: 23 January 2023  \nNext review due: 23 January 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Diagnosis\n3.  Treatment\n4.  Reducing the risk\n\n【3】**Paget's disease of the nipple, also known as Paget's disease of the breast, is a rare condition associated with breast cancer**.\n\n【4】It causes eczema-like changes to the skin of the nipple and the area of darker skin surrounding the nipple (areola). It's usually a sign of breast cancer in the tissue behind the nipple.\n\n【5】About 1 to 4% of women with breast cancer have Paget's disease of the nipple. It can also affect men, but this is extremely rare.\n\n【6】The term Paget's disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget's disease of the bone (where bones become weak and deformed).\n\n【7】Symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【8】Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola.\n\n【9】The affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated.\n\n【10】Credit:\n\n【11】CID, ISM /SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/459439/view\n\n【12】The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over.\n\n【13】If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor.\n\n【14】Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer.\n\n【15】Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump.\n\n【16】However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer.\n\n【17】This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread.\n\n【18】Causes of Paget's disease of the nipple\n---------------------------------------\n\n【19】The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown. Some women appear to be more at risk of developing breast cancer, but not specifically Paget's disease. There are no known causes that lead to a specific type of breast cancer.\n\n【20】In terms of risk factors, you're more likely to develop breast cancer if you:\n\n【21】*   are older – the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age\n*   have close relatives with breast cancer\n*   have had breast cancer before\n*   have had a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease before – certain types of benign breast disease may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but this is only seen in a very small number of women\n*   are overweight or living with obesity, particularly if you've been through the menopause (you can use the BMI calculator to check if you're a healthy weight)\n*   drink a lot of alcohol – your risk can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink\n\n【22】Read more about the risk factors for breast cancer.\n\n【23】Diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple\n----------------------------------------\n\n【24】You should see your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola.\n\n【25】As Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\n\n【26】Also see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out.\n\n【27】A biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous.\n\n【28】If the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray) to investigate further.\n\n【29】Read more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple.\n\n【30】Treating Paget's disease of the nipple\n--------------------------------------\n\n【31】Surgery is the main treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple. Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision).\n\n【32】If the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast.\n\n【33】You may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of:\n\n【34】*   chemotherapy – where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells\n*   radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells\n*   targeted or hormone therapy – which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body\n\n【35】If Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery.\n\n【36】Read more about treating Paget's disease of the nipple.\n\n【37】Reducing the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and making sure you exercise regularly, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer.\n\n【39】Breast cancer screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. In the UK, the NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women aged 50 to 70.\n\n【40】In some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a study looking at whether the age range for breast screening should be extended.\n\n【41】Read more about reducing the risks of breast cancer.\n\n【42】Page last reviewed: 06 April 2023  \nNext review due: 06 April 2026\n\n【43】*   Next : Diagnosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This means it's made from proteins or other substances produced by the body. It's used to reduce swelling (inflammation) by acting on your immune system.\n\n【3】Adalimumab is used to treat inflammation of the:\n\n【4】*   joints (rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active enthesitis-related arthritis)\n*   skin (plaque psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa)\n*   joints and skin (psoriatic arthritis)\n*   spine, causing back pain (axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis)\n*   gut and ulcers in the lining of the gut (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis)\n*   layer beneath the white of the eyeball (non-infectious uveitis)\n\n【5】Humira is the brand name of the original adalimumab medicine. There are now 5 newer versions of adalimumab, known by the brand names Amgevita, Hyrimoz, Idacio, Imraldi and Yuflyma.\n\n【6】These newer medicines are biosimilars. A biosimilar is a similar version of the original biological medicine. It works in the same way, by blocking part of your immune system to reduce inflammation.\n\n【7】If you switch, your body should respond the same way as if you'd stayed on Humira. You should not notice any difference.\n\n【8】Adalimumab is available on prescription. It comes as a pre-filled syringe or an injection pen that you inject under the skin. If you're switching from Humira to a different brand of adalimumab, the way the injection pen or syringe works might be different.\n\n【9】Key facts\n---------\n\n【10】*   Adalimumab is given by an injection under your skin. It works by blocking part of your immune system to reduce inflammation.\n*   It takes a few weeks for adalimumab to work. It may take longer depending on your condition.\n*   Adalimumab can make you more likely to get infections. Tell your doctor if you get an infection, such as coronavirus (COVID-19), or if you come into contact with anyone who has shingles, chickenpox or measles. These infections can make you very ill.\n*   If you need to have a vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether it's a live vaccine and if there's an alternative inactivated vaccine available. Adalimumab may increase the risk of getting an infection caused by a live vaccine.\n*   You might feel dizzy or have blurred vision after taking adalimumab. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools.\n*   When you start taking adalimumab you'll be given a patient alert card. Carry this with you all the time. It tells healthcare professionals that you're taking adalimumab. If you do not have a patient alert card, you can ask your specialist for one.\n\n【11】More in Adalimumab\n------------------\n\n【12】*   About adalimumab\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking adalimumab with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【13】Page last reviewed: 24 March 2022  \nNext review due: 24 March 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Have a bath or shower with plain warm water then carefully pat yourself dry.\n\n【5】If your stitches are sore or uncomfortable, tell your midwife.\n\n【6】Painkillers can help. If you're breastfeeding, check with your pharmacist, midwife or GP before you buy over-the-counter painkillers.\n\n【7】Stitches usually dissolve by the time the cut or tear has healed, but sometimes they have to be taken out.\n\n【8】Going to the toilet\n-------------------\n\n【9】At first, the thought of peeing can be a bit frightening – because of the soreness. Drinking lots of water dilutes your urine, which may make it sting less.\n\n【10】Tell your midwife if:\n\n【11】*   you're finding it really difficult to pee\n*   you feel very sore\n*   you notice an unpleasant smell\n\n【12】You probably won't have a poo for a few days after the birth, but it's important not to let yourself get constipated.\n\n【13】Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, salad, wholegrain cereals and wholemeal bread, and drink plenty of water.\n\n【14】If you've had stitches, it's very unlikely you'll break them, or open up the cut or tear again.\n\n【15】It might feel better if you hold a pad of clean tissue over the stitches when pooing. Try not to strain.\n\n【16】Talk to your midwife or GP if you have constipation that won't go away. A gentle laxative may help.\n\n【17】Also tell your midwife or GP if poo is leaking or you're pooing when you don't mean to.\n\n【18】Bladder control\n---------------\n\n【19】After having a baby, it's quite common to leak a bit of pee if you laugh, cough or move suddenly.\n\n【20】Pelvic floor exercises can help with this but tell your GP at your postnatal check if they aren't. They may refer you to a physiotherapist.\n\n【21】Piles\n-----\n\n【22】Piles are very common after birth but usually disappear within a few days.\n\n【23】Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, salad, wholegrain cereals and wholemeal bread, and drink plenty of water. This should make pooing easier and less painful.\n\n【24】Try not to push or strain – this will make the piles worse.\n\n【25】Let your midwife know if you feel very uncomfortable. They can give you a cream to soothe the piles.\n\n【26】Bleeding after birth (lochia)\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】You'll bleed from your vagina after the birth. It will be quite heavy at first, and you'll need super-absorbent sanitary towels. Change them regularly, washing your hands before and afterwards.\n\n【28】It isn't a good idea to use tampons until after your 6-week postnatal check because they could increase your chance of getting an infection.\n\n【29】See when you can start using tampons after birth.\n\n【30】You may notice the bleeding is redder and heavier when you breastfeed. This happens because breastfeeding makes your womb contract. You may also feel cramps similar to period pains.\n\n【31】The bleeding will carry on for a few weeks. It will gradually turn a brownish colour and decrease until it finally stops.\n\n【32】If you're losing blood in large clots, tell your midwife. You may need some treatment.\n\n【33】**When will my periods start again after pregnancy?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】It's hard to be exact about when your periods will start again, as everyone is different.\n\n【35】If you bottle feed your baby, or combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding, your first period could start as soon as 5 to 6 weeks after you give birth.\n\n【36】If you fully breastfeed (including at night) without any bottle feeding, your periods may not start again until you start to reduce breastfeeding.\n\n【37】How soon after giving birth can I get pregnant?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【38】You can get pregnant as little as 3 weeks after the birth of your baby, even if you're breastfeeding and your periods have not started again yet.\n\n【39】Find out more about when you can use contraception after having a baby.\n\n【40】**How soon can I use tampons after giving birth?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】You should not use tampons until you've had your 6-week postnatal check. This is because you'll still have a wound where the placenta joined with the wall of your womb, and you may also have tears or cuts in or around your vagina.\n\n【42】Using internal sanitary products like tampons and menstrual cups before this wound has healed could increase your chance of getting an infection.\n\n【43】Use maternity pads or sanitary towels during this time while your body is still healing.\n\n【44】Breasts\n-------\n\n【45】To begin with, your breasts will produce a yellowish liquid called colostrum for your baby.\n\n【46】On the third or fourth day, they may feel tight and tender as they start to produce milk.\n\n【47】Wearing a supportive nursing bra may help. Speak to your midwife if you're very uncomfortable.\n\n【48】Read more about breastfeeding in the first few days.\n\n【49】Tummy\n-----\n\n【50】After delivery, your tummy will probably still be a lot bigger than before pregnancy. This is partly because your muscles have stretched.\n\n【51】If you eat a balanced diet and get some exercise, your shape should gradually return.\n\n【52】Breastfeeding helps because it makes your womb contract. You may feel quite painful period-like cramps while you're feeding.\n\n【53】You could also try these gentle postnatal tummy exercises.\n\n【54】Is it something serious?\n------------------------\n\n【55】Tell your midwife, health visitor or GP straight away if you get any of these symptoms.\n\n【56】A table listing symptoms of something that might be serious. If you have any of these symptoms you should tell your GP straight away. The symtoms are Pain, swelling or redness in the calf muscle of one leg, Sudden or very heavy blood loss from your vagina, possibly feeling faint, rapid heart beat, high temperature, sore and tender tummy, or Headache, changes in your vision, vomiting.\n\n| Symptoms | What it could be |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pain, swelling or redness in the calf muscle of one leg | deep vein thrombosis (DVT) |\n| Pain in your chest, difficulty breathing | pulmonary embolism |\n| Sudden or very heavy blood loss from your vagina, possibly feeling faint, rapid heart beat | postpartum haemorrhage |\n| High temperature, sore and tender tummy | infection |\n| Headache, changes in your vision, vomiting | pre-eclampsia |\n\n【58】Video: What can I do to help recover from tearing?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】In this video, 4 mothers talk about what they did to help recover from tearing after birth.\n\n【60】Media last reviewed: 2 February 2023  \nMedia review due: 2 February 2026\n\n【61】More in After the birth\n-----------------------\n\n【62】*   What happens straight after the birth?\n*   Your body after the birth\n*   Your newborn baby\n*   Early days\n*   Special care: ill or premature babies\n\n【63】Page last reviewed: 15 April 2021  \nNext review due: 15 April 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

They also reduce how severe your symptoms are when you're exposed to substances which you're allergic to.\n\n【3】How long does it take to work?\n\n【4】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops usually take a few days to start working, and a few weeks to work fully. Tell your doctor if you do not feel any better after using the eye drops for 2 weeks.\n\n【5】Can I use it for a long time?\n\n【6】You can use sodium cromoglicate eye drops for as long as you are in contact with the substance that triggers your allergy (use them during the hay fever season). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think you need to use them for longer than 2 weeks.\n\n【7】But do not use your bottle of eye drops for longer than 4 weeks. If it is open longer than that, throw it away and start a new one.\n\n【8】How effective is it for hay fever?\n\n【9】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops are often used if you keep getting symptoms, or your symptoms last a long time. You need to use them regularly for several weeks for them to work best.\n\n【10】If your symptoms do not get better, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【11】How do sodium cromoglicate eye drops compare to similar medicines?\n\n【12】Lodoxamide eye drops work in a similar way to sodium cromoglicate eye drops. There is not enough information to say whether one works better than the other.\n\n【13】Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not helping your symptoms.\n\n【14】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【15】If you stop taking sodium cromoglicate eye drops, your symptoms may come back.\n\n【16】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【17】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops do not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【18】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【19】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops can cause blurry vision for a few minutes after using them. If this happens, do not drive, cycle or operate machinery straight away. Wait until your eyes feel OK again and your vision is back to normal.\n\n【20】Can I drink alcohol while using sodium cromoglicate eye drops?\n\n【21】Yes, it is OK to drink alcohol while using these eye drops.\n\n【22】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【23】You can eat and drink normally while using sodium cromoglicate eye drops.\n\n【24】Can lifestyle changes help with hay fever?\n\n【25】It will help if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【26】### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【27】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【28】### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【29】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n\n【30】More in Sodium cromoglicate eye drops\n-------------------------------------\n\n【31】*   About sodium cromoglicate eye drops\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using sodium cromoglicate eye drops with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【32】Page last reviewed: 22 July 2022  \nNext review due: 22 July 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Pregnancy tests are most reliable from the first day of your missed period.\n\n【2】When you can do a pregnancy test\n--------------------------------\n\n【3】You can carry out most pregnancy tests from the first day of a missed period. If you don't know when your next period is due, do the test at least 21 days after you last had unprotected sex.\n\n【4】Some very sensitive pregnancy tests can be used even before you miss a period.\n\n【5】You can do a pregnancy test on a sample of urine collected at any time of the day. It doesn't have to be in the morning.\n\n【6】Where you can get a pregnancy test\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】You can buy pregnancy testing kits from pharmacists and some supermarkets. They can give a quick result and you can do the test in private.\n\n【8】The following places provide free pregnancy tests:\n\n【9】*   sexual health services\n*   some young people's services – call the national sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for details\n*   Brook centres for under-25s – find your nearest Brook centre\n\n【10】You may also be able to get a pregnancy test free of charge from your GP.\n\n【11】How does a pregnancy test work?\n-------------------------------\n\n【12】All pregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which starts to be produced around 6 days after fertilisation.\n\n【13】Most pregnancy tests come in a box that contains 1 or 2 long sticks. You pee on the stick and the result appears on the stick after a few minutes. All tests are slightly different, so always check the instructions.\n\n【14】Will a pregnancy test work if I'm on the pill?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Yes.\n\n【16】Some methods of contraception, such as the contraceptive pill, contain hormones, but these hormones will not stop a pregnancy test working.\n\n【17】No method of contraception is completely effective, so it's important to take a pregnancy test if you think you might be pregnant.\n\n【18】Pregnancy test results\n----------------------\n\n【19】Home pregnancy tests are accurate as long as you follow the instructions correctly.\n\n【20】A positive test result is almost certainly correct. However, a negative test result is less reliable.\n\n【21】The result may not be reliable if you:\n\n【22】*   do not follow the instructions properly\n*   take the test too early\n\n【23】Some medicines can also affect the results.\n\n【24】If you get a negative result and still think you're pregnant, wait a few days and try again. Speak to your GP if you get a negative result after a second test but your period has not arrived.\n\n【25】Continuing with the pregnancy\n-----------------------------\n\n【26】If you're pregnant and want to continue with the pregnancy, contact your GP or a midwife to start your antenatal care. You can use the pregnancy due date calculator to work out when your baby is due.\n\n【27】If you're not sure you want to be pregnant\n------------------------------------------\n\n【28】If you're not sure about continuing with the pregnancy, you can discuss this confidentially with a healthcare professional. Your options are:\n\n【29】*   continuing with the pregnancy and keeping the baby\n*   having an abortion\n*   continuing with the pregnancy and having the baby adopted\n\n【30】As well as a GP or a nurse at your GP surgery, you can also get accurate, confidential information – from the age of 13 – from the following:\n\n【31】*   sexual health services\n*   the MSI Reproductive Choices website\n*   the British Pregnancy Advisory service website\n*   the National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory service website\n\n【32】All these services – including community contraceptive clinics – are confidential. If you're 13 or older, the staff won't tell your parents. They'll encourage you to talk to your parents, but they won't force you. \n\n【33】If you're under 25 and would prefer advice specifically for young people, the sexual health charity Brook provides a range of services for young people. The Brook website contains information on pregnancy choices. You can also use the Ask Brook 24/7 service.\n\n【34】Video: Is the pregnancy test accurate?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【35】In this video, a midwife explains when you can take a pregnancy test and how to do it properly.\n\n【36】Media last reviewed: 2 February 2023  \nMedia review due: 2 February 2026\n\n【37】More in Trying for a baby\n-------------------------\n\n【38】*   Trying to get pregnant\n*   Getting pregnant if you have a mental health condition\n*   Planning your pregnancy\n*   Doing a pregnancy test\n*   Signs and symptoms of pregnancy\n*   How long does it usually take to get pregnant?\n*   Planning another pregnancy\n\n【39】Page last reviewed: 9 February 2022  \nNext review due: 9 February 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "870ff45b-44e6-468a-9fdf-4b3d7f457f75", "title": "MCADD", "text": "【0】MCADD\n=====\n\n【1】**MCADD is a rare genetic condition where a person has problems breaking down fat to use as an energy source.**\n\n【2】This means that someone with MCADD can become very ill if their body's energy demands exceed their energy intake, such as during infections or vomiting illnesses when they're unable to eat.\n\n【3】Problems occur because fat is only partially broken down, which leads to a lack of energy and a build-up of harmful substances in the body.\n\n【4】MCADD is a lifelong condition that's present from birth. It is usually picked up using the newborn blood spot test.\n\n【5】MCADD stands for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n【6】Is MCADD serious?\n-----------------\n\n【7】MCADD is a potentially serious condition that can be life-threatening if not recognised quickly and treated appropriately.\n\n【8】However, most cases are picked up soon after birth and can be managed quite easily.\n\n【9】With proper care, there's no reason why someone with MCADD cannot live a normal, healthy and active life.\n\n【10】Symptoms of MCADD\n-----------------\n\n【11】Babies with MCADD are at risk of developing the following symptoms:\n\n【12】*   irritability\n*   poor feeding\n*   sleepiness\n*   floppiness\n*   breathing difficulties\n*   vomiting\n*   seizures (fits)\n*   coma\n\n【13】If your baby is ill or is not feeding well, they should be given a special high-sugar drink, known as glucose polymer. This is called the emergency regimen.\n\n【14】Families with a child with MCADD are taught how to prepare and give the emergency regimen.\n\n【15】If you see no improvement after giving the emergency regimen, you should take your child to your nearest A&E department immediately.\n\n【16】Take any relevant paperwork about your child's MCADD with you and tell hospital staff your child has MCADD.\n\n【17】It's also helpful to contact your specialist care team to say you are on your way but do not delay going to hospital.\n\n【18】What causes MCADD?\n------------------\n\n【19】MCADD is caused by a fault in the gene that provides the instructions to make an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD).\n\n【20】This genetic fault causes the enzyme to either not work properly or be missing entirely, which means the body cannot fully break down fat to release energy.\n\n【21】If the body needs to break down fat quickly (for example, if you're unwell and have not eaten for a while), energy cannot be produced quickly enough to meet the body's needs and substances created when fat is partially broken down can build up to harmful levels in the body.\n\n【22】This can lead to serious problems if not treated quickly.\n\n【23】How MCADD is inherited\n----------------------\n\n【24】A child will only be born with MCADD if they inherit a copy of the faulty gene that causes it from both of their parents.\n\n【25】The parents will not normally have the condition themselves because they usually only have one copy of the faulty gene each. This is known as being a \"carrier\".\n\n【26】If both parents are carriers of the faulty gene, there's a:\n\n【27】*   1 in 4 chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and will not have MCADD or be able to pass it on\n*   1 in 2 chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier\n*   1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have MCADD\n\n【28】Read more about genetic and genomic testing\n\n【29】Screening and testing for MCADD\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】A newborn blood spot test is now offered to all babies in England to earlier help detect problems including MCADD. \n\n【31】When your baby is 5 to 8 days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate MCADD.\n\n【32】You should receive the results by the time your baby is 6 to 8 weeks old. You'll be contacted sooner if a problem is found so you can attend a hospital appointment to discuss this further.\n\n【33】If your baby has a screen positive result, further urine and blood tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes MCADD.\n\n【34】If you've previously had a child with MCADD, the newborn blood spot test should be carried out within 24 to 48 hours of birth.\n\n【35】How MCADD is treated\n--------------------\n\n【36】There's no specific treatment for MCADD. A specialist care team will give you advice about how to look after your child and support them as they get older.\n\n【37】They will also:\n\n【38】*   arrange regular follow-up appointments\n*   provide you with contact details for your specialist care team and written information\n\n【39】Children and adults with MCADD can eat a normal diet, as long as they:\n\n【40】*   **frequently take special high-sugar drinks when they're ill** – this includes common illnesses such as a high temperature, diarrhoea, or vomiting\n*   **avoid long periods without eating during the newborn period and infancy even when well** – the length of time your child can go without eating is known as the maximum \"safe fasting time\" and it varies depending on age; you'll be given advice about this\n\n【41】The high-sugar drinks used for treating MCADD are available on prescription from a GP. You'll be advised by a specialist dietitian about when to use them and how much to use. If the drinks do not help or your child refuses them, they may need to be treated in hospital.\n\n【42】You can find more detailed information about MCADD treatment in the British Inherited Metabolic Diseases Group (BIMDG) MCADD information sheet for parents and carers (PDF, 116kb).\n\n【43】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【44】If you or your child has MCADD, your clinical team will pass information about you or them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【45】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n\n【46】Find out more about the register on GOV.UK\n\n【47】Support groups\n--------------\n\n【48】In addition to the support of your care team, you may find it useful to contact a national or local support group for people with MCADD and their families.\n\n【49】One of the main groups in the UK is Metabolic Support UK. You can find information about MCADD on its website and you can speak to their Family Advisers for free on 0845 241 2173.\n\n【50】Page last reviewed: 06 October 2022  \nNext review due: 06 October 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This may be done at home, at your GP surgery, or in hospital.\n\n【36】### Treatment in hospital\n\n【37】You may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys.\n\n【38】In hospital, you may be given strong medicines like steroids to help ease your symptoms.\n\n【39】Risks of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)\n---------------------------------------\n\n【40】Most people with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment.\n\n【41】But sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months.\n\n【42】There's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged (chronic kidney disease). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups.\n\n【43】### Important: Getting HSP again\n\n【44】You can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back.\n\n【45】Page last reviewed: 18 October 2023  \nNext review due: 18 October 2026\n\n【46】Some images provided by Don't Forget The Bubbles.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【4】Constipation\n\n【5】Eat more high-fibre foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals. Try to have several glasses of water, or other non-alcoholic drinks, every day. If you can, it may also help to do some exercise.\n\n【6】Feeling dizzy\n\n【7】This is probably because of low blood pressure (hypotension). Drink plenty of water or non-alcoholic drinks. Do not stand up too quickly after sitting or lying down.\n\n【8】Dry mouth\n\n【9】Chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n\n【10】Feeling sleepy or tired\n\n【11】Take dosulepin in the evening and try to cut down the amount of alcohol you drink. Do not drive or use tools or machinery if you're feeling sleepy. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n\n【12】Difficulty peeing\n\n【13】Relax when you try to pee. Do not try to force the flow of urine. If you cannot go, try again later. Talk to your doctor, urgently, if you cannot pee at all.\n\n【14】Headaches\n\n【15】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to drink too much alcohol. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【16】Blurred vision\n\n【17】Do not drive, cycle or operate machinery if this happens to you. This may improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but if it does not get better after 1 week, talk to your doctor as they may need to prescribe a different medicine.\n\n【18】If this advice does not help and any of these side effects continue, tell your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【19】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【20】Serious side effects after taking dosulepin are rare but there are some risks.

What happens\n3.  Side effects\n\n【3】**Radiotherapy can cause side effects, although many of these can be treated or prevented and most will go away after the treatment stops.**\n\n【4】It's difficult to predict what side effects you'll get and in some cases you may only develop side effects months, or even years, after you start treatment.\n\n【5】Side effects vary from person to person and depend on things such as the part of your body being treated and the type of radiotherapy you have. Ask your care team about the side effects you might get.\n\n【6】Sore skin\n---------\n\n【7】In some people, radiotherapy can make your skin sore, change colour (it might become red, lighter or darker than your normal skin tone), or dry and itchy. Sometimes it can blister and peel.\n\n【8】This tends to start 1 to 2 weeks after treatment begins.\n\n【9】Tell your care team if you notice any soreness or changes to your skin.\n\n【10】To care for your skin during radiotherapy you should:\n\n【11】*   wash your skin every day with your usual soap\n*   pat your skin dry instead of rubbing it\n*   apply your usual moisturiser every day, or start using a moisturiser\n*   use your usual deodorant, unless it irritates your skin\n*   avoid shaving the area if possible and do not use laser, wax, or hair-removal creams\n*   avoid using heat or cold packs on the area\n*   try wearing loose-fitting clothes made from natural fibres such as cotton or silk, and avoid tight bands, ties or straps on the sore area\n*   use a high-factor sunscreen (SPF 50 or above) to protect your skin from the sun and continue to use it for at least a year after treatment ends\n*   check with your care team if you should stop swimming – chlorine in the water can sometimes make your skin worse when you're having radiotherapy\n*   stop using any products on your skin if your skin breaks\n\n【12】Skin problems usually settle within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment finishing, but sometimes your skin might stay slightly darker or lighter than it was before.\n\n【13】Tiredness\n---------\n\n【14】Many people having radiotherapy feel tired (fatigued) a lot of the time or become tired very easily from doing everyday activities.\n\n【15】This usually starts during treatment and can continue for several weeks or months after treatment finishes.\n\n【16】It can help to:\n\n【17】*   get plenty of rest\n*   avoid doing tasks or activities that you do not feel up to\n*   do light exercise, such as going for short walks, if you're able to – this can boost your energy level, but be careful not to push yourself too hard\n*   ask your friends and family for help with everyday tasks\n\n【18】If you're working, you may want to ask your employer for time off or to let you work part-time until your treatment has finished.\n\n【19】Read more tips to help fight tiredness.\n\n【20】Contact your care team if you suddenly feel very tired and out of breath. This can be a sign of a lack of red blood cells (anaemia), which may need to be treated.\n\n【21】Hair loss\n---------\n\n【22】Hair loss is a common side effect of radiotherapy. But unlike hair loss during chemotherapy, it only causes hair loss in the area being treated.\n\n【23】Ask your care team to show you exactly where your hair is likely to fall out.\n\n【24】Your hair will usually start to fall out 2 to 3 weeks after treatment starts.\n\n【25】It should start to grow back a few weeks after treatment finishes, although sometimes it may be a slightly different texture or colour than it was before.\n\n【26】Occasionally, hair loss can be permanent if you have a high dose of radiotherapy. Ask your doctor if this is a risk before starting treatment.\n\n【27】### Coping with hair loss\n\n【28】Hair loss can be upsetting. Talk to your care team if you find losing your hair difficult to cope with.\n\n【29】They understand how distressing it can be and can support you and discuss your options with you.\n\n【30】You may decide you want to wear a wig if you lose the hair on your head. Synthetic wigs are available free of charge on the NHS for some people, but you'll usually have to pay for a wig made from real hair.\n\n【31】Other options include headwear such as headscarves.\n\n【32】Read advice about cancer and hair loss.\n\n【33】Feeling sick\n------------\n\n【34】Some people feel sick during, or for a short time after, radiotherapy treatment sessions.\n\n【35】This is more likely to happen if the treatment area is near your stomach, or if your brain is being treated.\n\n【36】Tell your care team if you feel sick during or after treatment. They can prescribe anti-sickness medicine to help.\n\n【37】You should stop feeling sick soon after your treatment finishes.\n\n【38】Macmillan has more information about managing sickness and vomiting.\n\n【39】Problems eating and drinking\n----------------------------\n\n【40】Radiotherapy can sometimes cause:\n\n【41】*   a sore mouth\n*   loss of appetite and weight loss\n*   discomfort when swallowing\n\n【42】### Sore mouth\n\n【43】Radiotherapy to your head or neck can make the lining of your mouth sore and irritated. This is known as mucositis.\n\n【44】Symptoms tend to happen within a couple of weeks of treatment starting and can include:\n\n【45】*   the inside of your mouth feeling sore – as if you have burned it by eating very hot food or drink\n*   mouth ulcers, which can become infected\n*   discomfort when eating, drinking and/or talking\n*   a dry mouth\n*   reduced sense of taste\n*   bad breath\n\n【46】Tell your care team if you have any of these problems. They may recommend painkillers or a special mouthwash that can help. Avoiding spicy, salty or sharp foods can also help.\n\n【47】Mucositis usually gets better a few weeks after treatment finishes, although sometimes a dry mouth can be a long-term problem.\n\n【48】### Loss of appetite\n\n【49】Feeling sick and tired during radiotherapy can make you lose your appetite, which could lead to weight loss. You may also find that your sense of taste changes, which can also affect appetite.\n\n【50】But it's important to try to eat healthily and maintain your weight during treatment. Tell your care team if you do not feel you're eating enough.\n\n【51】They may give you tips, such as eating frequent small meals instead of 3 large meals, or refer you to a dietitian.\n\n【52】### Discomfort when swallowing\n\n【53】Radiotherapy to your chest, head, neck or oesophagus (gullet or food pipe) can make swallowing uncomfortable.\n\n【54】Tell your care team if this affects you, as you may need to make some changes to your diet, such as eating soft or liquid foods.\n\n【55】You may also be prescribed medicine to reduce the discomfort and in a few cases you may need a temporary feeding tube.\n\n【56】Read more about treatments for swallowing problems.\n\n【57】Swallowing problems usually improve after treatment stops.\n\n【58】Diarrhoea\n---------\n\n【59】Diarrhoea is a common side effect of radiotherapy to the tummy or pelvic area.\n\n【60】It usually starts a few days after treatment begins and may get a bit worse as treatment continues.\n\n【61】Tell your care team if you get diarrhoea. Medicine is available to help relieve it.\n\n【62】Diarrhoea should disappear within a few weeks of treatment finishing. Tell your doctor if your symptoms have not improved after a few weeks, or if you notice blood in your poo.\n\n【63】Stiff joints and muscles\n------------------------\n\n【64】Radiotherapy can sometimes make your joints and muscles in the area being treated feel stiff, swollen and uncomfortable.\n\n【65】Exercising and stretching regularly can help to prevent stiffness.\n\n【66】Tell your care team if joint or muscle stiffness a problem. They may refer you to a physiotherapist, who can recommend exercises for you to try.\n\n【67】Sex and fertility issues\n------------------------\n\n【68】Radiotherapy can have an effect on your sex life and fertility, especially if your lower tummy, pelvic area or groin is treated.\n\n【69】Ask your care team if there's a chance it could affect you.\n\n【70】### Sex and fertility issues for women\n\n【71】In women, there's a risk that radiotherapy could cause:\n\n【72】*   loss of interest in sex (loss of libido) – this tends to gradually improve after treatment stops\n*   stiffening and narrowing of the vagina – your care team may suggest using vaginal dilators (devices you insert into your vagina) to prevent this; having sex regularly may also help\n*   vaginal dryness – lubricants, vaginal moisturisers and medicated creams can help with this\n*   the menopause – this can cause symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, but treatment with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help\n*   infertility – if there's a risk this could happen, it may be possible to store some of your eggs before treatment\n\n【73】Cancer Research UK has more information about women's sex life and fertility after radiotherapy.\n\n【74】### Sex and fertility issues for men\n\n【75】In men, there's a risk that radiotherapy could cause:\n\n【76】*   loss of interest in sex (loss of libido) – this tends to gradually improve after treatment stops\n*   difficulty getting an erection (erectile dysfunction) – this tends to improve with time and there are several erectile dysfunction treatments available\n*   pain when ejaculating – this should pass a few weeks after the treatment ends\n*   infertility – if there's a risk this could happen, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm before treatment\n\n【77】Cancer Research UK has more information about men's sex life and fertility after radiotherapy.\n\n【78】Emotional issues\n----------------\n\n【79】Having radiotherapy can be a frustrating, stressful and traumatic experience. It's natural to feel anxious and to wonder if your treatment will be successful.\n\n【80】Stress and anxiety can also increase your risk of depression.\n\n【81】Speak to your care team if you're struggling to cope emotionally. They can offer support and discuss possible treatment strategies.\n\n【82】Joining a cancer support group may also help. Talking to other people in a similar situation can often reduce feelings of isolation and stress.\n\n【83】The cancer support charity Macmillan Cancer Support has a directory of support groups. You can also call the free Macmillan support line: 0808 808 00 00 (every day, 8am to 8pm).\n\n【84】Lymphoedema\n-----------\n\n【85】Radiotherapy can damage your body's lymphatic system, which is a network of channels and glands that form part of your immune system (the body's defence against illness).\n\n【86】One of the jobs of the lymphatic system is to stop fluid building up in your body. If it becomes damaged, you may experience pain and swelling. This is known as lymphoedema.\n\n【87】It's most common in the arms or legs, but it can affect other areas, depending on the part of your body that was treated.\n\n【88】It may be possible to reduce your risk of lymphoedema by looking after your skin and doing regular exercises. Ask your care team if you're at risk and what you can do to help avoid it.\n\n【89】If you do get it, treatment for lymphoedema can often help keep the symptoms under control.\n\n【90】Getting another type of cancer\n------------------------------\n\n【91】Radiotherapy can slightly increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the years after treatment.\n\n【92】But the chance of this happening is small, and the benefits of treatment generally outweigh the risk.\n\n【93】Page last reviewed: 05 June 2023  \nNext review due: 05 June 2026\n\n【94】*   Previous : What happens", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But you might be able to stop treatment if your seizures disappear over time.\n\n【24】Living with epilepsy\n--------------------\n\n【25】Epilepsy is usually a lifelong condition, but most people with it are able to have normal lives if their seizures are well controlled.\n\n【26】Most children with epilepsy are able to go to a mainstream school, take part in most activities and sports, and get a job when they're older.\n\n【27】But you may have to think about your epilepsy before you do things such as driving, certain jobs, swimming, using contraception and planning a pregnancy.\n\n【28】Advice is available from a GP or support groups to help you adjust to life with epilepsy.\n\n【29】Find out more about living with epilepsy\n\n【30】Causes of epilepsy\n------------------\n\n【31】In epilepsy, the electrical signals in the brain become scrambled and there are sometimes sudden bursts of electrical activity. This is what causes seizures.\n\n【32】In most cases, it's not clear why this happens. It's possible it could be partly caused by your genes affecting how your brain works, as around 1 in 3 people with epilepsy have a family member with it.\n\n【33】Occasionally, epilepsy can be caused by damage to the brain, such as damage from:\n\n【34】*   a stroke\n*   a brain tumour\n*   a severe head injury\n*   drug abuse or alcohol misuse\n*   a brain infection\n*   a lack of oxygen during birth\n\n【35】Page last reviewed: 18 September 2020  \nNext review due: 18 September 2023\n\n【36】*   Next : Symptoms", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

If it happens suddenly, it can be serious and need treatment as soon as possible.**\n\n【2】Check if you have compartment syndrome\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】You can get compartment syndrome in any muscle, but it most often affects the muscles in the lower legs and forearms.\n\n【4】Symptoms include:\n\n【5】*   pain in a muscle – this may feel like a burning pain or a deep ache (moving the body part can make the pain even worse)\n*   swelling or bulging of the muscle\n*   numbness, weakness or pins and needles\n*   tightness or difficulty moving the affected body part\n\n【6】The symptoms can start suddenly, such as after an injury or if a bandage or plaster cast is too tight. This is called acute compartment syndrome.\n\n【7】Symptoms can also come on gradually after exercising and go away when you rest. This is called chronic compartment syndrome.\n\n【8】Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】*   you have sudden, severe pain in any part of your body\n\n【10】If compartment syndrome is causing the pain, you’ll need surgery to treat it as soon as possible.\n\n【11】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【12】What we mean by severe pain\n\n【13】Severe pain:\n\n【14】*   always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk\n*   you cannot sleep\n*   it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress\n\n【15】Moderate pain:\n\n【16】*   always there\n*   makes it hard to concentrate or sleep\n*   you can manage to get up, wash or dress\n\n【17】Mild pain:\n\n【18】*   comes and goes\n*   is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities\n\n【19】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【20】*   you keep getting pain, numbness, swelling, or have difficulty moving a part of your body when you exercise\n\n【21】A GP can help find out if the pain is caused by compartment syndrome or another condition.\n\n【22】Tests for compartment syndrome\n------------------------------\n\n【23】If the GP thinks you may have compartment syndrome, you may be referred to a specialist for tests.\n\n【24】Tests you may have include:\n\n【25】*   an X-ray to check if you’ve broken a bone\n*   MRI scans while you’re resting and while you’re exercising\n*   compartment pressure measurement – a needle connected to a pressure monitoring device is inserted into your muscle before and after exercise to measure the pressure inside it\n\n【26】Measuring the pressure inside a muscle is usually only recommended if your symptoms and other test results suggest compartment syndrome.\n\n【27】Treatments for compartment syndrome\n-----------------------------------\n\n【28】Treatment for compartment syndrome depends on whether it happens suddenly or comes on gradually.\n\n【29】### Sudden (acute) compartment syndrome\n\n【30】If compartment syndrome happens suddenly, you’ll need surgery as soon as possible to relieve the pressure in the muscle.\n\n【31】This type of surgery is called a fasciotomy. During a fasciotomy, the surgeon makes cuts around the muscle to relieve the pressure.\n\n【32】Sometimes, skin may need to be removed from another part of the body and used to cover the wound. This is known as a skin graft.\n\n【33】After the operation, you’ll have medicine to help ease any pain. You may also need physiotherapy to help regain full movement in the affected part of your body.\n\n【34】### Gradual (chronic) compartment syndrome\n\n【35】Treatment is often not needed for compartment syndrome that develops gradually.\n\n【36】To help relieve your symptoms you can:\n\n【37】*   avoid the activity that caused them – if you run, switching to a low-impact exercise, such as cycling, may help\n*   use anti-inflammatory painkillers to reduce the pain and discomfort\n*   have physiotherapy\n*   use inserts (orthotics) in your shoes if you start running again\n\n【38】If your symptoms do not improve after trying these things, surgery may be an option. The operation is similar to the one used to treat acute compartment syndrome.\n\n【39】Page last reviewed: 09 February 2023  \nNext review due: 09 February 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Living with\n6.  Complications\n\n【3】**Treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on how severe the condition is and how often your symptoms flare-up.**\n\n【4】The main aims of treatment are to:\n\n【5】*   reduce symptoms, known as inducing remission (a period without symptoms)\n*   maintain remission\n\n【6】This usually involves taking various types of medicine, although surgery may sometimes be an option.\n\n【7】Your treatment will normally be provided by a range of healthcare professionals, including:\n\n【8】*   specialist doctors, such as gastroenterologists or surgeons\n*   GPs\n*   specialist nurses\n\n【9】Your care will often be co-ordinated by your specialist nurse and your care team, and they'll usually be your main point of contact if you need help and advice.\n\n【10】Aminosalicylates\n----------------\n\n【11】Aminosalicylates, also known as 5-ASAs, are medicines that help to reduce inflammation. This in turn allows damaged tissue to heal.\n\n【12】They're usually the first treatment option for mild or moderate ulcerative colitis.\n\n【13】5-ASAs can be used as a short-term treatment for flare-ups. They can also be taken long term, usually for the rest of your life, to maintain remission.\n\n【14】5-ASAs can be taken:\n\n【15】*   orally – by swallowing a tablet or capsule\n*   as a suppository – a capsule that you insert into your bottom (rectum), where it dissolves\n*   through an enema – where fluid is pumped into your large intestine\n\n【16】How you take 5-ASAs depends on the severity and extent of your condition.\n\n【17】If you have mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, you'll usually be offered a 5-ASA to take in suppository or enema form.\n\n【18】If your symptoms do not improve after 4 weeks, you may be advised to take 5-ASA in tablet or capsule form as well.\n\n【19】These medicines rarely have side effects, but some people may experience:\n\n【20】*   headaches\n*   feeling sick\n*   tummy pain\n*   a rash\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【21】Corticosteroids\n---------------\n\n【22】Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are an alternative type of medicine used to reduce inflammation.\n\n【23】They can be used with or instead of 5-ASAs to treat a flare-up if 5-ASAs alone are not effective.\n\n【24】Like 5-ASAs, steroids can be administered orally, or through a suppository or enema.\n\n【25】But unlike 5-ASAs, corticosteroids are not used as a long-term treatment to maintain remission because they can cause potentially serious side effects, such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) and cloudy patches in the lens of the eye (cataracts), when used for a long time.\n\n【26】Side effects of short-term steroid use can include:\n\n【27】*   acne\n*   weight gain\n*   increased appetite\n*   mood changes, such as becoming more irritable\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n\n【28】Find out more about the side effects of corticosteroids\n\n【29】Immunosuppressants\n------------------\n\n【30】Immunosuppressants, such as tacrolimus and azathioprine, are medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system.\n\n【31】They're usually given as tablets to treat mild or moderate flare-ups, or maintain remission if your symptoms have not responded to other medicines.\n\n【32】Immunosuppressants can be very effective in treating ulcerative colitis, but they may take a while to start working.\n\n【33】The medicines can make you more vulnerable to infection, so it's important to report any signs of infection, such as a high temperature or sickness, promptly to a GP.\n\n【34】They can also lower the production of red blood cells, making you prone to anaemia.\n\n【35】You'll need regular blood tests to monitor your blood cell levels and check for any other problems.\n\n【36】Treating severe flare-ups\n-------------------------\n\n【37】While mild or moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home, more severe flare-ups should be managed in hospital to minimise the risk of dehydration and potentially fatal complications, such as your colon rupturing.\n\n【38】In hospital, you'll be given medicine and sometimes fluids directly into a vein (intravenously).\n\n【39】The medicines you have may be a type of corticosteroid or an immunosuppressant medicine called infliximab or ciclosporin.\n\n【40】### Ciclosporin\n\n【41】Ciclosporin is given slowly through a drip in your arm (an infusion) and treatment will usually be continuous, for around 7 days.\n\n【42】Side effects of intravenous ciclosporin can include:\n\n【43】*   an uncontrollable shaking or trembling of part of the body (a tremor)\n*   excessive hair growth\n*   extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n*   swollen gums\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【44】Ciclosporin can also cause high blood pressure and reduced kidney and liver function, but you'll be monitored regularly during treatment to check for signs of these.\n\n【45】### Biologic medicines\n\n【46】Biologic medicines are medicines that reduce inflammation of the intestine by targeting proteins the immune system uses to stimulate inflammation.\n\n【47】These medicines block these receptors and reduce inflammation.\n\n【48】They may be used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis if other options are not suitable or not working.\n\n【49】Biologic medicines are given in hospital as an infusion through a drip in your arm every 4 to 12 weeks, or as an injection every 1 to 4 weeks.\n\n【50】Your treatment team will then see how you respond to treatment. If your symptoms are under control (remission) for a year or more, they may recommend treatment is stopped.\n\n【51】Biologic medicines affect your immune system and can increase your risk of getting infections. Talk to a GP if you have any symptoms of a possible infection, such as coughs, a high temperature or a sore throat.\n\n【52】Find out more about biologic medicines from Crohn's & Colitis UK\n\n【53】### JAK inhibitors\n\n【54】There are now new types of medicines called JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib and filgotinib, that can be used to treat ulcerative colitis.\n\n【55】These work by blocking enzymes (proteins) that the immune system uses to trigger inflammation.\n\n【56】JAK inhibitors can be taken as tablets.\n\n【57】JAK inhibitors may be recommended for people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis if standard treatments or biologics have not worked, or are not suitable.\n\n【58】JAK inhibitors are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Women should use reliable contraception when taking them, for at least 4 weeks after finishing the course.\n\n【59】### Ozanimod\n\n【60】A medicine called ozanimod may be recommended for people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis if standard treatments or biologic medicines have not worked or are not suitable.\n\n【61】It comes as tablets that you take once a day. You'll usually take it long term. You'll have regular checks with your treatment team to see if it's working well for you.\n\n【62】Ozanimod affects your immune system and can increase your risk of getting infections. Talk to a GP if you have any symptoms of a possible infection, such as coughs, a high temperature or a sore throat.\n\n【63】Find out more about ozanimod from Crohn's & Colitis UK\n\n【64】Surgery\n-------\n\n【65】If you have frequent flare-ups that have a significant effect on your quality of life, or you have a particularly severe flare-up that's not responding to medicines, surgery may be an option.\n\n【66】Surgery for ulcerative colitis involves permanently removing the colon (a colectomy).\n\n【67】Once your colon is removed, your small intestine will be used to pass waste products out of your body instead of your colon.\n\n【68】This can be achieved by creating:\n\n【69】*   an ileostomy – where the small intestine is diverted out of a hole made in your tummy; special bags are placed over this opening to collect waste materials after the operation\n*   an ileoanal pouch (also known as a J-pouch) – where part of the small intestine is used to create an internal pouch that's then connected to your anus, allowing you to poo normally\n\n【70】As the colon is removed, ulcerative colitis cannot come back again after surgery.\n\n【71】But it's important to consider the risks of surgery and the impact of having a permanent ileostomy or ileoanal pouch.\n\n【72】Your healthcare team will discuss the best option with you.\n\n【73】Find out more about ileostomies\n\n【74】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【75】Living with a condition like ulcerative colitis, especially if your symptoms are severe, can be a frustrating and isolating experience.\n\n【76】Talking to others with the condition can provide support and comfort.\n\n【77】Crohn's & Colitis UK provides information on where you can find help and support\n\n【78】Page last reviewed: 01 November 2022  \nNext review due: 01 November 2025\n\n【79】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Living with", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "b0f4cfa4-1342-4de6-acb5-fd05aa72a0f4", "title": "Patau's syndrome", "text": "【0】Patau's syndrome\n================\n\n【1】**Patau's syndrome is a serious, rare genetic disorder caused by having an additional copy of chromosome 13 in some or all of the body's cells. It's also called trisomy 13.**\n\n【2】Each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents. \n\n【3】But a baby with Patau's syndrome has 3 copies of chromosome 13, instead of 2.\n\n【4】This severely disrupts normal development and, in many cases, results in miscarriage, stillbirth or the baby dying shortly after birth.\n\n【5】Babies with Patau's syndrome grow slowly in the womb and have a low birth weight, along with a number of other serious medical problems.\n\n【6】Patau's syndrome affects about 1 in every 4,000 births. The risk of having a baby with the syndrome increases with the mother's age.\n\n【7】More than 9 out of 10 children born with Patau's syndrome die during the first year.\n\n【8】Symptoms and features\n---------------------\n\n【9】Babies with Patau's syndrome can have a wide range of health problems.\n\n【10】Their growth in the womb is often restricted, resulting in a low birth weight, and 8 out of 10 will be born with severe heart defects.\n\n【11】The brain often does not divide into 2 halves. This is known as holoprosencephaly.\n\n【12】When this happens, it can affect facial features and cause defects such as:\n\n【13】*   cleft lip and palate\n*   an abnormally small eye or eyes (microphthalmia)\n*   absence of 1 or both eyes (anophthalmia)\n\n【14】Other abnormalities of the face and head include:\n\n【15】*   smaller than normal head size (microcephaly)\n*   ear malformations and deafness\n\n【16】Patau's syndrome can also cause other problems, such as:\n\n【17】*   an abdominal wall defect where the abdomen does not develop fully in the womb, resulting in the intestines being outside the body, covered only by a membrane – this is known as an exomphalos or omphalocoele\n*   abnormal cysts in the kidneys\n\n【18】There may also be abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) and a rounded bottom to the feet, known as rocker-bottom feet.\n\n【19】Causes of Patau's syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【20】Patau's syndrome happens by chance and is not caused by anything the parents have done.\n\n【21】Most cases do not run in families (they're not inherited). They happen randomly during conception, when the sperm and egg combine and the foetus starts to develop.\n\n【22】There's an error when the cells divide, resulting in an additional copy, or part of a copy, of chromosome 13, which severely affects the baby's development in the womb.\n\n【23】In many cases, the baby dies before reaching full term (miscarriage) or is dead at birth (stillbirth).\n\n【24】In most cases of Patau's syndrome, a baby has a whole extra copy of chromosome number 13 in their body's cells. This is sometimes known as trisomy 13 or simple trisomy 13.\n\n【25】In some cases of Patau's syndrome, genetic material is rearranged between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This is called a chromosomal translocation. Patau's syndrome that arises because of this can be inherited.\n\n【26】Sometimes only some cells have the extra copy of chromosome 13. This is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. Occasionally, only part of 1 chromosome 13 is extra (partial trisomy 13).\n\n【27】The symptoms and features of both mosaicism and partial trisomy tend to be less severe than in simple trisomy 13, resulting in more babies living longer.\n\n【28】Genetic Alliance UK has more information about chromosome disorders\n\n【29】Screening for Patau's syndrome\n------------------------------\n\n【30】You'll be offered a screening test for Patau's syndrome, as well as Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18), from 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【31】The test assesses your chances of having a baby with these syndromes.\n\n【32】The screening test offered at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy is called the combined test because it involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan.\n\n【33】If the screening tests show you have a higher chance of having a baby with Patau's syndrome, you'll be offered a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT).\n\n【34】This is a blood test that can give you a more accurate screening result and help you to decide whether to have a diagnostic test or not. It's available free on the NHS.\n\n【35】A diagnostic test will check the chromosomes in a sample of cells taken from your baby and helps to find out for certain if they have Patau's syndrome.\n\n【36】Two techniques can be used to obtain the cell sample: amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). \n\n【37】These are invasive tests to remove a sample of tissue or fluid so it can be tested for the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 13.\n\n【38】If you're not able to have the combined screening test, you'll be offered a scan that looks for physical abnormalities, including those found in Patau's syndrome.\n\n【39】This is sometimes called the mid-pregnancy scan and is carried out when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant.\n\n【40】Find out more about screening tests for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome\n\n【41】Treating and managing Patau's syndrome\n--------------------------------------\n\n【42】There's no specific treatment for Patau's syndrome. As a result of the severe health problems a newborn baby with the syndrome will have, doctors usually focus on minimising discomfort and ensuring the baby is able to feed.\n\n【43】For the small number of babies with Patau's syndrome who survive beyond the first few days of life, their care will depend on their specific symptoms and needs.\n\n【44】If your baby is diagnosed with Patau's syndrome, either before birth or shortly afterwards, you'll be offered counselling and support.\n\n【45】Genetic testing for parents\n---------------------------\n\n【46】Both parents will need to have their chromosomes analysed if their baby is affected by Patau's syndrome caused by a chromosomal translocation.\n\n【47】Genetic testing is carried out to help parents plan for future pregnancies, rather than as part of the decision-making process for the current pregnancy.\n\n【48】The test results will allow a more accurate assessment to be made of the likelihood of the syndrome affecting future pregnancies.\n\n【49】Other family members may also be affected and should be tested.\n\n【50】Find out more about genetic and genomic testing\n\n【51】### Information about your child\n\n【52】If your child has Patau's syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【53】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n\n【54】Find out more about the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service on GOV.UK\n\n【55】Further information and support\n-------------------------------\n\n【56】These organisations are useful further sources of information about Patau's syndrome.\n\n【57】They can also provide advice and support:\n\n【58】*   Contact\n*   Genetic Alliance UK\n*   Support Organisation for Trisomy 13/18 (SOFT UK)\n\n【59】Page last reviewed: 18 July 2023  \nNext review due: 18 July 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Recovery\n7.  Complications\n8.  Prevention\n\n【3】**If a heart attack is suspected, you should be admitted to hospital immediately. You will usually be admitted to an acute cardiac care unit (ACCU), or directly to the cardiac catheterisation unit, to confirm the diagnosis and begin treatment.**\n\n【4】Electrocardiogram\n-----------------\n\n【5】An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important test in suspected heart attacks. It should be done within 10 minutes of being admitted to hospital.\n\n【6】An ECG measures the electrical activity of your heart. Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical impulses. An ECG machine records these signals onto paper, allowing your doctor to see how well your heart is functioning.\n\n【7】An ECG is painless and takes about 5 minutes to do. During the test, flat metal discs (electrodes) are attached to your arms, legs and chest. Wires from the electrodes are connected to the ECG machine, which records the electrical impulses.\n\n【8】An ECG is important because:\n\n【9】*   it helps confirm the diagnosis of a heart attack\n*   it helps determine what type of heart attack you have had, which will help determine the most effective treatment\n\n【10】**Blood tests**\n---------------\n\n【11】Damage to your heart from a heart attack causes certain proteins to slowly leak into your blood.\n\n【12】If doctors suspect you have had a heart attack, a sample of your blood will be taken so it can be tested for these heart proteins (known as cardiac markers).\n\n【13】The most common protein measurement is called cardiac troponin. Your troponin level can help in diagnosing the type of heart attack you've had.\n\n【14】Types of heart attack\n---------------------\n\n【15】Heart attacks can be classified by a measurement from an ECG known as the ST segment, and the level of heart protein (troponin) in the blood.\n\n【16】### Acute coronary syndrome\n\n【17】A heart attack is a form of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), where there is a significant blockage in the coronary arteries.\n\n【18】The 3 main types of ACS include:\n\n【19】*   ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n*   non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n*   unstable angina\n\n【20】### ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\n\n【21】A STEMI is a type of heart attack where there is a long interruption to the blood supply. This can cause extensive damage to the heart. It's diagnosed when specific changes show on an ECG.\n\n【22】It needs urgent treatment to unblock the artery.\n\n【23】### Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)\n\n【24】An NSTEMI is another type of heart attack where there is some loss of blood supply, causing damage.\n\n【25】It's diagnosed when an ECG does not show the type of changes seen in a STEMI, but blood tests show that the heart is damaged.\n\n【26】An NSTEMI is a medical emergency. Without treatment, it can progress to a STEMI.\n\n【27】### Unstable angina\n\n【28】In unstable angina, you have symptoms of a heart attack but tests do not show damage to the heart.\n\n【29】The blood supply to the heart is still seriously restricted, and you are at high risk of a heart attack.\n\n【30】Other tests\n-----------\n\n【31】Other tests can be used to assess the state of your heart and check for related complications. However, because heart attacks are medical emergencies, some of these tests are usually done after your initial treatment has begun and your condition has been stabilised.\n\n【32】### Chest X-ray\n\n【33】A chest X-ray can be useful if diagnosis of a heart attack is uncertain and there are other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a pocket of air trapped between the layers of your lungs (pneumothorax).\n\n【34】A chest X-ray can also be used to check whether complications have happened because of the heart attack, such as a build-up of fluid inside your lungs (pulmonary oedema).\n\n【35】### Echocardiogram\n\n【36】An echocardiogram is a type of scan that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your heart.\n\n【37】This can be useful to identify exactly which areas of the heart have been damaged and how this damage has affected your heart's function.\n\n【38】### Coronary angiography\n\n【39】Coronary angiography can help determine whether there is a blockage or narrowing in the coronary arteries and, if so, to locate the exact place of the blockage or narrowing.\n\n【40】The test involves inserting a thin tube (catheter), into one of the blood vessels in your groin or arm. The catheter is guided into your coronary arteries using X-rays.\n\n【41】A special fluid, called a contrast agent, is pumped through the catheter. This fluid can be seen on X-rays and studying how it flows around and through your heart can help locate the site of any blockage or narrowing. This helps a doctor who specialises in heart conditions (cardiologist) decide the best treatment for you.\n\n【42】Find out more about treating a heart attack.\n\n【43】Page last reviewed: 13 July 2023  \nNext review due: 13 July 2026\n\n【44】*   Previous : Causes\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

However, do not regularly use super-size tampons to prevent sudden leaks if you have stress incontinence.\n\n【14】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend using tampons for the routine management of urinary incontinence in women.\n\n【15】However, tampons can be used occasionally, when necessary, to prevent leaks. For example, during exercise.\n\n【16】Appliances and bedding\n----------------------\n\n【17】Other useful incontinence products for more severe leaks include urinals (devices that collect urine), or sheaths and drainage systems (if you have a penis).\n\n【18】A variety of incontinence bedding is also available, such as washable bed pads that sit on top of the mattress and soak up any overnight leaks. The pads stay dry to the touch and they can be useful for trips away from home.\n\n【19】Can I get incontinence products on the NHS?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【20】You may be able to get incontinence products on the NHS depending on your local integrated care board (ICB). Ask your GP for details of your local continence service. To qualify for NHS products you may need to be assessed by a healthcare professional.\n\n【21】Where to buy incontinence products\n----------------------------------\n\n【22】The charity Bladder & Bowel UK gives independent advice on products that can help manage bladder and bowel problems.\n\n【23】For more information on products and how to order them, call its helpline on 0161 214 4591 or visit the Bladder & Bowel UK website.\n\n【24】The Continence Product Advisor gives independent and evidence-based advice on how to choose and use suitable incontinence products.\n\n【25】Page last reviewed: 15 June 2023  \nNext review due: 15 June 2026\n\n【26】*   Previous : Surgery and procedures\n*   Next : 10 ways to stop leaks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "b0b0370d-de3a-497c-bcd6-f16211fe4884", "title": "Pain relief in labour", "text": "【0】Pain relief in labour\n=====================\n\n【1】Your pain relief options\n------------------------\n\n【2】Labour can be painful – it can help to learn about all the ways you can relieve the pain.\n\n【3】It's also helpful for whoever is going to be with you during your labour to know about the different options, as well as how they can support you. \n\n【4】Ask your midwife or doctor to explain what's available so you can decide what's best for you.\n\n【5】Write down your wishes in your birth plan, but remember you need to keep an open mind. You may find you want more pain relief than you'd planned, or your doctor or midwife may suggest more effective pain relief to help the delivery.\n\n【6】Self-help in labour\n-------------------\n\n【7】You're likely to feel more relaxed in labour and better placed to cope with the pain if you: \n\n【8】*   learn about labour – this can make you feel more in control and less frightened about what's going to happen; talk to your midwife or doctor, ask them questions, and go to antenatal classes\n*   learn how to relax, stay calm and breathe deeply\n*   keep moving – your position can make a difference, so try kneeling, walking around, or rocking backwards and forwards\n*   bring a partner, friend or relative to support you during labour, but do not worry if you do not have a partner – your midwife will give you all the support you need\n*   ask your partner to massage you – although you may find you do not want to be touched\n*   have a bath\n*   take paracetamol, which can help relieve some of the pain in the early stages of labour\n\n【9】Gas and air (Entonox) for labour\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】This is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas. Gas and air will not remove all the pain, but it can help reduce it and make it more bearable. It's easy to use and you control it yourself.\n\n【11】You breathe in the gas and air through a mask or mouthpiece, which you hold yourself. The gas takes about 15 to 20 seconds to work, so you breathe it in just as a contraction begins. It works best if you take slow, deep breaths.\n\n【12】### Side effects\n\n【13】*   there are no harmful side effects for you or the baby\n*   it can make you feel lightheaded, sick, sleepy or unable to concentrate, but if this happens you can stop using it\n\n【14】If gas and air does not give you enough pain relief, you can ask for a painkilling injection as well.\n\n【15】Pethidine injections in labour\n------------------------------\n\n【16】This is an injection of a medicine called pethidine into your thigh or buttock to relieve pain. It can also help you to relax. Sometimes, less commonly, a medicine called diamorphine is used.\n\n【17】It takes about 20 minutes to work after the injection. The effects last between 2 and 4 hours, so would not be recommended if you're getting close to the pushing (second) stage of labour.\n\n【18】### Side effects\n\n【19】There are some side effects of pethidine and diamorphine to be aware of:\n\n【20】*   it can make you feel woozy, sick and forgetful\n*   if pethidine or diamorphine are given too close to the time of delivery, they may affect the baby's breathing – if this happens, another medicine to reverse the effect will be given\n*   these medicines can interfere with the baby's first feed\n\n【21】Epidural\n--------\n\n【22】An epidural is a type of local anaesthetic. It numbs the nerves that carry the pain impulses from the birth canal to the brain. It should not make you sick or drowsy.\n\n【23】In most cases, an epidural gives complete pain relief. It can be helpful if you are having a long or particularly painful labour.\n\n【24】An anaesthetist is the only person who can give an epidural, so it will not be available at home. If you think you might want one, check whether anaesthetists are always available at your hospital.\n\n【25】How much you can move your legs after an epidural depends on the local anaesthetic used. Some hospitals offer \"mobile\" epidurals, which means you can walk around.\n\n【26】However, this also requires the baby's heart rate to be monitored remotely (by telemetry) and many hospitals do not have the equipment to do this. Ask your midwife if mobile epidural is available in your local hospital.\n\n【27】An epidural can provide very good pain relief, but it's not always completely effective in labour.\n\n【28】### How does an epidural work?\n\n【29】To have an epidural:\n\n【30】*   a drip will run fluid through a needle into a vein in your arm\n*   while you lie on your side or sit up in a curled position, an anaesthetist will clean your back with antiseptic, numb a small area with some local anaesthetic, and then introduce a needle into your back\n*   a very thin tube will be passed through the needle into your back near the nerves that carry pain impulses from the womb (uterus). Medicines (usually a mixture of local anaesthetic and opioid) are administered through this tube. It takes about 10 minutes to set up the epidural, and another 10 to15 minutes for it to work. It does not always work perfectly at first and may need adjusting\n*   the epidural can be topped up by your midwife, or you may be able to top it up yourself through a machine\n*   your contractions and the baby's heart rate will need to be continuously monitored. This means having a belt around your abdomen and possibly a clip attached to the baby's head\n\n【31】### Side effects of epidurals in labour\n\n【32】There are some side effects of epidurals to be aware of.\n\n【33】An epidural may make your legs feel heavy, depending on the local anaesthetic used.\n\n【34】Your blood pressure can drop (hypotension), but this is rare because the fluid given through the drip in your arm helps to maintain good blood pressure.\n\n【35】Epidurals can prolong the second stage of labour. If you can no longer feel your contractions, the midwife will have to tell you when to push. This means that forceps or a ventouse may be needed to help deliver the baby (instrumental delivery).\n\n【36】When you have an epidural, your midwife or doctor will wait longer for the baby's head to come down (before you start pushing), as long as the baby is showing no signs of distress. This reduces the chance you'll need an instrumental delivery. Sometimes less anaesthetic is given towards the end, so the effect wears off and you can feel to push the baby out naturally.\n\n【37】You may find it difficult to pee as a result of the epidural. If so, a small tube called a catheter may be put into your bladder to help you.\n\n【38】You may get a headache after an epidural. This happens in about 1 in 100 cases and can be treated.\n\n【39】Your back might be a bit sore for a day or two, but epidurals do not cause long-term backache.\n\n【40】You may feel tingles or pins and needles down one leg after having a baby. This happens in about 1 in 2,000 cases. This is more likely to be the result of childbirth itself rather than the epidural. You'll be advised by the doctor or midwife when you can get out of bed.\n\n【41】Remifentanil\n------------\n\n【42】Remifentanil goes into a vein in your arm. You control it yourself by pushing a button.\n\n【43】It works quickly and wears off after a few minutes. You can use it up until your baby is born.\n\n【44】You’ll need a small clip on your finger to measure your oxygen levels, as remifentanil can make you feel breathless or need oxygen.\n\n【45】### Side effects\n\n【46】Remifentanil can make you feel sleepy, sick, dizzy or itchy. These stop once you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【47】Like pethidine, remifentanil can affect the baby’s breathing but this usually wears off quickly.\n\n【48】Using water in labour (water birth)\n-----------------------------------\n\n【49】Being in water can help you relax and make the contractions seem less painful. Ask if you can have a bath or use a birth pool. The water will be kept at a comfortable temperature, but not above 37.5C, and your temperature will be monitored.\n\n【50】Find out more about using water during labour and birth on the National Childbirth Trust website\n\n【51】TENS machines\n-------------\n\n【52】TENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Some hospitals have TENS machines. If not, you can hire your own machine.\n\n【53】TENS has not been shown to be effective during the active phase of labour, when contractions get longer, stronger and more frequent. It's probably most effective during the early stages, when you may have lower back pain.\n\n【54】TENS may also be useful while you're at home in the early stages of labour or if you plan to give birth at home. If you're interested in TENS, learn how to use it in the later months of your pregnancy. Ask your midwife to show you how it works.\n\n【55】### How TENS machines work\n\n【56】Electrodes are taped on to your back and connected by wires to a small battery-powered stimulator. Holding this, you give yourself small, safe amounts of current through the electrodes. You can move around while you use TENS.  \n\n【57】TENS is believed to work by stimulating the body to produce more of its own natural painkillers, called endorphins. It also reduces the number of pain signals sent to the brain by the spinal cord.\n\n【58】### Side effects of TENS machines\n\n【59】There are no known side effects of TENS for either you or the baby.\n\n【60】Read more about TENS\n\n【61】Alternative methods of labour pain relief\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【62】You may choose alternative treatments such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, hypnosis, massage and reflexology. Most of these techniques are not proven to provide effective pain relief.\n\n【63】If you'd like to use any of these methods, it's important to discuss them with your midwife or doctor and let the hospital know beforehand. Most hospitals do not offer them for pain relief during labour.\n\n【64】If you want to try any of these techniques, make sure the practitioner is properly trained and experienced. \n\n【65】Learn more about complementary and alternative medicines and how they're regulated\n\n【66】Find maternity services near you\n\n【67】More in What happens in labour and birth\n----------------------------------------\n\n【68】*   The stages of labour and birth\n*   Tips for your birth partner\n*   Giving birth to twins or more\n*   Pain relief in labour\n*   Episiotomy and perineal tears\n*   Forceps or vacuum delivery\n*   What happens if your baby is breech?\n*   What complications can affect the placenta?\n\n【69】Page last reviewed: 13 March 2023  \nNext review due: 13 March 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But many people have no side effects, or only minor ones.\n\n【2】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【3】The most common side effect of sitagliptin, which happens in more than 1 in 100 people, is headaches.\n\n【4】Talk to your doctor if headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【5】If taking sitagliptin gives you a headache, make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol.\n\n【6】Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller.\n\n【7】Low blood sugar\n---------------\n\n【8】Sitagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or \"hypos\") when taken on its own.\n\n【9】But hypos can happen when you take sitagliptin with other diabetes medicines, such as insulin or gliclazide.\n\n【10】Early warning signs of low blood sugar include:\n\n【11】*   feeling hungry\n*   trembling or shaking\n*   sweating\n*   confusion\n*   difficulty concentrating\n\n【12】It's also possible for your blood sugar to go too low while you're asleep. If this happens, it can make you feel sweaty, tired and confused when you wake up.\n\n【13】Low blood sugar may happen if you:\n\n【14】*   take too much of some types of diabetes medicines\n*   eat meals irregularly or skip meals\n*   are fasting\n*   do not eat a healthy diet and are not getting enough nutrients\n*   change what you eat\n*   increase your physical activity without eating more to compensate\n*   drink alcohol, especially after skipping a meal\n*   take some other medicines or herbal remedies at the same time\n*   have a hormone disorder, such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n*   have kidney or liver problems\n\n【15】It's important to have regular meals, including breakfast, to prevent hypoglycaemia. Never miss or delay a meal.\n\n【16】If you're planning to exercise more than usual, make sure you eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or cereals before, during or after exercise.\n\n【17】Always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners will not help.\n\n【18】You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.\n\n【19】If taking in sugar does not help or the hypo symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.\n\n【20】Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar levels so they can recognise a hypo if it happens.\n\n【21】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【22】It happens rarely, but some people may have serious side effects after taking sitagliptin.\n\n【23】Call your doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【24】*   you get severe stomach pains – this may be a sign of pancreatitis\n*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, or your skin turns yellow although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – this can be a sign of liver problems\n\n【25】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【26】It's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to sitagliptin.\n\n【27】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【28】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【29】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【30】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【31】**Other side effects**\n----------------------\n\n【32】These are not all the side effects of sitagliptin.

It's used to treat menopause symptoms.\n\n【2】Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. It affects anyone who has periods.\n\n【3】As you reach the menopause your ovaries gradually begin to produce less oestrogen and progestogen. This can cause symptoms such as hot flushes, mood swings and vaginal dryness.\n\n【4】Taking HRT can help these symptoms and help prevent other conditions such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), which is common after the menopause.\n\n【5】A doctor will usually recommend sequential combined HRT if you have menopause symptoms but you're still having periods, or your last period was less than 12 months ago.\n\n【6】Sequential combined HRT involves taking oestrogen every day and taking progestogen for 10 to 14 days of each 28-day cycle. You'll usually have withdrawal bleeding at the end of each course of progestogen.\n\n【7】This is different to continuous combined HRT, where you take both oestrogen and progestogen every day with no monthly bleeding. Continuous combined HRT is usually prescribed after you have not had a period for 1 year or more.\n\n【8】You'll need to take combined HRT if you still have a womb. This is because taking oestrogen on its own can thicken the womb lining, which slightly increases the risk of womb cancer. Taking progestogen together with oestrogen reduces the risk.\n\n【9】Sequential combined HRT is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or skin patches.\n\n【10】Brands include Elleste Duet, Clinorette, Femoston, Novofem, Tridesta and Trisequens tablets, and Evorel Sequi and FemSeven Sequi patches.\n\n【11】### Important: HRT shortages\n\n【12】Currently there are supply shortages of some types of HRT. If the medicine you've been prescribed is not available, a pharmacist or doctor will be able to advise you about using a different brand or type of HRT that is suitable for you.\n\n【13】Key facts\n---------\n\n【14】*   Your medicine will contain 2 or 3 different types of tablet or patch. You'll take the oestrogen part of your medicine every day and take your progestogen for 10 to 14 days of each 28-day cycle.\n*   HRT can take up to 3 months to work fully to improve your symptoms.\n*   Common side effects include headaches, breast tenderness, feeling sick and irregular vaginal bleeding, but these usually improve in the first few months of starting treatment.\n*   If you feel that the HRT you're taking is not helping your symptoms, talk to a doctor. It can take time to find the right type and dose to suit you.\n*   It's common to take sequential combined HRT for 2 to 5 years, and then try stopping to see if your menopause symptoms have improved. Your doctor may suggest swapping to continuous combined HRT after 1 to 2 years when the risk of irregular bleeding will be reduced.\n*   It's important to see your doctor at least once a year for a check-up and to review whether you need to keep taking HRT.\n\n【15】More in Sequential combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablets and patches\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   About sequential combined HRT\n*   Who can and cannot take or use it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking sequential combined HRT with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【17】Page last reviewed: 18 January 2023  \nNext review due: 18 January 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Spina bifida can cause a wide range of symptoms, including problems with movement, bladder and bowel problems, and problems associated with** **hydrocephalus** **(excess fluid on the brain).**\n\n【4】The severity of the symptoms of spina bifida varies considerably, largely depending on the location of the gap in the spine.\n\n【5】A gap higher up the spine is more likely to cause paralysis of the legs and mobility difficulties compared with gaps in the middle or at the base of the spine, which may only cause continence issues.\n\n【6】A baby is more likely to have learning difficulties if they develop hydrocephalus.\n\n【7】Movement problems\n-----------------\n\n【8】The brain controls all the muscles in the body with the nerves that run through the spinal cord. Any damage to the nerves can cause problems controlling the muscles.\n\n【9】Most children with spina bifida have some degree of weakness or paralysis in their lower limbs. They may need to use ankle supports or crutches to help them move around. If they have severe paralysis, they'll need a wheelchair.\n\n【10】Paralysis can also cause other, associated problems. For example, as the muscles in the legs are not being used regularly, they can become very weak.\n\n【11】The muscles support the bones so muscle weakness can affect bone development. This can cause dislocated or deformed joints, bone fractures, misshapen bones and an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis).\n\n【12】Bladder problems\n----------------\n\n【13】Many people with spina bifida have problems storing and passing pee. This is caused by the nerves that control the bladder not forming properly. It can lead to problems such as:\n\n【14】*   urinary incontinence\n*   urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n*   hydronephrosis – where one or both kidneys become stretched and swollen due to a build-up of pee inside them\n*   kidney scarring\n*   kidney stones\n\n【15】The bladder and kidneys will need to be regularly monitored because of the risk of infection. Ultrasound scans may be needed, as well as tests to measure the bladder's volume and the pressure inside it.\n\n【16】Bowel problems\n--------------\n\n【17】The nerves that run through the spinal cord also control the bowel and the sphincter muscles that keep poo in the bowel.\n\n【18】Many people with spina bifida have limited or no control over their sphincter muscles and have bowel incontinence.\n\n【19】Bowel incontinence often leads to periods of constipation followed by episodes of diarrhoea or soiling.\n\n【20】Hydrocephalus\n-------------\n\n【21】Some babies with spina bifida have hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain), which can damage the brain and cause further problems.\n\n【22】Many people with spina bifida and hydrocephalus will have normal intelligence, although some will have learning difficulties, such as:\n\n【23】*   a short attention span\n*   difficulty solving problems\n*   difficulty reading\n*   difficulty understanding some spoken language – particularly fast conversations between a group of people\n*   difficulty organising activities or making detailed plans\n\n【24】They may also have problems with visual and physical co-ordination – for example, tasks such as tying shoelaces or fastening buttons.\n\n【25】In some babies the lower parts of the brain are pushed downwards towards the spinal cord. This is known as type 2 Arnold-Chiari malformation and is linked to hydrocephalus.\n\n【26】Hydrocephalus can cause additional symptoms soon after birth, such as irritability, seizures, drowsiness, being sick and poor feeding.\n\n【27】Read more about the symptoms of hydrocephalus.\n\n【28】Other problems\n--------------\n\n【29】Other problems associated with spina bifida include: \n\n【30】*   skin problems – reduced sensation can make it difficult to tell when the skin on the legs has been damaged – for example, if the skin gets burnt on a radiator; if a person with spina bifida injures their legs without realising, the skin could become infected or an ulcer could develop; it's important to check the skin regularly for signs of injury\n*   latex allergy – people with spina bifida can develop an allergy to latex; symptoms can range from a mild allergic reaction – watery eyes and skin rashes – to a severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylactic shock, which requires an immediate injection of adrenalin; tell medical staff if you or your child is allergic to latex\n\n【31】Page last reviewed: 20 April 2020  \nNext review due: 20 April 2023\n\n【32】*   Previous : Spina bifida\n*   Next : Causes", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "642ec99b-1d9d-49c9-a162-7a9dbaffb645", "title": "Buprenorphine for pain", "text": "【0】Common questions about buprenorphine \\- Brand names: Butec, Buvidal, Espranor, Suboxone, Subutex\n================================================================================================\n\n【1】How does buprenorphine work?\n\n【2】Buprenorphine is from a group of medicines called opioids or narcotics.\n\n【3】It works in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. It also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】This depends on the type of buprenorphine you take.\n\n【6】A buprenorphine injection into a vein gives the quickest pain relief. It works almost straight away and is usually only given in hospital.\n\n【7】Buprenorphine tablets take about 1 to 2 hours to work.\n\n【8】Buprenorphine patches can take up to a day or 2 to start working but they'll last longer. Patches are usually given after buprenorphine tablets or another opioid such as morphine liquid. This is to make sure that you have pain relief until the patches start to work.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Some people with conditions that need long-term pain relief may need to take buprenorphine for a long time.\n\n【11】If you need to take it for a long time your body can become used to it (known as tolerance). That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【12】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【13】It's possible to become addicted to buprenorphine. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only having the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【14】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop buprenorphine.\n\n【15】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【16】How will I know if I'm addicted?\n\n【17】If you're addicted to buprenorphine you may find it difficult to stop using it, or feel you want to use it more often than you need to.\n\n【18】If you stop taking buprenorphine suddenly you may get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【19】These can include:\n\n【20】*   feeling agitated or anxious\n*   panic attacks\n*   feeling your heart beat (palpitations)\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   shaking\n*   sweating\n*   body aches\n*   feeling restless\n\n【21】Talk to your doctor if you:\n\n【22】*   are worried about addiction\n*   need help with addiction\n*   want to stop taking buprenorphine\n\n【23】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【24】If you need to take or use buprenorphine for a long time, your body can become used to it.\n\n【25】This is not usually a problem. However, you could get withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly.\n\n【26】If you want to stop taking or using buprenorphine, talk to your doctor first. Your dose can be reduced gradually so you do not get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【27】If you stop having buprenorphine suddenly it can make you:\n\n【28】*   feel agitated\n*   feel anxious\n*   shaky\n*   sweat a lot\n\n【29】### Important\n\n【30】If you've been taking or using buprenorphine for more than a few weeks, do not stop taking it without speaking to your doctor first.\n\n【31】How does buprenorphine compare with other opioids?\n\n【32】Buprenorphine acts on different pain signals in the brain to some other opioids, such as codeine, morphine and tramadol.\n\n【33】The pain relief and side effects from buprenorphine will be different for everyone. Your doctor may prescribe buprenorphine if you've had side effects from other opioids.\n\n【34】The way you take buprenorphine is different to some other painkillers. Buprenorphine is not absorbed very well by swallowing tablets. Instead, your body absorbs it through your skin or mouth.\n\n【35】Some people find skin patches more convenient than taking tablets or capsules regularly.\n\n【36】What do I do with used buprenorphine patches?\n\n【37】Fold the buprenorphine patch in half so that the sticky sides stick to each other. Then either put the patch back in the packet it came in or, if you're replacing it with a new patch, you could put your used patch in the empty packet from the new patch.\n\n【38】Return any used or unused patches to your pharmacist who will destroy them safely.\n\n【39】Patches can accidentally stick to another person.\n\n【40】### Urgent advice: Call your doctor or call 111 now if:\n\n【41】*   a buprenorphine patch sticks to someone it has not been prescribed for\n\n【42】If this happens, remove the patch straight away.\n\n【43】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【44】Buprenorphine does not affect any type of contraception including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【45】However, if buprenorphine makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【46】Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.\n\n【47】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【48】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if buprenorphine makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【49】This may be more likely when you first start using buprenorphine but could happen at any time, for example when starting another medicine.\n\n【50】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【51】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much buprenorphine is in your body.\n\n【52】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while using buprenorphine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【53】Can I drink alcohol while using or taking buprenorphine?\n\n【54】It's best not to drink alcohol when you first start taking or using buprenorphine until you see how it affects you.\n\n【55】Drinking alcohol while using buprenorphine can make you more sleepy and increases the risk of side effects.\n\n【56】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【57】Buprenorphine is not generally affected by food or drink so you can eat normally. It's best not to drink alcohol when you first start taking or using buprenorphine until you see how it affects you.\n\n【58】Check the information leaflet that came with your tablets to see whether you need to avoid food at the same time as taking your tablets.\n\n【59】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【60】If you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine or heroin, while you're taking buprenorphine, you're more likely to get serious side effects. These include breathing difficulties, heart problems such as high blood pressure, seizures or fits and even going into a coma.\n\n【61】Some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, will also increase the risk of side effects from buprenorphine – it may make you feel very sleepy or dizzy.\n\n【62】Taking heroin while you're on buprenorphine is especially dangerous. You're more likely to get all the side effects of buprenorphine.\n\n【63】Tell your doctor if you think you may take recreational drugs while you're on buprenorphine.\n\n【64】You can find out about the side effects of recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【65】More in Buprenorphine for pain\n------------------------------\n\n【66】*   About buprenorphine for pain\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【67】Page last reviewed: 23 May 2023  \nNext review due: 23 May 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The GP will examine your legs while you're standing to check for signs of swelling.\n\n【10】You may also be asked to describe any pain you have and whether there are situations that make your varicose veins worse.\n\n【11】For example, some women find their menstrual cycle (period) affects their varicose veins.\n\n【12】The GP will also want to know if you're at an increased risk of developing varicose veins, such as:\n\n【13】*   having a family history of varicose veins\n*   being pregnant\n*   whether you have a healthy body mass index (BMI)\n*   having deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body)\n*   a history of leg injury (for example, having previously broken a bone in your leg)\n\n【14】Further investigation\n---------------------\n\n【15】The GP may refer you to a vascular specialist (a doctor who specialises in veins) if you have any of the following:\n\n【16】*   varicose veins that are causing pain, aching, discomfort, swelling, heaviness or itching\n*   changes in the colour of the skin on your leg that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   skin conditions affecting your leg, such as eczema, that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   hard and painful varicose veins that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   a healed or unhealed leg ulcer (a break in the skin that has not healed within 2 weeks) below the knee\n\n【17】In most cases, a test called a duplex ultrasound scan will be carried out. This is a type of scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce a picture of the veins in your legs.\n\n【18】The picture shows the blood flow and helps the vascular specialist locate any damaged valves that might be causing your varicose veins.\n\n【19】Page last reviewed: 07 May 2020  \nNext review due: 07 May 2023\n\n【20】*   Previous : Causes\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Speak to your health visitor for advice and support.\n\n【15】Health visitors and doctors will usually advise you to:\n\n【16】*   hold or cuddle your baby when they're crying a lot\n*   sit or hold your baby upright during feeding to stop them swallowing air\n*   wind your baby after feeds\n*   gently rock your baby over your shoulder\n*   gently rock your baby in their Moses basket or crib, or push them in their pram\n*   bath your baby in a warm bath\n*   have some gentle white noise like the radio or TV in the background to distract them\n*   keep feeding your baby as usual\n\n【17】Other things you may hear about include:\n\n【18】*   anti-colic drops and herbal and probiotic supplements\n*   changes to your diet if you're breastfeeding\n*   applying gentle pressure to your baby's spine (spinal manipulation) or skull (cranial osteopathy)\n\n【19】But there's very little evidence these things work.

It's widely used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It's also used to protect your kidneys if you have both kidney disease and diabetes (diabetic kidney disease).\n\n【2】Losartan can also help to prevent strokes and heart attacks, and is used to improve your survival if you're taking it for heart failure or after a heart attack.\n\n【3】Like other ARBs, losartan relaxes and widens your blood vessels. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【4】Losartan can also be combined with hydrochlorothizide and is called by the brand name Cozaar-Comp.\n\n【5】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets.\n\n【6】Key facts\n---------\n\n【7】*   Losartan is often used as a second-choice treatment. Your doctor might prescribe it if you had to stop taking another medicine to lower your blood pressure because it gave you a dry, irritating cough.\n*   If you have diarrhoea and vomiting from a stomach bug or illness while taking losartan, tell your doctor. You may need to stop taking it until you feel better.\n*   The main side effects of losartan are feeling dizzy and tired, but they're usually mild and do not last long.\n*   Losartan can make you feel dizzy, especially when you first start taking it or after taking a bigger dose. If this happens, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n*   Losartan is not normally recommended in pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant, are already pregnant or you're breastfeeding.\n*   Do not use salt substitutes such as Lo-Salt. This is because they are high in potassium and when mixed with losartan, they may cause potassium levels in your blood to be too high.\n\n【8】More in Losartan\n----------------\n\n【9】*   About losartan\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking losartan with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【10】Page last reviewed: 24 February 2022  \nNext review due: 24 February 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "9080188a-9983-42e4-a020-c2e52bba9731", "title": "Finasteride", "text": "【0】Common questions about finasteride \\- Brand names: Proscar, Propecia\n====================================================================\n\n【1】How does finasteride work?\n\n【2】Finasteride is a type of medicine called a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.\n\n【3】It works by stopping testosterone (a sex hormone) turning into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT can cause your prostate to grow bigger (benign prostate enlargement). It can also stop your hair growing.\n\n【4】Finasteride stops DHT being produced and this helps shrink your prostate and reduce hair loss.\n\n【5】How long does it take to work?\n\n【6】You may notice an improvement a little while after you start taking finasteride.\n\n【7】However, for an enlarged prostate it can take up to 6 months for this medicine to work fully.\n\n【8】For hair loss, you can expect to see some improvement after 3 to 6 months.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Finasteride is generally safe to take for a long time. Many people take it for many months or even years without any problems.\n\n【11】However, there have been reports of breast cancer in some men taking finasteride, but this is rare. Speak to your doctor if you get any changes in your chest area such as lumps, pain or swelling, or discharge from your nipples.\n\n【12】Some men have reported that sexual side effects (such as not being able to get an erection) continued to bother them even after they stopped taking finasteride.\n\n【13】Talk to your doctor if you're bothered by any of these side effects.\n\n【14】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【15】Finasteride is not thought to stop any type of contraception working. However, this medicine is not usually taken by women.\n\n【16】The manufacturers of finasteride recommend using a condom when having sex because very small amounts of finasteride get into semen, but the actual risk is unlikely to be significant. Most experts agree that this is not necessary.\n\n【17】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【18】Finasteride will not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machinery.\n\n【19】Can I drink alcohol while taking finasteride?\n\n【20】You can drink alcohol with finasteride.\n\n【21】Is there any food or and drink I need to avoid?\n\n【22】You can eat and drink normally when taking finasteride.\n\n【23】Can lifestyle changes help symptoms of an enlarged prostate?\n\n【24】Making some simple changes to your lifestyle can help with symptoms of an enlarged prostate.\n\n【25】*   Drink fewer fizzy drinks and less alcohol, caffeine and artificial sweeteners – they can irritate the bladder and make urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Quit smoking – nicotine can irritate the bladder and make urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Drink less in the evening – try to reduce the amount you drink and avoid drinking anything for 2 hours before bedtime. This might help you avoid getting up in the night. Make sure you're still drinking enough fluids earlier in the day.\n*   Empty your bladder – remember to go to the toilet before long journeys or other situations when you know you may not be able to reach a toilet easily.\n*   Try double voiding – this is when you finish peeing, wait a few moments, then try to go again. This can help you empty your bladder properly (but take care not to strain or push).\n*   Check your medicines – ask a doctor whether any medicines you take, such as antidepressants or decongestants, may be making your urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Eat more fruit and fibre – this can help you avoid constipation. Being constipated can put pressure on the bladder and make your symptoms worse.\n\n【26】More in Finasteride\n-------------------\n\n【27】*   About finasteride\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Fertility and pregnancy\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【28】Page last reviewed: 2 August 2023  \nNext review due: 2 August 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Do not use it for longer than recommended.\n\n【7】Do not use coal tar together with other skin treatments unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【8】### Important\n\n【9】If you get coal tar in your eyes or mouth, wash it out immediately with plenty of cold water. If your eyes become irritated, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【10】### How to use cream or ointment\n\n【11】Coal tar is available as a cream and ointment.\n\n【12】Cream is better for skin that is moist or weepy. Ointment is thicker and greasier, and is better for dry or flaky areas of skin.\n\n【13】Sometimes, the amount of coal tar cream or ointment you need to use is given in fingertip units. This is the amount you can squeeze onto the end of your finger.\n\n【14】A fingertip unit is generally enough to treat both sides of your hand.\n\n【15】For children, the right amount of cream or ointment depends on their age. A doctor or pharmacist can advise you.\n\n【16】Credit:\n\n【17】Mark Thomas/Science Photo Library https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/463425/view\n\n【18】1.  Wash your hands.\n2.  Squeeze out a fingertip unit of cream or ointment.\n3.  Carefully smooth the cream or ointment in a thin layer over the affected area.\n4.  Be careful not to get the cream or ointment onto broken skin or cuts.\n5.  Wash your hands afterwards.\n\n【19】If you need to use a dressing, like a bandage or plaster, wait at least 10 minutes after putting on coal tar cream or ointment.\n\n【20】Use once or twice a day or as recommended by a doctor.\n\n【21】Some creams, like Psoriderm, should only be used on the particular type of skin condition that they're recommended for. Check the packet or ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【22】#### Important: Fire warning\n\n【23】Skin creams and ointments can dry onto your clothes and bedding. This makes them more likely to catch fire. Avoid naked flames.\n\n【24】### How to use shampoo\n\n【25】1.  Wet your hair thoroughly.\n2.  Use enough shampoo to lather your hair, scalp and immediately surrounding areas if they're also affected.\n3.  Using your fingertips, massage your scalp and affected areas well.\n4.  Rinse off the shampoo thoroughly with water.\n5.  Repeat steps 2 to 4.\n6.  Wash and rinse your hands.\n\n【26】Coal tar shampoo should be in contact with your scalp for between 3 and 5 minutes.\n\n【27】Use once or twice a week or as recommended by a doctor.\n\n【28】### How to use scalp lotion\n\n【29】1.  Shake the bottle thoroughly before each use.\n2.  Wash your hands.\n3.  Unscrew the bottle cap and place the nozzle directly on your scalp.\n4.  Gently squeeze the bottle to cover the scalp area with a thin and even layer of liquid.\n5.  Do not use more than the recommended amount and try not to get it into your eyes.\n6.  Massage the area gently with your fingertips.\n7.  Leave the treatment to dry for 1 hour. Your scalp will feel cool while the liquid is drying.\n8.  Wash the scalp lotion out with warm water.\n9.  Wash your hands straight after use.\n\n【30】For children and older people, the liquid can be diluted. Boil and cool some water. Pour the recommended amount of scalp treatment into the palm of your hand and add a few drops of the cooled water. Apply the mixture to the scalp and massage. Continue with steps 7, 8 and 9.\n\n【31】How often you use the scalp lotion depends on your symptoms. If they are mild, use it once a week. If your symptoms are more severe, use it daily for the first 3 to 7 days then reduce to once a week.\n\n【32】### How to use bath liquid (emulsion additive)\n\n【33】1.  Add 30ml of the liquid to a bath of warm water.\n2.  Get into the bath and soak for 5 to 20 minutes. Check your medicine instructions for information on how long to soak for.\n3.  The bathtub may be slippery, so take care when getting out.\n4.  Pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Avoid rubbing with the towel as this can make your skin condition worse.\n\n【34】Use this as your doctor tells you and always follow the instructions that come with your medicine. This will help to prevent your symptoms coming back.\n\n【35】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【36】If you forget to use coal tar, use it as soon as you remember, unless you do not remember until it's nearly time to use it again. In this case, just wait and use it at the usual time.\n\n【37】Do not use double the amount to make up for a missed use.\n\n【38】If you use too much\n-------------------\n\n【39】Using more than the recommended amount of coal tar is unlikely to harm you but it may increase the risk of skin irritation.

{"seq_id": "a5865ec0-386d-494d-8652-d568bcfabc5d", "title": "Amitriptyline for pain and migraine", "text": "【0】Common questions about amitriptyline for pain and migraine\n==========================================================\n\n【1】How does amitriptyline work?\n\n【2】Amitriptyline is from a group of medicines called tricyclic antidepressants.\n\n【3】They're thought to work by increasing a chemical called serotonin in your brain. This can improve your mood.\n\n【4】This can also change the way that your nerves receive pain signals so pain goes away. This helps your symptoms if you're taking amitriptyline for pain relief or migraine.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】You may find you're sleeping better straight away. But it usually takes 1 or 2 weeks for pain to begin to wear off.\n\n【7】It can take between 4 and 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits of amitriptyline as a painkiller.\n\n【8】Do not stop taking amitriptyline after 1 to 2 weeks just because you feel it's not helping your symptoms. Allow at least 6 weeks to see if it works for you.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Although there is a lot of information on the short-term effects of taking amitriptyline, less is known about the long-term effects.\n\n【11】There may be an increased risk of confusion and possibly dementia in people taking medicines like amitriptyline but more research needs to be done. If you're worried about this, talk to your doctor.\n\n【12】Your doctor will check with you regularly to make sure your treatment is still working and that you're not having problems with side effects.\n\n【13】What will happen when I stop taking amitriptyline?\n\n【14】You may get extra side effects when you stop taking amitriptyline. This is more likely if you stop taking it suddenly.\n\n【15】These side effects are a physical reaction as the medicine leaves your system. You may get flu-like symptoms like feeling sick, muscle pain and feeling tired or restless.\n\n【16】To help prevent these side effects, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks, or longer if you've been taking amitriptyline for a long time.\n\n【17】### Important\n\n【18】Do not stop taking amitriptyline suddenly without talking to your doctor.\n\n【19】Are there other treatments that will help?\n\n【20】Antidepressants like amitriptyline are just one of several ways to treat nerve pain or pain that lasts for a long time, or to prevent migraines. Other treatments include:\n\n【21】*   other antidepressants such as duloxetine\n*   painkillers such as paracetamol\n*   medicines that are usually used for epilepsy such as pregabalin\n*   medicines that are usually used to treat high blood pressure such as propranolol\n*   physiotherapy\n*   talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n*   exercise programmes and physical activity\n*   acupuncture\n\n【22】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【23】*   what is causing the pain\n*   how long you've had the pain\n*   your symptoms\n*   what medicines have worked or not worked for you in the past\n\n【24】How will amitriptyline make me feel?\n\n【25】Many people sleep better while they're taking amitriptyline.\n\n【26】Although amitriptyline is an antidepressant, the doses are lower when used to treat pain. Taking amitriptyline as a painkiller will not have the same effects as taking it for depression.\n\n【27】Is amitriptyline addictive?\n\n【28】Amitriptyline is not addictive but you can get extra side effects if you stop taking it suddenly. You may have flu-like symptoms like feeling sick, muscle pain and feeling tired or restless.\n\n【29】To help prevent this happening, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks, or longer if you've been taking amitriptyline for a long time.\n\n【30】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【31】Amitriptyline can change how hungry you feel. Some people feel more hungry when they're taking it while others feel less hungry. So your weight may change when you first start taking it.\n\n【32】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking amitriptyline, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist.\n\n【33】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【34】Some people have sex-related problems while taking amitriptyline. These can include:\n\n【35】*   men having problems with getting an erection and problems with ejaculating\n*   women having some vaginal bleeding\n*   both men and women having breast swelling\n\n【36】Sexual side effects are not common and should go away after the first couple of weeks. If they do not, and this is a problem for you, go back to your doctor to see if there's another medicine you can try.\n\n【37】If you're a woman and you get vaginal bleeding after the menopause, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【38】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【39】Amitriptyline does not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【40】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【41】Some people feel sleepy and dizzy while they're taking amitriptyline. It's best to stop driving and cycling, and avoid using machinery or tools, for the first few days of treatment until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\n【42】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【43】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking amitriptyline. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【44】Can I drink alcohol while taking amitriptyline?\n\n【45】You can drink alcohol while taking amitriptyline but it may make you feel sleepy. It's usually best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine makes you feel.\n\n【46】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【47】Apart from avoiding drinking too much alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while taking amitriptyline.\n\n【48】Will recreational drugs affect amitriptyline?\n\n【49】Cannabis with amitriptyline can make you feel very sleepy, especially if you've just started taking the medicine. Using them together can also give you a fast heartbeat.\n\n【50】It can be dangerous to take amitriptyline with:\n\n【51】*   methadone\n*   stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine\n*   hallucinogens like LSD\n*   novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone\n\n【52】Amitriptyline has not been properly tested with recreational drugs. Talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking amitriptyline.\n\n【53】Find out more the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【54】More in Amitriptyline for pain and migraine\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【55】*   About amitriptyline for pain and migraine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【56】Page last reviewed: 14 August 2023  \nNext review due: 14 August 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

A child might have complex needs from birth, or after an illness or injury.\n\n【2】Support after diagnosis\n-----------------------\n\n【3】Although everyone's experience will be different, it can be reassuring to speak to other parents who have children with the same disability or health condition as yours. They're likely to have been through the same emotions and processes.\n\n【4】Many organisations offer advice as well as online forums or message boards for parents:\n\n【5】*   the charity Bliss can provide advice and support to families with a baby in special care\n*   your local council may be able to provide details of parent carers groups in your area – find your local council on GOV.UK\n*   Carers Direct has advice for parent carers – call on 0300 123 1053 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm at weekends (closed bank holidays), or use the textphone/minicom service on 0300 123 1004\n*   health charities such as the Down's Syndrome Association can give advice and guidance on your child's specific health condition\n*   the charity Contact has advice and information for families with disabled children\n\n【6】### GP carers register\n\n【7】If your GP's surgery has a carers register, ask to be added.

Being overwhelmed and exhausted by your caring responsibilities can affect your health.\n\n【23】If family and friends can't always step in, respite care may be a possibility. Your GP or social worker will be able to discuss all the options and organise the care. Alternatively, you could pay for respite care privately.\n\n【24】Find out more about carers' breaks and respite care.\n\n【25】Single parent carers\n--------------------\n\n【26】There are lots of organisations specifically aimed at single parents, including those with disabled children, such as Gingerbread that can provide information and advice.\n\n【27】Local support groups provide the opportunity to talk to other single parents. Some run drop-in centres or offer home visits. Your local group may also publish a newsletter covering activities in your area or providing help with organising respite care.\n\n【28】For more support, call Gingerbread's single parent helpline on 0808 802 0925 or Contact on 0808 808 3555.\n\n【29】Single parents of disabled children may be entitled to a range of benefits.

Looking after children can be a physical and financial strain at any age but particularly if you're older.\n\n【35】Advice and support on being the sole carer of a grandchild is available from Kinship.\n\n【36】Lifelong care for a disabled child\n----------------------------------\n\n【37】It's natural to be concerned about your child's future if they are born with an illness or disability, or diagnosed at an early age.\n\n【38】It's worth asking your local authority for an assessment of your child's needs and for your needs as a carer.\n\n【39】The local authority should consider the needs of your whole family, especially if you have other children who may be young carers themselves.\n\n【40】To find out about assessments, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053.\n\n【41】Find contact details for your local council on GOV.UK.\n\n【42】### Independence in adulthood\n\n【43】Many young people who have disabilities live independent lives, while others may always need significant care.\n\n【44】Even if they have extensive care needs, your child may still be able to live independently with the right support.\n\n【45】The video below shows how Victoria, who has profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, lives in her own home and employs her own personal assistants.\n\n【46】Many organisations can offer advice about managing a young person's move from children's social care to adult social care.\n\n【47】You can find contact details for these organisations in the directory of local carers' services.\n\n【48】### What will happen to my child after I die?\n\n【49】You may want to plan for your child's future and make sure things are in place in case they outlive you.\n\n【50】If your child has a physical disability, they might need someone to help them with personal care or transportation.\n\n【51】If your child has learning disabilities, they may require specialist provision such as sheltered housing, care homes or specialist nursing care.\n\n【52】### Make a will\n\n【53】Writing a will can help you address the fears you may have about what will happen to your children when you die. You can write a will through a solicitor, or using a will-writing pack or online will-writing services.\n\n【54】You might have family or friends who could care for your child in an emergency, or who would be willing to look after your son or daughter if you die. If this is the case, you may want to make a will explaining your wishes for your child. It's also a good idea to let social services know in advance and to include them in an emergency care plan.\n\n【55】If friends and family can't help, speak to social services about the best options for your child.\n\n【56】### Written instructions\n\n【57】It will help your child, and those who may need to care for them, if they know exactly what has to be done each day.\n\n【58】Keep a log of the food and drinks your child likes and dislikes, what time they wake up and go to bed, what time they need their medication and so on.

How it's performed\n3.  Who can have one\n\n【3】**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a type of scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.**\n\n【4】An MRI scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets. You lie inside the tube during the scan.\n\n【5】An MRI scan can be used to examine almost any part of the body, including the:\n\n【6】*   brain and spinal cord\n*   bones and joints\n*   breasts\n*   heart and blood vessels\n*   internal organs, such as the liver, womb or prostate gland\n\n【7】The results of an MRI scan can be used to help diagnose conditions, plan treatments and assess how effective previous treatment has been.\n\n【8】What happens during an MRI scan?\n--------------------------------\n\n【9】During an MRI scan, you lie on a flat bed that's moved into the scanner.\n\n【10】Depending on the part of your body being scanned, you'll be moved into the scanner either head first or feet first.\n\n【11】Credit:\n\n【12】MEDICIMAGE / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\n【13】https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1200089/view\n\n【14】The MRI scanner is operated by a radiographer, who is trained in carrying out imaging investigations.\n\n【15】They control the scanner using a computer, which is in a different room, to keep it away from the magnetic field generated by the scanner.\n\n【16】You'll be able to talk to the radiographer through an intercom and they'll be able to see you on a television monitor and through the viewing window throughout the scan.\n\n【17】At certain times during the scan, the scanner will make loud tapping noises. This is the electric current in the scanner coils being turned on and off.\n\n【18】You'll be given earplugs or headphones to wear.\n\n【19】It's very important to keep as still as possible during your MRI scan.\n\n【20】The radiographer may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds or follow other instructions during the scan.\n\n【21】The scan lasts 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken.\n\n【22】Read more about how an MRI scan is performed.\n\n【23】How does an MRI scan work?\n--------------------------\n\n【24】Most of the human body is made up of water molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\n\n【25】At the centre of each hydrogen atom is an even smaller particle called a proton. Protons are like tiny magnets and are very sensitive to magnetic fields.\n\n【26】When you lie under the powerful scanner magnets, the protons in your body line up in the same direction, in the same way that a magnet can pull the needle of a compass. You will not be able to feel this.\n\n【27】Short bursts of radio waves are then sent to certain areas of the body, knocking the protons out of alignment.\n\n【28】When the radio waves are turned off, the protons realign. This sends out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers.\n\n【29】These signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body.\n\n【30】They also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals.\n\n【31】In the same way that millions of pixels on a computer screen can create complex pictures, the signals from the millions of protons in the body are combined to create a detailed image of the inside of the body.\n\n【32】Safety\n------\n\n【33】An MRI scan is a painless and safe procedure. You may find it uncomfortable if you have claustrophobia, but most people are able to manage it with support from the radiographer.\n\n【34】Most modern MRI scanners have a wider tunnel, which can help reduce claustrophobia. Going into the scanner feet first may be easier, although this isn't always possible.\n\n【35】Extensive research has been carried out into whether the magnetic fields and radio waves used during MRI scans could pose a risk to the human body.\n\n【36】No evidence has been found to suggest there's a risk, which means MRI scans are one of the safest medical procedures available.\n\n【37】But MRI scans may not be recommended in certain situations. For example, if you have a metal implant fitted, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint, you may not be able to have an MRI scan.\n\n【38】If you're pregnant, a doctor will discuss with you whether an MRI scan is suitable for you.\n\n【39】Read more about who can and can't have an MRI scan.\n\n【40】Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022  \nNext review due: 26 July 2025\n\n【41】*   Next : How it's performed", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Steroids closely copy the effects of natural hormones produced in your adrenal glands. These sit on top of your kidneys.\n\n【3】Dexamethasone works on your immune system to reduce the symptoms of inflammatory conditions and allergic reactions such as swelling, redness and itching.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】Your eye symptoms should start to improve quickly within a few days. Tell your doctor if you do not feel better after 7 days.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】Once your condition has settled down, your doctor will generally recommend that you stop using this medicine.\n\n【8】If you have been using dexamethasone eye drops for a long time, your doctor may advise you to gradually reduce the amount you use before stopping completely.\n\n【9】Using dexamethasone continuously for a long time can increase the risk of side effects.\n\n【10】What will happen if I stop using it?\n\n【11】If you've been using the drops for more than a few weeks, your doctor may tell you to use them less often before you stop completely. This is to reduce the chances of your condition coming back.\n\n【12】Talk to your doctor if your symptoms come back after you have stopped using dexamethasone eye drops.\n\n【13】What are dexamethasone eye drops combined with an antibiotic used for?\n\n【14】Dexamethasone can be combined with an antibiotic as eye drops, eye ointment, ear drops or ear spray.\n\n【15】They're usually prescribed if you have eye inflammation and your eye could become infected.\n\n【16】The eye drops and eye ointment are not usually used to treat an eye infection but the antibiotic is to prevent infection, for example while the eye heals after injury or surgery.\n\n【17】Dexamethasone ear drops and ear spray are often used for inflammation in the ear canal (outer ear) which may be infected, for example eczema in the ear or “swimmer's ear.”\n\n【18】Can dexamethasone eye drops be used in the ear?\n\n【19】It is safe to use dexamethasone eye drops in the ear but only use them in the ear if advised by a doctor.\n\n【20】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【21】Dexamethasone eye drops do not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【22】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【23】For most people, using dexamethasone eye drops will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle. However, it might help to wait 15 minutes after using the eye drops so that your vision returns to normal.\n\n【24】The eye drops can sometimes make your eyesight blurred or cloudy. If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery until you feel well and you can see clearly again.\n\n【25】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【26】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while using dexamethasone eye drops. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【27】Can I drink alcohol while using dexamethasone eye drops?\n\n【28】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using dexamethasone eye drops.\n\n【29】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【30】No, you can eat and drink normally while using dexamethasone eye drops.\n\n【31】More in Dexamethasone eye drops\n-------------------------------\n\n【32】*   About dexamethasone eye drops\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using dexamethasone eye drops with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【33】Page last reviewed: 21 July 2022  \nNext review due: 21 July 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
