Overview\n2.  Side effects\n\n【3】**Bronchodilators are a type of medication that make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs and widening the airways (bronchi).**\n\n【4】They're often used to treat long-term conditions where the airways may become narrow and inflamed, such as:\n\n【5】*   asthma, a common lung condition caused by inflammation of the airways\n*   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a group of lung conditions, usually caused by smoking, that make breathing difficult\n\n【6】Bronchodilators may be either:\n\n【7】*   short-acting – used as short-term relief from sudden, unexpected attacks of breathlessness\n*   long-acting – used regularly to help control breathlessness in asthma and COPD, and increase the effectiveness of corticosteroids in asthma\n\n【8】Bronchodilators and corticosteroids\n-----------------------------------\n\n【9】Inhaled corticosteroids are the main treatment to reduce inflammation and prevent flare-ups in asthma.\n\n【10】But some people may also benefit from taking bronchodilators to keep the airways open and enhance the effects of corticosteroids.\n\n【11】Long-acting bronchodilators should never be taken without corticosteroids.\n\n【12】In COPD initial treatment is with short- or long-acting bronchodilators, with corticosteroids added in some severe cases.\n\n【13】Treatment with corticosteroids and bronchodilators may require the use of separate inhalers, but increasingly these medications are provided together in single inhalers.\n\n【14】Types of bronchodilator\n-----------------------\n\n【15】The 3 most widely used bronchodilators are:\n\n【16】*   beta-2 agonists, such as salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol and vilanterol\n*   anticholinergics, such as ipratropium and tiotropium\n*   theophylline\n\n【17】Beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics are available in both short-acting and long-acting forms, whereas theophylline is only available in a long-acting form.\n\n【18】### Beta-2 agonists\n\n【19】Beta-2 agonists are used for both asthma and COPD, although some types are only available for COPD.\n\n【20】They're usually inhaled using a small handheld inhaler, but may also be available as tablets or syrup.\n\n【21】For sudden, severe symptoms, they can also be injected or nebulised.\n\n【22】A nebuliser is a compressor that turns liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing a large dose of the medicine to be inhaled through a mouthpiece or face mask.\n\n【23】Beta-2 agonists work by stimulating receptors called beta-2 receptors in the muscles that line the airways, which causes them to relax and allows the airways to widen (dilate).\n\n【24】They should be used with caution in people with:\n\n【25】*   an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) – a condition that occurs when there's too much thyroid hormone in the body\n*   cardiovascular disease – conditions that affect the heart or blood vessels\n*   an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   diabetes – a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high\n\n【26】In rare cases, beta-2 agonists can make some of the symptoms and possible complications of these conditions worse.\n\n【27】### Anticholinergics\n\n【28】Anticholinergics (also known as antimuscarinics) are mainly used to treat COPD, but a few can also be used for asthma.\n\n【29】They're usually taken using an inhaler, but may be nebulised to treat sudden and severe symptoms.\n\n【30】Anticholinergics cause the airways to widen by blocking the cholinergic nerves.\n\n【31】These nerves release chemicals that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten.\n\n【32】They should be used with caution in people with:\n\n【33】*   benign prostate enlargement – where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, which can affect how you pee\n*   a bladder outflow obstruction – any condition that affects the flow of urine out of the bladder, such as bladder stones or prostate cancer\n*   glaucoma – a build-up of pressure in the eye\n\n【34】If you have benign prostate enlargement or a bladder outflow obstruction, anticholinergics can cause problems, such as difficulty peeing and not being able to empty your bladder fully.\n\n【35】Glaucoma can get worse if anticholinergic medication unintentionally gets into the eyes.\n\n【36】### Theophylline\n\n【37】Theophylline is usually taken in tablet or capsule form, but a different version called aminophylline can be given directly into a vein (intravenously) if your symptoms are severe.\n\n【38】It's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but it seems to reduce any inflammation (swelling) in the airways, in addition to relaxing the muscles lining them.\n\n【39】The effect of theophylline is weaker than other bronchodilators and corticosteroids.\n\n【40】It's also more likely to cause side effects, so is often only used alongside these medicines if they're not effective enough.\n\n【41】Theophylline should be used with caution in people with:\n\n【42】*   an overactive thyroid\n*   cardiovascular disease\n*   liver problems, such as liver disease\n*   high blood pressure\n*   open sores that develop on the stomach lining (stomach ulcers)\n*   a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits (seizures) (epilepsy)\n\n【43】Theophylline may make these conditions worse. In people with liver problems, it can sometimes lead to a dangerous build-up of medication in the body.\n\n【44】Other medicines can also cause an abnormal build-up of theophylline in the body. This should always be checked by your doctor.\n\n【45】Older people may also need additional monitoring while taking theophylline.\n\n【46】Side effects\n------------\n\n【47】The side effects of bronchodilators can vary, depending on the specific medication you're taking.\n\n【48】Make sure you read the leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the specific side effects are.\n\n【49】General side effects of bronchodilators include:\n\n【50】*   trembling, particularly in the hands\n*   headaches\n*   a dry mouth\n*   suddenly noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\n*   muscle cramps\n*   a cough\n*   nausea and vomiting\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【51】Find out more about the side effects of bronchodilators\n\n【52】Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n---------------------------\n\n【53】In most cases bronchodilators should be taken as normal while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n【54】But speak to your GP if you regularly use bronchodilators and you're considering having a baby or think you might be pregnant.\n\n【55】Pregnancy may affect your asthma, so it's important to continue taking your medication and have it monitored regularly to make sure the condition is controlled.\n\n【56】Find out more about taking medication during pregnancy\n\n【57】Interactions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【58】Bronchodilators may interact with other medicines, which could affect the way they work or increase your risk of side effects.\n\n【59】Some of the medicines that can interact with bronchodilators (particularly theophylline) include:\n\n【60】*   some diuretics, a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body\n*   some antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n*   digoxin, a medication used to treat arrhythmias\n*   benzodiazepines, a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment for anxiety or sleeping problems (insomnia)\n*   lithium, a medication used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder\n*   quinolones, a type of antibiotic medication\n\n【61】This is not a complete list of all the medications that can interact with bronchodilators, and not all of these interactions apply to each type of bronchodilator.\n\n【62】Always carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. \n\n【63】You may be able to find a specific leaflet on the medicines A to Z on the MHRA website. \n\n【64】If in doubt, speak to a pharmacist or GP.\n\n【65】Page last reviewed: 05 October 2022  \nNext review due: 05 October 2025\n\n【66】*   Next : Side effects", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【65】Page last reviewed: 05 October 2022\n\nNext review due: 05 October 2025\n\n【66】*   Next : Side effects\n\n\n", "content": "【0】Overview \\- Bronchodilators\n===========================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

these medicines are only likely to increase the risk of AKI if you're dehydrated or ill\n\n【18】Causes of acute kidney injury\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】Most cases of AKI are caused by reduced blood flow to the kidneys, usually in someone who's already unwell with another health condition.\n\n【20】This reduced blood flow could be caused by:\n\n【21】*   low blood volume after bleeding, excessive vomiting or diarrhoea, or severe dehydration\n*   the heart pumping out less blood than normal as a result of heart failure, liver failure or sepsis\n*   certain medicines that reduce blood pressure or blood flow to the kidneys, such as ACE inhibitors, certain diuretics or NSAIDs\n\n【22】AKI can also be caused by a problem with the kidney itself, such as inflammation of the filters in the kidney (glomerulonephritis), the blood vessels (vasculitis), or other structures in the kidney.\n\n【23】This may be caused by a reaction to some medicines, infections or the liquid dye used in some types of X-rays.\n\n【24】It may sometimes be the result of a blockage affecting the drainage of the kidneys, such as:\n\n【25】*   an enlarged prostate\n*   a tumour in the pelvis, such as an ovarian or bladder tumour\n*   kidney stones\n\n【26】Diagnosing acute kidney injury\n------------------------------\n\n【27】A doctor may suspect AKI if you:\n\n【28】*   are in an \"at risk\" group and suddenly fall ill\n*   get symptoms of AKI\n\n【29】AKI is usually diagnosed with a blood test to measure your levels of creatinine, a chemical waste product produced by the muscles.\n\n【30】If there's a lot of creatinine in your blood, it means your kidneys are not working as well as they should.\n\n【31】You may also be asked to give a pee sample.\n\n<mark>【32】Find out more from InfoKID about AKI in children</mark>\n\n【33】### Investigating the underlying cause\n\n【34】Urine can be tested for protein, blood cells, sugar and waste products, which may give clues to the underlying cause.\n\n【35】Doctors also need to know about:\n\n【36】*   any other symptoms, such as signs of sepsis or signs of heart failure\n*   any other medical conditions\n*   any medicine that's been taken in the past week, as some medicines can cause AKI\n\n【37】An ultrasound scan should reveal if the cause is a blockage in the urinary system, such as an enlarged prostate or bladder tumour.\n\n【38】Treating acute kidney injury\n----------------------------\n\n【39】Treatment of AKI depends on what's causing your illness and how severe it is.\n\n【40】You may need:\n\n【41】*   to increase your intake of water and other fluids if you're dehydrated\n*   antibiotics if you have an infection\n*   to stop taking certain medicines (at least until the problem is sorted)\n*   a urinary catheter, a thin tube used to drain the bladder if there's a blockage\n\n【42】You may need to go to hospital for some treatments.\n\n【43】Most people with AKI make a full recovery, but some people go on to develop chronic kidney disease or long-term kidney failure as a result.\n\n【44】In severe cases, dialysis – where a machine filters the blood to rid the body of harmful waste, extra salt and water – may be needed.\n\n【45】Preventing acute kidney injury\n------------------------------\n\n【46】Those at risk of AKI should be monitored with regular blood tests if they become unwell or start new medicine. \n\n【47】It's also useful to check how much pee you're passing.\n\n【48】Any warning signs of AKI, such as vomiting or producing little pee, require immediate investigation for AKI and treatment.\n\n【49】People who are dehydrated or at risk of dehydration may need to be given fluids through a drip.\n\n【50】Any medicine that seems to be making the problem worse or directly damaging the kidneys needs to be stopped, at least temporarily.\n\n【51】Complications of acute kidney injury\n------------------------------------\n\n【52】The most serious complications of acute kidney injury include:\n\n【53】*   high levels of potassium in the blood – in severe cases, this can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and heart rhythm problems\n*   too much fluid in the body, which can cause build-up of fluid in the arms and legs (oedema) or in the lungs (pulmonary oedema)\n*   acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) – which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness\n*   chronic kidney disease\n\n【54】Page last reviewed: 08 September 2022  \nNext review due: 08 September 2025", "index": 6699, "show": true, "start": 6673, "end": 6750, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:37:15", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:38:45", "cost": 89.785}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:49", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:38:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:37:15"}

syndrome is the collection of symptoms some people with a neuroendocrine tumour may have.\n\n【5】It is more common when the tumour has spread to the liver and releases hormones such as serotonin into the bloodstream.\n\n【6】Carcinoid syndrome can also happen in people with lung and pancreatic NETs, but this is rare.\n\n【7】About 4,000 people are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour each year in the UK, but not everyone with a tumour will have carcinoid syndrome.\n\n【8】Cancer Research UK has more information about different types of neuroendocrine tumours\n\n【9】Signs and symptoms\n------------------\n\n【10】In the early stages of having a neuroendocrine tumour, you may not have any symptoms.\n\n【11】You may also not have symptoms if the tumour is just in your digestive system, as any hormones it produces will be broken down by your liver.\n\n【12】If symptoms do develop, they tend to be general and can be easily mistaken for signs of other illnesses.\n\n【13】Symptoms may result from both the tumour itself and from any hormones it releases into the bloodstream.\n\n【14】### Symptoms caused by the tumour\n\n【15】Symptoms will depend on where in the body the tumour develops:\n\n【16】*   a tumour in the bowel may cause tummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick or being sick) and bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)\n*   a tumour in the lung may cause a cough, which may make you cough up blood, and cause wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain and tiredness\n*   a tumour in the stomach may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness\n\n【17】Some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance.\n\n【18】For example, a tumour in the appendix may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.\n\n【19】### Symptoms caused by the hormones (carcinoid syndrome)\n\n【20】Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:\n\n【21】*   diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite\n*   flushing of the skin, particularly the face\n*   fast heart rate\n*   breathlessness and wheezing\n\n【22】These symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.\n\n【23】Some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly.\n\n【24】There's also a risk of developing a rare but serious condition called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a changes in your blood pressure.\n\n【25】What causes neuroendocrine tumours?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】It's not known exactly why neuroendocrine tumours develop, but it's thought that most occur by chance.\n\n【27】Your chances of developing a neuroendocrine tumour may be increased if you have:\n\n【28】*   a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)\n*   parents or siblings (brothers or sisters) with a carcinoid tumour\n*   conditions called neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis\n\n【29】Read more about neuroendocrine tumours on the Cancer Research UK website\n\n【30】Diagnosing neuroendocrine tumours\n---------------------------------\n\n【31】A neuroendocrine tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix.\n\n【32】In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.\n\n【33】Otherwise, people usually see their GP after they have developed symptoms.\n\n【34】A neuroendocrine tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an endoscopy.\n\n【35】Treating neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether.\n\n【37】Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).\n\n【38】If the tumour cannot be removed, but it's not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored. \n\n【39】If it's causing symptoms, you may be offered treatment.\n\n【40】This can include:\n\n【41】*   injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour\n*   radiotherapy to kill some of the cancer cells \n*   a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation\n*   a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation\n*   chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms\n*   targeted drugs to help control the growth of the tumour, such as sunitinib, everolimus and interferon.\n\n【42】You may also be given medicine to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medicine.\n\n【43】Read more about surgery and treatments for neuroendocrine tumours on the Cancer Research UK website\n\n【44】What can I do to help myself?\n-----------------------------\n\n【45】There are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.\n\n【46】Generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:\n\n【47】*   alcohol\n*   large meals\n*   spicy foods\n*   foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats\n*   stress\n\n【48】If you have diarrhoea, it's important to keep drinking little and often to avoid dehydration.\n\n【49】Outlook\n-------\n\n【50】If the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether.\n\n【51】But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medicine.\n\n【52】You might have treatment to help with symptoms if the tumour has spread to another organ, such as the liver.\n\n【53】Survival for people with neuroendocrine tumours depends on many things, including the person's condition and the type of tumour they have.\n\n【54】Page last reviewed: 24 May 2021  \nNext review due: 24 May 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name":

The bacteria are usually spread through sex or contact with infected genital fluids (semen or vaginal fluid).\n\n【14】You can get chlamydia through:\n\n【15】*   unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex\n*   sharing sex toys that are not washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used\n*   your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals – this means you can get chlamydia from someone even if there's no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation\n*   infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye\n\n【16】It can also be passed by a pregnant woman to her baby.\n\n【17】Chlamydia cannot be passed on through casual contact, such as kissing and hugging, or from sharing baths, towels, swimming pools, toilet seats or cutlery.\n\n【18】Is chlamydia serious?\n---------------------\n\n【19】Although chlamydia does not usually cause any symptoms and can normally be treated with a short course of antibiotics, it can be serious if it's not treated early on.\n\n【20】If left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your body and lead to long-term health problems, especially in women.\n\n【21】In women, untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy and infertility.\n\n【22】In men, in rare cases, chlamydia can spread to the testicles and epididymis (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles), causing them to become painful and swollen. This is known as epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the testicles).\n\n【23】It can also sometimes cause reactive arthritis in men and women.\n\n【24】This is why it's important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you think you might have chlamydia.\n\n【25】Find out more about the complications of chlamydia\n\n【26】Getting tested for chlamydia\n----------------------------\n\n【27】Testing for chlamydia is done with a urine test or a swab test.\n\n【28】You do not always need a physical examination by a nurse or doctor.\n\n【29】Anyone can get a free and confidential chlamydia test at a sexual health clinic, a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or a GP surgery.\n\n【30】In England, if you're a woman under 25 years old, you may be offered a chlamydia test when you visit some health services, for example a pharmacy or GP.

It helps your baby grow normally.\n*   You're unlikely to get side effects with folic acid, but some people feel sick, lose their appetite, get wind or feel bloated. These side effects are usually mild and do not last long.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol while taking folic acid, as it can stop your folic acid from working as well.\n\n【11】More in Folic acid\n------------------\n\n【12】*   About folic acid\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking folic acid with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【13】Page last reviewed: 5 April 2022  \nNext review due: 5 April 2025", "index": 1618, "show": true, "start": 1618, "end": 1886, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:45:57", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:46:23", "cost": 25.977}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:49", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:46:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:45:57"}

Your muscles will start to relax when you have been taking diazepam regularly for a few days\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】You'll usually take diazepam for no longer than 2 to 4 weeks.\n\n【10】If you're prescribed diazepam for more than 4 weeks, your dose may be reduced gradually when you stop taking it to prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【11】Is diazepam addictive?\n\n【12】It is possible to become addicted to diazepam. To reduce the risk of becoming addicted, it's best to take the lowest dose that treats your symptoms, and to take it for only a short time (2 to 4 weeks).\n\n【13】You're more likely to get addicted if you need to take a higher dose for a longer time, or if you've ever had problems with alcohol or drugs.\n\n【14】### Important\n\n【15】Take diazepam tablets or liquid for as short a time as possible.\n\n【16】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【17】If you have been taking a high dose of diazepam or have been taking it for a long time, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually.\n\n【18】If you suddenly stop taking it, you may get some side effects, such as:\n\n【19】*   confusion\n*   seizures or fits\n*   depression\n*   feeling nervous or irritable\n*   sweating\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【20】You're less likely to get these side effects if you reduce your dose gradually.\n\n【21】Are there other medicines for anxiety and for seizures or fits?\n\n【22】There are different types of medicines for treating anxiety or seizures or fits.\n\n【23】For anxiety, depending on your symptoms, you may need a medicine to treat your physical symptoms, as well as your psychological ones.\n\n【24】Your doctor will usually start you on a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram.\n\n【25】For seizures or fits, a medicine called midazolam can be used. It comes as a pre-filled syringe and is given inside your mouth between your cheek and your gum (buccal cavity).\n\n【26】You can use this instead of rectal diazepam, which is inserted into your bottom (anus).\n\n【27】You can discuss the different options with your doctor. They'll help you decide which medicine is best for you.\n\n【28】Can I take diazepam before surgery?\n\n【29】Diazepam can be given as a pre-med to relax you before an operation or dental treatment that may be uncomfortable or make you feel anxious.\n\n【30】It's important to tell your doctor or dentist if you're already taking diazepam.\n\n【31】### Important\n\n【32】Tell your doctor that you take diazepam if you're going to be put to sleep (using a general anaesthetic) or having any kind of major operation.\n\n【33】Can I take diazepam with me if I'm travelling abroad?\n\n【34】It depends on which country you're travelling to. Different countries have different rules and regulations for diazepam.\n\n【35】It's important to plan ahead and find out whether you can take your medicine abroad. It's best to only take the amount that you need while abroad.\n\n【36】You can check the rules by contacting the embassy for the country you're visiting. You can find a full list of foreign embassies in the UK on the GOV.UK website.\n\n【37】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【38】Diazepam will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【39】But some contraceptive pills can keep diazepam in your body for longer and increase its effect.\n\n【40】You can also get bleeding in between your periods if you take diazepam and contraceptive pills together.\n\n【41】But your contraception will still work.\n\n【42】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【43】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if diazepam makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【44】This may be more likely when you first start taking diazepam, but it could happen at any time, for example when starting another medicine.\n\n【45】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【46】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much diazepam is in your body.\n\n【47】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking diazepam. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【48】Can I operate machinery or tools while I'm taking it?\n\n【49】Do not operate machinery or tools if you get any side effects, such as feeling sleepy, being forgetful, or poor co-ordination.\n\n【50】Can I drink alcohol while taking diazepam?\n\n【51】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking diazepam. Alcohol can increase the effects of diazepam. It can make you go into a very deep sleep. There's a risk you will not be able to breathe properly, and you may have difficulty waking up.\n\n【52】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【53】Grapefruit juice may increase the amount of diazepam in your blood. It's a good idea to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking diazepam.\n\n【54】Caffeine is a stimulant and may reduce the calming effects of diazepam. It's best not to have drinks like coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks because they contain caffeine.\n\n【55】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking diazepam.\n\n【56】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【57】Using cannabis, heroin or methadone with diazepam will increase the drowsy effects of diazepam.

To reduce the risk of becoming addicted, it's best to take the lowest dose that treats your symptoms, and to take it for only a short time (2 to 4 weeks).\n\n【13】You're more likely to get addicted if you need to take a higher dose for a longer time, or if you've ever had problems with alcohol or drugs.\n\n【14】### Important\n\n【15】Take diazepam tablets or liquid for as short a time as possible.\n\n【16】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【17】If you have been taking a high dose of diazepam or have been taking it for a long time, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually.\n\n【18】If you suddenly stop taking it, you may get some side effects, such as:\n\n【19】*   confusion\n*   seizures or fits\n*   depression\n*   feeling nervous or irritable\n*   sweating\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【20】You're less likely to get these side effects if you reduce your dose gradually.\n\n【21】Are there other medicines for anxiety and for seizures or fits?\n\n【22】There are different types of medicines for treating anxiety or seizures or fits.\n\n【23】For anxiety, depending on your symptoms, you may need a medicine to treat your physical symptoms, as well as your psychological ones.\n\n【24】Your doctor will usually start you on a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as sertraline, paroxetine or escitalopram.\n\n【25】For seizures or fits, a medicine called midazolam can be used. It comes as a pre-filled syringe and is given inside your mouth between your cheek and your gum (buccal cavity).\n\n【26】You can use this instead of rectal diazepam, which is inserted into your bottom (anus).\n\n【27】You can discuss the different options with your doctor. They'll help you decide which medicine is best for you.\n\n【28】Can I take diazepam before surgery?\n\n【29】Diazepam can be given as a pre-med to relax you before an operation or dental treatment that may be uncomfortable or make you feel anxious.\n\n【30】It's important to tell your doctor or dentist if you're already taking diazepam.\n\n【31】### Important\n\n【32】Tell your doctor that you take diazepam if you're going to be put to sleep (using a general anaesthetic) or having any kind of major operation.\n\n【33】Can I take diazepam with me if I'm travelling abroad?\n\n【34】It depends on which country you're travelling to. Different countries have different rules and regulations for diazepam.\n\n【35】It's important to plan ahead and find out whether you can take your medicine abroad. It's best to only take the amount that you need while abroad.\n\n【36】You can check the rules by contacting the embassy for the country you're visiting. You can find a full list of foreign embassies in the UK on the GOV.UK website.\n\n【37】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【38】Diazepam will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【39】But some contraceptive pills can keep diazepam in your body for longer and increase its effect.\n\n【40】You can also get bleeding in between your periods if you take diazepam and contraceptive pills together.\n\n【41】But your contraception will still work.\n\n【42】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【43】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if diazepam makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【44】This may be more likely when you first start taking diazepam, but it could happen at any time, for example when starting another medicine.\n\n【45】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【46】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much diazepam is in your body.\n\n【47】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking diazepam. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.\n\n【48】Can I operate machinery or tools while I'm taking it?\n\n【49】Do not operate machinery or tools if you get any side effects, such as feeling sleepy, being forgetful, or poor co-ordination.\n\n【50】Can I drink alcohol while taking diazepam?\n\n【51】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking diazepam. Alcohol can increase the effects of diazepam. It can make you go into a very deep sleep. There's a risk you will not be able to breathe properly, and you may have difficulty waking up.\n\n【52】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【53】Grapefruit juice may increase the amount of diazepam in your blood. It's a good idea to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice while taking diazepam.\n\n【54】Caffeine is a stimulant and may reduce the calming effects of diazepam. It's best not to have drinks like coffee, tea, cola and energy drinks because they contain caffeine.\n\n【55】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking diazepam.\n\n【56】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【57】Using cannabis, heroin or methadone with diazepam will increase the drowsy effects of diazepam. It can make you go into a very deep sleep.\n\n【58】There's a risk you will not be able to breathe properly, and you may have difficulty waking up.\n\n【59】Using cocaine or other stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) and amphetamines with diazepam can also make you drowsy.\n\n【60】Talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking diazepam.\n\n【61】You can find out more about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【62】Can lifestyle changes help with anxiety and insomnia?\n\n【63】If you have anxiety, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to help ease symptoms:\n\n【64】*   try a book or online course on anxiety\n*   exercise regularly\n*   learn to relax\n*   avoid caffeine\n*   quit smoking if you can\n*   try not to drink alcohol\n*   contact support groups run by charities like Anxiety UK, Mind and Rethink Mental Illness\n\n【65】If you're having trouble sleeping, there are some things you can do to help with insomnia and getting to sleep:\n\n【66】*   set regular times for going to bed and waking up\n*   relax before bedtime – try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\n*   use thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\n*   avoid caffeine, cigarettes, vaping, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed\n*   do not watch TV or use phones, tablets or computers just before going to bed\n*   do not nap during the day\n*   write a list of your worries, and any ideas about how to solve them, before you go to bed to help you forget about them until the morning\n\n【67】More in Diazepam\n----------------\n\n【68】*   About diazepam\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking diazepam with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【69】Page last reviewed: 3 February 2022  \nNext review due: 3 February 2025", "index": 7797, "show": true, "start": 7797, "end": 8095, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:58:40", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:59:50", "cost": 70.219}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:49", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:59:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:58:39"}

The risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or do not use your treatments correctly.\n\n【6】Signs of a bacterial infection can include:\n\n【7】*   fluid oozing from the skin\n*   a yellow crust on the skin surface\n*   small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\n*   the skin becoming swollen and sore\n*   feeling hot and shivery and generally unwell\n\n【8】Your normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments.\n\n【9】You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.\n\n【10】They may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled.\n\n【11】Speak to a GP if these do not help or your symptoms get worse.\n\n【12】Once your infection has cleared, a GP will prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you're using to avoid contamination. Old treatments should be disposed of.\n\n【13】Viral skin infections\n---------------------\n\n【14】It's also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causes cold sores. This can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum.\n\n【15】Symptoms of eczema herpeticum include:\n\n【16】*   areas of painful eczema that quickly get worse\n*   groups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin\n*   feeling hot, shivery and generally unwell, in some cases\n\n【17】Eczema herpeticum rash on white skin.\n\n【18】Credit:\n\n【19】JOHN RADCLIFFE HOSPITAL/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/256206/view\n\n【20】Contact a doctor immediately if you suspect eczema herpeticum. If you cannot contact a GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital.\n\n【21】If you're diagnosed with eczema herpeticum, you'll be given an antiviral medicine called aciclovir.\n\n【22】Psychological effects\n---------------------\n\n【23】As well as affecting you or your child physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically.\n\n【24】### Bullying\n\n【25】Schoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with.\n\n【26】Your child may become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child's teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they're feeling.\n\n【27】Find out about regional support groups on the National Eczema Society website where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema.\n\n【28】### Problems sleeping\n\n【29】Sleep-related problems are common among people with eczema.\n\n【30】A lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work.\n\n【31】If your child has problems sleeping because of their eczema, they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It might help to let their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration.\n\n【32】During a severe eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies.\n\n【33】### Self-confidence\n\n【34】Atopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may lead to them having a poor self-image.\n\n【35】If your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child's self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance.\n\n【36】Speak to a GP if you're concerned your child's eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support.\n\n【37】Page last reviewed: 13 November 2023  \nNext review due: 13 November 2026\n\n【38】*   Previous : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】Contents\n【2】1.

But there are some causes we do know about.**\n\n【4】Complications with the placenta\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】Many stillbirths are linked to complications with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's and nourishes the baby in the womb.\n\n【6】If there have been problems with the placenta, stillborn babies are usually born perfectly formed, although often small.\n\n【7】With more research, it's hoped that placental causes may be better understood, leading to improved detection and better care for these babies.\n\n【8】Other causes of stillbirth\n--------------------------\n\n【9】Other conditions that can cause or may be associated with stillbirth include:\n\n【10】*   bleeding (haemorrhage) before or during labour\n*   placental abruption – where the placenta separates from the womb before the baby is born (there may be bleeding or abdominal pain)\n*   pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure in the mother\n*   a problem with the umbilical cord, which attaches the placenta to the baby's tummy button – the cord can slip down through the entrance of the womb before the baby is born (cord prolapse) or can be wrapped around the baby and become knotted \n*   intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) or obstetric cholestasis – a liver disorder associated with severe itching during pregnancy\n*   a genetic physical defect in the baby\n*   pre-existing diabetes\n*   an infection in the mother that also affects the baby\n\n【11】Infections\n----------\n\n【12】Usually this will be a bacterial infection that travels from the vagina into the womb (uterus). These bacteria include group B streptococcus, E. coli, klebsiella, enterococcus, Haemophilus influenza, chlamydia, and mycoplasma or ureaplasma.\n\n【13】Some bacterial infections, such as chlamydia and mycoplasma or ureaplasma, which are sexually transmitted infections, can be prevented by using condoms during sex.\n\n【14】Other infections that can cause stillbirths include:  \n\n【15】*   rubella – commonly known as German measles\n*   flu – it's recommended that all pregnant women have the seasonal flu vaccine, regardless of stage of pregnancy\n*   parvovirus B19 – this causes slapped cheek syndrome, a common childhood infection that's dangerous for pregnant women\n*   coxsackie virus – this can cause hand, foot and mouth disease in humans\n*   cytomegalovirus – a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva or urine, which often causes few symptoms in the mother\n*   herpes simplex – the virus that causes genital herpes and cold sores\n*   listeriosis – an infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by listeria bacteria 通用删除1(英):<u>(see foods to avoid in pregnancy)</u>\n*   leptospirosis – a bacterial infection spread by animals such as mice and rats\n*   Lyme disease – a bacterial infection spread by infected ticks\n*   Q fever – a bacterial infection caught from animals such as sheep, goats and cows\n*   toxoplasmosis – an infection caused by a parasite found in soil and cat faeces\n*   malaria – a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes\n\n【16】Increased risk\n--------------\n\n【17】There are also a number of things that may increase your risk of having a stillborn baby, including:\n\n【18】*   having twins or a multiple pregnancy\n*   having a baby who doesn't grow as they should in the womb\n*   being over 35 years of age\n*   smoking, drinking alcohol or misusing drugs while pregnant\n*   being obese – having a body mass index above 30\n*   having a pre-existing physical health condition, such as epilepsy\n\n【19】Your baby's growth\n------------------\n\n【20】Your midwife will check the growth and wellbeing of your baby at each antenatal appointment and plot the baby's growth on a chart.\n\n【21】Every baby is different and should grow to the size that's normal for them. Some babies are naturally small, but all babies should continue to grow steadily throughout pregnancy.\n\n【22】If a baby is smaller than expected or their growth pattern tails off as the pregnancy continues, it may be because the placenta isn't working properly. This increases the risk of stillbirth.\n\n【23】Problems with a baby's growth should be picked up during antenatal appointments.\n\n【24】Your baby's movements\n---------------------\n\n【25】It's important to be aware of your baby's movements and know what's normal for your baby.\n\n【26】Tell your midwife immediately if you notice the baby's movements slowing down or stopping.

Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Symptoms\n4.  Causes\n5.  Diagnosis\n6.  Treatment\n7.  Complications\n8.  Prevention\n\n【3】**Treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the specific defect you or your child has.**\n\n【4】The majority of congenital heart disease problems are mild heart defects and don't usually need to be treated, although it's likely that you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your health in an outpatient setting throughout life.\n\n【5】More severe heart defects usually require surgery or catheter intervention (where a thin hollow tube is inserted into the heart via an artery) and long-term monitoring of the heart throughout adult life by a congenital heart disease specialist.\n\n【6】In some cases, medications may be used to relieve symptoms or stabilise the condition before and/or after surgery or intervention.\n\n【7】These may include diuretics (water tablets) to remove fluid from the body and make breathing easier, and other medication, such as digoxin to slow down the heartbeat and increase the strength of the heart's pumping function.\n\n【8】Aortic valve stenosis\n---------------------\n\n【9】The urgency for treatment for aortic valve stenosis depends on how narrow the valve is. Treatment may be needed immediately, or it could be delayed until the development of symptoms.\n\n【10】If treatment is required, a procedure called a balloon valvuloplasty is often the recommended treatment option in children and younger people.\n\n【11】During the procedure, a small tube (catheter) is passed through the blood vessels to the site of the narrowed valve. A balloon attached to the catheter is inflated, which helps to stretch or widen the valve and relieve any blockage in blood flow.\n\n【12】If balloon valvuloplasty is ineffective or unsuitable, it's usually necessary to remove and replace the valve using open heart surgery. This is where the surgeon makes a cut in the chest to access the heart.\n\n【13】There are several options for replacing aortic valves, including valves made from animal or human tissue, or your own pulmonary valve. If the pulmonary valve is used, it will be replaced at the same time with a donor pulmonary valve. This type of specialised surgery is known as the Ross procedure. In older children or adults, it's more likely that metal valves will be used.\n\n【14】Some people also develop a leak of the aortic valve which will require monitoring. If the leak starts to cause problems with the heart, the aortic valve will need to be replaced.\n\n【15】Read more about aortic valve replacement.\n\n【16】Coarctation of the aorta\n------------------------\n\n【17】If your child has the more serious form of coarctation of the aorta that develops shortly after birth, surgery to restore the flow of blood through the aorta is usually recommended in the first few days of life.\n\n【18】Several surgical techniques can be used, including:\n\n【19】*   removing the narrowed section of the aorta and reconnecting the 2 remaining ends\n*   inserting a catheter into the aorta and widening it with a balloon or metal tube (stent)\n*   removing sections of blood vessels from other parts of your child's body and using them to create an aorta in the region of the coarctation or bypass around the site of the blockage (this is similar to a coronary artery bypass graft, which is used to treat heart disease)\n\n【20】Sometimes, older children and adults can develop a newly diagnosed coarctation or partial recurrence of the previous blockage. The main goal of treatment will be to control high blood pressure using a combination of diet, exercise and medicine.\n\n【21】Some people will need to have the narrowed section of the aorta widened with a balloon and stent.\n\n【22】Read more about treating high blood pressure.\n\n【23】Ebstein's anomaly\n-----------------\n\n【24】In many cases, Ebstein's anomaly is mild and doesn't require treatment. However, some people may need medicines to help control their heart rate and rhythm. Surgery to repair the abnormal tricuspid valve is usually recommended if the valve is very leaky.\n\n【25】If valve repair surgery is ineffective or unsuitable, a replacement valve may be implanted. If Ebstein's anomaly occurs along with an atrial septal defect, the hole will be closed at the same time.\n\n【26】Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n------------------------------\n\n【27】Some cases of PDA can be treated with medicine shortly after birth.\n\n【28】There are 2 types of medication to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct responsible for PDA. These are indomethacin and a special form of ibuprofen.\n\n【29】If the PDA doesn't close with medication, the duct may be sealed with a coil or plug. These can be implanted using a catheter (keyhole surgery).\n\n【30】Sometimes the duct may need to be tied shut to close it. This is done using open heart surgery.\n\n【31】Pulmonary valve stenosis\n------------------------\n\n【32】Mild pulmonary valve stenosis doesn't require treatment, because it doesn't cause any symptoms or problems.\n\n【33】More severe cases of pulmonary valve stenosis usually require treatment, even if they cause few or no symptoms. This is because there's a high risk of heart failure in later life if it's not treated.\n\n【34】As with aortic valve stenosis, the main treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis is a balloon to the pulmonary valve (valvuloplasty). However, if this is ineffective or the valve isn't suitable for this treatment, surgery may be needed to open the valve (valvotomy) or replace it with an animal or human valve.\n\n【35】Some patients develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart then the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【36】Septal defects\n--------------\n\n【37】The treatment of ventricular and atrial septal defects depends on the size of the hole. No treatment will be required if your child has a small septal defect that doesn't cause any symptoms or stretch on the heart. These types of septal defects have an excellent outcome and don't pose a threat to your child's health.\n\n【38】If your child has a larger ventricular septal defect, surgery is usually recommended to close the hole.\n\n【39】A large atrial septal defect and some types of ventricular septal defect can be closed with a special device inserted with a catheter. If the defect is too big or not suitable for the device, surgery may be needed to close the hole.\n\n【40】Unlike open heart surgery, the catheter procedure doesn't cause any scarring and is associated with just a small bruise in the groin. Recovery is very quick. This procedure is undertaken in specialist units that treat congenital heart problems in children and a small number of additional adult centres.\n\n【41】Single ventricle defects\n------------------------\n\n【42】Tricuspid atresia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome are treated in much the same way.\n\n【43】Shortly after birth, your baby will be given an injection of medicine called prostaglandin. This will encourage the mixing of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. The condition will then need to be treated using a 3-stage procedure.\n\n【44】The first stage is usually performed during the first few days of life. An artificial passage known as a shunt is created between the heart and lungs, so blood can get to the lungs. However, not all babies will need a shunt.\n\n【45】The second stage will be performed when your child is 3 to 6 months old. The surgeon will connect veins that carry oxygen-poor blood from the upper part of the body (superior vena cava) directly to your child's pulmonary artery. This will allow blood to flow into the lungs, where it can be filled with oxygen.\n\n【46】The final stage is usually performed when your child is 18 to 36 months old. It involves connecting the remaining lower body vein (inferior vena cava) to the pulmonary artery, effectively bypassing the heart.\n\n【47】Patients treated in this way with a single ventricle are complex and need lifelong specialist care. There may be significant complications after such complex surgery, which may limit the ability to exercise and shorten life expectancy.\n\n【48】A heart transplant may be recommended for a small number of people but is limited by the lack of available hearts for transplantation.\n\n【49】Read more about the heart transplant waiting list.\n\n【50】Tetralogy of Fallot\n-------------------\n\n【51】Tetralogy of Fallot is treated using surgery. If your baby is born with severe symptoms, surgery may be recommended soon after birth. If the symptoms are less severe, surgery will usually be carried out when your child is 4 to 6 months old.\n\n【52】During the operation, the surgeon will close the hole in the heart and open up the narrowing in the pulmonary valve.\n\n【53】Some people develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart, the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【54】Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】TAPVC is treated with surgery. During the procedure, the surgeon will reconnect the abnormally positioned veins into the correct position in the left atrium.\n\n【56】The timing of surgery will usually depend on whether your child's pulmonary vein (the vein connecting the lungs and heart) is also obstructed or narrowed.\n\n【57】If the pulmonary vein is obstructed, surgery will be performed shortly after birth. If the vein isn't obstructed, surgery can often be postponed until your child is a few weeks or months old.\n\n【58】Transposition of the great arteries\n-----------------------------------\n\n【59】As with treatment for single ventricle defects, your baby will be given an injection of a medication called prostaglandin shortly after birth. This will prevent the passage between the aorta and pulmonary arteries (the ductus arteriosus) closing after birth.\n\n【60】Keeping the ductus arteriosus open means that oxygen-rich blood is able to mix with oxygen-poor blood, which should help relieve your baby's symptoms.\n\n【61】In some cases, it may also be necessary to use a catheter to create a temporary hole in the atrial septum (the wall separating the 2 upper chambers of the heart) to further encourage the mixing of blood.\n\n【62】Once your baby's health has stabilised, it's likely that surgery will be recommended. This should ideally be carried out during the first month of the baby's life. A surgical technique called arterial switch is used, which involves detaching the transposed arteries and reattaching them in the correct position.\n\n【63】Truncus arteriosus\n------------------\n\n【64】Your baby may be given medicines to help stabilise their condition. Once your baby is in a stable condition, surgery will be used to treat truncus arteriosus. This is usually carried out within a few weeks of birth.\n\n【65】The abnormal blood vessel will be split to create 2 new blood vessels, and each one will be reconnected in the correct position.\n\n【66】Exercise\n--------\n\n【67】In the past, children with congenital heart disease were discouraged from exercising. However, exercise is now believed to improve health, boost self-esteem and help prevent problems developing in later life.\n\n【68】Even if your child can't do strenuous exercise, they can still benefit from a more limited programme of physical activity, such as walking or, in some cases, swimming.\n\n【69】Your child's heart specialist can give you more detailed advice about the right level of physical activity that's suitable for your child.\n\n【70】Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021  \nNext review due: 07 September 2024\n\n【71】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Complications", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【15】Read more about aortic valve replacement.", "content": "【0】Treatment \\- Congenital heart disease\n=====================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

If the leak starts to cause problems with the heart, the aortic valve will need to be replaced.\n\n【15】Read more about aortic valve replacement.\n\n【16】Coarctation of the aorta\n------------------------\n\n【17】If your child has the more serious form of coarctation of the aorta that develops shortly after birth, surgery to restore the flow of blood through the aorta is usually recommended in the first few days of life.\n\n【18】Several surgical techniques can be used, including:\n\n【19】*   removing the narrowed section of the aorta and reconnecting the 2 remaining ends\n*   inserting a catheter into the aorta and widening it with a balloon or metal tube (stent)\n*   removing sections of blood vessels from other parts of your child's body and using them to create an aorta in the region of the coarctation or bypass around the site of the blockage (this is similar to a coronary artery bypass graft, which is used to treat heart disease)\n\n【20】Sometimes, older children and adults can develop a newly diagnosed coarctation or partial recurrence of the previous blockage. The main goal of treatment will be to control high blood pressure using a combination of diet, exercise and medicine.\n\n【21】Some people will need to have the narrowed section of the aorta widened with a balloon and stent.\n\n【22】Read more about treating high blood pressure.\n\n【23】Ebstein's anomaly\n-----------------\n\n【24】In many cases, Ebstein's anomaly is mild and doesn't require treatment. However, some people may need medicines to help control their heart rate and rhythm. Surgery to repair the abnormal tricuspid valve is usually recommended if the valve is very leaky.\n\n【25】If valve repair surgery is ineffective or unsuitable, a replacement valve may be implanted. If Ebstein's anomaly occurs along with an atrial septal defect, the hole will be closed at the same time.\n\n【26】Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n------------------------------\n\n【27】Some cases of PDA can be treated with medicine shortly after birth.\n\n【28】There are 2 types of medication to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct responsible for PDA. These are indomethacin and a special form of ibuprofen.\n\n【29】If the PDA doesn't close with medication, the duct may be sealed with a coil or plug. These can be implanted using a catheter (keyhole surgery).\n\n【30】Sometimes the duct may need to be tied shut to close it. This is done using open heart surgery.\n\n【31】Pulmonary valve stenosis\n------------------------\n\n【32】Mild pulmonary valve stenosis doesn't require treatment, because it doesn't cause any symptoms or problems.\n\n【33】More severe cases of pulmonary valve stenosis usually require treatment, even if they cause few or no symptoms. This is because there's a high risk of heart failure in later life if it's not treated.\n\n【34】As with aortic valve stenosis, the main treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis is a balloon to the pulmonary valve (valvuloplasty). However, if this is ineffective or the valve isn't suitable for this treatment, surgery may be needed to open the valve (valvotomy) or replace it with an animal or human valve.\n\n【35】Some patients develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart then the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【36】Septal defects\n--------------\n\n【37】The treatment of ventricular and atrial septal defects depends on the size of the hole. No treatment will be required if your child has a small septal defect that doesn't cause any symptoms or stretch on the heart. These types of septal defects have an excellent outcome and don't pose a threat to your child's health.\n\n【38】If your child has a larger ventricular septal defect, surgery is usually recommended to close the hole.\n\n【39】A large atrial septal defect and some types of ventricular septal defect can be closed with a special device inserted with a catheter. If the defect is too big or not suitable for the device, surgery may be needed to close the hole.\n\n【40】Unlike open heart surgery, the catheter procedure doesn't cause any scarring and is associated with just a small bruise in the groin. Recovery is very quick. This procedure is undertaken in specialist units that treat congenital heart problems in children and a small number of additional adult centres.\n\n【41】Single ventricle defects\n------------------------\n\n【42】Tricuspid atresia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome are treated in much the same way.\n\n【43】Shortly after birth, your baby will be given an injection of medicine called prostaglandin. This will encourage the mixing of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. The condition will then need to be treated using a 3-stage procedure.\n\n【44】The first stage is usually performed during the first few days of life. An artificial passage known as a shunt is created between the heart and lungs, so blood can get to the lungs. However, not all babies will need a shunt.\n\n【45】The second stage will be performed when your child is 3 to 6 months old. The surgeon will connect veins that carry oxygen-poor blood from the upper part of the body (superior vena cava) directly to your child's pulmonary artery. This will allow blood to flow into the lungs, where it can be filled with oxygen.\n\n【46】The final stage is usually performed when your child is 18 to 36 months old. It involves connecting the remaining lower body vein (inferior vena cava) to the pulmonary artery, effectively bypassing the heart.\n\n【47】Patients treated in this way with a single ventricle are complex and need lifelong specialist care. There may be significant complications after such complex surgery, which may limit the ability to exercise and shorten life expectancy.\n\n【48】A heart transplant may be recommended for a small number of people but is limited by the lack of available hearts for transplantation.\n\n【49】Read more about the heart transplant waiting list.\n\n【50】Tetralogy of Fallot\n-------------------\n\n【51】Tetralogy of Fallot is treated using surgery. If your baby is born with severe symptoms, surgery may be recommended soon after birth. If the symptoms are less severe, surgery will usually be carried out when your child is 4 to 6 months old.\n\n【52】During the operation, the surgeon will close the hole in the heart and open up the narrowing in the pulmonary valve.\n\n【53】Some people develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart, the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【54】Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】TAPVC is treated with surgery. During the procedure, the surgeon will reconnect the abnormally positioned veins into the correct position in the left atrium.\n\n【56】The timing of surgery will usually depend on whether your child's pulmonary vein (the vein connecting the lungs and heart) is also obstructed or narrowed.\n\n【57】If the pulmonary vein is obstructed, surgery will be performed shortly after birth. If the vein isn't obstructed, surgery can often be postponed until your child is a few weeks or months old.\n\n【58】Transposition of the great arteries\n-----------------------------------\n\n【59】As with treatment for single ventricle defects, your baby will be given an injection of a medication called prostaglandin shortly after birth. This will prevent the passage between the aorta and pulmonary arteries (the ductus arteriosus) closing after birth.\n\n【60】Keeping the ductus arteriosus open means that oxygen-rich blood is able to mix with oxygen-poor blood, which should help relieve your baby's symptoms.\n\n【61】In some cases, it may also be necessary to use a catheter to create a temporary hole in the atrial septum (the wall separating the 2 upper chambers of the heart) to further encourage the mixing of blood.\n\n【62】Once your baby's health has stabilised, it's likely that surgery will be recommended. This should ideally be carried out during the first month of the baby's life. A surgical technique called arterial switch is used, which involves detaching the transposed arteries and reattaching them in the correct position.\n\n【63】Truncus arteriosus\n------------------\n\n【64】Your baby may be given medicines to help stabilise their condition. Once your baby is in a stable condition, surgery will be used to treat truncus arteriosus. This is usually carried out within a few weeks of birth.\n\n【65】The abnormal blood vessel will be split to create 2 new blood vessels, and each one will be reconnected in the correct position.\n\n【66】Exercise\n--------\n\n【67】In the past, children with congenital heart disease were discouraged from exercising. However, exercise is now believed to improve health, boost self-esteem and help prevent problems developing in later life.\n\n【68】Even if your child can't do strenuous exercise, they can still benefit from a more limited programme of physical activity, such as walking or, in some cases, swimming.\n\n【69】Your child's heart specialist can give you more detailed advice about the right level of physical activity that's suitable for your child.\n\n【70】Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021  \nNext review due: 07 September 2024\n\n【71】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Complications", "index": 2578, "show": true, "start": 2578, "end": 2623, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【22】Read more about treating high blood pressure.", "content": "【0】Treatment \\- Congenital heart disease\n=====================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

Treatment may be needed immediately, or it could be delayed until the development of symptoms.\n\n【10】If treatment is required, a procedure called a balloon valvuloplasty is often the recommended treatment option in children and younger people.\n\n【11】During the procedure, a small tube (catheter) is passed through the blood vessels to the site of the narrowed valve. A balloon attached to the catheter is inflated, which helps to stretch or widen the valve and relieve any blockage in blood flow.\n\n【12】If balloon valvuloplasty is ineffective or unsuitable, it's usually necessary to remove and replace the valve using open heart surgery.

A surgical technique called arterial switch is used, which involves detaching the transposed arteries and reattaching them in the correct position.\n\n【63】Truncus arteriosus\n------------------\n\n【64】Your baby may be given medicines to help stabilise their condition. Once your baby is in a stable condition, surgery will be used to treat truncus arteriosus. This is usually carried out within a few weeks of birth.\n\n【65】The abnormal blood vessel will be split to create 2 new blood vessels, and each one will be reconnected in the correct position.\n\n【66】Exercise\n--------\n\n【67】In the past, children with congenital heart disease were discouraged from exercising. However, exercise is now believed to improve health, boost self-esteem and help prevent problems developing in later life.\n\n【68】Even if your child can't do strenuous exercise, they can still benefit from a more limited programme of physical activity, such as walking or, in some cases, swimming.\n\n【69】Your child's heart specialist can give you more detailed advice about the right level of physical activity that's suitable for your child.\n\n【70】Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021  \nNext review due: 07 September 2024\n\n【71】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Complications", "index": 8506, "show": true, "start": 8480, "end": 8534, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【70】Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021\n\nNext review due: 07 September 2024\n\n【71】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n\nNext : Complications", "content": "【0】Treatment \\- Congenital heart disease\n=====================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.  Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Symptoms\n4.  Causes\n5.  Diagnosis\n6.  Treatment\n7.  Complications\n8.  Prevention\n\n【3】**Treatment for congenital heart disease depends on the specific defect you or your child has.**\n\n【4】The majority of congenital heart disease problems are mild heart defects and don't usually need to be treated, although it's likely that you'll have regular check-ups to monitor your health in an outpatient setting throughout life.\n\n【5】More severe heart defects usually require surgery or catheter intervention (where a thin hollow tube is inserted into the heart via an artery) and long-term monitoring of the heart throughout adult life by a congenital heart disease specialist.\n\n【6】In some cases, medications may be used to relieve symptoms or stabilise the condition before and/or after surgery or intervention.\n\n【7】These may include diuretics (water tablets) to remove fluid from the body and make breathing easier, and other medication, such as digoxin to slow down the heartbeat and increase the strength of the heart's pumping function.\n\n【8】Aortic valve stenosis\n---------------------\n\n【9】The urgency for treatment for aortic valve stenosis depends on how narrow the valve is. Treatment may be needed immediately, or it could be delayed until the development of symptoms.\n\n【10】If treatment is required, a procedure called a balloon valvuloplasty is often the recommended treatment option in children and younger people.\n\n【11】During the procedure, a small tube (catheter) is passed through the blood vessels to the site of the narrowed valve. A balloon attached to the catheter is inflated, which helps to stretch or widen the valve and relieve any blockage in blood flow.\n\n【12】If balloon valvuloplasty is ineffective or unsuitable, it's usually necessary to remove and replace the valve using open heart surgery. This is where the surgeon makes a cut in the chest to access the heart.\n\n【13】There are several options for replacing aortic valves, including valves made from animal or human tissue, or your own pulmonary valve. If the pulmonary valve is used, it will be replaced at the same time with a donor pulmonary valve. This type of specialised surgery is known as the Ross procedure. In older children or adults, it's more likely that metal valves will be used.\n\n【14】Some people also develop a leak of the aortic valve which will require monitoring. If the leak starts to cause problems with the heart, the aortic valve will need to be replaced.\n\n<mark>【15】Read more about aortic valve replacement.</mark>\n\n【16】Coarctation of the aorta\n------------------------\n\n【17】If your child has the more serious form of coarctation of the aorta that develops shortly after birth, surgery to restore the flow of blood through the aorta is usually recommended in the first few days of life.\n\n【18】Several surgical techniques can be used, including:\n\n【19】*   removing the narrowed section of the aorta and reconnecting the 2 remaining ends\n*   inserting a catheter into the aorta and widening it with a balloon or metal tube (stent)\n*   removing sections of blood vessels from other parts of your child's body and using them to create an aorta in the region of the coarctation or bypass around the site of the blockage (this is similar to a coronary artery bypass graft, which is used to treat heart disease)\n\n【20】Sometimes, older children and adults can develop a newly diagnosed coarctation or partial recurrence of the previous blockage. The main goal of treatment will be to control high blood pressure using a combination of diet, exercise and medicine.\n\n【21】Some people will need to have the narrowed section of the aorta widened with a balloon and stent.\n\n<mark>【22】Read more about treating high blood pressure.</mark>\n\n【23】Ebstein's anomaly\n-----------------\n\n【24】In many cases, Ebstein's anomaly is mild and doesn't require treatment. However, some people may need medicines to help control their heart rate and rhythm. Surgery to repair the abnormal tricuspid valve is usually recommended if the valve is very leaky.\n\n【25】If valve repair surgery is ineffective or unsuitable, a replacement valve may be implanted. If Ebstein's anomaly occurs along with an atrial septal defect, the hole will be closed at the same time.\n\n【26】Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n------------------------------\n\n【27】Some cases of PDA can be treated with medicine shortly after birth.\n\n【28】There are 2 types of medication to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct responsible for PDA. These are indomethacin and a special form of ibuprofen.\n\n【29】If the PDA doesn't close with medication, the duct may be sealed with a coil or plug. These can be implanted using a catheter (keyhole surgery).\n\n【30】Sometimes the duct may need to be tied shut to close it. This is done using open heart surgery.\n\n【31】Pulmonary valve stenosis\n------------------------\n\n【32】Mild pulmonary valve stenosis doesn't require treatment, because it doesn't cause any symptoms or problems.\n\n【33】More severe cases of pulmonary valve stenosis usually require treatment, even if they cause few or no symptoms. This is because there's a high risk of heart failure in later life if it's not treated.\n\n【34】As with aortic valve stenosis, the main treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis is a balloon to the pulmonary valve (valvuloplasty). However, if this is ineffective or the valve isn't suitable for this treatment, surgery may be needed to open the valve (valvotomy) or replace it with an animal or human valve.\n\n【35】Some patients develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of pulmonary valve stenosis. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart then the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【36】Septal defects\n--------------\n\n【37】The treatment of ventricular and atrial septal defects depends on the size of the hole. No treatment will be required if your child has a small septal defect that doesn't cause any symptoms or stretch on the heart. These types of septal defects have an excellent outcome and don't pose a threat to your child's health.\n\n【38】If your child has a larger ventricular septal defect, surgery is usually recommended to close the hole.\n\n【39】A large atrial septal defect and some types of ventricular septal defect can be closed with a special device inserted with a catheter. If the defect is too big or not suitable for the device, surgery may be needed to close the hole.\n\n【40】Unlike open heart surgery, the catheter procedure doesn't cause any scarring and is associated with just a small bruise in the groin. Recovery is very quick. This procedure is undertaken in specialist units that treat congenital heart problems in children and a small number of additional adult centres.\n\n【41】Single ventricle defects\n------------------------\n\n【42】Tricuspid atresia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome are treated in much the same way.\n\n【43】Shortly after birth, your baby will be given an injection of medicine called prostaglandin. This will encourage the mixing of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. The condition will then need to be treated using a 3-stage procedure.\n\n【44】The first stage is usually performed during the first few days of life. An artificial passage known as a shunt is created between the heart and lungs, so blood can get to the lungs. However, not all babies will need a shunt.\n\n【45】The second stage will be performed when your child is 3 to 6 months old. The surgeon will connect veins that carry oxygen-poor blood from the upper part of the body (superior vena cava) directly to your child's pulmonary artery. This will allow blood to flow into the lungs, where it can be filled with oxygen.\n\n【46】The final stage is usually performed when your child is 18 to 36 months old. It involves connecting the remaining lower body vein (inferior vena cava) to the pulmonary artery, effectively bypassing the heart.\n\n【47】Patients treated in this way with a single ventricle are complex and need lifelong specialist care. There may be significant complications after such complex surgery, which may limit the ability to exercise and shorten life expectancy.\n\n【48】A heart transplant may be recommended for a small number of people but is limited by the lack of available hearts for transplantation.\n\n<mark>【49】Read more about the heart transplant waiting list.</mark>\n\n【50】Tetralogy of Fallot\n-------------------\n\n【51】Tetralogy of Fallot is treated using surgery. If your baby is born with severe symptoms, surgery may be recommended soon after birth. If the symptoms are less severe, surgery will usually be carried out when your child is 4 to 6 months old.\n\n【52】During the operation, the surgeon will close the hole in the heart and open up the narrowing in the pulmonary valve.\n\n【53】Some people develop leaking of the pulmonary valve after treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot. This will require ongoing monitoring and if the leak starts to cause a problem with the heart, the valve will need to be replaced. This can be performed with open heart surgery or, increasingly, using catheter intervention which is a much less invasive procedure.\n\n【54】Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】TAPVC is treated with surgery. During the procedure, the surgeon will reconnect the abnormally positioned veins into the correct position in the left atrium.\n\n【56】The timing of surgery will usually depend on whether your child's pulmonary vein (the vein connecting the lungs and heart) is also obstructed or narrowed.\n\n【57】If the pulmonary vein is obstructed, surgery will be performed shortly after birth. If the vein isn't obstructed, surgery can often be postponed until your child is a few weeks or months old.\n\n【58】Transposition of the great arteries\n-----------------------------------\n\n【59】As with treatment for single ventricle defects, your baby will be given an injection of a medication called prostaglandin shortly after birth. This will prevent the passage between the aorta and pulmonary arteries (the ductus arteriosus) closing after birth.\n\n【60】Keeping the ductus arteriosus open means that oxygen-rich blood is able to mix with oxygen-poor blood, which should help relieve your baby's symptoms.\n\n【61】In some cases, it may also be necessary to use a catheter to create a temporary hole in the atrial septum (the wall separating the 2 upper chambers of the heart) to further encourage the mixing of blood.\n\n【62】Once your baby's health has stabilised, it's likely that surgery will be recommended. This should ideally be carried out during the first month of the baby's life. A surgical technique called arterial switch is used, which involves detaching the transposed arteries and reattaching them in the correct position.\n\n【63】Truncus arteriosus\n------------------\n\n【64】Your baby may be given medicines to help stabilise their condition. Once your baby is in a stable condition, surgery will be used to treat truncus arteriosus. This is usually carried out within a few weeks of birth.\n\n【65】The abnormal blood vessel will be split to create 2 new blood vessels, and each one will be reconnected in the correct position.\n\n【66】Exercise\n--------\n\n【67】In the past, children with congenital heart disease were discouraged from exercising. However, exercise is now believed to improve health, boost self-esteem and help prevent problems developing in later life.\n\n【68】Even if your child can't do strenuous exercise, they can still benefit from a more limited programme of physical activity, such as walking or, in some cases, swimming.\n\n【69】Your child's heart specialist can give you more detailed advice about the right level of physical activity that's suitable for your child.\n\n【70】Page last reviewed: 07 September 2021  \nNext review due: 07 September 2024\n\n【71】*   Previous : Diagnosis\n*   Next : Complications", "index": 11952, "show": true, "start": 11913, "end": 12042, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:39:29", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:41:07", "cost": 97.612}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:48", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:41:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:39:29"}

Prevention\n\n【3】**The causes of breast cancer are not fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.**\n\n【4】However, there are risk factors known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you cannot do anything about, but there are some you can change.\n\n【5】Age\n---\n\n【6】The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common in women over age 50 who have been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer happen in women over 50.\n\n【7】All women who are 50 to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme.\n\n【8】Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.\n\n【9】Find out more about breast screening.\n\n【10】Family history\n--------------\n\n【11】If you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【12】However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it's possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.\n\n【13】Most cases of breast cancer do not run in families, but genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It's possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. \n\n【14】The genes TP53 and CHEK2, are also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n【15】Speak to a GP if breast or ovarian cancer runs in your family and you're worried you may get it too. They may refer you for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer-risk genes.\n\n【16】Find out more about predictive genetic tests for cancer-risk genes.\n\n【17】Previous breast cancer or lump\n------------------------------\n\n【18】If you have previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast.\n\n【19】A benign breast lump does not mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of breast lumps may slightly increase your risk of developing cancer.\n\n【20】Some benign changes in your breast tissue, such as cells growing abnormally in ducts (atypical ductal hyperplasia), or abnormal cells inside your breast lobes (lobular carcinoma in situ), can make getting breast cancer more likely.\n\n【21】Dense breast tissue\n-------------------\n\n【22】Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules) that produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser.\n\n【23】Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer as there are more cells that can become cancerous.\n\n【24】Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, as any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue are harder to see.\n\n【25】Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.\n\n【26】Hormones and hormone medicine\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】### Exposure to oestrogen\n\n【28】The female hormone oestrogen can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow.\n\n【29】The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start puberty, to regulate your periods.\n\n【30】Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to.\n\n【31】For example, if you started having periods at a young age and experienced the menopause later than average, you will have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time.\n\n【32】In the same way, not having children or having children later in life may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is not interrupted by pregnancy.\n\n【33】### Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\n【34】Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【35】All types of HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, except for vaginal oestrogen.\n\n【36】There is no increased risk of breast cancer if you take HRT for less than 1 year.\n\n【37】But if you take HRT for longer than 1 year, you have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who never use HRT.\n\n【38】The increased risk of breast cancer falls after you stop taking HRT, but some increased risk remains for more than 10 years compared to women who have never used HRT.\n\n【39】Find out more about the risks of HRT.\n\n【40】### Contraceptive pill\n\n【41】Research shows that women who take the contraceptive pill have a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【42】However, the risk starts to decrease once you stop taking the pill, and your risk of breast cancer is back to normal 10 years after stopping.\n\n【43】Cancer Research UK has more information about the contraceptive pill and cancer risk.\n\n【44】Lifestyle factors\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Being overweight or obese\n\n【46】If you have experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【47】This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, as being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.\n\n【48】### Alcohol\n\n【49】Drinking alcohol increases the risk of getting breast cancer.\n\n【50】People who drink even small amounts of alcohol on a regular basis have a greater risk of getting breast cancer than people who do not drink alcohol at all. The more alcohol you drink, the more your risk of getting breast cancer increases.\n\n【51】Radiation\n---------\n\n【52】Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【53】If you had radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma you should have already received a letter from the Department of Health and Social Care inviting you for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【54】See your GP if you were not contacted or if you did not attend a consultation. You're usually entitled to have your breast checked with an MRI scan.\n\n【55】If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.\n\n【56】Want to know more?\n------------------\n\n【57】*   Breast Cancer Now: the causes of breast cancer\n*   Cancer Research UK: breast cancer risks and causes\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: understanding breast cancer\n\n【58】Page last reviewed: 28 October 2019  \nNext review due: 28 October 2022\n\n【59】*   Previous : Symptoms\n*   Next : Diagnosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Want to know more?\n【57】*   Breast Cancer Now: the causes of breast cancer\n\nCancer Research UK: breast cancer risks and causes\nMacmillan Cancer Support: understanding breast cancer\n【58】Page last reviewed: 28 October 2019\n\nNext review due: 28 October 2022\n\n【59】*   Previous : Symptoms\n\nNext : Diagnosis", "content": "【0】Causes \\- Breast cancer in women\n================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

They may refer you for an NHS genetic test, which will tell you if you have inherited one of the cancer-risk genes.\n\n【16】Find out more about predictive genetic tests for cancer-risk genes.\n\n【17】Previous breast cancer or lump\n------------------------------\n\n【18】If you have previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast.\n\n【19】A benign breast lump does not mean you have breast cancer, but certain types of breast lumps may slightly increase your risk of developing cancer.\n\n【20】Some benign changes in your breast tissue, such as cells growing abnormally in ducts (atypical ductal hyperplasia), or abnormal cells inside your breast lobes (lobular carcinoma in situ), can make getting breast cancer more likely.\n\n【21】Dense breast tissue\n-------------------\n\n【22】Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules) that produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser.\n\n【23】Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer as there are more cells that can become cancerous.\n\n【24】Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, as any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue are harder to see.\n\n【25】Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.\n\n【26】Hormones and hormone medicine\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】### Exposure to oestrogen\n\n【28】The female hormone oestrogen can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to grow.\n\n【29】The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start puberty, to regulate your periods.\n\n【30】Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen your body is exposed to.\n\n【31】For example, if you started having periods at a young age and experienced the menopause later than average, you will have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time.\n\n【32】In the same way, not having children or having children later in life may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is not interrupted by pregnancy.\n\n【33】### Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\n【34】Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【35】All types of HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, except for vaginal oestrogen.\n\n【36】There is no increased risk of breast cancer if you take HRT for less than 1 year.\n\n【37】But if you take HRT for longer than 1 year, you have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who never use HRT.\n\n【38】The increased risk of breast cancer falls after you stop taking HRT, but some increased risk remains for more than 10 years compared to women who have never used HRT.\n\n【39】Find out more about the risks of HRT.\n\n【40】### Contraceptive pill\n\n【41】Research shows that women who take the contraceptive pill have a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【42】However, the risk starts to decrease once you stop taking the pill, and your risk of breast cancer is back to normal 10 years after stopping.\n\n【43】Cancer Research UK has more information about the contraceptive pill and cancer risk.\n\n【44】Lifestyle factors\n-----------------\n\n【45】### Being overweight or obese\n\n【46】If you have experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【47】This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, as being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.\n\n【48】### Alcohol\n\n【49】Drinking alcohol increases the risk of getting breast cancer.\n\n【50】People who drink even small amounts of alcohol on a regular basis have a greater risk of getting breast cancer than people who do not drink alcohol at all. The more alcohol you drink, the more your risk of getting breast cancer increases.\n\n【51】Radiation\n---------\n\n【52】Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【53】If you had radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma you should have already received a letter from the Department of Health and Social Care inviting you for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer.\n\n【54】See your GP if you were not contacted or if you did not attend a consultation. You're usually entitled to have your breast checked with an MRI scan.\n\n【55】If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.\n\n【56】Want to know more?\n------------------\n\n【57】*   Breast Cancer Now: the causes of breast cancer\n*   Cancer Research UK: breast cancer risks and causes\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: understanding breast cancer\n\n【58】Page last reviewed: 28 October 2019  \nNext review due: 28 October 2022\n\n【59】*   Previous : Symptoms\n*   Next : Diagnosis", "index": 6666, "show": true, "start": 6666, "end": 6966, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 09:44:56", "endTime": "2024/09/02 09:47:18", "cost": 142.14}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:48", "update_time": "2024-09-01 17:47:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 17:44:48"}

How to cope with side effects of methylphenidate\n7.  Cautions with other medicines\n8.  Common questions about methylphendiate for children\n\n【3】1\\. About methylphenidate for children\n--------------------------------------\n\n【4】Methylphenidate belongs to a group of medicines, called stimulants. They work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that help control attention and behaviour.\n\n【5】Methylphenidate is used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It helps with hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour, and allows them to concentrate better. It is also used to treat adults with ADHD or narcolepsy (a sleep disorder).\n\n【6】Methylphenidate is only available on prescription. It comes as standard (immediate release) tablets and capsules and slow release (also called extended, modified or prolonged release) tablets and capsules.\n\n【7】Some children may need to take both slow release and standard methylphenidate to help improve their ADHD.\n\n【8】For adults aged 18 and over, read our information on methylphenidate for adults.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Methylphenidate is a controlled drug, which means that you may have to prove your identity when collecting your prescription. Collect your prescription within 28 days.\n*   If your child takes slow release methylphenidate, give it to them once a day. If they are taking standard tablets or capsules, your doctor may recommend giving it up to 3 times a day.\n*   It's best to stick to the same brand, particularly if your child has slow release methylphenidate. Different brands work differently in how they release the medicine into the body, and this can affect how they work to manage your child's symptoms.\n*   Methylphenidate makes your child less hyperactive and impulsive, and helps them concentrate.\n*   Methylphenidate for children is also known by the brand names Matoride, Tranquilin, Xaggitin and Xenidate.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take methylphenidate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Methylphenidate can be taken by most children aged 4 and over, although, it is not suitable for all children. Tell your child's doctor before they start taking this medicine if:\n\n【13】*   they have ever had an allergic reaction to methylphenidate or any other medicine\n*   they have difficulty swallowing, as some brands may not be suitable\n*   they have heart problems\n*   they have an overactive thyroid\n*   have a tumour in the adrenal gland (phaeochromocytoma)\n*   they have mental health problems (or a close family member has mental health problems)\n*   they have high blood pressure or problems with their blood vessels, such as vasculitis\n*   they have epilepsy\n*   they have sudden muscle twitches in their face or body (tics), or there is a close family member with Tourette's syndrome\n*   either they or a a close family member has glaucoma\n\n【14】4\\. How and when to give methylphenidate to children\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Always follow the advice of your child's doctor and the instructions that come with the medicine. Different brands of methylphenidate tablets and capsules may have different instructions.\n\n【16】### Dosage\n\n【17】The usual dose of methylphenidate depends on whether your child has standard or slow release medicine. In some cases, the specialist may prescribe both.\n\n【18】Although standard tablets and capsules are sometimes called immediate release, they can still take a while to start working.\n\n【19】Slow release tablets and capsules are sometimes called extended release, modified release, or prolonged release. These tablets and capsules let the medicine pass into your child's body gradually.\n\n【20】#### Dose for standard tablets and capsules\n\n【21】The usual starting dose for children is 5mg, given once or twice a day. Your doctor may increase your child's dose gradually (usually weekly) until they find the dose that works best. Your child may need to take it 2 or 3 times a day.\n\n【22】Give your child their methylphenidate first thing in the morning. If they have a second dose, give it to them at around lunchtime (early afternoon) and, if prescribed, a third dose in the late afternoon or evening.\n\n【23】Try to leave at least 4 hours between doses. If your child has a third dose, try to give it to them at least 4 hours before bedtime so it does not affect their sleep.\n\n【24】Although they are called immediate release, it can still take a while for the medicine to work. You may not see any changes in behaviour straight away.\n\n【25】Let your child's school know if they need to take their medicine during the school day.\n\n【26】#### Dose for slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【27】Slow release tablets and capsules start to work with a first release of the medicine into the body. After that, the medicine continues to release into the body more slowly.\n\n【28】The usual starting dose for:\n\n【29】*   **tablets** is 18mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may gradually increase the dose by 18mg at a time (usually weekly, up to 54mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n*   **capsules** is 10mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may increase the dose gradually (usually weekly, up to 60mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n\n【30】Check the leaflet that comes with the medicine for when to give it and whether it should be taken with food.\n\n【31】If your child is taking Equasym XL, give them their medicine about 30 minutes before breakfast. If they're taking Medikinet XL, give it to them with or after breakfast.\n\n【32】### How to give children tablets or capsules\n\n【33】Give your child the tablets or capsules with a drink of water, milk or juice. Tell them to swallow the medicine whole, not chew it.\n\n【34】If your child has problems swallowing pills, then it's OK to crush standard tablets (Medikinet or Ritalin). Mix the crushed tablets with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【35】#### Important\n\n【36】Do not crush or break slow release tablets because the medicine will not work properly.\n\n【37】However, if your child takes slow release capsules, you can open the capsule and mix the contents with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【38】Give your child the mixture straight away and tell them to swallow it without chewing.\n\n【39】### Will their dose go up or down?\n\n【40】Your child will usually start on a low dose of methylphenidate, taken once or twice a day. The doctor will increase the dose gradually, until they find the dose that works best for your child.\n\n【41】If your child starts on standard methylphenidate, the doctor may later switch them to slow release methylphenidate. They only have to take this once a day.\n\n【42】### How long will they take it for?\n\n【43】If methylphenidate is working well to control your child's symptoms, they might need to take it for several months or even years. However, it's not usually a life-long medicine.\n\n【44】Your doctor will usually monitor how your child is every 6 months. This gives them a better idea about how your child is getting on with their medicine and whether they still need it.\n\n【45】### What if my child is sick?\n\n【46】If your child is sick (vomits) less than 30 minutes after taking their methylphenidate, give them the same dose again.\n\n【47】If it’s more than 30 minutes after taking their medicine, do not give your child another dose, just wait until their next dose is due.\n\n【48】If your child is sick again, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【49】### What if I forget to give a dose?\n\n【50】If you forget to give your child their medicine, skip the missed dose and wait until it’s time for the next dose. Give them the next dose as usual.\n\n【51】Never give them a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【52】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to give your child their medicine.\n\n【53】### What if they take too much?\n\n【54】The amount of methylphenidate that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【55】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【56】Your child takes too much methylphenidate and has:\n\n【57】*   a seizure or fit (uncontrollable jerking and shaking)\n*   a fast, slow or uneven heart beat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating faster or slower than normal or may say it is racing\n\n【58】Take the methylphenidate packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【59】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【60】*   your child takes more than their prescribed dose of methylphenidate\n\n【61】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【62】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【63】#### Important\n\n【64】Keep methylphenidate in a cupboard. Make sure children cannot see or reach this medicine.\n\n【65】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【66】Like all medicines, methylphenidate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【67】### Common side effects\n\n【68】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people:\n\n【69】*   headaches\n*   feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense\n*   trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n*   loss of appetite – this can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain\n*   stomach ache\n*   dry mouth\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【70】Keep giving your child the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother your child or do not go away:\n\n【71】### Serious side effects\n\n【72】Serious side effects are uncommon and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【73】Tell your doctor straight away if your child:\n\n【74】*   has changes in mood or personality\n*   has thoughts about harming themselves\n*   has a fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating much faster than normal or may say it is racing\n*   starts seeing, feeling or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)\n*   has started to get facial tics – these are quick, little movements in the muscles of the face that cannot be controlled and are sudden, if this starts happening, their doctor will stop your treatment\n\n【75】Methylphenidate can also cause a small increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. For this reason, your doctor will usually measure your child’s blood pressure and pulse every 6 months.\n\n【76】#### Growth in children\n\n【77】If your child takes methylphenidate for longer than a year, it can slow down their growth. However this happens in less than 1 in 10 children.\n\n【78】Your doctor will check your child’s height, weight and appetite every 6 months to make sure they are growing OK.\n\n【79】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【80】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to methylphenidate.\n\n【81】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【82】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【83】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【84】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【85】These are not all the side effects of methylphenidate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside the medicine packet.\n\n【86】Information:\n\n【87】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【88】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【89】6\\. How to cope with side effects of methylphenidate\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【90】**What to do about:**\n\n【91】*   **headaches** – make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids. Painkillers such as paracetamol (Calpol) can help. Talk to your doctor if your child's headaches are severe or do not go away.\n*   **feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense** – this may go away as your child gets used to the medicine. If it does not, speak to your doctor. They may want to recommend a lower dose or try a different medicine.\n*   **trouble sleeping** – if your child is finding it hard to sleep, try giving the last dose at least 6 hours before bedtime. Speak to your doctor if this does not help. They may want to try slow release instead.\n*   **loss of appetite** – it may help to give them methylphenidate with a meal. You may notice they lose some weight during the first few months of treatment. Your child will probably put this weight back on once they are used to the medicine. If you notice they are losing a lot of weight speak to your doctor.\n*   **dry mouth** – this usually improves quite quickly. It may help to give them small sips of water and citrus fruits like oranges or satsumas.\n*   **feeling or being sick** – stick to simple meals and do not give your child rich or spicy food if they feel sick. It might help to give them their methylphenidate with or after a meal or snack. If they are being sick, encourage them to take small, frequent sips of water or squash to avoid dehydration. If your child keeps being sick or having severe stomach pains, see a doctor.\n\n【92】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】There are some medicines that can affect the way methylphenidate works.\n\n【94】If your child is taking any of the following medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them methylphenidate:\n\n【95】*   medicines to treat depression or other mental health problems\n*   medicines for epilepsy\n*   blood pressure medicines\n*   medicines that treat or prevent blood clots\n*   medicines for coughs and colds\n\n【96】Some cough and cold medicines can affect blood pressure so speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're buying these for your child. It’s important to check whether they are OK for them to have while taking methylphenidate.\n\n【97】### Mixing methylphenidate with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【98】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking methylphenidate. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving any to your child.\n\n【99】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD.

Common questions about methylphendiate for children\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【103】How does methylphenidate work?\n\n【104】Methylphenidate belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants. They increase activity in the brain, particularly in areas that help control attention and behaviour.\n\n【105】It's not known exactly how methylphenidate works. It's thought to boost the levels of chemicals called dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain.\n\n【106】This can increase activity in the parts of your child's brain that control attention and behaviour.\n\n【107】This makes them less hyperactive or impulsive. It will also help them to pay attention and concentrate better.\n\n【108】How long does it take to work?\n\n【109】When your child first starts taking methylphenidate they will be on a low dose. Your doctor will usually increase this gradually until they find the dose that works for your child.\n\n【110】This means it might take a few weeks before you see any benefits. When your doctor has found the right dose, methylphenidate should start to work within 30 to 60 minutes of your child taking it.\n\n【111】The medicine makes your child less hyperactive or impulsive, and helps their concentration. How quickly it works depends on whether it's standard or slow release.\n\n【112】How long will my child take it for?\n\n【113】Your child may need to take methylphenidate for several months or even years. They will not usually need to take it for the rest of their life.\n\n【114】Your child will have regular check-ups, usually every 6 months or so.\n\n【115】Your doctor may recommend stopping methylphenidate for a while, or reducing the dose. This will normally be during the school holidays and can be called “a medicine break”. This is to check whether it’s still helping.\n\n【116】As your child gets to puberty, or just after, the doctor may stop their methylphenidate. But if the medicine is still helping, they may recommend that your child keep taking it, even as an adult.\n\n【117】Is it safe to take for a long time?\n\n【118】There is no evidence that methylphenidate is harmful as long as it is taken exactly as prescribed and your child is monitored carefully. This is why it’s a good idea for them to have regular reviews with their doctor to check whether it’s still needed.\n\n【119】What will happen if my child stops taking it?\n\n【120】Only stop giving your child methylphenidate if your doctor tells you to.\n\n【121】If your child suddenly stops taking methylphenidate, you may notice withdrawal symptoms such as depression.\n\n【122】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop giving your child methylphenidate. They may want to slowly reduce the amount that your child takes before stopping completely. This is to help avoid any extra side effects.\n\n【123】Is it addictive?\n\n【124】As long as you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, methylphenidate does not generally cause addiction issues.\n\n【125】Do not stop giving methylphenidate to your child suddenly. Talk to your doctor first, as they may want to reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of your child having extra side effects when they stop taking this medicine.\n\n【126】Addiction problems usually only occur if you give methylphenidate more often than prescribed, or at a higher dose than recommended.\n\n【127】Does my child need to stick to the same brand of methylphenidate?\n\n【128】Once your child is on a brand of methylphenidate that works for them, they'll usually keep taking the same brand. This is because it can be a problem to change brands, particularly if they're taking slow release tablets or capsules.\n\n【129】Different brands of slow release methylphenidate tablets and capsules work differently in how they release the medicine into the body. This can affect how they work to manage symptoms. Side effects can also vary.\n\n【130】Different brands also have different instructions for how and when to take it, such as whether to take it with food.\n\n【131】If your child does need to change brands, check the instructions that come with the medicine carefully.\n\n【132】Can my child take it with painkillers?\n\n【133】You can give your child painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, unless your doctor has told you not to.\n\n【134】Is there any food or drink they need to avoid?\n\n【135】There's no particular food or drink that your child needs to avoid when taking methylphenidate.\n\n【136】Are medicines the first treatment option for children with ADHD?\n\n【137】If a child has ADHD, their doctor will usually only prescribe a medicine if other treatments have not helped. Their symptoms may still be causing problems, even after trying practical things like:\n\n【138】*   taking regular breaks to move around\n*   reducing distractions, for example by using headphones\n*   having instructions written down clearly\n\n【139】Medicines are usually only used for ADHD as part of a treatment programme. Other treatments can include:\n\n【140】*   therapies to improve specific skills and behaviours\n*   training for parents to help them manage their child’s behaviour\n*   additional support at school\n\n【141】If you have any questions or worries about your child’s medicine, speak to your doctor.\n\n【142】What if methylphenidate is not helping my child?\n\n【143】Some people find that methylphenidate does not work for their child. In this case, the doctor may recommend trying a different medicine or psychological treatments.\n\n【144】Other medicines for ADHD include dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine and atomoxetine.\n\n【145】Non-medicine treatments for ADHD include, behavioural therapy and talking therapy.\n\n【146】Speak to your doctor if you are interested in finding out about alternative treatments. Do not stop giving your child methylphenidate without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【147】Can taking supplements help ADHD?\n\n【148】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is very limited and more research is needed.\n\n【149】Talk to your doctor before giving any supplements to your child. This is because some can react with medicine - causing side effects, or can make the medicine work less well.\n\n【150】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【151】*   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n【152】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【153】*   HealthUnlocked: methylphenidate forum\n*   ADHD Foundation: charity\n*   Medicines for Children (information about methylphenidate): charity\n\n【154】Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021  \nNext review due: 27 July 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】On this page", "content": "【0】Methylphenidate for children \\- Brand names: Ritalin, Concerta, Medikinet, Delmosart, Equasym\n=============================================================================================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.

About methylphenidate for children\n--------------------------------------\n\n【4】Methylphenidate belongs to a group of medicines, called stimulants. They work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that help control attention and behaviour.\n\n【5】Methylphenidate is used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It helps with hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour, and allows them to concentrate better. It is also used to treat adults with ADHD or narcolepsy (a sleep disorder).\n\n【6】Methylphenidate is only available on prescription. It comes as standard (immediate release) tablets and capsules and slow release (also called extended, modified or prolonged release) tablets and capsules.\n\n【7】Some children may need to take both slow release and standard methylphenidate to help improve their ADHD.\n\n【8】For adults aged 18 and over, read our information on methylphenidate for adults.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Methylphenidate is a controlled drug, which means that you may have to prove your identity when collecting your prescription. Collect your prescription within 28 days.\n*   If your child takes slow release methylphenidate, give it to them once a day. If they are taking standard tablets or capsules, your doctor may recommend giving it up to 3 times a day.\n*   It's best to stick to the same brand, particularly if your child has slow release methylphenidate. Different brands work differently in how they release the medicine into the body, and this can affect how they work to manage your child's symptoms.\n*   Methylphenidate makes your child less hyperactive and impulsive, and helps them concentrate.\n*   Methylphenidate for children is also known by the brand names Matoride, Tranquilin, Xaggitin and Xenidate.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take methylphenidate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Methylphenidate can be taken by most children aged 4 and over, although, it is not suitable for all children. Tell your child's doctor before they start taking this medicine if:\n\n【13】*   they have ever had an allergic reaction to methylphenidate or any other medicine\n*   they have difficulty swallowing, as some brands may not be suitable\n*   they have heart problems\n*   they have an overactive thyroid\n*   have a tumour in the adrenal gland (phaeochromocytoma)\n*   they have mental health problems (or a close family member has mental health problems)\n*   they have high blood pressure or problems with their blood vessels, such as vasculitis\n*   they have epilepsy\n*   they have sudden muscle twitches in their face or body (tics), or there is a close family member with Tourette's syndrome\n*   either they or a a close family member has glaucoma\n\n【14】4\\. How and when to give methylphenidate to children\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Always follow the advice of your child's doctor and the instructions that come with the medicine. Different brands of methylphenidate tablets and capsules may have different instructions.\n\n【16】### Dosage\n\n【17】The usual dose of methylphenidate depends on whether your child has standard or slow release medicine. In some cases, the specialist may prescribe both.\n\n【18】Although standard tablets and capsules are sometimes called immediate release, they can still take a while to start working.\n\n【19】Slow release tablets and capsules are sometimes called extended release, modified release, or prolonged release. These tablets and capsules let the medicine pass into your child's body gradually.\n\n【20】#### Dose for standard tablets and capsules\n\n【21】The usual starting dose for children is 5mg, given once or twice a day. Your doctor may increase your child's dose gradually (usually weekly) until they find the dose that works best. Your child may need to take it 2 or 3 times a day.\n\n【22】Give your child their methylphenidate first thing in the morning. If they have a second dose, give it to them at around lunchtime (early afternoon) and, if prescribed, a third dose in the late afternoon or evening.\n\n【23】Try to leave at least 4 hours between doses. If your child has a third dose, try to give it to them at least 4 hours before bedtime so it does not affect their sleep.\n\n【24】Although they are called immediate release, it can still take a while for the medicine to work. You may not see any changes in behaviour straight away.\n\n【25】Let your child's school know if they need to take their medicine during the school day.\n\n【26】#### Dose for slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【27】Slow release tablets and capsules start to work with a first release of the medicine into the body. After that, the medicine continues to release into the body more slowly.\n\n【28】The usual starting dose for:\n\n【29】*   **tablets** is 18mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may gradually increase the dose by 18mg at a time (usually weekly, up to 54mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n*   **capsules** is 10mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may increase the dose gradually (usually weekly, up to 60mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n\n【30】Check the leaflet that comes with the medicine for when to give it and whether it should be taken with food.\n\n【31】If your child is taking Equasym XL, give them their medicine about 30 minutes before breakfast. If they're taking Medikinet XL, give it to them with or after breakfast.\n\n【32】### How to give children tablets or capsules\n\n【33】Give your child the tablets or capsules with a drink of water, milk or juice. Tell them to swallow the medicine whole, not chew it.\n\n【34】If your child has problems swallowing pills, then it's OK to crush standard tablets (Medikinet or Ritalin). Mix the crushed tablets with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【35】#### Important\n\n【36】Do not crush or break slow release tablets because the medicine will not work properly.\n\n【37】However, if your child takes slow release capsules, you can open the capsule and mix the contents with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【38】Give your child the mixture straight away and tell them to swallow it without chewing.\n\n【39】### Will their dose go up or down?\n\n【40】Your child will usually start on a low dose of methylphenidate, taken once or twice a day. The doctor will increase the dose gradually, until they find the dose that works best for your child.\n\n【41】If your child starts on standard methylphenidate, the doctor may later switch them to slow release methylphenidate. They only have to take this once a day.\n\n【42】### How long will they take it for?\n\n【43】If methylphenidate is working well to control your child's symptoms, they might need to take it for several months or even years. However, it's not usually a life-long medicine.\n\n【44】Your doctor will usually monitor how your child is every 6 months. This gives them a better idea about how your child is getting on with their medicine and whether they still need it.\n\n【45】### What if my child is sick?\n\n【46】If your child is sick (vomits) less than 30 minutes after taking their methylphenidate, give them the same dose again.\n\n【47】If it’s more than 30 minutes after taking their medicine, do not give your child another dose, just wait until their next dose is due.\n\n【48】If your child is sick again, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【49】### What if I forget to give a dose?\n\n【50】If you forget to give your child their medicine, skip the missed dose and wait until it’s time for the next dose. Give them the next dose as usual.\n\n【51】Never give them a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【52】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to give your child their medicine.\n\n【53】### What if they take too much?\n\n【54】The amount of methylphenidate that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【55】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【56】Your child takes too much methylphenidate and has:\n\n【57】*   a seizure or fit (uncontrollable jerking and shaking)\n*   a fast, slow or uneven heart beat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating faster or slower than normal or may say it is racing\n\n【58】Take the methylphenidate packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【59】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【60】*   your child takes more than their prescribed dose of methylphenidate\n\n【61】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【62】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【63】#### Important\n\n【64】Keep methylphenidate in a cupboard. Make sure children cannot see or reach this medicine.\n\n【65】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【66】Like all medicines, methylphenidate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【67】### Common side effects\n\n【68】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people:\n\n【69】*   headaches\n*   feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense\n*   trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n*   loss of appetite – this can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain\n*   stomach ache\n*   dry mouth\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【70】Keep giving your child the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother your child or do not go away:\n\n【71】### Serious side effects\n\n【72】Serious side effects are uncommon and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【73】Tell your doctor straight away if your child:\n\n【74】*   has changes in mood or personality\n*   has thoughts about harming themselves\n*   has a fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating much faster than normal or may say it is racing\n*   starts seeing, feeling or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)\n*   has started to get facial tics – these are quick, little movements in the muscles of the face that cannot be controlled and are sudden, if this starts happening, their doctor will stop your treatment\n\n【75】Methylphenidate can also cause a small increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. For this reason, your doctor will usually measure your child’s blood pressure and pulse every 6 months.\n\n【76】#### Growth in children\n\n【77】If your child takes methylphenidate for longer than a year, it can slow down their growth. However this happens in less than 1 in 10 children.\n\n【78】Your doctor will check your child’s height, weight and appetite every 6 months to make sure they are growing OK.\n\n【79】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【80】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to methylphenidate.\n\n【81】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【82】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【83】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【84】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【85】These are not all the side effects of methylphenidate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside the medicine packet.\n\n【86】Information:\n\n【87】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【88】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【89】6\\. How to cope with side effects of methylphenidate\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【90】**What to do about:**\n\n【91】*   **headaches** – make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids. Painkillers such as paracetamol (Calpol) can help. Talk to your doctor if your child's headaches are severe or do not go away.\n*   **feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense** – this may go away as your child gets used to the medicine. If it does not, speak to your doctor. They may want to recommend a lower dose or try a different medicine.\n*   **trouble sleeping** – if your child is finding it hard to sleep, try giving the last dose at least 6 hours before bedtime. Speak to your doctor if this does not help. They may want to try slow release instead.\n*   **loss of appetite** – it may help to give them methylphenidate with a meal. You may notice they lose some weight during the first few months of treatment. Your child will probably put this weight back on once they are used to the medicine. If you notice they are losing a lot of weight speak to your doctor.\n*   **dry mouth** – this usually improves quite quickly. It may help to give them small sips of water and citrus fruits like oranges or satsumas.\n*   **feeling or being sick** – stick to simple meals and do not give your child rich or spicy food if they feel sick. It might help to give them their methylphenidate with or after a meal or snack. If they are being sick, encourage them to take small, frequent sips of water or squash to avoid dehydration. If your child keeps being sick or having severe stomach pains, see a doctor.\n\n【92】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】There are some medicines that can affect the way methylphenidate works.\n\n【94】If your child is taking any of the following medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them methylphenidate:\n\n【95】*   medicines to treat depression or other mental health problems\n*   medicines for epilepsy\n*   blood pressure medicines\n*   medicines that treat or prevent blood clots\n*   medicines for coughs and colds\n\n【96】Some cough and cold medicines can affect blood pressure so speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're buying these for your child. It’s important to check whether they are OK for them to have while taking methylphenidate.\n\n【97】### Mixing methylphenidate with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【98】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking methylphenidate. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving any to your child.\n\n【99】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is limited and more research is needed.\n\n【100】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【101】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【102】8\\.

It comes as standard (immediate release) tablets and capsules and slow release (also called extended, modified or prolonged release) tablets and capsules.\n\n【7】Some children may need to take both slow release and standard methylphenidate to help improve their ADHD.\n\n【8】For adults aged 18 and over, read our information on methylphenidate for adults.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Methylphenidate is a controlled drug, which means that you may have to prove your identity when collecting your prescription. Collect your prescription within 28 days.\n*   If your child takes slow release methylphenidate, give it to them once a day. If they are taking standard tablets or capsules, your doctor may recommend giving it up to 3 times a day.\n*   It's best to stick to the same brand, particularly if your child has slow release methylphenidate. Different brands work differently in how they release the medicine into the body, and this can affect how they work to manage your child's symptoms.\n*   Methylphenidate makes your child less hyperactive and impulsive, and helps them concentrate.\n*   Methylphenidate for children is also known by the brand names Matoride, Tranquilin, Xaggitin and Xenidate.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take methylphenidate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Methylphenidate can be taken by most children aged 4 and over, although, it is not suitable for all children. Tell your child's doctor before they start taking this medicine if:\n\n【13】*   they have ever had an allergic reaction to methylphenidate or any other medicine\n*   they have difficulty swallowing, as some brands may not be suitable\n*   they have heart problems\n*   they have an overactive thyroid\n*   have a tumour in the adrenal gland (phaeochromocytoma)\n*   they have mental health problems (or a close family member has mental health problems)\n*   they have high blood pressure or problems with their blood vessels, such as vasculitis\n*   they have epilepsy\n*   they have sudden muscle twitches in their face or body (tics), or there is a close family member with Tourette's syndrome\n*   either they or a a close family member has glaucoma\n\n【14】4\\. How and when to give methylphenidate to children\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Always follow the advice of your child's doctor and the instructions that come with the medicine. Different brands of methylphenidate tablets and capsules may have different instructions.\n\n【16】### Dosage\n\n【17】The usual dose of methylphenidate depends on whether your child has standard or slow release medicine. In some cases, the specialist may prescribe both.\n\n【18】Although standard tablets and capsules are sometimes called immediate release, they can still take a while to start working.\n\n【19】Slow release tablets and capsules are sometimes called extended release, modified release, or prolonged release. These tablets and capsules let the medicine pass into your child's body gradually.\n\n【20】#### Dose for standard tablets and capsules\n\n【21】The usual starting dose for children is 5mg, given once or twice a day. Your doctor may increase your child's dose gradually (usually weekly) until they find the dose that works best. Your child may need to take it 2 or 3 times a day.\n\n【22】Give your child their methylphenidate first thing in the morning. If they have a second dose, give it to them at around lunchtime (early afternoon) and, if prescribed, a third dose in the late afternoon or evening.\n\n【23】Try to leave at least 4 hours between doses. If your child has a third dose, try to give it to them at least 4 hours before bedtime so it does not affect their sleep.\n\n【24】Although they are called immediate release, it can still take a while for the medicine to work. You may not see any changes in behaviour straight away.\n\n【25】Let your child's school know if they need to take their medicine during the school day.\n\n【26】#### Dose for slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【27】Slow release tablets and capsules start to work with a first release of the medicine into the body. After that, the medicine continues to release into the body more slowly.\n\n【28】The usual starting dose for:\n\n【29】*   **tablets** is 18mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may gradually increase the dose by 18mg at a time (usually weekly, up to 54mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n*   **capsules** is 10mg, given once in the morning - your child's doctor may increase the dose gradually (usually weekly, up to 60mg max) until they find the dose that works well for your child.\n\n【30】Check the leaflet that comes with the medicine for when to give it and whether it should be taken with food.\n\n【31】If your child is taking Equasym XL, give them their medicine about 30 minutes before breakfast. If they're taking Medikinet XL, give it to them with or after breakfast.\n\n【32】### How to give children tablets or capsules\n\n【33】Give your child the tablets or capsules with a drink of water, milk or juice. Tell them to swallow the medicine whole, not chew it.\n\n【34】If your child has problems swallowing pills, then it's OK to crush standard tablets (Medikinet or Ritalin). Mix the crushed tablets with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【35】#### Important\n\n【36】Do not crush or break slow release tablets because the medicine will not work properly.\n\n【37】However, if your child takes slow release capsules, you can open the capsule and mix the contents with a small amount of soft food such as yogurt, honey or jam.\n\n【38】Give your child the mixture straight away and tell them to swallow it without chewing.\n\n【39】### Will their dose go up or down?\n\n【40】Your child will usually start on a low dose of methylphenidate, taken once or twice a day. The doctor will increase the dose gradually, until they find the dose that works best for your child.\n\n【41】If your child starts on standard methylphenidate, the doctor may later switch them to slow release methylphenidate. They only have to take this once a day.\n\n【42】### How long will they take it for?\n\n【43】If methylphenidate is working well to control your child's symptoms, they might need to take it for several months or even years. However, it's not usually a life-long medicine.\n\n【44】Your doctor will usually monitor how your child is every 6 months. This gives them a better idea about how your child is getting on with their medicine and whether they still need it.\n\n【45】### What if my child is sick?\n\n【46】If your child is sick (vomits) less than 30 minutes after taking their methylphenidate, give them the same dose again.\n\n【47】If it’s more than 30 minutes after taking their medicine, do not give your child another dose, just wait until their next dose is due.\n\n【48】If your child is sick again, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【49】### What if I forget to give a dose?\n\n【50】If you forget to give your child their medicine, skip the missed dose and wait until it’s time for the next dose. Give them the next dose as usual.\n\n【51】Never give them a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【52】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to give your child their medicine.\n\n【53】### What if they take too much?\n\n【54】The amount of methylphenidate that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【55】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【56】Your child takes too much methylphenidate and has:\n\n【57】*   a seizure or fit (uncontrollable jerking and shaking)\n*   a fast, slow or uneven heart beat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating faster or slower than normal or may say it is racing\n\n【58】Take the methylphenidate packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【59】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【60】*   your child takes more than their prescribed dose of methylphenidate\n\n【61】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【62】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【63】#### Important\n\n【64】Keep methylphenidate in a cupboard. Make sure children cannot see or reach this medicine.\n\n【65】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【66】Like all medicines, methylphenidate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【67】### Common side effects\n\n【68】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people:\n\n【69】*   headaches\n*   feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense\n*   trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n*   loss of appetite – this can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain\n*   stomach ache\n*   dry mouth\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【70】Keep giving your child the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother your child or do not go away:\n\n【71】### Serious side effects\n\n【72】Serious side effects are uncommon and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【73】Tell your doctor straight away if your child:\n\n【74】*   has changes in mood or personality\n*   has thoughts about harming themselves\n*   has a fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating much faster than normal or may say it is racing\n*   starts seeing, feeling or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)\n*   has started to get facial tics – these are quick, little movements in the muscles of the face that cannot be controlled and are sudden, if this starts happening, their doctor will stop your treatment\n\n【75】Methylphenidate can also cause a small increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. For this reason, your doctor will usually measure your child’s blood pressure and pulse every 6 months.\n\n【76】#### Growth in children\n\n【77】If your child takes methylphenidate for longer than a year, it can slow down their growth. However this happens in less than 1 in 10 children.\n\n【78】Your doctor will check your child’s height, weight and appetite every 6 months to make sure they are growing OK.\n\n【79】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【80】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to methylphenidate.\n\n【81】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【82】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【83】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【84】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【85】These are not all the side effects of methylphenidate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside the medicine packet.\n\n【86】Information:\n\n【87】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【88】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【89】6\\. How to cope with side effects of methylphenidate\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【90】**What to do about:**\n\n【91】*   **headaches** – make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids. Painkillers such as paracetamol (Calpol) can help. Talk to your doctor if your child's headaches are severe or do not go away.\n*   **feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense** – this may go away as your child gets used to the medicine. If it does not, speak to your doctor. They may want to recommend a lower dose or try a different medicine.\n*   **trouble sleeping** – if your child is finding it hard to sleep, try giving the last dose at least 6 hours before bedtime. Speak to your doctor if this does not help. They may want to try slow release instead.\n*   **loss of appetite** – it may help to give them methylphenidate with a meal. You may notice they lose some weight during the first few months of treatment. Your child will probably put this weight back on once they are used to the medicine. If you notice they are losing a lot of weight speak to your doctor.\n*   **dry mouth** – this usually improves quite quickly. It may help to give them small sips of water and citrus fruits like oranges or satsumas.\n*   **feeling or being sick** – stick to simple meals and do not give your child rich or spicy food if they feel sick. It might help to give them their methylphenidate with or after a meal or snack. If they are being sick, encourage them to take small, frequent sips of water or squash to avoid dehydration. If your child keeps being sick or having severe stomach pains, see a doctor.\n\n【92】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】There are some medicines that can affect the way methylphenidate works.\n\n【94】If your child is taking any of the following medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them methylphenidate:\n\n【95】*   medicines to treat depression or other mental health problems\n*   medicines for epilepsy\n*   blood pressure medicines\n*   medicines that treat or prevent blood clots\n*   medicines for coughs and colds\n\n【96】Some cough and cold medicines can affect blood pressure so speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're buying these for your child. It’s important to check whether they are OK for them to have while taking methylphenidate.\n\n【97】### Mixing methylphenidate with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【98】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking methylphenidate. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving any to your child.\n\n【99】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is limited and more research is needed.\n\n【100】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【101】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【102】8\\. Common questions about methylphendiate for children\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【103】How does methylphenidate work?\n\n【104】Methylphenidate belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants. They increase activity in the brain, particularly in areas that help control attention and behaviour.\n\n【105】It's not known exactly how methylphenidate works. It's thought to boost the levels of chemicals called dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain.\n\n【106】This can increase activity in the parts of your child's brain that control attention and behaviour.\n\n【107】This makes them less hyperactive or impulsive. It will also help them to pay attention and concentrate better.\n\n【108】How long does it take to work?\n\n【109】When your child first starts taking methylphenidate they will be on a low dose. Your doctor will usually increase this gradually until they find the dose that works for your child.\n\n【110】This means it might take a few weeks before you see any benefits. When your doctor has found the right dose, methylphenidate should start to work within 30 to 60 minutes of your child taking it.\n\n【111】The medicine makes your child less hyperactive or impulsive, and helps their concentration. How quickly it works depends on whether it's standard or slow release.\n\n【112】How long will my child take it for?\n\n【113】Your child may need to take methylphenidate for several months or even years. They will not usually need to take it for the rest of their life.\n\n【114】Your child will have regular check-ups, usually every 6 months or so.\n\n【115】Your doctor may recommend stopping methylphenidate for a while, or reducing the dose. This will normally be during the school holidays and can be called “a medicine break”. This is to check whether it’s still helping.\n\n【116】As your child gets to puberty, or just after, the doctor may stop their methylphenidate. But if the medicine is still helping, they may recommend that your child keep taking it, even as an adult.\n\n【117】Is it safe to take for a long time?\n\n【118】There is no evidence that methylphenidate is harmful as long as it is taken exactly as prescribed and your child is monitored carefully. This is why it’s a good idea for them to have regular reviews with their doctor to check whether it’s still needed.\n\n【119】What will happen if my child stops taking it?\n\n【120】Only stop giving your child methylphenidate if your doctor tells you to.\n\n【121】If your child suddenly stops taking methylphenidate, you may notice withdrawal symptoms such as depression.\n\n【122】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop giving your child methylphenidate. They may want to slowly reduce the amount that your child takes before stopping completely. This is to help avoid any extra side effects.\n\n【123】Is it addictive?\n\n【124】As long as you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, methylphenidate does not generally cause addiction issues.\n\n【125】Do not stop giving methylphenidate to your child suddenly. Talk to your doctor first, as they may want to reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of your child having extra side effects when they stop taking this medicine.\n\n【126】Addiction problems usually only occur if you give methylphenidate more often than prescribed, or at a higher dose than recommended.\n\n【127】Does my child need to stick to the same brand of methylphenidate?\n\n【128】Once your child is on a brand of methylphenidate that works for them, they'll usually keep taking the same brand. This is because it can be a problem to change brands, particularly if they're taking slow release tablets or capsules.\n\n【129】Different brands of slow release methylphenidate tablets and capsules work differently in how they release the medicine into the body. This can affect how they work to manage symptoms. Side effects can also vary.\n\n【130】Different brands also have different instructions for how and when to take it, such as whether to take it with food.\n\n【131】If your child does need to change brands, check the instructions that come with the medicine carefully.\n\n【132】Can my child take it with painkillers?\n\n【133】You can give your child painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, unless your doctor has told you not to.\n\n【134】Is there any food or drink they need to avoid?\n\n【135】There's no particular food or drink that your child needs to avoid when taking methylphenidate.\n\n【136】Are medicines the first treatment option for children with ADHD?\n\n【137】If a child has ADHD, their doctor will usually only prescribe a medicine if other treatments have not helped. Their symptoms may still be causing problems, even after trying practical things like:\n\n【138】*   taking regular breaks to move around\n*   reducing distractions, for example by using headphones\n*   having instructions written down clearly\n\n【139】Medicines are usually only used for ADHD as part of a treatment programme. Other treatments can include:\n\n【140】*   therapies to improve specific skills and behaviours\n*   training for parents to help them manage their child’s behaviour\n*   additional support at school\n\n【141】If you have any questions or worries about your child’s medicine, speak to your doctor.\n\n【142】What if methylphenidate is not helping my child?\n\n【143】Some people find that methylphenidate does not work for their child. In this case, the doctor may recommend trying a different medicine or psychological treatments.\n\n【144】Other medicines for ADHD include dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine and atomoxetine.\n\n【145】Non-medicine treatments for ADHD include, behavioural therapy and talking therapy.\n\n【146】Speak to your doctor if you are interested in finding out about alternative treatments. Do not stop giving your child methylphenidate without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【147】Can taking supplements help ADHD?\n\n【148】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is very limited and more research is needed.\n\n【149】Talk to your doctor before giving any supplements to your child. This is because some can react with medicine - causing side effects, or can make the medicine work less well.\n\n【150】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【151】*   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n【152】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【153】*   HealthUnlocked: methylphenidate forum\n*   ADHD Foundation: charity\n*   Medicines for Children (information about methylphenidate): charity\n\n【154】Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021  \nNext review due: 27 July 2024", "index": 12354, "show": true, "start": 12341, "end": 12488, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【152】Useful resources\n【153】*   HealthUnlocked: methylphenidate forum\n\nADHD Foundation: charity\nMedicines for Children (information about methylphenidate): charity\n【154】Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021\n\nNext review due: 27 July 2024", "content": "【0】Methylphenidate for children \\- Brand names: Ritalin, Concerta, Medikinet, Delmosart, Equasym\n=============================================================================================\n\n<mark>【1】On this page</mark>\n------------\n\n【2】1.

You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to give your child their medicine.\n\n【53】### What if they take too much?\n\n【54】The amount of methylphenidate that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【55】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【56】Your child takes too much methylphenidate and has:\n\n【57】*   a seizure or fit (uncontrollable jerking and shaking)\n*   a fast, slow or uneven heart beat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating faster or slower than normal or may say it is racing\n\n【58】Take the methylphenidate packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【59】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【60】*   your child takes more than their prescribed dose of methylphenidate\n\n【61】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【62】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【63】#### Important\n\n【64】Keep methylphenidate in a cupboard. Make sure children cannot see or reach this medicine.\n\n【65】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【66】Like all medicines, methylphenidate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【67】### Common side effects\n\n【68】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people:\n\n【69】*   headaches\n*   feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense\n*   trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n*   loss of appetite – this can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain\n*   stomach ache\n*   dry mouth\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【70】Keep giving your child the medicine, but tell your doctor if they bother your child or do not go away:\n\n【71】### Serious side effects\n\n【72】Serious side effects are uncommon and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【73】Tell your doctor straight away if your child:\n\n【74】*   has changes in mood or personality\n*   has thoughts about harming themselves\n*   has a fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations) – your child may feel their heart is beating much faster than normal or may say it is racing\n*   starts seeing, feeling or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations)\n*   has started to get facial tics – these are quick, little movements in the muscles of the face that cannot be controlled and are sudden, if this starts happening, their doctor will stop your treatment\n\n【75】Methylphenidate can also cause a small increase in blood pressure and pulse rate. For this reason, your doctor will usually measure your child’s blood pressure and pulse every 6 months.\n\n【76】#### Growth in children\n\n【77】If your child takes methylphenidate for longer than a year, it can slow down their growth. However this happens in less than 1 in 10 children.\n\n【78】Your doctor will check your child’s height, weight and appetite every 6 months to make sure they are growing OK.\n\n【79】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【80】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to methylphenidate.\n\n【81】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【82】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【83】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【84】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【85】These are not all the side effects of methylphenidate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside the medicine packet.\n\n<mark>【86】Information:\n\n【87】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【88】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</mark>\n\n【89】6\\. How to cope with side effects of methylphenidate\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【90】**What to do about:**\n\n【91】*   **headaches** – make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids. Painkillers such as paracetamol (Calpol) can help. Talk to your doctor if your child's headaches are severe or do not go away.\n*   **feeling aggressive, irritable, depressed, anxious or tense** – this may go away as your child gets used to the medicine. If it does not, speak to your doctor. They may want to recommend a lower dose or try a different medicine.\n*   **trouble sleeping** – if your child is finding it hard to sleep, try giving the last dose at least 6 hours before bedtime. Speak to your doctor if this does not help. They may want to try slow release instead.\n*   **loss of appetite** – it may help to give them methylphenidate with a meal. You may notice they lose some weight during the first few months of treatment. Your child will probably put this weight back on once they are used to the medicine. If you notice they are losing a lot of weight speak to your doctor.\n*   **dry mouth** – this usually improves quite quickly. It may help to give them small sips of water and citrus fruits like oranges or satsumas.\n*   **feeling or being sick** – stick to simple meals and do not give your child rich or spicy food if they feel sick. It might help to give them their methylphenidate with or after a meal or snack. If they are being sick, encourage them to take small, frequent sips of water or squash to avoid dehydration. If your child keeps being sick or having severe stomach pains, see a doctor.\n\n【92】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】There are some medicines that can affect the way methylphenidate works.\n\n【94】If your child is taking any of the following medicines, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them methylphenidate:\n\n【95】*   medicines to treat depression or other mental health problems\n*   medicines for epilepsy\n*   blood pressure medicines\n*   medicines that treat or prevent blood clots\n*   medicines for coughs and colds\n\n【96】Some cough and cold medicines can affect blood pressure so speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're buying these for your child. It’s important to check whether they are OK for them to have while taking methylphenidate.\n\n【97】### Mixing methylphenidate with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【98】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking methylphenidate. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving any to your child.\n\n【99】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is limited and more research is needed.\n\n【100】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【101】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【102】8\\. Common questions about methylphendiate for children\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【103】How does methylphenidate work?\n\n【104】Methylphenidate belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants. They increase activity in the brain, particularly in areas that help control attention and behaviour.\n\n【105】It's not known exactly how methylphenidate works. It's thought to boost the levels of chemicals called dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain.\n\n【106】This can increase activity in the parts of your child's brain that control attention and behaviour.\n\n【107】This makes them less hyperactive or impulsive. It will also help them to pay attention and concentrate better.\n\n【108】How long does it take to work?\n\n【109】When your child first starts taking methylphenidate they will be on a low dose. Your doctor will usually increase this gradually until they find the dose that works for your child.\n\n【110】This means it might take a few weeks before you see any benefits. When your doctor has found the right dose, methylphenidate should start to work within 30 to 60 minutes of your child taking it.\n\n【111】The medicine makes your child less hyperactive or impulsive, and helps their concentration. How quickly it works depends on whether it's standard or slow release.\n\n【112】How long will my child take it for?\n\n【113】Your child may need to take methylphenidate for several months or even years. They will not usually need to take it for the rest of their life.\n\n【114】Your child will have regular check-ups, usually every 6 months or so.\n\n【115】Your doctor may recommend stopping methylphenidate for a while, or reducing the dose. This will normally be during the school holidays and can be called “a medicine break”. This is to check whether it’s still helping.\n\n【116】As your child gets to puberty, or just after, the doctor may stop their methylphenidate. But if the medicine is still helping, they may recommend that your child keep taking it, even as an adult.\n\n【117】Is it safe to take for a long time?\n\n【118】There is no evidence that methylphenidate is harmful as long as it is taken exactly as prescribed and your child is monitored carefully. This is why it’s a good idea for them to have regular reviews with their doctor to check whether it’s still needed.\n\n【119】What will happen if my child stops taking it?\n\n【120】Only stop giving your child methylphenidate if your doctor tells you to.\n\n【121】If your child suddenly stops taking methylphenidate, you may notice withdrawal symptoms such as depression.\n\n【122】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop giving your child methylphenidate. They may want to slowly reduce the amount that your child takes before stopping completely. This is to help avoid any extra side effects.\n\n【123】Is it addictive?\n\n【124】As long as you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully, methylphenidate does not generally cause addiction issues.\n\n【125】Do not stop giving methylphenidate to your child suddenly. Talk to your doctor first, as they may want to reduce the dose gradually. This reduces the risk of your child having extra side effects when they stop taking this medicine.\n\n【126】Addiction problems usually only occur if you give methylphenidate more often than prescribed, or at a higher dose than recommended.\n\n【127】Does my child need to stick to the same brand of methylphenidate?\n\n【128】Once your child is on a brand of methylphenidate that works for them, they'll usually keep taking the same brand. This is because it can be a problem to change brands, particularly if they're taking slow release tablets or capsules.\n\n【129】Different brands of slow release methylphenidate tablets and capsules work differently in how they release the medicine into the body. This can affect how they work to manage symptoms. Side effects can also vary.\n\n【130】Different brands also have different instructions for how and when to take it, such as whether to take it with food.\n\n【131】If your child does need to change brands, check the instructions that come with the medicine carefully.\n\n【132】Can my child take it with painkillers?\n\n【133】You can give your child painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, unless your doctor has told you not to.\n\n【134】Is there any food or drink they need to avoid?\n\n【135】There's no particular food or drink that your child needs to avoid when taking methylphenidate.\n\n【136】Are medicines the first treatment option for children with ADHD?\n\n【137】If a child has ADHD, their doctor will usually only prescribe a medicine if other treatments have not helped. Their symptoms may still be causing problems, even after trying practical things like:\n\n【138】*   taking regular breaks to move around\n*   reducing distractions, for example by using headphones\n*   having instructions written down clearly\n\n【139】Medicines are usually only used for ADHD as part of a treatment programme. Other treatments can include:\n\n【140】*   therapies to improve specific skills and behaviours\n*   training for parents to help them manage their child’s behaviour\n*   additional support at school\n\n【141】If you have any questions or worries about your child’s medicine, speak to your doctor.\n\n【142】What if methylphenidate is not helping my child?\n\n【143】Some people find that methylphenidate does not work for their child. In this case, the doctor may recommend trying a different medicine or psychological treatments.\n\n【144】Other medicines for ADHD include dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine and atomoxetine.\n\n【145】Non-medicine treatments for ADHD include, behavioural therapy and talking therapy.\n\n【146】Speak to your doctor if you are interested in finding out about alternative treatments. Do not stop giving your child methylphenidate without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【147】Can taking supplements help ADHD?\n\n【148】Some studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 supplements can help with ADHD. However, the evidence is very limited and more research is needed.\n\n【149】Talk to your doctor before giving any supplements to your child. This is because some can react with medicine - causing side effects, or can make the medicine work less well.\n\n【150】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【151】*   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n【152】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【153】*   HealthUnlocked: methylphenidate forum\n*   ADHD Foundation: charity\n*   Medicines for Children (information about methylphenidate): charity\n\n【154】Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021  \nNext review due: 27 July 2024", "index": 21658, "show": true, "start": 21632, "end": 21863, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 11:19:31", "endTime": "2024/09/02 11:21:46", "cost": 134.473}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:48", "update_time": "2024-09-01 19:21:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 19:19:31"}

Most people who are fit enough to have surgery eventually make a full recovery.\n\n【32】But because many people with these types of haematoma are older, they may be too frail to have treatment.\n\n【33】Read more about recovering from a subdural haematoma.\n\n【34】Page last reviewed: 19 August 2021  \nNext review due: 19 August 2024\n\n【35】*   Next : Symptoms", "index": 3667, "show": true, "start": 3602, "end": 3757, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 11:06:41", "endTime": "2024/09/02 11:07:43", "cost": 62.16}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:48", "update_time": "2024-09-01 19:07:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 19:06:41"}

MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/262644/view\n\n【20】Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】*   you think you might have shingles\n\n【22】You might need medicine to help speed up your recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems.\n\n【23】This works best if you start taking it within 3 days of the shingles rash appearing.\n\n【24】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【25】Treatment from a GP for shingles\n--------------------------------\n\n【26】Treatment for shingles depends on how severe your symptoms are and whether you're at risk of complications.\n\n【27】If you have a mild rash you may not need any treatment.\n\n【28】You may be offered medicine (antiviral tablets) to help speed up your recovery from shingles if:\n\n【29】*   you have a weakened immune system\n*   your pain or your rash is moderate or severe\n*   the rash is affecting other areas of your body apart from your chest, tummy and back\n\n【30】You usually need to start taking the medicine within 3 days of your rash first appearing.\n\n【31】Treatment for shingles can also include medicines to help relieve pain, such as painkillers, steroid tablets or medicines that help with nerve pain.\n\n【32】How to treat shingles symptoms yourself\n---------------------------------------\n\n【33】If you have shingles there are things you can do to help with the symptoms.\n\n【34】### Do\n\n【35】*   take paracetamol to ease pain\n\n【36】*   keep the rash clean and dry to reduce the risk of infection\n\n【37】*   wear loose-fitting clothing\n\n【38】*   use a cool compress (a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel, or a wet cloth) a few times a day\n\n【39】### Don’t\n\n【40】*   do not let dressings or plasters stick to the rash\n\n【41】*   do not wear clothes with rough fibres that can irritate your skin\n\n【42】How long shingles lasts\n-----------------------\n\n【43】It can take up to 4 weeks for the shingles rash to heal.\n\n【44】Your skin can be painful for weeks after the rash has gone, but it usually gets better over time.\n\n【45】Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】You cannot spread shingles to others. But people could catch chickenpox from you if they have not had chickenpox before or have not had the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n【47】This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.\n\n【48】Try to avoid:\n\n【49】*   anyone who is pregnant and has not had chickenpox before\n*   people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy\n*   babies less than 1 month old\n\n【50】### Important: Work and school\n\n【51】Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out.\n\n【52】You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid.\n\n【53】You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing.\n\n【54】Complications of shingles\n-------------------------\n\n【55】Most people recover from shingles without any problems. But it can sometimes cause complications, such as:\n\n【56】*   post-herpetic neuralgia, where pain lasts for several months after the shingles rash has gone\n*   the rash becoming infected, which may need to be treated with antibiotics\n*   scarring or changes in skin colour after the rash has healed\n*   muscle weakness\n*   eye problems, which can lead to sight loss\n*   Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare condition where shingles affects your facial nerve, causing weakness on one side of your face and sometimes hearing problems\n\n【57】You can reduce the risk of complications by getting treatment as soon as possible after your symptoms start.\n\n【58】### Shingles and pregnancy\n\n【59】If you're pregnant and get shingles, it's mostly mild and there's usually no risk to you or your baby.\n\n【60】But a GP should arrange for a specialist to advise on whether you need treatment.\n\n【61】Causes of shingles\n------------------\n\n【62】You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.\n\n【63】But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.\n\n【64】When people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is weakened.\n\n【65】This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.\n\n【66】Shingles vaccine\n----------------\n\n【67】A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:\n\n【68】*   people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023\n*   people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated\n*   people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system\n\n【69】The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles.\n\n【70】If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.\n\n【71】You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before.\n\n【72】Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS.\n\n【73】Page last reviewed: 23 November 2023  \nNext review due: 23 November 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【9】Credit:\n\n【10】Scott Camazine / Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/herpes-zoster-shingles-rash-image3217474.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=04C48F81-4F80-4503-BEE8-E369C12FA659&p=9949&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3Dbar%26st%3D0%26pn%3D1%26ps%3D100%26sortby%3D2%26resultview%3DsortbyPopular%26npgs%3D0%26qt%3DA02G43%26qt\\_raw%3DA02G43%26lic%3D3%26mr%3D0%26pr%3D0%26ot%3D0%26creative%3D%26ag%3D0%26hc%3D0%26pc%3D%26blackwhite%3D%26cutout%3D%26tbar%3D1%26et%3D0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3D0%26loc%3D0%26imgt%3D0%26dtfr%3D%26dtto%3D%26size%3D0xFF%26archive%3D1%26groupid%3D%26pseudoid%3D%26a%3D%26cdid%3D%26cdsrt%3D%26name%3D%26qn%3D%26apalib%3D%26apalic%3D%26lightbox%3D%26gname%3D%26gtype%3D%26xstx%3D0%26simid%3D%26saveQry%3D%26editorial%3D1%26nu%3D%26t%3D%26edoptin%3D%26customgeoip%3D%26cap%3D1%26cbstore%3D1%26vd%3D0%26lb%3D%26fi%3D2%26edrf%3D0%26ispremium%3D1%26flip%3D0%26pl%3D", "content": "【0】Shingles\n========\n\n【1】**Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash.

But people could catch chickenpox from you if they have not had chickenpox before or have not had the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n【47】This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.\n\n【48】Try to avoid:\n\n【49】*   anyone who is pregnant and has not had chickenpox before\n*   people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy\n*   babies less than 1 month old\n\n【50】### Important: Work and school\n\n【51】Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out.\n\n【52】You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid.\n\n【53】You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing.\n\n【54】Complications of shingles\n-------------------------\n\n【55】Most people recover from shingles without any problems. But it can sometimes cause complications, such as:\n\n【56】*   post-herpetic neuralgia, where pain lasts for several months after the shingles rash has gone\n*   the rash becoming infected, which may need to be treated with antibiotics\n*   scarring or changes in skin colour after the rash has healed\n*   muscle weakness\n*   eye problems, which can lead to sight loss\n*   Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare condition where shingles affects your facial nerve, causing weakness on one side of your face and sometimes hearing problems\n\n【57】You can reduce the risk of complications by getting treatment as soon as possible after your symptoms start.\n\n【58】### Shingles and pregnancy\n\n【59】If you're pregnant and get shingles, it's mostly mild and there's usually no risk to you or your baby.\n\n【60】But a GP should arrange for a specialist to advise on whether you need treatment.\n\n【61】Causes of shingles\n------------------\n\n【62】You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.\n\n【63】But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.\n\n【64】When people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is weakened.\n\n【65】This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.\n\n【66】Shingles vaccine\n----------------\n\n【67】A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:\n\n【68】*   people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023\n*   people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated\n*   people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system\n\n【69】The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles.\n\n【70】If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.\n\n【71】You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before.\n\n【72】Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS.\n\n【73】Page last reviewed: 23 November 2023  \nNext review due: 23 November 2026", "index": 852, "show": true, "start": 852, "end": 1766, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【12】Credit:\n\n【13】Science Photo Library https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/877219/view", "content": "【0】Shingles\n========\n\n【1】**Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash.

But people could catch chickenpox from you if they have not had chickenpox before or have not had the chickenpox vaccine.\n\n【47】This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.\n\n【48】Try to avoid:\n\n【49】*   anyone who is pregnant and has not had chickenpox before\n*   people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy\n*   babies less than 1 month old\n\n【50】### Important: Work and school\n\n【51】Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out.\n\n【52】You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid.\n\n【53】You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing.\n\n【54】Complications of shingles\n-------------------------\n\n【55】Most people recover from shingles without any problems. But it can sometimes cause complications, such as:\n\n【56】*   post-herpetic neuralgia, where pain lasts for several months after the shingles rash has gone\n*   the rash becoming infected, which may need to be treated with antibiotics\n*   scarring or changes in skin colour after the rash has healed\n*   muscle weakness\n*   eye problems, which can lead to sight loss\n*   Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare condition where shingles affects your facial nerve, causing weakness on one side of your face and sometimes hearing problems\n\n【57】You can reduce the risk of complications by getting treatment as soon as possible after your symptoms start.\n\n【58】### Shingles and pregnancy\n\n【59】If you're pregnant and get shingles, it's mostly mild and there's usually no risk to you or your baby.\n\n【60】But a GP should arrange for a specialist to advise on whether you need treatment.\n\n【61】Causes of shingles\n------------------\n\n【62】You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.\n\n【63】But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.\n\n【64】When people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is weakened.\n\n【65】This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.\n\n【66】Shingles vaccine\n----------------\n\n【67】A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:\n\n【68】*   people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023\n*   people aged 70 to 79 who have not yet been vaccinated\n*   people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system\n\n【69】The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles.\n\n【70】If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.\n\n【71】You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before.\n\n【72】Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS.\n\n【73】Page last reviewed: 23 November 2023  \nNext review due: 23 November 2026", "index": 2361, "show": true, "start": 2322, "end": 2421, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【73】Page last reviewed: 23 November 2023\n\nNext review due: 23 November 2026", "content": "【0】Shingles\n========\n\n【1】**Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash.

In rare cases shingles can cause pain without a rash.\n\n【6】Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals.\n\n【7】The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles.\n\n【8】The blotches become itchy blisters that ooze fluid. A few days later, the blisters dry out and scab.\n\n<mark>【9】Credit:\n\n【10】Scott Camazine / Alamy Stock Photo https://www.alamy.com/herpes-zoster-shingles-rash-image3217474.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=04C48F81-4F80-4503-BEE8-E369C12FA659&p=9949&n=0&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%3Dbar%26st%3D0%26pn%3D1%26ps%3D100%26sortby%3D2%26resultview%3DsortbyPopular%26npgs%3D0%26qt%3DA02G43%26qt\\_raw%3DA02G43%26lic%3D3%26mr%3D0%26pr%3D0%26ot%3D0%26creative%3D%26ag%3D0%26hc%3D0%26pc%3D%26blackwhite%3D%26cutout%3D%26tbar%3D1%26et%3D0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3D0%26loc%3D0%26imgt%3D0%26dtfr%3D%26dtto%3D%26size%3D0xFF%26archive%3D1%26groupid%3D%26pseudoid%3D%26a%3D%26cdid%3D%26cdsrt%3D%26name%3D%26qn%3D%26apalib%3D%26apalic%3D%26lightbox%3D%26gname%3D%26gtype%3D%26xstx%3D0%26simid%3D%26saveQry%3D%26editorial%3D1%26nu%3D%26t%3D%26edoptin%3D%26customgeoip%3D%26cap%3D1%26cbstore%3D1%26vd%3D0%26lb%3D%26fi%3D2%26edrf%3D0%26ispremium%3D1%26flip%3D0%26pl%3D</mark>\n\n【11】The rash can be red, but this can be harder to see on brown and black skin.\n\n<mark>【12】Credit:\n\n【13】Science Photo Library https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/877219/view</mark>\n\n【14】The rash can form a cluster that only appears on 1 side of your body.

But check with your doctor before you travel.\n\n【48】It may be advisable to avoid travelling to high altitudes or hot, humid places because this may put extra strain on your heart.\n\n【49】Flying won't usually cause problems, but if your heart failure is severe, your legs and ankles may swell and breathing may become more difficult.\n\n【50】If you're flying, inform the airline of your condition. They may provide a wheelchair or electric car so you can avoid having to walk long distances at the airport.\n\n【51】If you're travelling and sitting still for a long time, either in a car, coach or on a plane, you should do simple exercises to reduce the risk of blood clots. Wearing flight socks or compression stockings while flying should also help.\n\n【52】It may be a good idea to take 2 sets of medication with you when you travel. Carry them in different places in case you lose one, and make a list of the medication you take and what it's for.\n\n【53】Having heart failure shouldn't stop you getting travel insurance, but you may have to find a specialist company that'll insure you.\n\n【54】### Driving\n\n【55】You may need to tell the DVLA if you have heart failure.\n\n【56】Read more about heart failure and driving on GOV.UK.\n\n【57】Emotions, relationships and sex\n-------------------------------\n\n【58】Being diagnosed with heart failure can be a shock. Some people feel scared, anxious, depressed or angry. These feelings are completely normal.\n\n【59】Some people also become depressed. Speak to your GP or care team if you feel unable to enjoy the things you used to or cope with everyday life.\n\n【60】You may find your physical relationship with your partner changes after your diagnosis because of worries about having a heart attack, or because you lose interest in sex or are unable to get an erection, which can sometimes be caused by heart failure medicines.\n\n【61】You can discuss any worries or problems you have with your GP or care team if you feel unable to talk to your family or friends.

This legal authority is called \"lasting power of attorney\".\n\n【3】The person who is given power of attorney is known as the \"attorney\" and must be over 18 years old. You are known as the \"donor\".\n\n【4】Appointing attorneys\n--------------------\n\n【5】You can appoint just 1 attorney, or more than 1 attorney, to act:\n\n【6】*   \"jointly\" – they must always make decisions together\n*   \"jointly and severally\" – they have to make some decisions together and some individually\n\n【7】For example, you can appoint attorneys to act jointly when making decisions over your money, but state that only one attorney should decide where you should live.\n\n【8】You have the right to say the attorneys must act jointly on all your affairs.\n\n【9】Types of power of attorney\n--------------------------\n\n【10】There are 3 different types of power of attorney: lasting power of attorney (LPA), enduring power of attorney (EPA) and ordinary power of attorney.\n\n【11】LPAs came into force in October 2007. Before that, people made EPAs. It's no longer possible to make an EPA, but an EPA made before October 2007 remains valid.\n\n【12】An ordinary power of attorney allows someone to look after your financial affairs for a temporary period.

It's important to avoid any potential conflicts of interest.\n\n【78】Specifically, you must keep the donor's money and property separate from your own, and keep accurate accounts in all of your dealings as an attorney.\n\n【79】Find out more about power of attorney on GOV.UK\n\n【80】More in Making decisions for someone else\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【81】*   Mental Capacity Act\n*   Giving someone power of attorney\n\n【82】Page last reviewed: 15 April 2021  \nNext review due: 15 April 2024", "index": 9728, "show": true, "start": 9715, "end": 9945, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 11:21:49", "endTime": "2024/09/02 11:23:28", "cost": 99.179}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:48", "update_time": "2024-09-01 19:23:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 19:21:48"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Frostbite is damage to skin and tissue caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically any temperature below -0.55C (31F).**\n\n【4】Frostbite can affect any part of your body, but the extremities, such as the hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected.\n\n【5】The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful.\n\n【6】If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles before the area becomes numb as the tissues freeze.\n\n【7】When to get medical attention\n-----------------------------\n\n【8】If you think you or someone else may have frostbite, call your GP or NHS 111 for advice.\n\n【9】If the symptoms are more severe or there are signs of hypothermia, such as constant shivering or fast breathing (hyperventilation), go immediately to your nearest A&E.\n\n【10】A doctor will examine the affected area, check your vital signs, and ask how you got frostbite.\n\n【11】You may need a follow-up appointment or referral to a specialist, as the full extent of a frostbite injury often isn't apparent until a few days later.\n\n【12】Treating frostbite\n------------------\n\n【13】A person with frostbite should be taken to a warm environment as soon as possible. This is to limit the effects of the injury and because it's also likely they'll have hypothermia. Don't put pressure on the affected area.\n\n【14】The frostbitten area should be warmed up by a healthcare professional. This is usually done by immersing the affected area in warm – but not hot – water. \n\n【15】A bath of water at 37C to 39C (98.6F to 102.2F) is recommended for rewarming. The rewarming process is often painful, and regular strong painkillers may be needed.\n\n【16】It's important not to rewarm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, as this can lead to further tissue damage.\n\n【17】If frostbite is severe, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. Amputation may be needed if frostbite is severe.\n\n【18】Read more about treating frostbite.\n\n【19】What causes frostbite?\n----------------------\n\n【20】The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down so flow to the vital organs can be increased.\n\n【21】As the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.\n\n【22】The ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.\n\n【23】### At-risk groups\n\n【24】Certain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite.\n\n【25】They include:\n\n【26】*   people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers\n*   anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions\n*   anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers\n*   homeless people\n*   the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature\n*   people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such as diabetes and Raynaud's phenomenon\n*   anyone taking medicine that constricts the blood vessels, including beta blockers – smoking can also constrict the blood vessels\n\n【27】People who've taken drugs or drunk alcohol are also vulnerable to frostbite. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather.\n\n【28】As you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30 to 60 cases every winter.\n\n【29】Preventing frostbite\n--------------------\n\n【30】Most of the time frostbite can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather.\n\n【31】Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible. \n\n【32】It's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip.\n\n【33】Wear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as:\n\n【34】*   well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks\n*   mittens – they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves\n*   a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears – it's important to protect your head from the cold\n*   multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing – these act as insulation\n\n【35】You should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can. \n\n【36】If you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car in case you break down. \n\n【37】If you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall.\n\n【38】Be careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold, a common cause of frostbite. Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.\n\n【39】Smoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels.\n\n【40】Complications of frostbite\n--------------------------\n\n【41】If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Frostbite is damage to skin and tissue caused by exposure to freezing temperatures – typically any temperature below -0.55C (31F).**\n\n【4】Frostbite can affect any part of your body, but the extremities, such as the hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected.\n\n【5】The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful.\n\n【6】If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles before the area becomes numb as the tissues freeze.\n\n【7】When to get medical attention\n-----------------------------\n\n【8】If you think you or someone else may have frostbite, call your GP or NHS 111 for advice.\n\n【9】If the symptoms are more severe or there are signs of hypothermia, such as constant shivering or fast breathing (hyperventilation), go immediately to your nearest A&E.\n\n【10】A doctor will examine the affected area, check your vital signs, and ask how you got frostbite.\n\n【11】You may need a follow-up appointment or referral to a specialist, as the full extent of a frostbite injury often isn't apparent until a few days later.\n\n【12】Treating frostbite\n------------------\n\n【13】A person with frostbite should be taken to a warm environment as soon as possible. This is to limit the effects of the injury and because it's also likely they'll have hypothermia. Don't put pressure on the affected area.\n\n【14】The frostbitten area should be warmed up by a healthcare professional. This is usually done by immersing the affected area in warm – but not hot – water. \n\n【15】A bath of water at 37C to 39C (98.6F to 102.2F) is recommended for rewarming. The rewarming process is often painful, and regular strong painkillers may be needed.\n\n【16】It's important not to rewarm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, as this can lead to further tissue damage.\n\n【17】If frostbite is severe, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. Amputation may be needed if frostbite is severe.\n\n【18】Read more about treating frostbite.\n\n【19】What causes frostbite?\n----------------------\n\n【20】The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down so flow to the vital organs can be increased.\n\n【21】As the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.\n\n【22】The ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.\n\n【23】### At-risk groups\n\n【24】Certain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite.\n\n【25】They include:\n\n【26】*   people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers\n*   anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions\n*   anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers\n*   homeless people\n*   the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature\n*   people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such as diabetes and Raynaud's phenomenon\n*   anyone taking medicine that constricts the blood vessels, including beta blockers – smoking can also constrict the blood vessels\n\n【27】People who've taken drugs or drunk alcohol are also vulnerable to frostbite. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather.\n\n【28】As you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30 to 60 cases every winter.\n\n【29】Preventing frostbite\n--------------------\n\n【30】Most of the time frostbite can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather.\n\n【31】Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible. \n\n【32】It's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip.\n\n【33】Wear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as:\n\n【34】*   well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks\n*   mittens – they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves\n*   a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears – it's important to protect your head from the cold\n*   multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing – these act as insulation\n\n【35】You should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can. \n\n【36】If you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car in case you break down. \n\n【37】If you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall.\n\n【38】Be careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold, a common cause of frostbite. Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.\n\n【39】Smoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels.\n\n【40】Complications of frostbite\n--------------------------\n\n【41】If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply. This can make the affected body part very vulnerable to infection because your body relies on white blood cells to ward off infections.\n\n【42】People with frostbite are at risk of bacterial wound infections, such as tetanus. More seriously, this infection can spread into the blood (sepsis), which requires treatment with antibiotics.

This can be taken as:\n\n【8】*   50,000IU once a week for 6 weeks\n*   40,000IU once a week for 7 weeks\n*   1,000IU four times a day for 10 weeks\n*   800IU five times a day for 10 weeks\n\n【9】### Maintenance dose\n\n【10】If you've had a loading dose but need to maintain your vitamin D levels, your doctor may prescribe a maintenance dose of 800IU to 2,000IU a day.\n\n【11】### Lower colecalciferol doses\n\n【12】Colecalciferol is also available in lower doses. You can take 400IU a day if you're an adult maintaining your vitamin D levels.\n\n【13】### Doses for children\n\n【14】Your child's dose will depend on their age and how severe their vitamin D deficiency is.\n\n【15】The usual loading dose for children is:\n\n【16】*   age 1 to 5 months – 3,000IU daily for 8 to 12 weeks\n*   age 6 months to 11 years – 6,000IU daily for 8 to 12 weeks\n*   age 12 to 17 years – 10,000IU daily for 8 to 12 weeks\n\n【17】#### Maintenance dose for children\n\n【18】Your child's doctor may recommend changes to your child's diet to improve their vitamin D levels. If changes to their diet still do not provide enough vitamin D then the doctor may prescribe a maintenance dose of 400IU to 600IU for them to take daily long term.\n\n【19】#### Prevention doses for children\n\n【20】To help your child grow healthy bones and prevent rickets, you can give them:\n\n【21】*   340IU to 400IU a day – from birth to 1 year\n*   400IU a day – from 1 year to 4 years\n\n【22】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【23】If you're unsure how to take colecalciferol, ask your doctor or your pharmacist. Take your medicine exactly as they advise you to.\n\n【24】### Capsules and tablets\n\n【25】If you're taking colecalciferol capsules or tablets, swallow them whole with some water. Take them with your main meal of the day.\n\n【26】### Chewable tablets\n\n【27】If you're taking chewable tablets, chew them. Do not swallow them whole.\n\n【28】### Syrup (oral solution)\n\n【29】Your colecalciferol liquid should come with a plastic syringe. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one.\n\n【30】Follow the instructions included with your medicine about how to take the syrup with a syringe.\n\n【31】1.  Measure the amount prescribed by your doctor into the syringe.\n2.  Squirt the medicine straight into your mouth until the syringe is empty.\n3.  Wash the syringe and allow to dry.\n\n【32】### Colecalciferol oral drops\n\n【33】If you're using colecalciferol drops, you can either drop them straight into your mouth or onto a spoon before you take it.\n\n【34】### Colecalciferol dissolvable tablets\n\n【35】Drop 1 tablet into a glass of water and as soon as it dissolves drink straight away. Do not chew or swallow the tablets whole.\n\n【36】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【37】For adults, if you're taking a loading dose for severe vitamin D deficiency you'll usually take it daily or weekly for 6 to 10 weeks.\n\n【38】To maintain your vitamin D levels or prevent deficiency you'll usually take colecalciferol long term.\n\n【39】Children with severe vitamin D deficiency usually take a loading dose for 8 to 12 weeks. They may then take a lower, maintenance dose of vitamin D long term.\n\n【40】If you or your child's vitamin D levels are OK, your doctor may recommend safely increasing your exposure to sunlight and adding more foods that are high in vitamin D to your diet.\n\n【41】If you stop taking colecalciferol, your symptoms may come back and your bone health may be affected. Stopping colecalciferol could cause the calcium levels in your body to fall. This can cause problems like bone pain or muscle weakness.\n\n【42】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【43】If you forget to take your daily or weekly dose of colecalciferol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【44】Never take 2 doses at the same time and do not take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【45】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm or make a note in your diary to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【46】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【47】Unless you're taking a loading dose of vitamin D, as prescribed by your doctor, taking an extra dose is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【48】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【49】*   you have taken more than 4,000IU of colecalciferol in 1 day\n*   your child is between 1 and 10 years of age and has had more than 2,000IU in 1 day\n*   your child is under 12 months and has had more than 1,000IU in 1 day\n\n【50】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Behçet's disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, but it's rare for someone with the condition to have all of them at once.**\n\n【4】Most people experience times when the symptoms improve (remission) and times when they get worse (flare-ups or relapses).\n\n【5】Mouth ulcers\n------------\n\n【6】Almost everyone with Behçet's disease develops mouth ulcers. The ulcers may look the same as normal mouth ulcers, but can be more numerous and painful. They most often develop on the tongue, lips, gums and the insides of the cheeks.\n\n【7】The ulcers usually heal within a couple of weeks without leaving any scarring, although they'll often return.\n\n【8】Genital ulcers\n--------------\n\n【9】Like mouth ulcers, recurrent genital ulcers are also a common symptom of Behçet's disease.\n\n【10】In men, the ulcers usually appear on the scrotum. In women, they usually appear on the cervix (neck of the womb), vulva or vagina. However, genital ulcers can appear anywhere in the groin area, including on the penis, but this is rare.\n\n【11】The genital ulcers are usually painful and may leave scarring. Men may also experience inflammation (swelling) of the testicles and women may find the ulcers make having sex painful.\n\n【12】Genital ulcers caused by Behçet's disease are not contagious and cannot be spread through sexual intercourse.\n\n【13】Skin lesions\n------------\n\n【14】Many people with Behçet's disease also develop skin lesions. A lesion is any type of unusual growth or abnormality that develops on your skin, such as a bump or a discoloured area of skin.\n\n【15】Skin lesions that can occur in Behçet's disease include red, tender swellings on the legs called erythema nodosum and more widespread acne\\-like spots called pseudofolliculitis.\n\n【16】Skin lesions often heal within 14 days, although they may come back frequently. Erythema nodosum lesions may leave permanently discoloured areas of skin.\n\n【17】Behçet's disease may also cause another skin condition called superficial thrombophlebitis. which causes tender red lumps that appear in a line.\n\n【18】Inflammation of the joints\n--------------------------\n\n【19】Behçet's disease affects the joints in around 1 in 2 people with the condition, causing arthritis\\-like symptoms such as pain, stiffness, swelling, warmth and tenderness.\n\n【20】The joints most often affected include the knees, ankles, wrists and small joints in the hands.\n\n【21】Unlike some conditions affecting the joints, permanent joint damage is rare in Behçet's disease and symptoms can usually be controlled successfully.\n\n【22】Inflammation of the eyes\n------------------------\n\n【23】Inflammation of the eyes is another common symptom of Behçet's disease, occurring in around 7 out of 10 cases. It often develops very suddenly.\n\n【24】Inflammation often affects the uveal tract, which is a group of connected structures inside the eye. Sometimes both eyes may be affected at the same time.\n\n【25】Inflammation of the uveal tract is known as uveitis and it can cause symptoms that include:\n\n【26】*   painful red eyes\n*   sensitivity to light\n*   floaters (dots that move across the field of vision)\n*   blurred vision\n*   sudden loss of vision\n\n【27】Call 999 or go to A&E if you have sudden blurred vision or sudden loss of vision.\n\n【28】In the most severe cases of Behçet's disease, inflammation of the eyes can lead to permanent loss of vision. However, this is far less likely with early and appropriate treatment.\n\n【29】Sensitive skin\n--------------\n\n【30】In some people with Behçet's disease, the skin is particularly sensitive to injury or irritation. This is known as pathergy.\n\n【31】For example, if a needle is used to prick the skin of someone who has pathergy, a large red bump may develop within 1 to 2 days that appears out of proportion to the original needle prick.\n\n【32】Not everyone with Behçet's disease has pathergy, so this reaction alone cannot diagnose the condition.\n\n【33】Gastrointestinal symptoms\n-------------------------\n\n【34】Behçet's disease can cause inflammation of the stomach and bowel, which can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【35】*   feeling and being sick\n*   tummy pain\n*   indigestion\n*   loss of appetite\n*   diarrhoea with bleeding\n\n【36】Occasionally, the inflammation can cause the bowel to become damaged and bleed. Having blood in your poo is a possible symptom of inflammation of the internal lining of the bowel.\n\n【37】Blood clots\n-----------\n\n【38】The inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels associated with Behçet's disease can sometimes cause blood clots to form.\n\n【39】One of the most common types of blood clot to affect people with Behçet's disease is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), where a blood clot develops in 1 of the deep veins of the body, usually in the legs.\n\n【40】Symptoms of DVT include:\n\n【41】*   pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually in the calf)\n*   a heavy ache in the affected area\n*   warm skin in the area of the clot\n*   redness of your skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee\n\n【42】DVT requires immediate medical treatment. If you suspect DVT,  go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately.\n\n【43】In people with Behçet's disease, careful assessment is needed to determine if it's safe to use blood thinning treatment for this complication. Treatment to control inflammation is usually more effective.\n\n【44】### Cerebral venous thrombosis\n\n【45】A less common type of blood clot associated with Behçet's disease is cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). This occurs when a blood clot develops inside the blood vessels that run through channels located between the outer and inner layer of your brain.\n\n【46】The blood clot can increase the pressure inside your skull and also lead to an interruption of the blood supply to the brain (stroke).\n\n【47】Symptoms of a CVT include:\n\n【48】*   a severe headache – this has been described as a throbbing, piercing, band of pain, or as a very severe pain that suddenly appears out of nowhere\n*   slurred speech\n*   seizures (fits)\n*   hearing loss\n*   double vision\n*   stroke-like symptoms, such as muscle weakness or paralysis – but, unlike most strokes, both sides of the body can be affected\n\n【49】CVT is as a medical emergency. If you suspect a CVT, dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance.\n\n【50】Aneurysms\n---------\n\n【51】Inflammation of the blood vessels can cause the walls of your blood vessels to weaken. This causes the walls to bulge outwards as a result of blood pressure. The bulge is known as an aneurysm.\n\n【52】Aneurysms do not usually cause any noticeable symptoms unless the wall of the blood vessel becomes so weak that it enlarges or ruptures. This can place pressure on nearby areas and can sometimes lead to internal bleeding or organ dysfunction.\n\n【53】The symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can vary depending on where in the body the aneurysm developed. Possible symptoms include:\n\n【54】*   sudden severe pain in the body, such as the limb, chest, back, or tummy\n*   a sudden agonising headache\n*   dizziness\n*   breathlessness\n*   coughing up blood\n*   confusion\n*   loss of consciousness\n\n【55】Call 999 if you or someone else suddenly gets these symptoms.\n\n【56】Inflammation of the nervous system\n----------------------------------\n\n【57】Inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) causes the most serious symptoms associated with Behçet's disease.\n\n【58】The symptoms of CNS inflammation usually develop quickly over the space of a few days, and can include:\n\n【59】*   headache\n*   double vision\n*   loss of balance\n*   seizures (fits)\n*   partial paralysis on 1 side of the body\n*   behavioural or personality changes\n\n【60】Call 999 or go to A&E if you or someone else suddenly develops these symptoms.\n\n【61】General symptoms\n----------------\n\n【62】It's also common for people with Behçet's disease to experience more general symptoms as a result of the condition, including periods of extreme physical or mental tiredness (fatigue). This can affect a person's ability to perform any sort of activity.\n\n【63】Page last reviewed: 06 April 2023  \nNext review due: 06 April 2026\n\n【64】*   Previous : Behçet's disease\n*   Next : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Page last reviewed: 06 April 2023\n\nNext review due: 06 April 2026\n\n【64】*   Previous : Behçet’s disease\n\nNext : Treatment", "content": "【0】Symptoms \\- Behçet's disease\n============================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.  Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Behçet's disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, but it's rare for someone with the condition to have all of them at once.**\n\n【4】Most people experience times when the symptoms improve (remission) and times when they get worse (flare-ups or relapses).\n\n【5】Mouth ulcers\n------------\n\n【6】Almost everyone with Behçet's disease develops mouth ulcers. The ulcers may look the same as normal mouth ulcers, but can be more numerous and painful. They most often develop on the tongue, lips, gums and the insides of the cheeks.\n\n【7】The ulcers usually heal within a couple of weeks without leaving any scarring, although they'll often return.\n\n【8】Genital ulcers\n--------------\n\n【9】Like mouth ulcers, recurrent genital ulcers are also a common symptom of Behçet's disease.\n\n【10】In men, the ulcers usually appear on the scrotum. In women, they usually appear on the cervix (neck of the womb), vulva or vagina. However, genital ulcers can appear anywhere in the groin area, including on the penis, but this is rare.\n\n【11】The genital ulcers are usually painful and may leave scarring. Men may also experience inflammation (swelling) of the testicles and women may find the ulcers make having sex painful.\n\n【12】Genital ulcers caused by Behçet's disease are not contagious and cannot be spread through sexual intercourse.\n\n【13】Skin lesions\n------------\n\n【14】Many people with Behçet's disease also develop skin lesions. A lesion is any type of unusual growth or abnormality that develops on your skin, such as a bump or a discoloured area of skin.\n\n【15】Skin lesions that can occur in Behçet's disease include red, tender swellings on the legs called erythema nodosum and more widespread acne\\-like spots called pseudofolliculitis.\n\n【16】Skin lesions often heal within 14 days, although they may come back frequently. Erythema nodosum lesions may leave permanently discoloured areas of skin.\n\n【17】Behçet's disease may also cause another skin condition called superficial thrombophlebitis. which causes tender red lumps that appear in a line.\n\n【18】Inflammation of the joints\n--------------------------\n\n【19】Behçet's disease affects the joints in around 1 in 2 people with the condition, causing arthritis\\-like symptoms such as pain, stiffness, swelling, warmth and tenderness.\n\n【20】The joints most often affected include the knees, ankles, wrists and small joints in the hands.\n\n【21】Unlike some conditions affecting the joints, permanent joint damage is rare in Behçet's disease and symptoms can usually be controlled successfully.\n\n【22】Inflammation of the eyes\n------------------------\n\n【23】Inflammation of the eyes is another common symptom of Behçet's disease, occurring in around 7 out of 10 cases.

Metal implant advice\n\n【3】**Patients with a common type of metal hip implant should have regular annual health checks.**\n\n【4】Most people who have a metal-on-metal (MoM) implant have well-functioning hips and are thought to be at low risk of developing any serious problems.\n\n【5】But compared with other hip replacements, some metal-on-metal hip devices have been found to wear down more quickly in some patients.\n\n【6】This potentially causes damage and deterioration in the bone and tissue around the hip, which medical checks will monitor.\n\n【7】In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published updated guidelines on monitoring patients with all types of metal-on-metal hip implants.\n\n【8】Check-ups are a precautionary measure to reduce the small risk of complications and monitor patients who have had the devices implanted for a long time.\n\n【9】What should I do if I have this type of hip implant?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Metal-on-metal (MoM) implants have only been used in a minority of all hip replacement surgeries. They are done on very few people now, so this may not affect you.\n\n【11】If you're not sure what type of implant you have or you have any concerns about your hip, you can consult your doctor for advice.\n\n【12】If you do have a metal-on-metal implant, make sure you attend any follow-up appointments you're invited to.\n\n【13】You should also be aware of the warning signs that could show there's a problem.\n\n【14】What are the warning signs?\n---------------------------\n\n【15】You should contact your doctor if you have:\n\n【16】*   pain in your groin, hip or leg\n*   swelling at or near your hip joint\n*   a limp or problems walking\n*   grinding or clunking from the joint\n\n【17】These symptoms do not necessarily mean your device is failing, but they do need to be investigated.\n\n【18】Any changes in your general health should also be reported, including:\n\n【19】*   chest pain or shortness of breath\n*   numbness or weakness\n*   changes in vision or hearing\n*   fatigue\n*   feeling cold\n*   weight gain\n\n【20】What are metal-on-metal implants?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】As the name implies, metal-on-metal implants are a joint made of two metal surfaces:\n\n【22】*   a metal \"ball\" that replaces the ball at the top of the thigh bone (femur)\n*   a metal \"cup\" that acts like the socket in the pelvis\n\n【23】What does monitoring involve?\n-----------------------------\n\n【24】Patients who have metal-on-metal implants should be monitored regularly for the life of the implant and have tests to measure levels of metal particles (ions) in their blood.\n\n【25】Patients with these types of implant who have symptoms may be investigated with MRI or ultrasound scans, and patients without symptoms should have a scan if the level of metal ions in their blood is rising.\n\n【26】What is the problem with metal-on-metal implants?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】### Wear and tear\n\n【28】All hip implants wear down over time as the ball and cup slide against each other during movements, including walking and running.\n\n【29】Although many people live the rest of their lives without needing a replacement implant, some people may eventually need surgery to remove or replace its components.\n\n【30】Evidence suggests that certain types of metal-on-metal implant wear down at a faster rate than other types.\n\n【31】As friction acts upon their surfaces, it can cause tiny metal particles to break off and enter the space around the implant.\n\n【32】People are thought to react differently to the presence of these metal particles, but they can trigger inflammation and discomfort in the area around the implant in some people.\n\n【33】If not caught early, this can cause damage and deterioration in the bone and tissue surrounding the implant and joint over time.

Metal implant advice</mark>advice\n\n【3】**Patients with a common type of metal hip implant should have regular annual health checks.**\n\n【4】Most people who have a metal-on-metal (MoM) implant have well-functioning hips and are thought to be at low risk of developing any serious problems.\n\n【5】But compared with other hip replacements, some metal-on-metal hip devices have been found to wear down more quickly in some patients.\n\n【6】This potentially causes damage and deterioration in the bone and tissue around the hip, which medical checks will monitor.\n\n【7】In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published updated guidelines on monitoring patients with all types of metal-on-metal hip implants.\n\n【8】Check-ups are a precautionary measure to reduce the small risk of complications and monitor patients who have had the devices implanted for a long time.\n\n【9】What should I do if I have this type of hip implant?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Metal-on-metal (MoM) implants have only been used in a minority of all hip replacement surgeries. They are done on very few people now, so this may not affect you.\n\n【11】If you're not sure what type of implant you have or you have any concerns about your hip, you can consult your doctor for advice.\n\n【12】If you do have a metal-on-metal implant, make sure you attend any follow-up appointments you're invited to.\n\n【13】You should also be aware of the warning signs that could show there's a problem.\n\n【14】What are the warning signs?\n---------------------------\n\n【15】You should contact your doctor if you have:\n\n【16】*   pain in your groin, hip or leg\n*   swelling at or near your hip joint\n*   a limp or problems walking\n*   grinding or clunking from the joint\n\n【17】These symptoms do not necessarily mean your device is failing, but they do need to be investigated.\n\n【18】Any changes in your general health should also be reported, including:\n\n【19】*   chest pain or shortness of breath\n*   numbness or weakness\n*   changes in vision or hearing\n*   fatigue\n*   feeling cold\n*   weight gain\n\n【20】What are metal-on-metal implants?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】As the name implies, metal-on-metal implants are a joint made of two metal surfaces:\n\n【22】*   a metal \"ball\" that replaces the ball at the top of the thigh bone (femur)\n*   a metal \"cup\" that acts like the socket in the pelvis\n\n【23】What does monitoring involve?\n-----------------------------\n\n【24】Patients who have metal-on-metal implants should be monitored regularly for the life of the implant and have tests to measure levels of metal particles (ions) in their blood.\n\n【25】Patients with these types of implant who have symptoms may be investigated with MRI or ultrasound scans, and patients without symptoms should have a scan if the level of metal ions in their blood is rising.\n\n【26】What is the problem with metal-on-metal implants?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】### Wear and tear\n\n【28】All hip implants wear down over time as the ball and cup slide against each other during movements, including walking and running.\n\n【29】Although many people live the rest of their lives without needing a replacement implant, some people may eventually need surgery to remove or replace its components.\n\n【30】Evidence suggests that certain types of metal-on-metal implant wear down at a faster rate than other types.\n\n【31】As friction acts upon their surfaces, it can cause tiny metal particles to break off and enter the space around the implant.\n\n【32】People are thought to react differently to the presence of these metal particles, but they can trigger inflammation and discomfort in the area around the implant in some people.\n\n【33】If not caught early, this can cause damage and deterioration in the bone and tissue surrounding the implant and joint over time. This in turn may cause the implant to become loose and cause painful symptoms, meaning further surgery is required.\n\n【34】The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance is designed to detect and treat any complications like this.\n\n【35】### Metal ions in the blood\n\n【36】Some news coverage has focused on the MHRA's recommendation to check for the presence of metal ions in the blood.\n\n【37】Ions are electrically charged molecules. Levels of ions in the blood, particularly of cobalt and chromium used in the surface of the implants, may therefore indicate how much wear there is to the artificial hip.\n\n【38】These ions in the blood are not blood poisoning and do not lead to sepsis, which is an entirely different type of illness. Talk of this in some news reports is very misleading and completely wrong.\n\n【39】There has been no definitive link between ions from metal-on-metal implants and illness, although there has been a small number of cases in which high levels of metal ions in the blood have been associated with symptoms or illnesses elsewhere in the body, including effects on the heart, nervous system and thyroid gland.\n\n【40】How many people are affected?\n-----------------------------\n\n【41】Approximately 71,000 UK patients have had a metal-on-metal hip device implanted or had metal-on-metal resurfacing.\n\n【42】The majority of these patients have well-functioning hips and a low risk of complications.\n\n【43】Because of the problems with this type of implant, they are rarely used now.\n\n【44】How are medical devices regulated?\n----------------------------------\n\n【45】In the UK, the MHRA is the government agency responsible for ensuring medical devices work and are safe. MHRA audits the performance of private sector organisations that assess and approve medical devices.\n\n【46】Once a product is on the market and in use, MHRA has a system for receiving reports of problems with these products and will issue warnings if these problems are confirmed through its investigations.\n\n【47】It also inspects companies that manufacture products to ensure they comply with regulations.\n\n【48】Further information\n-------------------\n\n【49】National Joint Registry: metal-on-metal hip implants\n\n【50】Page last reviewed: 23 December 2019  \nNext review due: 23 December 2022\n\n【51】*   Previous : Recovery", "index": 6119, "show": true, "start": 6106, "end": 6292, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:52:33", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:53:28", "cost": 54.635}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:47", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:53:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:52:33"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment\n\n【3】**Spina bifida is when a baby's spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb, causing a gap in the spine.**\n\n【4】Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord.\n\n【5】The neural tube starts to form in early pregnancy and closes about 4 weeks after conception.\n\n【6】In spina bifida, part of the neural tube does not develop or close properly, leading to defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine (vertebrae).\n\n【7】It's not known what causes spina bifida, but a lack of folic acid before and in the early stages of pregnancy is a significant risk factor.\n\n【8】Types of spina bifida\n---------------------\n\n【9】There are several different types of spina bifida, including:\n\n【10】*   myelomeningocele – the most severe type of spina bifida; the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the back, allowing the spinal cord and protective membranes around it to push out and form a sac in the baby's back\n*   meningocele – another serious type of spina bifida where the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the spine; the spinal cord usually develops normally so surgery can often be used to remove the membranes without damaging the nerves\n*   spina bifida occulta – the most common and mildest type of spina bifida; 1 or more vertebrae does not form properly, but the gap in the spine is very small; spina bifida occulta does not usually cause any problems and most people are unaware they have it\n\n【11】These pages focus on myelomeningocele, the most severe type of spina bifida, and this is the type usually referred to whenever the term spina bifida is used.\n\n【12】Shine is a charity that provides help and support for people affected by spina bifida. \n\n【13】Their website has more information about the other types of spina bifida.\n\n【14】Symptoms of spina bifida\n------------------------\n\n【15】Most people with spina bifida are able to have surgery to close the opening in the spine.\n\n【16】But the nervous system will usually already have been damaged, which can lead to problems such as:\n\n【17】*   weakness or total paralysis of the legs\n*   bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence\n*   loss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom – the child is unable to feel hot or cold, which can lead to accidental injury\n\n【18】Many babies will have or develop hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain.\n\n【19】Most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, but some have learning difficulties.\n\n【20】Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida.\n\n【21】Causes of spina bifida\n----------------------\n\n【22】The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but a number of factors can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition.\n\n【23】These include: \n\n【24】*   low folic acid intake during pregnancy\n*   having a family history of spina bifida\n*   medicines – taking certain medicines such as valproic acid (used to prevent seizures) during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida\n\n【25】Read more about the causes of spina bifida.\n\n【26】Diagnosing spina bifida\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Spina bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【28】If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you.\n\n【29】This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice.\n\n【30】### Tests after birth\n\n【31】Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option.\n\n【32】Tests may include:\n\n【33】*   monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan, to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)\n*   ultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally\n*   an assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis\n\n【34】Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born.\n\n【35】Treating spina bifida\n---------------------\n\n【36】Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include:\n\n【37】*   surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus\n*   therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n*   assistive devices and mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, or walking aids\n*   treatments for bowel and urinary problems\n\n【38】With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood.\n\n【39】It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives.\n\n【40】Read more about treating spina bifida.\n\n【41】Preventing spina bifida with folic acid\n---------------------------------------\n\n【42】The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy.\n\n【43】### Folic acid recommendations\n\n【44】You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant.\n\n【45】If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant.\n\n【46】Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you.\n\n【47】You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas.\n\n【48】Read more about folic acid, including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate.\n\n【49】### Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida\n\n【50】Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP.\n\n【51】Women at higher risk include those:\n\n【52】*   with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   with a partner with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n*   with diabetes\n\n【53】A GP can advise you further about this.\n\n【54】If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy, you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid.\n\n【55】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【56】If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it.\n\n【57】Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations.\n\n【58】You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website.\n\n【59】National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】If you or your child has spina bifida, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【61】The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【28】If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you.\n\n【29】This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice.\n\n【30】### Tests after birth\n\n【31】Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option.\n\n【32】Tests may include:\n\n【33】*   monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan, to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)\n*   ultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally\n*   an assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis\n\n【34】Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born.\n\n【35】Treating spina bifida\n---------------------\n\n【36】Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include:\n\n【37】*   surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus\n*   therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n*   assistive devices and mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, or walking aids\n*   treatments for bowel and urinary problems\n\n【38】With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood.\n\n【39】It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives.\n\n<mark>【40】Read more about treating spina bifida.</mark>\n\n【41】Preventing spina bifida with folic acid\n---------------------------------------\n\n【42】The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy.\n\n【43】### Folic acid recommendations\n\n【44】You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant.\n\n【45】If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant.\n\n【46】Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you.\n\n【47】You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas.\n\n<mark>【48】Read more about folic acid, including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate.</mark>\n\n【49】### Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida\n\n【50】Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP.\n\n【51】Women at higher risk include those:\n\n【52】*   with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   with a partner with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n*   with diabetes\n\n【53】A GP can advise you further about this.\n\n【54】If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy, you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid.\n\n【55】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【56】If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it.\n\n【57】Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations.\n\n【58】You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website.\n\n【59】National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【60】If you or your child has spina bifida, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【61】The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n\n【62】Page last reviewed: 20 April 2020  \nNext review due: 20 April 2023\n\n【63】*   Next : Symptoms", "index": 7739, "show": true, "start": 7687, "end": 7781, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:25:45", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:27:38", "cost": 113.619}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:47", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:27:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:25:44"}

This is because the medicine works best when your bowels are empty.\n\n【9】After you use the foam, try not to poo again for at least a few hours. For the medicine to work properly it needs to stay inside your bowel as long as possible.\n\n【10】### How to use it\n\n【11】1.  Read the instruction leaflet. The pictures show you exactly how to use the foam.\n2.  If you're using it for the first time, remove the plastic flap (or safety lock) from underneath the dome-shaped pump at the top of the can.\n3.  Wash your hands before and after using the foam.\n4.  Push a new applicator onto the nozzle. This nozzle sticks out beneath the dome at the top of the can.\n5.  Shake the can for about 15 seconds.\n6.  Twist the rounded dome at the bottom.\n7.  Put your index finger on top of the dome and turn the can upside down. It's important to keep the can as straight (vertical) as possible.\n8.  Stand with one leg raised on a chair – or lie down on your side if you prefer. Gently put the applicator into your bottom as far as possible.\n9.  Push the dome down fully once.\n10.  Then release the dome slowly. The foam comes out of the spray can when you do this.\n11.  Wait 10 to 15 seconds before removing the applicator from your bottom. This is important to make sure you get the full dose and to stop any foam spilling out.\n12.  Twist the dome at the base and remove the applicator from the nozzle. This stops any foam coming out when you're not using it. Put the applicator in the plastic bag provided and throw the bag away.\n\n【12】**Budesonide enemas**\n---------------------\n\n【13】This medicine comes as liquid and tablets that you mix together. Once made up, it contains a 2mg dose of budesonide.\n\n【14】It's best to use budesonide enemas at night, just before going to bed.\n\n【15】It's best to go to the toilet before using the enema. This is because it's more comfortable if you empty your bowels and bladder before using it.\n\n【16】You may want to sleep on a towel or similar covering. This is to protect your bedding from stains.\n\n【17】### How to use a budesonide enema\n\n【18】You should have 1 bottle of liquid, 1 nozzle and enema tablets.\n\n【19】1.  Check the instruction leaflet first. The pictures show you exactly how to prepare and use the enema.\n2.  Take a bottle of the liquid and unscrew the cap.\n3.  Remove 1 tablet from the foil strip and drop it into the bottle of liquid.\n4.  Replace the cap and screw firmly back onto the bottle.\n5.  Shake the bottle well for at least 15 seconds, or until the tablet has dissolved in the liquid.\n6.  Remove the cap and screw the nozzle tightly onto the top of the bottle.\n7.  The enema is now ready and should be used immediately.\n8.  Wash your hands before and after using the enema.\n9.  Lie on your side, with your bottom slightly higher than the rest of your body. You can use a pillow to lift your bottom up. You may want to lie on a towel.\n10.  Put one of the disposable plastic bags provided over your hand (like a glove) and pick up the bottle.\n11.  Shake the bottle and remove only the protective cap that covers the nozzle (do not unscrew the nozzle itself).\n12.  Gently push the nozzle into your bottom as far as is comfortable. You can use a lubricant if you find this uncomfortable.\n13.  Squeeze the bottle to push the liquid into your bottom. It's normal for some liquid to be left in the bottle afterwards.\n14.  Remove the nozzle from your bottom.\n15.  Put the bottle into the disposable plastic bag by rolling the bag off your hand and over the bottle, ready to throw away.\n16.  Roll onto your front and wait for 5 minutes. This will stop any liquid coming out of your bottom.\n17.  For sleeping, find a comfortable position that keeps the liquid in your bottom for as long as possible. The longer it stays there, the better it will work.\n\n【20】How long to use it for\n----------------------\n\n【21】Your doctor will tell you how long to use budesonide rectal foam or enemas for. This will usually be for no longer than 8 weeks. Do not use budesonide rectal foam or enemas for more than 8 weeks without speaking to a doctor.\n\n【22】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【23】If you forget to use your budesonide rectal foam or enema, use it as soon as you remember unless it's nearly time for the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【24】Never use 2 doses to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【25】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to use this medicine.\n\n【26】If you use too much\n-------------------\n\n【27】Using too much budesonide is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【28】If you're worried, talk to your doctor or a pharmacist.\n\n【29】More in Budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   About budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n\n【31】Page last reviewed: 16 August 2023  \nNext review due: 16 August 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "More in Budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n【30】*   About budesonide rectal foam and enemas\n\nWho can and cannot use it\nHow and when to use it\nSide effects\nPregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\nUsing it with other medicines and herbal supplements\nCommon questions\n【31】Page last reviewed: 16 August 2023\n\nNext review due: 16 August 2026", "content": "【0】How and when to use budesonide rectal foam and enemas \\- Brand names: Budenofalk, Entocort\n==========================================================================================\n\n【1】Always use budesonide rectal foam and enemas as a doctor or pharmacist has told you.\n\n【2】Dosage\n------\n\n【3】The usual dose of budesonide rectal foam or budesonide enema is 2mg, used once a day for up to 8 weeks.\n\n【4】Budesonide rectal foam\n----------------------\n\n【5】Budesonide rectal foam comes in a can with single-use plastic tubes (applicators) that you use to insert the foam.\n\n【6】Each application gives a 2mg dose of budesonide.\n\n【7】Try to use it at about the same time of day, either in the morning or in the evening before bed.\n\n【8】Use the rectal foam after doing a poo.

It's a treatment that can be given when you stop breathing (respiratory arrest) or your heart stops beating (cardiac arrest).\n\n【2】CPR tries to get your breathing and heart going again.\n\n【3】It can involve:\n\n【4】*   pressing down hard on your chest repeatedly (chest compressions)\n*   a machine to stimulate your heart using electrical shocks (sometimes more than once)\n*   equipment that helps move oxygen around your body (artificial ventilation)\n*   giving medicine by injection\n\n【5】How successful is CPR?\n----------------------\n\n【6】CPR can sometimes get the heart and breathing going again. The actions used in CPR, such as chest compressions, can cause bruising, break ribs and puncture lungs.\n\n【7】Overall, CPR restarts the heart and/or breathing for between 1 and 2 in 10 people whose heart or breathing have stopped.\n\n【8】You have the best chance of CPR restarting your heart or breathing if:\n\n【9】*   your lungs, heart or other organs are healthy and working well before your heart or breathing stops\n*   you are near a person trained in CPR\n*   any equipment that is needed, such as a defibrillator, is nearby\n\n【10】The chances of CPR starting your heart and/or breathing are lower if your lungs, heart or other organs are struggling to work before CPR is needed. Your organs might be struggling because you:\n\n【11】*   have previous organ damage (for example, your lungs have been damaged by smoking)\n*   have a serious long-term condition (this is not the same as a disability)\n*   have current severe illness\n*   are frail\n*   are approaching the end of your life\n\n【12】Only a few people make a full recovery even if their heart or breathing can be restarted with CPR.\n\n【13】You may still be very unwell and need more treatment and you may never get back to the health you had before.\n\n【14】Your heart and/or brain may be permanently damaged. This is why DNACPR forms are written. They mean you do not receive a treatment that may prolong or cause suffering at the end of your life.\n\n【15】What does DNACPR mean and how is it recorded?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【16】DNACPR stands for do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It's sometimes called DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation) or DNR (do not resuscitate) but they all refer to the same thing.\n\n【17】DNACPR means if your heart or breathing stops your healthcare team will not try to restart it.\n\n【18】A DNACPR decision is made by you and/or your doctor or healthcare team. This is explained in more detail in the following section \"When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\".\n\n【19】A DNACPR decision is usually recorded on a special form. Different doctors or hospitals might use different forms, but they all serve the same purpose. Some examples are a DNACPR form, a treatment escalation plan, or a recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) process.\n\n【20】All these forms are easily recognised by doctors, nurses and healthcare workers, so they know what to do in an emergency.\n\n【21】This form is kept in your medical records. It may also be printed and kept with you if you are at home or in a care home.\n\n【22】You and the people important to you should know that a DNACPR form has been put in your medical records.\n\n【23】The form says that if your heart or breathing stop, CPR should not be tried. This means medical staff will not try to restart your heart or breathing.\n\n【24】### Important\n\n【25】DNACPR is about CPR only. It does not mean that you will not get care and treatment. You will continue to have all the other appropriate care, treatment and support you need.\n\n【26】When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】There are different situations when a DNACPR decision might be made.\n\n【28】### You decide – deciding in advance to refuse CPR\n\n【29】Everyone who has capacity to do so can refuse CPR if they wish.\n\n【30】This is a choice you can make at any time, for example when you are healthy or when you are approaching the end of your life.\n\n【31】You can make it clear to your doctor or medical team that you do not want CPR if your heart or breathing stops.\n\n【32】Your doctor may complete a DNACPR form to indicate this and put it in your medical records.\n\n【33】*   If you wish to make your refusal of CPR legally binding for when in the future you are unable to make this decision, then you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains to a doctor or medical team when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatments).\n*   You can change your mind about your DNACPR decision at any time. If you do, you need to tell your doctors and nurses so that the DNACPR form is marked as no longer valid. The fact that you once had a DNACPR form will still be recorded on your records so that doctors and nurses can see your full medical history and know about conversations that happened in the past.\n\n【34】### A doctor decides in advance\n\n【35】*   DNACPR is a medical treatment decision that can be made by your doctor even if you do not agree.\n*   You must be told that a DNACPR form will be/has been completed for you, but a doctor does not need your consent. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n*   You should be given the chance to understand what a DNACPR is, how the decision is made and why they think CPR would not be suitable for you. For example, your doctor may think that CPR will not help you live longer or that giving you CPR could cause you more harm. This may be because your organs are already too damaged because of another illness or you are approaching the end of your life.\n*   You should then be consulted, and doctors should ask about your wishes and preferences. Your doctor makes the final decision.\n*   Doctors do not have to give you treatment if they think it will not work.\n*   A DNACPR decision must be made on an individual (person by person) basis. This means it must be based on your health, needs and priorities as an individual. The judgement about whether the discussion or decision would cause you harm should also be made on an individual basis.\n*   DNACPR decisions should not be made for a group of people at once. For example, DNACPR decisions should not be made for everyone living in a care home or for a group of people over a certain age. This is unlawful, irrespective of medical condition, age, disability, race or language.\n*   Learning disability, autism or dementia are not reasons to put a DNACPR on someone's record.\n*   If you disagree with a DNACPR decision that a doctor has made, you can ask for a second opinion and a review. You cannot demand CPR. The law does not require your consent to a DNACPR. The law does provide you with the right to be involved in, and informed of, a doctor's DNACPR decision.\n\n【36】What happens if you are unable to make or discuss a DNACPR decision in advance of your heart stopping?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Some people cannot make decisions about CPR for themselves. If you have been assessed as unable to make a specific decision for yourself, you will be referred to as \"lacking capacity\".\n\n【38】If you lack capacity to decide about CPR, doctors should first check to see if you have an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT) that says that you do not want CPR. They should also check to see if you have a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and care decisions.\n\n【39】An LPA is a document that explains who you have chosen to help you make decisions or who can make decisions for you. Your chosen person(s) are known as \"attorneys\". If you would like your LPA to make decisions about CPR, then you must complete and sign the section on life-sustaining treatment in the LPA document.\n\n【40】An LPA (with the right to make decisions on life-sustaining treatment) means if you lack the relevant capacity, your attorney can make the decision relating to CPR in your best interests. Your attorney cannot insist on CPR being given.\n\n【41】If you do not have an ADRT (which says that you do not want CPR) or an LPA (with life-sustaining treatment decision-making powers) then a best interest's decision is made by the senior doctor.\n\n【42】This doctor must ask the people who are important to you about your wishes and preferences. This includes anyone with the legal power to represent you, such as a personal welfare deputy, special guardian or – for children and young people under 16 – a parent.\n\n【43】If you do not have family or friends appropriate to ask, then the doctor should ask an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to represent you in the decision-making process. The doctor should also ask members of your healthcare (multidisciplinary) team for their views.\n\n【44】Information:\n\n【45】### Further information\n\n【46】*   GOV.UK: Deputies - make decisions for someone who lacks capacity\n*   GOV.UK: Become a special guardian\n\n【47】How long does a DNACPR form last?\n---------------------------------\n\n【48】A DNACPR form can be written for a short period – for example, if you have been admitted to hospital. Or it can be written with no end date – for example, if you have a long-term condition that has damaged your heart, lungs or other organs – only being reviewed if your situation changes.\n\n【49】When the DNACPR decision is made you should be told when it will be reviewed, and this is usually recorded on the form. It's recommended that a DNACPR is reviewed each time your situation changes – for example, when you leave hospital. If a DNACPR form is placed on your medical records while in hospital, this will be included in your discharge summary and shared with your GP.\n\n【50】Is a DNACPR form legally binding?\n---------------------------------\n\n【51】A DNACPR form is not legally binding. It's a tool to tell doctors, nurses or paramedics not to attempt CPR.\n\n【52】If you wish to make your DNACPR decision legally binding, you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatment).\n\n【53】Talking about a DNACPR\n----------------------\n\n【54】You do not have to talk about DNACPR if you do not want to. If you would prefer not to talk about it, you can let your doctors and nurses know. You could ask your doctors and nurses to make it clear on your record. If you change your mind and want to talk about it, you can.\n\n【55】If a decision needs to be made about CPR, your doctors can still decide to complete a form even if you ask not to talk about it. Your doctor will do this if they believe that CPR would not prolong your life or would do you more harm than good.\n\n【56】Even if you ask not to be involved in the decision, you should be told if a DNACPR form is written and placed on your medical records. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n\n【57】What should you do if you are concerned about a DNACPR form in your medical record or on somebody else's (such as a relative)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】If you are concerned about a DNACPR form, you should first raise those concerns with your doctor.\n\n【59】If you are still not happy, then you can ask for another doctor's opinion.\n\n【60】If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity to make their own decisions, they will need to agree to it being discussed with you. If you do not have capacity, your family, friends or those with the legal power to represent you (such as a Lasting Power of Attorney) can raise concerns on your behalf.\n\n【61】It's important to understand that nobody has the right to demand CPR, so the decision may not change if there was a good clinical reason for it (for example, your heart, lungs or other organs are struggling to work). The doctor should explain their reasons and ask about your wishes and preferences.\n\n【62】If the DNACPR form was made by a GP, and you are not happy with their response, you should follow the practice's complaints procedure. If you are still concerned, or you wish to make a complaint, contact NHS England and NHS Improvement.\n\n【63】If the DNACPR form was made by a doctor in a hospital, and you are not happy with their response, you can ask to speak to the senior doctor on duty or the consultant responsible for your care. The hospital should have its own complaints procedure. This will tell you how to make a complaint.\n\n【64】If your DNACPR form was made by a GP or doctor in a hospital, you can contact your local Healthwatch to find out about how to get help making a complaint.

The actions used in CPR, such as chest compressions, can cause bruising, break ribs and puncture lungs.\n\n【7】Overall, CPR restarts the heart and/or breathing for between 1 and 2 in 10 people whose heart or breathing have stopped.\n\n【8】You have the best chance of CPR restarting your heart or breathing if:\n\n【9】*   your lungs, heart or other organs are healthy and working well before your heart or breathing stops\n*   you are near a person trained in CPR\n*   any equipment that is needed, such as a defibrillator, is nearby\n\n【10】The chances of CPR starting your heart and/or breathing are lower if your lungs, heart or other organs are struggling to work before CPR is needed. Your organs might be struggling because you:\n\n【11】*   have previous organ damage (for example, your lungs have been damaged by smoking)\n*   have a serious long-term condition (this is not the same as a disability)\n*   have current severe illness\n*   are frail\n*   are approaching the end of your life\n\n【12】Only a few people make a full recovery even if their heart or breathing can be restarted with CPR.\n\n【13】You may still be very unwell and need more treatment and you may never get back to the health you had before.\n\n【14】Your heart and/or brain may be permanently damaged. This is why DNACPR forms are written. They mean you do not receive a treatment that may prolong or cause suffering at the end of your life.\n\n【15】What does DNACPR mean and how is it recorded?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【16】DNACPR stands for do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It's sometimes called DNAR (do not attempt resuscitation) or DNR (do not resuscitate) but they all refer to the same thing.\n\n【17】DNACPR means if your heart or breathing stops your healthcare team will not try to restart it.\n\n【18】A DNACPR decision is made by you and/or your doctor or healthcare team. This is explained in more detail in the following section \"When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\".\n\n【19】A DNACPR decision is usually recorded on a special form. Different doctors or hospitals might use different forms, but they all serve the same purpose. Some examples are a DNACPR form, a treatment escalation plan, or a recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment (ReSPECT) process.\n\n【20】All these forms are easily recognised by doctors, nurses and healthcare workers, so they know what to do in an emergency.\n\n【21】This form is kept in your medical records. It may also be printed and kept with you if you are at home or in a care home.\n\n【22】You and the people important to you should know that a DNACPR form has been put in your medical records.\n\n【23】The form says that if your heart or breathing stop, CPR should not be tried. This means medical staff will not try to restart your heart or breathing.\n\n【24】### Important\n\n【25】DNACPR is about CPR only. It does not mean that you will not get care and treatment. You will continue to have all the other appropriate care, treatment and support you need.\n\n【26】When is a DNACPR decision made and a form written and who is involved?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】There are different situations when a DNACPR decision might be made.\n\n【28】### You decide – deciding in advance to refuse CPR\n\n【29】Everyone who has capacity to do so can refuse CPR if they wish.\n\n【30】This is a choice you can make at any time, for example when you are healthy or when you are approaching the end of your life.\n\n【31】You can make it clear to your doctor or medical team that you do not want CPR if your heart or breathing stops.\n\n【32】Your doctor may complete a DNACPR form to indicate this and put it in your medical records.\n\n【33】*   If you wish to make your refusal of CPR legally binding for when in the future you are unable to make this decision, then you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains to a doctor or medical team when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatments).\n*   You can change your mind about your DNACPR decision at any time. If you do, you need to tell your doctors and nurses so that the DNACPR form is marked as no longer valid. The fact that you once had a DNACPR form will still be recorded on your records so that doctors and nurses can see your full medical history and know about conversations that happened in the past.\n\n【34】### A doctor decides in advance\n\n【35】*   DNACPR is a medical treatment decision that can be made by your doctor even if you do not agree.\n*   You must be told that a DNACPR form will be/has been completed for you, but a doctor does not need your consent. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n*   You should be given the chance to understand what a DNACPR is, how the decision is made and why they think CPR would not be suitable for you. For example, your doctor may think that CPR will not help you live longer or that giving you CPR could cause you more harm. This may be because your organs are already too damaged because of another illness or you are approaching the end of your life.\n*   You should then be consulted, and doctors should ask about your wishes and preferences. Your doctor makes the final decision.\n*   Doctors do not have to give you treatment if they think it will not work.\n*   A DNACPR decision must be made on an individual (person by person) basis. This means it must be based on your health, needs and priorities as an individual. The judgement about whether the discussion or decision would cause you harm should also be made on an individual basis.\n*   DNACPR decisions should not be made for a group of people at once. For example, DNACPR decisions should not be made for everyone living in a care home or for a group of people over a certain age. This is unlawful, irrespective of medical condition, age, disability, race or language.\n*   Learning disability, autism or dementia are not reasons to put a DNACPR on someone's record.\n*   If you disagree with a DNACPR decision that a doctor has made, you can ask for a second opinion and a review. You cannot demand CPR. The law does not require your consent to a DNACPR. The law does provide you with the right to be involved in, and informed of, a doctor's DNACPR decision.\n\n【36】What happens if you are unable to make or discuss a DNACPR decision in advance of your heart stopping?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Some people cannot make decisions about CPR for themselves. If you have been assessed as unable to make a specific decision for yourself, you will be referred to as \"lacking capacity\".\n\n【38】If you lack capacity to decide about CPR, doctors should first check to see if you have an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT) that says that you do not want CPR. They should also check to see if you have a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and care decisions.\n\n【39】An LPA is a document that explains who you have chosen to help you make decisions or who can make decisions for you. Your chosen person(s) are known as \"attorneys\". If you would like your LPA to make decisions about CPR, then you must complete and sign the section on life-sustaining treatment in the LPA document.\n\n【40】An LPA (with the right to make decisions on life-sustaining treatment) means if you lack the relevant capacity, your attorney can make the decision relating to CPR in your best interests. Your attorney cannot insist on CPR being given.\n\n【41】If you do not have an ADRT (which says that you do not want CPR) or an LPA (with life-sustaining treatment decision-making powers) then a best interest's decision is made by the senior doctor.\n\n【42】This doctor must ask the people who are important to you about your wishes and preferences. This includes anyone with the legal power to represent you, such as a personal welfare deputy, special guardian or – for children and young people under 16 – a parent.\n\n【43】If you do not have family or friends appropriate to ask, then the doctor should ask an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to represent you in the decision-making process. The doctor should also ask members of your healthcare (multidisciplinary) team for their views.\n\n【44】Information:\n\n【45】### Further information\n\n【46】*   GOV.UK: Deputies - make decisions for someone who lacks capacity\n*   GOV.UK: Become a special guardian\n\n【47】How long does a DNACPR form last?\n---------------------------------\n\n【48】A DNACPR form can be written for a short period – for example, if you have been admitted to hospital. Or it can be written with no end date – for example, if you have a long-term condition that has damaged your heart, lungs or other organs – only being reviewed if your situation changes.\n\n【49】When the DNACPR decision is made you should be told when it will be reviewed, and this is usually recorded on the form. It's recommended that a DNACPR is reviewed each time your situation changes – for example, when you leave hospital. If a DNACPR form is placed on your medical records while in hospital, this will be included in your discharge summary and shared with your GP.\n\n【50】Is a DNACPR form legally binding?\n---------------------------------\n\n【51】A DNACPR form is not legally binding. It's a tool to tell doctors, nurses or paramedics not to attempt CPR.\n\n【52】If you wish to make your DNACPR decision legally binding, you should write an Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment (ADRT). An ADRT explains when you want to refuse CPR (or other treatment).\n\n【53】Talking about a DNACPR\n----------------------\n\n【54】You do not have to talk about DNACPR if you do not want to. If you would prefer not to talk about it, you can let your doctors and nurses know. You could ask your doctors and nurses to make it clear on your record. If you change your mind and want to talk about it, you can.\n\n【55】If a decision needs to be made about CPR, your doctors can still decide to complete a form even if you ask not to talk about it. Your doctor will do this if they believe that CPR would not prolong your life or would do you more harm than good.\n\n【56】Even if you ask not to be involved in the decision, you should be told if a DNACPR form is written and placed on your medical records. Doctors can only not tell you that a DNACPR form has been completed for you if they think doing so would cause you physical or psychological harm.\n\n【57】What should you do if you are concerned about a DNACPR form in your medical record or on somebody else's (such as a relative)?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】If you are concerned about a DNACPR form, you should first raise those concerns with your doctor.\n\n【59】If you are still not happy, then you can ask for another doctor's opinion.\n\n【60】If you are not the patient and the patient has capacity to make their own decisions, they will need to agree to it being discussed with you. If you do not have capacity, your family, friends or those with the legal power to represent you (such as a Lasting Power of Attorney) can raise concerns on your behalf.\n\n【61】It's important to understand that nobody has the right to demand CPR, so the decision may not change if there was a good clinical reason for it (for example, your heart, lungs or other organs are struggling to work). The doctor should explain their reasons and ask about your wishes and preferences.\n\n【62】If the DNACPR form was made by a GP, and you are not happy with their response, you should follow the practice's complaints procedure. If you are still concerned, or you wish to make a complaint, contact NHS England and NHS Improvement.\n\n【63】If the DNACPR form was made by a doctor in a hospital, and you are not happy with their response, you can ask to speak to the senior doctor on duty or the consultant responsible for your care. The hospital should have its own complaints procedure. This will tell you how to make a complaint.\n\n【64】If your DNACPR form was made by a GP or doctor in a hospital, you can contact your local Healthwatch to find out about how to get help making a complaint. You can also have support from an advocate if you want help to make a complaint about your GP or a doctor in the hospital.\n\n【65】If you are still not happy with the response you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.\n\n【66】Page last reviewed: 14 December 2023  \nNext review due: 14 December 2026", "index": 13257, "show": true, "start": 13257, "end": 13332, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 11:00:55", "endTime": "2024/09/02 11:02:14", "cost": 79.16}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:47", "update_time": "2024-09-01 19:02:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 19:00:54"}

Many couples conceive within the second year of trying.\n\n【26】You can help maximise your chances of conceiving by:\n\n【27】*   having sex every 2 or 3 days\n*   moderating your alcohol consumption and stopping smoking\n*   staying in good shape, exercising regularly and having a healthy, balanced diet\n\n【28】Read more about how to improve your chances of becoming a dad.\n\n【29】### IVF\n\n【30】In vitro fertilisation (IVF) may be an option if you have a slightly low sperm count and you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least 2 years.\n\n【31】During IVF, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop.\n\n【32】Read more about IVF.\n\n【33】### Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)\n\n【34】Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a type of IVF technique, in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to fertilise it. The fertilised egg is then transferred to the woman's womb.\n\n【35】ICSI may be offered if you've been trying to conceive naturally with your partner for at least 2 years and you have either few or no sperm in your semen or poor quality sperm.\n\n【36】Before having ICSI, you and your partner will need to have an assessment to ensure the treatment is appropriate.\n\n【37】This will involve questions about your medical and sexual history, and screening tests to check for infections or genetic problems that could affect your baby and the chances of ICSI working.\n\n【38】The Human Fertilisation & Embryo Authority (HFEA) has more information about ICSI.\n\n【39】### Donor insemination\n\n【40】Donor insemination means using sperm donated by another man.\n\n【41】You may wish to consider using donor insemination as an alternative to ICSI, particularly if you have a genetic disorder that could be passed on to any children.

Coughing or straining may make the lump appear.\n\n【4】Types of hernia\n---------------\n\n【5】### Inguinal hernias\n\n【6】Inguinal hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\n\n【7】This is the most common type of hernia and it mainly affects men. It's often associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【8】### Femoral hernias\n\n【9】Femoral hernias also happen when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\n\n【10】They're much less common than inguinal hernias and tend to affect more women than men.\n\n【11】Like inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are also associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【12】### Umbilical hernias\n\n【13】Umbilical hernias occur when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through your tummy near your belly button.\n\n【14】This type of hernia can occur in babies if the opening in the tummy that the umbilical cord passes through does not seal properly after birth.\n\n【15】Adults can also be affected, possibly as a result of repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【16】### Hiatus hernias\n\n【17】Hiatus hernias occur when part of the stomach pushes up into your chest by squeezing through an opening in the diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the tummy.\n\n【18】This type of hernia may not have any noticeable symptoms, although it can cause heartburn in some people.\n\n【19】It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernias, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age or pressure on the tummy.\n\n【20】### Other types of hernia\n\n【21】Other types of hernia that can affect the tummy include:\n\n【22】*   incisional hernias – where tissue pokes through a surgical wound in your tummy that has not fully healed\n*   epigastric hernias – where fatty tissue pokes through your tummy, between your belly button and the lower part of your breastbone\n*   spigelian hernias – where part of your bowel pokes through your tummy at the side of your abdominal muscle, usually below your belly button\n*   diaphragmatic hernias – where organs in your tummy move into your chest through an opening in the diaphragm; this can also affect babies if their diaphragm does not develop properly in the womb\n*   muscle hernias – where part of the muscle pokes through the tissue; they commonly occur in leg muscles as a result of a sports injury\n\n【23】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【24】See a GP if you think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary.\n\n【25】You should go to your nearest A&E straight away if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms:\n\n【26】*   sudden, severe pain\n*   being sick\n*   difficulty pooing or passing wind\n*   the hernia becomes firm or tender, or cannot be pushed back in\n\n【27】These symptoms could mean that either: \n\n【28】*   the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation)\n*   a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction)\n\n【29】A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【30】Assessing a hernia\n------------------\n\n【31】A GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area.\n\n【32】In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem.\n\n【33】This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body.\n\n【34】Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, a GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary.\n\n【35】A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including:\n\n【36】*   the type of hernia – some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated or cause a bowel obstruction than others\n*   the content of your hernia – if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction\n*   your symptoms and the impact on your daily life – surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities\n*   your general health – surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor\n\n【37】Although most hernias will not get better without surgery, they will not necessarily get worse.\n\n【38】In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits.\n\n【39】Surgery for a hernia\n--------------------\n\n【40】There are 2 main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out:\n\n【41】*   open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the tummy\n*   laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) – this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia\n\n【42】Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks.\n\n【43】If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia coming back.\n\n【44】Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.\n\n【45】### More information\n\n【46】To find out more about some common types of hernia surgery, see:\n\n【47】*   how inguinal hernias are repaired\n*   how femoral hernias are repaired\n*   how umbilical hernias are repaired\n*   how hiatus hernias are treated\n\n【48】Video: what is a hernia?\n------------------------\n\n【49】Watch this animation to see how a hernia occurs and the procedures used to treat it.\n\n【50】Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021  \nMedia review due: 1 April 2024\n\n【51】Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  \nNext review due: 18 October 2025", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【45】### More information\n\n【46】To find out more about some common types of hernia surgery, see:\n\n【47】*   how inguinal hernias are repaired\n\nhow femoral hernias are repaired\nhow umbilical hernias are repaired\nhow hiatus hernias are treated\n【48】Video: what is a hernia?\n【49】Watch this animation to see how a hernia occurs and the procedures used to treat it.\n\n【50】Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021\n\nMedia review due: 1 April 2024\n\n【51】Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022\n\nNext review due: 18 October 2025", "content": "【0】Hernia\n======\n\n【1】**A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.**\n\n【2】A hernia usually develops between your chest and hips.

They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary.\n\n【25】You should go to your nearest A&E straight away if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms:\n\n【26】*   sudden, severe pain\n*   being sick\n*   difficulty pooing or passing wind\n*   the hernia becomes firm or tender, or cannot be pushed back in\n\n【27】These symptoms could mean that either: \n\n【28】*   the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation)\n*   a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction)\n\n【29】A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【30】Assessing a hernia\n------------------\n\n【31】A GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area.\n\n【32】In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem.\n\n【33】This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body.\n\n【34】Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, a GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary.\n\n【35】A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including:\n\n【36】*   the type of hernia – some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated or cause a bowel obstruction than others\n*   the content of your hernia – if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction\n*   your symptoms and the impact on your daily life – surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities\n*   your general health – surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor\n\n【37】Although most hernias will not get better without surgery, they will not necessarily get worse.\n\n【38】In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits.\n\n【39】Surgery for a hernia\n--------------------\n\n【40】There are 2 main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out:\n\n【41】*   open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the tummy\n*   laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) – this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia\n\n【42】Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks.\n\n【43】If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia coming back.\n\n【44】Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.\n\n【45】### More information\n\n【46】To find out more about some common types of hernia surgery, see:\n\n【47】*   how inguinal hernias are repaired\n*   how femoral hernias are repaired\n*   how umbilical hernias are repaired\n*   how hiatus hernias are treated\n\n【48】Video: what is a hernia?\n------------------------\n\n【49】Watch this animation to see how a hernia occurs and the procedures used to treat it.\n\n【50】Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021  \nMedia review due: 1 April 2024\n\n【51】Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  \nNext review due: 18 October 2025", "index": 5822, "show": true, "start": 5822, "end": 6323, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 09:45:50", "endTime": "2024/09/02 09:56:17", "cost": 627.465}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:46", "update_time": "2024-09-01 17:56:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 17:45:45"}

Your doctor may just suggest having regular check-ups to monitor your condition.\n\n【32】If you have symptoms or the problem with your valve is serious, your doctor may recommend:\n\n【33】*   medicines to relieve your symptoms – such as diuretics to reduce breathlessness and medicines for atrial fibrillation\n*   open heart surgery – to repair or replace the mitral valve\n*   keyhole surgery – a small clip is attached to the mitral valve to help it close; the clip is guided into the heart through a thin tube inserted into a vein in the groin\n\n【34】### Causes\n\n【35】Mitral regurgitation happens if the mitral valve cannot close properly.\n\n【36】This is usually caused by either:\n\n【37】*   the mitral valve becoming too floppy (mitral valve prolapse)\n*   the ring of muscle around the valve becoming too wide\n\n【38】These problems often develop with age – for example, because of \"wear and tear\" over time or damage caused by untreated high blood pressure.\n\n【39】Mitral regurgitation can sometimes be caused by a problem such as:\n\n【40】*   cardiomyopathy – where the walls of the heart become stretched, thickened or stiff\n*   endocarditis – infection of the inner lining of the heart\n*   congenital heart disease – birth defects affecting the heart\n\n【41】Mitral stenosis\n---------------\n\n【42】Mitral valve stenosis is where the mitral valve does not open as wide as it should, restricting the flow of blood through the heart.\n\n【43】### Symptoms\n\n【44】Mitral valve stenosis may not have any symptoms.\n\n【45】Sometimes it can cause:\n\n【46】*   dizziness\n*   breathlessness\n*   tiredness\n*   noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\n*   chest pain\n\n【47】If not treated, it can lead to:\n\n【48】*   atrial fibrillation – an irregular and fast heartbeat\n*   pulmonary hypertension – high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs\n*   heart failure – where the heart cannot pump blood around the body properly\n\n【49】### Treatment\n\n【50】You might not need treatment if you do not have any symptoms. Your doctor may just suggest having regular check-ups to monitor your condition.\n\n【51】If you have symptoms or the problem with your valve is serious, your doctor may recommend:\n\n【52】*   medicine to relieve your symptoms – such as medicines called diuretics to reduce breathlessness and medicines for atrial fibrillation\n*   mitral valve surgery – to replace the valve or a procedure to stretch it with a small balloon (balloon valvuloplasty)\n\n【53】### Causes\n\n【54】One of the main causes of mitral valve stenosis is rheumatic heart disease.\n\n【55】This is where an infection causes the heart to become inflamed. Over time, it can cause the flaps of the mitral valve to become hard and thick.\n\n【56】Other causes include hard deposits that form around the valve with age, or a problem with the heart from birth (congenital heart disease).\n\n【57】Mitral valve surgery\n--------------------\n\n【58】Mitral valve surgery may be recommended if you have symptoms caused by a problem with your mitral valve or if the problem is quite serious.\n\n【59】The most common mitral valve procedures are:\n\n【60】*   mitral valve repair\n*   mitral valve replacement\n*   balloon valvuloplasty – where the mitral valve is stretched with a small balloon\n\n【61】### Mitral valve repair\n\n【62】Mitral valve repair is an operation to make the flaps of the mitral valve stay closer together. This will help stop blood flowing the wrong way through the valve.\n\n【63】It's mainly used to treat mitral valve prolapse or regurgitation, if the problem is serious and causing symptoms.\n\n【64】The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. \n\n【65】Your surgeon will usually get to your heart through a single cut along the middle of your chest, but smaller cuts between your ribs are sometimes used.\n\n【66】The flaps of the mitral valve are then partially sewn together.\n\n【67】The operation may be done as keyhole surgery, where a small clip is attached to the mitral valve to help it close.\n\n【68】Most people experience a significant improvement in their symptoms after surgery, but speak to your surgeon about the possible complications.\n\n【69】### Mitral valve replacement\n\n【70】Mitral valve replacement is an operation to replace your mitral valve with a mechanical valve or a valve made from animal tissue (a bioprosthetic valve).\n\n【71】This is usually only done if you have mitral stenosis or mitral prolapse or regurgitation and are unable to have a valve repair.\n\n【72】The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. Your surgeon will usually replace the valve through a single cut along the middle of your chest.\n\n【73】Most people experience a significant improvement in their symptoms after surgery, but speak to your surgeon about the possible complications. The risk of serious problems is generally higher than with mitral valve repair.\n\n【74】You'll also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots for a long time after this operation. If you have a mechanical valve, you'll need to take this medicine for life.\n\n【75】### Balloon valvuloplasty\n\n【76】Balloon valvuloplasty, also called percutaneous mitral commissurotomy, is a procedure that can be used to widen the mitral valve if you have mitral stenosis.\n\n【77】It's usually done using local anaesthetic, where you remain awake but your skin is numbed.\n\n【78】A small cut is made in your groin or neck and a thin tube is passed along a blood vessel to your heart.\n\n【79】The end of the catheter has a small balloon attached to it. This is inflated inside the narrowed valve to stretch it wider. The balloon is then deflated and removed along with the catheter.\n\n【80】This procedure is generally less effective than replacing the mitral valve, but recovery tends to be quicker and it may be a better option if your valve is not too narrow or you're at an increased risk of surgery complications (for example, if you're pregnant or frail).\n\n【81】Page last reviewed: 14 October 2020  \nNext review due: 14 October 2023", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【81】Page last reviewed: 14 October 2020\n\nNext review due: 14 October 2023\n\n\n", "content": "【0】Heart valve problems, see Mitral valve problems\nMitral valve problems\n=====================\n\n【1】**The mitral valve is a small flap in the heart that stops blood flowing the wrong way.

About sodium valproate\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】It's occasionally used to prevent migraine headaches.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It also comes as granules that you mix with food or drink.\n\n【7】Sodium valproate can also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.\n\n【8】If taken during pregnancy, sodium valproate can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【9】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take sodium valproate then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【10】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【11】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【12】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking sodium valproate or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【13】If you do need to continue sodium valproate then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking sodium valproate.\n\n【14】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking sodium valproate. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n【16】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【17】*   You'll usually take sodium valproate once or twice a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are similar to sodium valproate and work in the same way. However these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, sodium valproate is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe sodium valproate for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【18】3\\. Who can and cannot take sodium valproate\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Sodium valproate can be taken by adults and children to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【20】It can be taken by adults (aged 18 and above) to help prevent migraine.\n\n【21】Sodium valproate is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take sodium valproate must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【22】To make sure sodium valproate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【23】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to sodium valproate or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic illness such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【24】4\\. How and when to take sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Sodium valproate is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【26】### Dosage\n\n【27】The usual dose for treating epilepsy in:\n\n【28】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses. Some people take a higher dose of 2,500mg a day\n*   younger children (aged 1 month to 11 years) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【29】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder in:\n\n【30】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【31】The usual dose for preventing migraine in:\n\n【32】*   adults – daily doses vary from a single dose of 400mg to 1,500mg split into 2 doses\n\n【33】If your doctor tells you to take sodium valproate twice a day, you'll usually take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening (to make up your full daily dose).\n\n【34】If you're taking sodium valproate and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【35】### How to take it\n\n【36】Sodium valproate comes as slow release (prolonged or sustained release) tablets, capsules and granules, gastro-resistant tablets, crushable tablets, and as a liquid.\n\n【37】Slow release medicine passes into your body gradually.\n\n【38】Gastro-resistant tablets release the medicine as soon as it passes through your stomach. This means the sodium valproate is less likely to upset your stomach.\n\n【39】You can take sodium valproate with or without food, but it's best to stick to the same way each time. Do not take it with food some days and without food on other days.\n\n【40】#### How to take slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【41】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【42】You'll usually take them once a day, unless you're on a high dose and your doctor tells you to take your medicine twice a day.\n\n【43】#### How to take slow release granules\n\n【44】Add the granules to a small drink, then stir and swallow it. If you prefer, sprinkle the granules onto any soft food that you can swallow whole. Do not chew the granules.\n\n【45】Your doctor will tell you to take these either once or twice a day.\n\n【46】#### How to take gastro-resistant tablets\n\n【47】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【48】You'll usually take these twice a day.\n\n【49】#### How to take crushable tablets\n\n【50】Crush the tablets using the back of a spoon and mix the powder with some soft food that you can swallow whole. If you prefer, add the powder to a small drink, then stir and swallow it.\n\n【51】You'll usually take this medicine twice a day.\n\n【52】#### How to take liquid\n\n【53】Use the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with your medicine to measure the correct dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【54】You'll usually take the liquid twice a day.\n\n【55】### When to take sodium valproate\n\n【56】If you're taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.\n\n【57】If you're taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【58】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【59】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【60】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.\n\n【61】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【62】If you've missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.\n\n【63】If you take sodium valproate:\n\n【64】*   **once a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within a few hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n*   **twice a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n\n【65】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【66】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【67】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I take too much?\n\n【69】Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【70】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【71】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【72】*   you take too much sodium valproate and feel unwell\n\n【73】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【74】If you need to go to A&E, take the sodium valproate packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【75】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【76】Like all medicines, sodium valproate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【77】### Common side effects\n\n【78】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【79】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【80】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【81】### Serious side effects\n\n【82】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking sodium valproate. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【83】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking sodium valproate have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【84】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【85】In rare cases, sodium valproate may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【86】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【87】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【88】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【89】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【90】These are not all the side effects of sodium valproate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n\n【91】Information:\n\n【92】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【93】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【94】6\\. How to cope with side effects of sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【95】**What to do about:**\n\n【96】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take sodium valproate with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to sodium valproate, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking sodium valproate, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of sodium valproate, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and sodium valproate can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of sodium valproate. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【97】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【98】### Sodium valproate and pregnancy\n\n【99】Sodium valproate is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【100】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【101】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【102】If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【103】Your doctor may continue to prescribe sodium valproate, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【104】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to sodium valproate.\n\n【105】Information:\n\n【106】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【107】### Sodium valproate and breastfeeding\n\n【108】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take sodium valproate while breastfeeding.\n\n【109】Sodium valproate passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【110】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend sodium valproate if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【111】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【112】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【113】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n\n【114】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【115】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【116】### More information\n\n【117】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how sodium valproate can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate, available in different languages\n*   valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【118】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【119】There are some medicines that may affect how sodium valproate works. Sodium valproate can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【120】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【121】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【122】### Mixing sodium valproate with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【123】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with sodium valproate.\n\n【124】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【125】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【126】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【127】9\\. Common questions about sodium valproate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【128】How does sodium valproate work?\n\n【129】Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【130】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【131】It's not clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【132】When will I feel better?\n\n【133】It takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【134】How long will I take it for?\n\n【135】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.\n\n【136】Can I get addicted to sodium valproate?\n\n【137】Sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.\n\n【138】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【139】Many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.\n\n【140】However, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【141】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【142】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【143】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【144】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【145】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【146】Are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?\n\n【147】Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【148】If you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.\n\n【149】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【150】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【151】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【152】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【153】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【154】Sodium valproate works for several different types of epilepsy. If it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【155】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【156】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【157】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【158】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【159】Sodium valproate is not used as often for preventing migraine. However, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【160】Your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【161】How does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【162】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【163】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【164】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【165】Do I need to stick to the same brand of sodium valproate?\n\n【166】Once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. This is because it can be a problem to swap from modified release to gastro-resistant tablets.\n\n【167】Some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate. For example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. If you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.\n\n【168】However, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.\n\n【169】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【170】Do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【171】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.\n\n【172】If you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【173】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【174】Sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【175】If you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【176】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【177】Drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【178】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【179】Sodium valproate can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【180】In men sodium valproate has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【181】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Sodium valproate has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【182】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how sodium valproate may affect your fertility.\n\n【183】Sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking sodium valproate and want to start a family, it's important to talk your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking sodium valproate while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【184】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【185】Sodium valproate does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【186】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【187】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【188】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【189】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking sodium valproate. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【190】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【191】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【192】Information:\n\n【193】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【194】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n\n【195】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【196】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n\n【197】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【198】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls of taking sodium valproate.

About sodium valproate\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】It's occasionally used to prevent migraine headaches.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It also comes as granules that you mix with food or drink.\n\n【7】Sodium valproate can also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.\n\n【8】If taken during pregnancy, sodium valproate can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【9】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take sodium valproate then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【10】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【11】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【12】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking sodium valproate or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【13】If you do need to continue sodium valproate then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking sodium valproate.\n\n【14】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking sodium valproate. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n【16】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【17】*   You'll usually take sodium valproate once or twice a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are similar to sodium valproate and work in the same way. However these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, sodium valproate is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe sodium valproate for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【18】3\\. Who can and cannot take sodium valproate\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Sodium valproate can be taken by adults and children to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【20】It can be taken by adults (aged 18 and above) to help prevent migraine.\n\n【21】Sodium valproate is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take sodium valproate must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【22】To make sure sodium valproate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【23】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to sodium valproate or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic illness such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【24】4\\. How and when to take sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Sodium valproate is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【26】### Dosage\n\n【27】The usual dose for treating epilepsy in:\n\n【28】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses. Some people take a higher dose of 2,500mg a day\n*   younger children (aged 1 month to 11 years) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【29】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder in:\n\n【30】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【31】The usual dose for preventing migraine in:\n\n【32】*   adults – daily doses vary from a single dose of 400mg to 1,500mg split into 2 doses\n\n【33】If your doctor tells you to take sodium valproate twice a day, you'll usually take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening (to make up your full daily dose).\n\n【34】If you're taking sodium valproate and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【35】### How to take it\n\n【36】Sodium valproate comes as slow release (prolonged or sustained release) tablets, capsules and granules, gastro-resistant tablets, crushable tablets, and as a liquid.\n\n【37】Slow release medicine passes into your body gradually.\n\n【38】Gastro-resistant tablets release the medicine as soon as it passes through your stomach. This means the sodium valproate is less likely to upset your stomach.\n\n【39】You can take sodium valproate with or without food, but it's best to stick to the same way each time. Do not take it with food some days and without food on other days.\n\n【40】#### How to take slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【41】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【42】You'll usually take them once a day, unless you're on a high dose and your doctor tells you to take your medicine twice a day.\n\n【43】#### How to take slow release granules\n\n【44】Add the granules to a small drink, then stir and swallow it. If you prefer, sprinkle the granules onto any soft food that you can swallow whole. Do not chew the granules.\n\n【45】Your doctor will tell you to take these either once or twice a day.\n\n【46】#### How to take gastro-resistant tablets\n\n【47】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【48】You'll usually take these twice a day.\n\n【49】#### How to take crushable tablets\n\n【50】Crush the tablets using the back of a spoon and mix the powder with some soft food that you can swallow whole. If you prefer, add the powder to a small drink, then stir and swallow it.\n\n【51】You'll usually take this medicine twice a day.\n\n【52】#### How to take liquid\n\n【53】Use the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with your medicine to measure the correct dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【54】You'll usually take the liquid twice a day.\n\n【55】### When to take sodium valproate\n\n【56】If you're taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.\n\n【57】If you're taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【58】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【59】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【60】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.\n\n【61】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【62】If you've missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.\n\n【63】If you take sodium valproate:\n\n【64】*   **once a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within a few hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n*   **twice a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n\n【65】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【66】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【67】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I take too much?\n\n【69】Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【70】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【71】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【72】*   you take too much sodium valproate and feel unwell\n\n【73】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【74】If you need to go to A&E, take the sodium valproate packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【75】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【76】Like all medicines, sodium valproate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【77】### Common side effects\n\n【78】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【79】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【80】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【81】### Serious side effects\n\n【82】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking sodium valproate. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【83】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking sodium valproate have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【84】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【85】In rare cases, sodium valproate may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【86】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【87】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【88】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【89】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【90】These are not all the side effects of sodium valproate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n\n【91】Information:\n\n【92】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【93】Visit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n【94】6\\. How to cope with side effects of sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【95】**What to do about:**\n\n【96】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take sodium valproate with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to sodium valproate, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking sodium valproate, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of sodium valproate, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and sodium valproate can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of sodium valproate. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【97】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【98】### Sodium valproate and pregnancy\n\n【99】Sodium valproate is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【100】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【101】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【102】If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【103】Your doctor may continue to prescribe sodium valproate, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【104】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to sodium valproate.\n\n【105】Information:\n\n【106】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【107】### Sodium valproate and breastfeeding\n\n【108】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take sodium valproate while breastfeeding.\n\n【109】Sodium valproate passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【110】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend sodium valproate if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【111】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【112】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【113】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n\n【114】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【115】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【116】### More information\n\n【117】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how sodium valproate can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate, available in different languages\n*   valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【118】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【119】There are some medicines that may affect how sodium valproate works. Sodium valproate can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【120】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【121】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【122】### Mixing sodium valproate with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【123】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with sodium valproate.\n\n【124】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【125】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【126】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【127】9\\. Common questions about sodium valproate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【128】How does sodium valproate work?\n\n【129】Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【130】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【131】It's not clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【132】When will I feel better?\n\n【133】It takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【134】How long will I take it for?\n\n【135】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.\n\n【136】Can I get addicted to sodium valproate?\n\n【137】Sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.\n\n【138】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【139】Many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.\n\n【140】However, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【141】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【142】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【143】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【144】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【145】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【146】Are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?\n\n【147】Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【148】If you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.\n\n【149】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【150】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【151】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【152】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【153】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【154】Sodium valproate works for several different types of epilepsy. If it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【155】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【156】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【157】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【158】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【159】Sodium valproate is not used as often for preventing migraine. However, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【160】Your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【161】How does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【162】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【163】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【164】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【165】Do I need to stick to the same brand of sodium valproate?\n\n【166】Once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. This is because it can be a problem to swap from modified release to gastro-resistant tablets.\n\n【167】Some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate. For example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. If you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.\n\n【168】However, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.\n\n【169】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【170】Do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【171】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.\n\n【172】If you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【173】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【174】Sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【175】If you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【176】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【177】Drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【178】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【179】Sodium valproate can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【180】In men sodium valproate has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【181】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Sodium valproate has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【182】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how sodium valproate may affect your fertility.\n\n【183】Sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking sodium valproate and want to start a family, it's important to talk your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking sodium valproate while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【184】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【185】Sodium valproate does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【186】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【187】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【188】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【189】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking sodium valproate. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【190】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【191】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【192】Information:\n\n【193】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【194】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n\n【195】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【196】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n\n【197】Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【198】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls of taking sodium valproate.

There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【4】Headaches\n\n【5】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller.\n\n【6】Talk to your doctor if headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【7】Stomach pain\n\n【8】Try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your stomach may also help. If you're in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【9】Feeling bloated\n\n【10】Try not to eat foods that cause wind (like lentils, peas, beans and onions). Eat smaller meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. There are pharmacy medicines that can also help, such as charcoal tablets or simeticone. Speak to a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【11】Feeling sick (nausea)\n\n【12】It may help if you avoid rich or spicy food.\n\n【13】If it does not go away or it's severe, tell your doctor. They may be able to prescribe an extra medicine to help with this side effect.\n\n【14】Feeling nervous or depressed\n\n【15】Talk to your doctor if you have problems with mood changes and it does not improve.\n\n【16】Changes to your periods\n\n【17】Talk to your doctor if you have irregular bleeding, or bleeding after you have not had a period for a while. They may be able to prescribe medicine to help, or arrange for extra tests if you need them.\n\n【18】Weight gain or weight loss\n\n【19】You may lose weight when having medroxyprogesterone injections, but it's more common to gain weight. This is often a small amount.\n\n【20】Eating a healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise will help you keep to a healthy weight.\n\n【21】Lower sex drive\n\n【22】Speak to your doctor if you have problems with your sex drive (loss of libido). You may need to consider using a different contraceptive.\n\n【23】Feeling dizzy\n\n【24】Stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling dizzy.\n\n【25】Breast tenderness\n\n【26】Try to wear a well-fitting and comfortable bra.\n\n【27】Back pain\n\n【28】Try taking a painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【29】Feeling tired or weak\n\n【30】Try to get plenty of rest. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling tired. Do not drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse.\n\n【31】Itchy skin\n\n【32】It may help to take an antihistamine which you can buy from a pharmacy. Check with the pharmacist to see what type is suitable for you.\n\n【33】Acne\n\n【34】Wash with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Speak to a pharmacist for advice about treating acne.\n\n【35】Hair loss\n\n【36】Thinning hair or mild hair loss can be stressful but it is not usually a sign of anything to worry about.

In some people, this can cause fainting or fits (seizures).**\n\n【2】Symptoms of long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Some people with long QT syndrome do not have any symptoms. They may only become aware of their condition after having an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.\n\n【4】Those who do have symptoms usually have:\n\n【5】*   **blackouts or** **fainting**, because the heart has stopped pumping blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen – the heart's rhythm returns to normal within a few minutes and the person regains consciousness\n*   **seizures**, which sometimes happen instead of a blackout when the brain is starved of oxygen\n*   **heart palpitations**, when the heart is beating in a fast or unpredictable way\n\n【6】These symptoms can start unexpectedly and may be triggered by:\n\n【7】*   stress\n*   a sudden noise – such as an alarm\n*   strenuous exercise – particularly swimming\n*   a slow heart rate during sleep\n\n【8】### Risk of death\n\n【9】The heart usually returns to its normal rhythm after it's been beating abnormally.\n\n【10】But if it continues to beat abnormally and is not treated in time with a defibrillator, the heart will stop pumping and the person will die. This is called cardiac arrest, and the heart rarely returns to normal if it is not electrically corrected with shock.\n\n【11】**Call 999 for an ambulance if someone with long QT syndrome suddenly collapses and does not regain consciousness. If you're able to, perform** **cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)** **until medical help arrives.**\n\n【12】Long QT syndrome is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy, people. It can also be an underlying cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n【13】Causes of long QT syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【14】Long QT syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene inherited from a parent. The abnormal gene affects the heart's electrical activity.\n\n【15】Certain medicines can also trigger long QT syndrome, including some types of:\n\n【16】*   antibiotics\n*   antihistamines\n*   antidepressants\n*   antipsychotics\n*   diuretics\n*   heart medicines\n\n【17】But drug-induced long QT syndrome tends to only affect people who already have a tendency to develop the condition.\n\n【18】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, see Cardiac Risk in the Young: medicines people with long QT syndrome should avoid.</u>\n\n【19】Diagnosing long QT syndrome\n---------------------------\n\n【20】A GP may recommend you have an ECG and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) if:\n\n【21】*   you have long QT syndrome\n*   you have blackouts during exercise\n*   you have a family history of unexpected and unexplained sudden death\n\n【22】An ECG records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. If you have long QT syndrome, the trace of the QT section (showing part of the heartbeat) will be longer than normal. Sometimes an exercise ECG will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Genetic testing may be needed to identify the faulty gene causing long QT syndrome. It can also help identify other family members who may have inherited the faulty gene and need clinical assessment.\n\n【24】Treating long QT syndrome \n--------------------------\n\n【25】Most people with inherited long QT syndrome will need treatment with medicines. Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, may be prescribed to help control irregular heartbeats and slow down your heart rate.\n\n【26】If your symptoms are frequent or severe, and you have a high risk of having a life-threatening arrhythmia, you may need to have a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.\n\n【27】In some cases of long QT syndrome, surgery may be needed to control the flow of chemicals into the heart. This is known as a sympathectomy.\n\n【28】If medicines are causing long QT syndrome, your medicines will be reviewed and an alternative may be prescribed.\n\n【29】Living with long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【30】With the right treatment, it's possible to avoid long QT syndrome having a major impact on your day-to-day life. However, you may need to make some lifestyle adjustments to reduce your risk of having blackouts.\n\n【31】For example, you may not be able to exercise strenuously or play competitive sports, and may need to try to avoid startling noises, such as alarm clocks.

In some people, this can cause fainting or fits (seizures).**\n\n【2】Symptoms of long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Some people with long QT syndrome do not have any symptoms. They may only become aware of their condition after having an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.\n\n【4】Those who do have symptoms usually have:\n\n【5】*   **blackouts or** **fainting**, because the heart has stopped pumping blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen – the heart's rhythm returns to normal within a few minutes and the person regains consciousness\n*   **seizures**, which sometimes happen instead of a blackout when the brain is starved of oxygen\n*   **heart palpitations**, when the heart is beating in a fast or unpredictable way\n\n【6】These symptoms can start unexpectedly and may be triggered by:\n\n【7】*   stress\n*   a sudden noise – such as an alarm\n*   strenuous exercise – particularly swimming\n*   a slow heart rate during sleep\n\n【8】### Risk of death\n\n【9】The heart usually returns to its normal rhythm after it's been beating abnormally.\n\n【10】But if it continues to beat abnormally and is not treated in time with a defibrillator, the heart will stop pumping and the person will die. This is called cardiac arrest, and the heart rarely returns to normal if it is not electrically corrected with shock.\n\n【11】**Call 999 for an ambulance if someone with long QT syndrome suddenly collapses and does not regain consciousness. If you're able to, perform** **cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)** **until medical help arrives.**\n\n【12】Long QT syndrome is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy, people. It can also be an underlying cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n【13】Causes of long QT syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【14】Long QT syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene inherited from a parent. The abnormal gene affects the heart's electrical activity.\n\n【15】Certain medicines can also trigger long QT syndrome, including some types of:\n\n【16】*   antibiotics\n*   antihistamines\n*   antidepressants\n*   antipsychotics\n*   diuretics\n*   heart medicines\n\n【17】But drug-induced long QT syndrome tends to only affect people who already have a tendency to develop the condition.\n\n【18】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, see Cardiac Risk in the Young: medicines people with long QT syndrome should avoid.</u>\n\n【19】Diagnosing long QT syndrome\n---------------------------\n\n【20】A GP may recommend you have an ECG and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) if:\n\n【21】*   you have long QT syndrome\n*   you have blackouts during exercise\n*   you have a family history of unexpected and unexplained sudden death\n\n【22】An ECG records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. If you have long QT syndrome, the trace of the QT section (showing part of the heartbeat) will be longer than normal. Sometimes an exercise ECG will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Genetic testing may be needed to identify the faulty gene causing long QT syndrome. It can also help identify other family members who may have inherited the faulty gene and need clinical assessment.\n\n【24】Treating long QT syndrome \n--------------------------\n\n【25】Most people with inherited long QT syndrome will need treatment with medicines. Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, may be prescribed to help control irregular heartbeats and slow down your heart rate.\n\n【26】If your symptoms are frequent or severe, and you have a high risk of having a life-threatening arrhythmia, you may need to have a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.\n\n【27】In some cases of long QT syndrome, surgery may be needed to control the flow of chemicals into the heart. This is known as a sympathectomy.\n\n【28】If medicines are causing long QT syndrome, your medicines will be reviewed and an alternative may be prescribed.\n\n【29】Living with long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【30】With the right treatment, it's possible to avoid long QT syndrome having a major impact on your day-to-day life. However, you may need to make some lifestyle adjustments to reduce your risk of having blackouts.\n\n【31】For example, you may not be able to exercise strenuously or play competitive sports, and may need to try to avoid startling noises, such as alarm clocks. Avoiding stressful situations may also be recommended.\n\n【32】Rehydrating properly after a tummy upset is also essential, usually with supplements containing salt and sugar.\n\n【33】Your doctor may prescribe potassium supplements or suggest increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods in your diet. Good sources of potassium include:\n\n【34】*   bananas\n*   vegetables\n*   pulses\n*   nuts and seeds\n*   milk\n*   fish\n*   shellfish\n*   beef\n*   chicken\n*   turkey\n*   bread\n\n【35】Always tell medical staff that you have long QT syndrome.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Recovery\n\n【3】**After being treated for a benign (non-cancerous) brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.**\n\n【4】Follow-up appointments\n----------------------\n\n【5】Non-cancerous brain tumours can sometimes grow back after treatment, so you'll have regular follow-up appointments to check for signs of this.\n\n【6】Your appointments may include a discussion of any new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and, occasionally, a brain scan.\n\n【7】It's likely you'll have follow-up appointments at least every few months to start with, but they'll probably be needed less frequently if no problems develop.\n\n【8】Side effects of treatment\n-------------------------\n\n【9】Some people who have had a brain tumour can develop side effects of treatment months or years later, such as:\n\n【10】*   cataracts\n*   problems with thinking, memory, language or judgement\n*   epilepsy\n*   hearing loss\n*   infertility\n*   migraine attacks\n*   a tumour developing somewhere else\n*   numbness, pain, weakness or loss of vision resulting from nerve damage (but these complications are rare)\n*   a stroke (this is rare)\n\n【11】If you or someone you care for has any worrying symptoms that develop after brain tumour treatment, see your doctor.\n\n【12】If you think it's a stroke, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\n\n【13】Supportive treatment\n--------------------\n\n【14】Problems caused by a brain tumour do not always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated.\n\n【15】For example, some people have persistent weakness, epileptic fits (seizures), difficulty walking and speech problems.\n\n【16】Extra support may be needed to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have.\n\n【17】This may include therapies such as:\n\n【18】*   **physiotherapy** to help with any movement problems you have\n*   **occupational therapy** to identify any problems you're having with daily activities, and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help\n*   **speech and language therapy** to help you with communication or swallowing problems\n\n【19】Some people may also need to continue taking medicine for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.\n\n【20】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations about the standards of care people with brain tumours should receive.\n\n【21】See the NICE guidance about improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.\n\n【22】Driving and travelling\n----------------------\n\n【23】You may not be allowed to drive for a while after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.\n\n【24】How long you'll be unable to drive will depend on factors such as:\n\n【25】*   whether you have had epileptic fits (seizures)\n*   the type of brain tumour you have\n*   where it is in your brain\n*   what symptoms you have\n*   what type of surgery you have had\n\n【26】If you're unsure whether or not you should be driving, do not drive until you have had clarification from the DVLA, your GP or specialist. \n\n【27】Driving against medical advice is both dangerous and against the law.\n\n【28】If you need to give up your driving licence, the DVLA will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again.\n\n【29】With up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive after an agreed period.\n\n【30】This is usually after you have successfully completed medical tests to determine your ability to control a vehicle, and when the risk of having seizures is low.\n\n【31】The Cancer Research UK website has more information about brain tumours and driving.\n\n【32】Flying is usually possible when you have recovered from surgery, but you should let your travel insurance company know about your condition.\n\n【33】Lifestyle advice\n----------------\n\n【34】If you have had radiotherapy, it's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.\n\n【35】This means stopping smoking if you smoke, eating a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n\n【36】However, there are limits to the exercise you should do.\n\n【37】### Sports and activities\n\n【38】After being treated for a brain tumour, you might be advised to permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing.\n\n【39】You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\n\n【40】Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for about a year after treatment because there's a risk you could have a seizure while in the water.\n\n【41】Sex and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【42】It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.\n\n【43】Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. \n\n【44】If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\n\n【45】Going back to work\n------------------\n\n【46】Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.\n\n【47】Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.\n\n【48】If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.\n\n【49】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【50】A brain tumour is often life changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained.\n\n【51】Your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker or counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\n\n【52】There are also a number of organisations that can provide help and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\n\n【53】Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  \nNext review due: 21 April 2023\n\n【54】*   Previous : Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】Contents\n【2】1.

(this is rare)\n\n【11】If you or someone you care for has any worrying symptoms that develop after brain tumour treatment, see your doctor.\n\n【12】If you think it's a stroke, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\n\n【13】Supportive treatment\n--------------------\n\n【14】Problems caused by a brain tumour do not always resolve as soon as the tumour is removed or treated.\n\n【15】For example, some people have persistent weakness, epileptic fits (seizures), difficulty walking and speech problems.\n\n【16】Extra support may be needed to help you overcome or adapt to any problems you have.\n\n【17】This may include therapies such as:\n\n【18】*   **physiotherapy** to help with any movement problems you have\n*   **occupational therapy** to identify any problems you're having with daily activities, and arrange for any equipment or alterations to your home that may help\n*   **speech and language therapy** to help you with communication or swallowing problems\n\n【19】Some people may also need to continue taking medicine for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.\n\n【20】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations about the standards of care people with brain tumours should receive.\n\n<mark>【21】See the NICE guidance about improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.</mark>\n\n【22】Driving and travelling\n----------------------\n\n【23】You may not be allowed to drive for a while after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.\n\n【24】How long you'll be unable to drive will depend on factors such as:\n\n【25】*   whether you have had epileptic fits (seizures)\n*   the type of brain tumour you have\n*   where it is in your brain\n*   what symptoms you have\n*   what type of surgery you have had\n\n【26】If you're unsure whether or not you should be driving, do not drive until you have had clarification from the DVLA, your GP or specialist. \n\n【27】Driving against medical advice is both dangerous and against the law.\n\n【28】If you need to give up your driving licence, the DVLA will speak to your GP or specialist to determine when you can drive again.\n\n【29】With up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive after an agreed period.\n\n【30】This is usually after you have successfully completed medical tests to determine your ability to control a vehicle, and when the risk of having seizures is low.\n\n【31】The Cancer Research UK website has more information about brain tumours and driving.\n\n【32】Flying is usually possible when you have recovered from surgery, but you should let your travel insurance company know about your condition.\n\n【33】Lifestyle advice\n----------------\n\n【34】If you have had radiotherapy, it's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.\n\n【35】This means stopping smoking if you smoke, eating a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n\n【36】However, there are limits to the exercise you should do.\n\n【37】### Sports and activities\n\n【38】After being treated for a brain tumour, you might be advised to permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing.\n\n【39】You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\n\n【40】Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for about a year after treatment because there's a risk you could have a seizure while in the water.\n\n【41】Sex and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【42】It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.\n\n【43】Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. \n\n【44】If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\n\n【45】Going back to work\n------------------\n\n【46】Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.\n\n【47】Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.\n\n【48】If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.\n\n【49】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【50】A brain tumour is often life changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained.\n\n【51】Your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker or counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\n\n【52】There are also a number of organisations that can provide help and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\n\n【53】Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  \nNext review due: 21 April 2023\n\n【54】*   Previous : Treatment", "index": 5886, "show": true, "start": 5860, "end": 5959, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 10:41:10", "endTime": "2024/09/02 10:42:43", "cost": 93.554}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:44", "update_time": "2024-09-01 18:42:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 18:41:09"}

Overview\n2.  When it's used\n3.  How it's performed\n4.  Recovery\n5.  Risks\n\n【3】**Recovery after lumbar decompression surgery will depend on your fitness and level of activity prior to surgery. This is why a course of physiotherapy before the operation may be recommended.**\n\n【4】You'll be encouraged to walk and move around the day after surgery and it's likely you'll be discharged 1 to 4 days afterwards.\n\n【5】It will take about 4 to 6 weeks for you to reach your expected level of mobility and function (this will depend on the severity of your condition and symptoms before the operation).\n\n【6】When you wake up after lumbar decompression surgery, your back may feel sore and you'll probably be attached to 1 or more tubes.\n\n【7】These may include a:\n\n【8】*   drip supplying fluids into a vein (intravenous drip), to make sure you don't get dehydrated\n*   drain to take away any fluid from your wound\n*   thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder (urinary catheter), in case you have difficulty urinating\n*   pump to deliver painkillers directly into your veins\n\n【9】The tubes are usually only attached for a short time after your operation.\n\n【10】Pain\n----\n\n【11】Immediately after surgery, you'll have some pain in and around the area where the operation was carried out. You'll be given pain relief to ensure you're comfortable and to help you move. The original leg pain you had before surgery usually improves immediately, but you should tell the nurses and your doctor if it doesn't.\n\n【12】A very small number of people have difficulty urinating after the operation. This is usually temporary, but in rare cases complications, such as nerve damage, may cause the legs or bladder to stop working properly. It's important to tell your doctor and nurses immediately if you have problems.\n\n【13】It can take up to 6 weeks for the general pain and tiredness after your operation to disappear completely.\n\n【14】Stitches\n--------\n\n【15】You'll have stitches or staples to close any cuts or incisions made during your operation. Deep stitches beneath the skin will dissolve and don't need to be removed. If dissolvable stiches are used, they don't need to be removed.\n\n【16】Non-dissolvable stitches or staples will be removed 5 to 10 days after your operation. Before you leave hospital, you'll be given an appointment to have them removed.\n\n【17】Your stitches may be covered by a simple adhesive dressing, like a large plaster. Be careful not to get your dressing wet when you wash. After having your stitches removed, you won't need a dressing and will be able to bath and shower as normal.\n\n【18】Rehabilitation\n--------------\n\n【19】Your medical team will want you to get up and moving about as soon as possible, usually from the day after the operation. This is because inactivity can increase your risk of developing a blood clot in the leg (DVT), and movement can speed up the recovery process.\n\n【20】After your operation, a physiotherapist will help you safely regain strength and movement. They'll teach you some simple exercises you can do at home to help your recovery.\n\n【21】Read more about physiotherapy.\n\n【22】Getting home\n------------\n\n【23】You'll usually be able to go home about 1 to 4 days after your operation. How long you need to stay in hospital will depend on the specific type of surgery you had and your general health.\n\n【24】When you get home, it's important to take things easy at first, gradually increasing your level of activity every day. Some help at home is usually needed for at least the first week after surgery.\n\n【25】Being active will speed up your recovery. Make sure you do the exercises recommended by your physiotherapist, and try not to sit or stand in the same position for more than 15-20 minutes at a time, because this can make you feel stiff and sore.\n\n【26】Walking is a good way to keep active, but you should avoid heavy lifting, awkward twisting and leaning when you do everyday tasks until you're feeling better.\n\n【27】You may be asked to return to hospital for one or more follow-up appointments in the weeks after your operation to check how you're doing.\n\n【28】Work\n----\n\n【29】When you can go back to work will depend on how quickly you heal after surgery and the type of job you do. Most people return to work after 4 to 8 weeks, if their job isn't too strenuous.\n\n【30】If your job involves a lot of driving, lifting heavy items or other strenuous activities, you may need to be off work for up to 3 to 6 months.\n\n【31】Driving\n-------\n\n【32】Before starting to drive again, you should be free from the effects of any painkillers that may make you drowsy.\n\n【33】You should be comfortable in the driving position and be able to do an emergency stop without experiencing any pain (you can practise this without starting your car).\n\n【34】Most people feel ready to drive after 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the size of the operation.\n\n【35】Some insurance companies don't insure drivers for a number of weeks after surgery, so check what your policy says before you start to drive.\n\n【36】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【37】Call the hospital where you had your operation, or your GP, for advice if:\n\n【38】*   there's leaking fluid or redness at the site of your wound\n*   your stitches come out\n*   your dressing becomes soaked with blood\n*   you have a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n*   you have increasing pain, numbness or weakness in your legs, back or buttocks\n*   you can't move your legs\n*   you can't pee or control your bladder\n*   you have a severe headache\n*   you experience a sudden shortness of breath (this could be a sign of pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or other heart and lung problems)\n\n【39】Page last reviewed: 28 April 2022  \nNext review due: 28 April 2025\n\n【40】*   Previous : How it's performed\n*   Next : Risks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【21】Read more about physiotherapy.", "content": "【0】Recovery \\- Lumbar decompression surgery\n========================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

Go to a sexual health clinic to be checked.\n\n【24】Sexual health clinics are sometimes called genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics, or sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services.\n\n【25】Treatment can help remove the warts and stop the infection being passed on.\n\n【26】Information:\n\n【27】### Why you should go to a sexual health clinic\n\n【28】A GP will probably refer you to a sexual health clinic if they think you might have genital warts.\n\n【29】Sexual health clinics specialise in treating problems with the genitals and urine system.\n\n【30】Many sexual health clinics offer a walk-in service where you do not need an appointment.\n\n【31】Sexual health clinics often get test results quicker than GP surgeries. You also do not have to pay a prescription charge for medicines prescribed by a sexual health clinic.\n\n【32】Find a sexual health clinic\n\n【33】What happens at a sexual health clinic\n--------------------------------------\n\n【34】A doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic will usually be able to diagnose genital warts by looking at them.\n\n【35】They may:\n\n【36】*   ask you about your symptoms and sexual partners\n*   look at the lumps around your genitals and anus, sometimes using a magnifying lens\n*   possibly need to look inside your vagina, anus or urethra (tube where pee comes out), depending on where the warts are\n\n【37】It may not be possible to find out who you got genital warts from, or how long you've had the infection.\n\n【38】Treatments for genital warts\n----------------------------\n\n【39】Treatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months.\n\n【40】If treatment is recommended, it will need to be prescribed by a doctor.\n\n【41】The type of treatment you'll be offered depends on what the warts look like and where they are. The doctor or nurse will discuss this with you.\n\n【42】Treatments for genital warts include:\n\n【43】*   cream, liquid or ointment – you can usually apply these yourself, but if the area is large, a doctor or nurse will need to apply it (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or a burning sensation)\n*   freezing (cryotherapy) – this treatment may need to be repeated several times and can be painful\n*   surgery – the warts are cut out after numbing the affected area with local anaesthetic, or they may be removed using heat or a laser (these treatments can cause pain, irritation or scarring)\n\n【44】It may take weeks or months for genital wart treatment to work and the warts may come back. Sometimes the treatment does not work.\n\n【45】Tell the doctor or nurse if you're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant, as some treatments will not be suitable for you.\n\n【46】Some creams can weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms if it comes into contact with them.

The virus can be passed on even when there are no visible warts.\n\n【58】Many people with the virus do not have symptoms but can still pass it on.\n\n【59】If you have genital warts, your current sexual partners should consider getting checked because they may have warts and not know it.\n\n【60】After you get the infection, it can take weeks to many months before symptoms appear.\n\n【61】You can get genital warts from:\n\n【62】*   skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal and anal sex\n*   sharing sex toys\n*   oral sex, but this is rare\n\n【63】The virus can also be passed to a baby from its mother during birth, but this is rare.\n\n【64】Genital warts can be spread if you touch an infected area and then touch another part of your body.\n\n【65】You cannot get genital warts from kissing or from sharing things like towels, cutlery, cups or toilet seats.\n\n【66】Stopping genital warts being passed on\n--------------------------------------\n\n【67】You can stop genital warts being passed on by:\n\n【68】*   using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex – but if the virus is in any skin that's not protected by a condom, it can still be passed on\n*   not having sex while you're having treatment for genital warts\n*   not sharing sex toys – if you do share them, wash them or cover them with a new condom before anyone else uses them\n\n【69】### HPV vaccine\n\n【70】The HPV vaccine offered to 12 to 13 year-old girls and boys in England protects against genital warts and some cancers (such as cervical cancer and anal cancer).\n\n【71】The HPV vaccine is also offered to men (up to and including 45 years old) who have sex with men, some trans men and trans women, sex workers and people living with HIV.\n\n【72】Find out more about the HPV vaccine\n\n【73】Genital warts and pregnancy\n---------------------------\n\n【74】Genital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy.\n\n【75】But you'll usually be referred to a sexual health specialist if you have genital warts and you’re pregnant.\n\n【76】During pregnancy, genital warts may:\n\n【77】*   multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they're very big)\n*   become more easily irritated\n*   be passed on to the baby during birth, but this is rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby’s throat or genitals)\n\n【78】Most creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy.\n\n【79】Genital warts often disappear on their own within 6 weeks after the baby is born, so treatment is often delayed until after the birth.\n\n【80】Page last reviewed: 10 July 2023  \nNext review due: 10 July 2026", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "See pictures of genital warts\n\n【13】Credit:\n\n【14】DR P.

If you need complete dentures, they may also improve the appearance of your smile and give you confidence.\n\n【7】It's also possible that dentures might not give you the result you hope for. Discuss plans openly with your dentist before you agree to go ahead.\n\n【8】How dentures are fitted\n-----------------------\n\n【9】### Complete dentures\n\n【10】A full denture will be fitted if all your upper or lower teeth need to be removed or you're having an old complete denture replaced.\n\n【11】The denture will usually be fitted as soon as your teeth are removed, which means you won't be without teeth. The denture will fit snugly over your gums and jawbone.\n\n【12】But if you have dentures fitted immediately after the removal of several teeth, the gums and bone will alter in shape fairly quickly and the dentures will probably need relining or remaking after a few months.\n\n【13】Occasionally, your gums may need to be left to heal and alter in shape for several months before dentures can be fitted.\n\n【14】You can either see a dentist or a qualified clinical dental technician to have your dentures made and fitted.\n\n【15】The difference between them is that a:\n\n【16】*   dentist will take measurements and impressions (moulds) of your mouth, and then order your full or partial dentures from a dental technician\n*   clinical dental technician will provide a full set of dentures directly without you having to see your dentist (although you should still have regular dental check-ups with your dentist)\n\n【17】A trial denture will be created from the impressions taken of your mouth.\n\n【18】The dentist or clinical dental technician will try this in your mouth to assess the fit and for you to assess the appearance.\n\n【19】The shape and colour may be adjusted before the final denture is produced.\n\n【20】### Partial dentures\n\n【21】A partial denture is designed to fill in the gaps left by one or more missing teeth. It's a plastic, nylon or metal plate with a number of false teeth attached to it.\n\n【22】It usually clips onto some of your natural teeth via metal clasps, which hold it securely in place in your mouth. It can easily be unclipped and removed.\n\n【23】Occasionally, the clips can be made of a tooth- or gum-coloured material, although this type of clip isn't always suitable because it tends to be more brittle than metal.\n\n【24】Your dentist can measure your mouth and order a partial denture for you, or you can see a qualified clinical dental technician, who can provide a partial denture for you directly after you have first seen your dentist for a treatment plan and certificate of oral health.\n\n【25】The Oral Health Foundation website has more information and advice about bridges and partial dentures, including which type of denture (metal or plastic) is best for you.\n\n【26】A fixed bridge is an alternative to a partial denture and may be suitable for some people.\n\n【27】Crowns are put on the teeth either side of the gap and joined together by a false tooth that's put in the gap.\n\n【28】Looking after your dentures\n---------------------------\n\n【29】Dentures may feel a bit strange to begin with, but you'll soon get used to wearing them.\n\n【30】At first, you may need to wear your dentures all the time, including while sleeping.\n\n【31】Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you on whether you should remove your dentures before you go to sleep.\n\n【32】It isn't always necessary to remove your dentures at night, but doing so can allow your gums to rest as you sleep. \n\n【33】If you remove your dentures, they should be kept moist – for example, in water or a polythene bag with some dampened cotton wool in it, or in a suitable overnight denture-cleaning solution.\n\n【34】This will stop the denture material drying out and changing shape.\n\n【35】### Dental hygiene\n\n【36】Keeping your mouth clean is just as important when you wear dentures.\n\n【37】You should brush your remaining teeth, gums and tongue every morning and evening with fluoride toothpaste to prevent tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems.\n\n【38】Read more about how to keep your teeth clean.\n\n【39】### Cleaning dentures\n\n【40】It's important to regularly remove plaque and food deposits from your dentures.\n\n【41】This is because unclean dentures can also lead to problems, such as bad breath, gum disease, tooth decay and oral thrush.\n\n【42】Clean your dentures as often as you would normal teeth (at least twice a day: every morning and night).\n\n【43】You should:\n\n【44】*   brush your dentures with toothpaste or soap and water before soaking them to remove food particles\n*   soak them in a fizzy solution of denture-cleaning tablets to remove stains and bacteria (follow the manufacturer's instructions)\n*   brush them again as you would your normal teeth (but don't scrub them too hard)\n\n【45】Dentures may break if you drop them, so you should clean them over a bowl or sink filled with water, or something soft like a folded towel.\n\n【46】Find more information on denture cleaning, on the Oral Health Foundation website.\n\n【47】### Eating with dentures\n\n【48】When you first start wearing dentures, you should eat soft foods cut into small pieces and chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth.\n\n【49】Avoid chewing gum and any food that's sticky, hard or has sharp edges.\n\n【50】You can gradually start to eat other types of food until you're back to your old diet. Never use toothpicks.\n\n【51】### Denture adhesive\n\n【52】If your dentures fit properly, you shouldn't necessarily need to use denture fixative (adhesive).\n\n【53】But if your jawbone has shrunk significantly, adhesive may be the only way to help retain your dentures. \n\n【54】Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you if this is the case.\n\n【55】At first, some people feel more confident with their dentures if they use adhesive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid using excessive amounts.\n\n【56】Adhesive can be removed from the denture by brushing with soap and water. \n\n【57】Remnants of adhesive left in the mouth may need to be removed with some damp kitchen roll or a clean damp flannel.\n\n【58】When to see your dentist\n------------------------\n\n【59】You should continue to see your dentist regularly if you have dentures (even if you have complete dentures) so they can check for any problems.\n\n【60】Your dentures should last several years if you take good care of them.\n\n【61】But your gums and jawbone will eventually shrink, which means the dentures may not fit as well as they used to and can become loose, or they may become worn.\n\n【62】See your dentist as soon as possible if:\n\n【63】*   your dentures click when you're talking\n*   your dentures tend to slip, or you feel they no longer fit properly\n*   your dentures feel uncomfortable\n*   your dentures are visibly worn\n*   you have signs of gum disease or tooth decay, such as bleeding gums or bad breath\n\n【64】If poorly fitting or worn dentures aren't replaced, they can cause great discomfort and lead to mouth sores, infections or problems eating and speaking.\n\n【65】How much dentures cost on the NHS\n---------------------------------\n\n【66】Having dentures fitted is a band 3 treatment.\n\n【67】Read about understanding NHS dental charges for the different bands and how to get help with dental costs.\n\n【68】Page last reviewed: 08 September 2021  \nNext review due: 08 September 2024", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【38】Read more about how to keep your teeth clean.", "content": "【0】Dentures (false teeth)\n======================\n\n【1】**Dentures are removable false teeth made of acrylic (plastic), nylon or metal.

It can easily be unclipped and removed.\n\n【23】Occasionally, the clips can be made of a tooth- or gum-coloured material, although this type of clip isn't always suitable because it tends to be more brittle than metal.\n\n【24】Your dentist can measure your mouth and order a partial denture for you, or you can see a qualified clinical dental technician, who can provide a partial denture for you directly after you have first seen your dentist for a treatment plan and certificate of oral health.\n\n【25】The Oral Health Foundation website has more information and advice about bridges and partial dentures, including which type of denture (metal or plastic) is best for you.\n\n【26】A fixed bridge is an alternative to a partial denture and may be suitable for some people.\n\n【27】Crowns are put on the teeth either side of the gap and joined together by a false tooth that's put in the gap.\n\n【28】Looking after your dentures\n---------------------------\n\n【29】Dentures may feel a bit strange to begin with, but you'll soon get used to wearing them.\n\n【30】At first, you may need to wear your dentures all the time, including while sleeping.\n\n【31】Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you on whether you should remove your dentures before you go to sleep.\n\n【32】It isn't always necessary to remove your dentures at night, but doing so can allow your gums to rest as you sleep. \n\n【33】If you remove your dentures, they should be kept moist – for example, in water or a polythene bag with some dampened cotton wool in it, or in a suitable overnight denture-cleaning solution.\n\n【34】This will stop the denture material drying out and changing shape.\n\n【35】### Dental hygiene\n\n【36】Keeping your mouth clean is just as important when you wear dentures.\n\n【37】You should brush your remaining teeth, gums and tongue every morning and evening with fluoride toothpaste to prevent tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems.\n\n<mark>【38】Read more about how to keep your teeth clean.</mark>\n\n【39】### Cleaning dentures\n\n【40】It's important to regularly remove plaque and food deposits from your dentures.\n\n【41】This is because unclean dentures can also lead to problems, such as bad breath, gum disease, tooth decay and oral thrush.\n\n【42】Clean your dentures as often as you would normal teeth (at least twice a day: every morning and night).\n\n【43】You should:\n\n【44】*   brush your dentures with toothpaste or soap and water before soaking them to remove food particles\n*   soak them in a fizzy solution of denture-cleaning tablets to remove stains and bacteria (follow the manufacturer's instructions)\n*   brush them again as you would your normal teeth (but don't scrub them too hard)\n\n【45】Dentures may break if you drop them, so you should clean them over a bowl or sink filled with water, or something soft like a folded towel.\n\n【46】Find more information on denture cleaning, on the Oral Health Foundation website.\n\n【47】### Eating with dentures\n\n【48】When you first start wearing dentures, you should eat soft foods cut into small pieces and chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth.\n\n【49】Avoid chewing gum and any food that's sticky, hard or has sharp edges.\n\n【50】You can gradually start to eat other types of food until you're back to your old diet. Never use toothpicks.\n\n【51】### Denture adhesive\n\n【52】If your dentures fit properly, you shouldn't necessarily need to use denture fixative (adhesive).\n\n【53】But if your jawbone has shrunk significantly, adhesive may be the only way to help retain your dentures. \n\n【54】Your dentist or clinical dental technician will advise you if this is the case.\n\n【55】At first, some people feel more confident with their dentures if they use adhesive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid using excessive amounts.\n\n【56】Adhesive can be removed from the denture by brushing with soap and water. \n\n【57】Remnants of adhesive left in the mouth may need to be removed with some damp kitchen roll or a clean damp flannel.\n\n【58】When to see your dentist\n------------------------\n\n【59】You should continue to see your dentist regularly if you have dentures (even if you have complete dentures) so they can check for any problems.\n\n【60】Your dentures should last several years if you take good care of them.\n\n【61】But your gums and jawbone will eventually shrink, which means the dentures may not fit as well as they used to and can become loose, or they may become worn.\n\n【62】See your dentist as soon as possible if:\n\n【63】*   your dentures click when you're talking\n*   your dentures tend to slip, or you feel they no longer fit properly\n*   your dentures feel uncomfortable\n*   your dentures are visibly worn\n*   you have signs of gum disease or tooth decay, such as bleeding gums or bad breath\n\n【64】If poorly fitting or worn dentures aren't replaced, they can cause great discomfort and lead to mouth sores, infections or problems eating and speaking.\n\n【65】How much dentures cost on the NHS\n---------------------------------\n\n【66】Having dentures fitted is a band 3 treatment.\n\n【67】Read about understanding NHS dental charges for the different bands and how to get help with dental costs.\n\n【68】Page last reviewed: 08 September 2021  \nNext review due: 08 September 2024", "index": 5621, "show": true, "start": 5608, "end": 5693, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【65】How much dentures cost on the NHS\n【66】Having dentures fitted is a band 3 treatment.\n\n【67】Read about understanding NHS dental charges for the different bands and how to get help with dental costs.\n\n【68】Page last reviewed: 08 September 2021\n\nNext review due: 08 September 2024", "content": "【0】Dentures (false teeth)\n======================\n\n【1】**Dentures are removable false teeth made of acrylic (plastic), nylon or metal. They fit snugly over the gums to replace missing teeth and eliminate potential problems caused by gaps.**\n\n【2】Gaps left by missing teeth can cause problems with eating and speech, and teeth either side of the gap may grow into the space at an angle.\n\n【3】Sometimes all the teeth need to be removed and replaced.\n\n【4】You may therefore need either:\n\n【5】*   **complete dentures** (a full set) – which replace all your upper or lower teeth, or\n*   **partial dentures** – which replace just 1 tooth or a few missing teeth\n\n【6】Dentures may help prevent problems with eating and speech. If you need complete dentures, they may also improve the appearance of your smile and give you confidence.\n\n【7】It's also possible that dentures might not give you the result you hope for.

hospital accommodation can be difficult for some patients for a variety of personal and cultural reasons.\n\n【14】All providers of NHS-funded care are expected to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation, except where it's in the overall best interests of the patient or reflects their personal choice.\n\n【15】While there are some circumstances where mixing can be justified, these are mainly confined to patients who need highly specialised care, such as that given in critical care units.\n\n【16】Find out about being detained under the Mental Health Act to learn more about this.\n\n【17】Since April 2011, hospitals have had to provide a monthly report of the number of times they breach the Department of Health's same-sex accommodation guidance.\n\n【18】Mixed-sex accommodation data is published on the NHS England website, and you can use this information to help you choose a hospital.\n\n【19】Hospitals can face fines of up to £250 for breaching the same-sex accommodation guidance.\n\n【20】While this central reporting concentrates on sleeping accommodation, mixing in bathrooms and WCs is still unacceptable.\n\n【21】Will the hospital address possible mental health needs?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】If you're physically ill and have to go to hospital for treatment, the team looking after you should also consider your mental health needs.\n\n【23】Your hospital should have a liaison psychiatry service, also known as a psychological medicine service.\n\n【24】The service aims to bridge the gap between physical and mental healthcare.\n\n【25】In discussion with you, your healthcare team should refer you to the liaison psychiatry service where appropriate to ensure your mental health needs are met.\n\n【26】Consent to treatment\n--------------------\n\n【27】For some procedures, including operations, you'll be asked to sign a consent form.\n\n【28】It's up to you whether you give your consent for a treatment.\n\n【29】You should ask as much about the treatment as possible before giving your consent so you can give an informed decision.\n\n【30】Find out what questions to ask your doctor\n\n【31】You can change your mind after the consent form has been signed, at any time, including during the procedure.\n\n【32】Find out about consent to treatment\n\n【33】You may wish to plan ahead for a time when you cannot give consent.\n\n【34】You can pre-arrange a legally binding advance decision to refuse treatment (living will), previously known as an advance directive.\n\n【35】Healthcare professionals must follow the advance decision, provided it's valid and applicable.\n\n【36】You can also make broader statements about how you wish to be treated, such as receiving terminal care at home rather than in hospital.\n\n【37】These are not legally binding, but will be taken into consideration by health professionals.\n\n【38】### What if I'm not able to give consent?\n\n【39】If you clearly lack the capacity to make decisions when you're admitted to hospital, health professionals will make what's called a \"best interests decision\" about whether a specific treatment is in your best interests.\n\n【40】Doctors and nurses will weigh up the benefits and risks, including whether you're likely to regain the ability to give or withhold consent.\n\n【41】Find out more about how capacity to consent is assessed\n\n【42】### Consent under the Mental Health Act\n\n【43】If you're held under the Mental Health Act, you can be treated against your will.\n\n【44】This is because it's felt you do not have sufficient capacity to make an informed decision about your treatment at the time.\n\n【45】This is also the case if you refuse treatment but the team treating you believe you should have it.\n\n【46】The Care Quality Commission (CQC) provides detailed guidance about your rights in relation to consent to medication and electroconvulsive therapy if you're detained in hospital or placed on a community treatment order.\n\n【47】Read more about your rights around treatment when you are restricted under the Mental Health Act on the CQC website.\n\n【48】Find out more about the Mental Health Act\n\n【49】Download easy read factsheets that explain your rights\n\n【50】### Consent for children and young people\n\n【51】Before a doctor, nurse or therapist can examine or treat your child, they must have consent or agreement.\n\n【52】As a parent, you'll make your decisions based on what you feel is in your child's best interests.\n\n【53】But it's advisable to involve children as much as possible in these decisions.\n\n【54】This will give them a sense of control, and they're more likely to respond positively to their treatment.\n\n【55】People aged 16 or over are entitled to consent to their own treatment. This can only be overruled in exceptional circumstances.\n\n【56】Children under the age of 16 can consent to their own treatment if they're believed to have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment. This is known as being Gillick competent.\n\n【57】Find out more about consent from children and young people\n\n【58】Advice for parents with children\n--------------------------------\n\n【59】Children can find going to hospital a daunting experience.\n\n【60】This is partly to do with their treatment, but also because the hospital is a new and strange environment, full of new sights, smells, noises and people.\n\n【61】If possible, talk to your child before leaving for hospital and explain what they should expect.\n\n【62】### Stay with your child as much as you can\n\n【63】Children often adapt better to a hospital if their parents stay with them for as long as possible.\n\n【64】Reassure your child that you'll be staying by their side and let them know the hospital is a safe place to be.\n\n【65】But if you have to leave the hospital at any time, inform your child how long you'll be gone for and make sure you're back on time.\n\n【66】If you're able to stay with your child overnight, the hospital may arrange for an extra bed in your child's room or ward.\n\n【67】### Stick to a routine\n\n【68】Keeping a routine can help your child feel more at home.\n\n【69】It may help if, for example, you stick to your child's usual bedtime routine, or bring in their favourite toy or comforter.\n\n【70】### Take time for yourself\n\n【71】While it's important to reassure children about their stay in hospital, it's just as important to look after yourself.\n\n【72】You'll be better able to care for your child and give support if you're coping well yourself.\n\n【73】Remember, it's fine to take breaks. Go for a walk, or get a cup of tea or coffee.\n\n【74】Talk things through with your partner, friends or family.

Details of what you need to do will vary depending on the hospital.\n\n【3】They might ask you to wear a face covering over your nose and mouth, test to check if you have COVID-19 or self-isolate before you go into hospital.\n\n【4】Check the hospital's website for more information.\n\n【5】Find the contact details of a hospital\n\n【6】When you arrive at the hospital, you'll be welcomed by a member of

admissions\n\n【11】Find out more about having an operation\n\n【12】Will I be offered same-sex hospital accommodation?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Being in mixed-sex hospital accommodation can be difficult for some patients for a variety of personal and cultural reasons.\n\n【14】All providers of NHS-funded care are expected to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation, except where it's in the overall best interests of the patient or reflects their personal choice.\n\n【15】While there are some circumstances where mixing can be justified, these are mainly confined to patients who need highly specialised care, such as that given in critical care units.\n\n【16】Find out about being detained under the Mental Health Act to learn more about this.\n\n【17】Since April 2011, hospitals have had to provide a monthly report of the number of times they breach the Department of Health's same-sex accommodation guidance.\n\n【18】Mixed-sex accommodation data is published on the NHS England website, and you can use this information to help you choose a hospital.\n\n【19】Hospitals can face fines of up to £250 for breaching the same-sex accommodation guidance.\n\n【20】While this central reporting concentrates on sleeping accommodation, mixing in bathrooms and WCs is still unacceptable.\n\n【21】Will the hospital address possible mental health needs?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】If you're physically ill and have to go to hospital for treatment, the team looking after you should also consider your mental health needs.\n\n【23】Your hospital should have a liaison psychiatry service, also known as a psychological medicine service.\n\n【24】The service aims to bridge the gap between physical and mental healthcare.\n\n【25】In discussion with you, your healthcare team should refer you to the liaison psychiatry service where appropriate to ensure your mental health needs are met.\n\n【26】Consent to treatment\n--------------------\n\n【27】For some procedures, including operations, you'll be asked to sign a consent form.\n\n【28】It's up to you whether you give your consent for a treatment.\n\n【29】You should ask as much about the treatment as possible before giving your consent so you can give an informed decision.\n\n【30】Find out what questions to ask your doctor\n\n【31】You can change your mind after the consent form has been signed, at any time, including during the procedure.\n\n【32】Find out about consent to treatment\n\n【33】You may wish to plan ahead for a time when you cannot give consent.\n\n【34】You can pre-arrange a legally binding advance decision to refuse treatment (living will), previously known as an advance directive.\n\n【35】Healthcare professionals must follow the advance decision, provided it's valid and applicable.\n\n【36】You can also make broader statements about how you wish to be treated, such as receiving terminal care at home rather than in hospital.\n\n【37】These are not legally binding, but will be taken into consideration by health professionals.\n\n【38】### What if I'm not able to give consent?\n\n【39】If you clearly lack the capacity to make decisions when you're admitted to hospital, health professionals will make what's called a \"best interests decision\" about whether a specific treatment is in your best interests.\n\n【40】Doctors and nurses will weigh up the benefits and risks, including whether you're likely to regain the ability to give or withhold consent.\n\n【41】Find out more about how capacity to consent is assessed\n\n【42】### Consent under the Mental Health Act\n\n【43】If you're held under the Mental Health Act, you can be treated against your will.\n\n【44】This is because it's felt you do not have sufficient capacity to make an informed decision about your treatment at the time.\n\n【45】This is also the case if you refuse treatment but the team treating you believe you should have it.\n\n【46】The Care Quality Commission (CQC) provides detailed guidance about your rights in relation to consent to medication and electroconvulsive therapy if you're detained in hospital or placed on a community treatment order.\n\n【47】Read more about your rights around treatment when you are restricted under the Mental Health Act on the CQC website.\n\n【48】Find out more about the Mental Health Act\n\n【49】Download easy read factsheets that explain your rights\n\n【50】### Consent for children and young people\n\n【51】Before a doctor, nurse or therapist can examine or treat your child, they must have consent or agreement.\n\n【52】As a parent, you'll make your decisions based on what you feel is in your child's best interests.\n\n【53】But it's advisable to involve children as much as possible in these decisions.\n\n【54】This will give them a sense of control, and they're more likely to respond positively to their treatment.\n\n【55】People aged 16 or over are entitled to consent to their own treatment. This can only be overruled in exceptional circumstances.\n\n【56】Children under the age of 16 can consent to their own treatment if they're believed to have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what's involved in their treatment. This is known as being Gillick competent.\n\n【57】Find out more about consent from children and young people\n\n【58】Advice for parents with children\n--------------------------------\n\n【59】Children can find going to hospital a daunting experience.\n\n【60】This is partly to do with their treatment, but also because the hospital is a new and strange environment, full of new sights, smells, noises and people.\n\n【61】If possible, talk to your child before leaving for hospital and explain what they should expect.\n\n【62】### Stay with your child as much as you can\n\n【63】Children often adapt better to a hospital if their parents stay with them for as long as possible.\n\n【64】Reassure your child that you'll be staying by their side and let them know the hospital is a safe place to be.\n\n【65】But if you have to leave the hospital at any time, inform your child how long you'll be gone for and make sure you're back on time.\n\n【66】If you're able to stay with your child overnight, the hospital may arrange for an extra bed in your child's room or ward.\n\n【67】### Stick to a routine\n\n【68】Keeping a routine can help your child feel more at home.\n\n【69】It may help if, for example, you stick to your child's usual bedtime routine, or bring in their favourite toy or comforter.\n\n【70】### Take time for yourself\n\n【71】While it's important to reassure children about their stay in hospital, it's just as important to look after yourself.\n\n【72】You'll be better able to care for your child and give support if you're coping well yourself.\n\n【73】Remember, it's fine to take breaks. Go for a walk, or get a cup of tea or coffee.\n\n【74】Talk things through with your partner, friends or family. They'll be able to give support, and talking can be a great stress reliever.\n\n【75】Find out more about special care for ill or premature babies\n\n【76】Staying mobile\n--------------\n\n【77】Staying mobile in hospital can help you recover more quickly.\n\n【78】Being immobile can lead to additional health problems, such as infections and pressure sores.

Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain.\n\n【9】Waiting for an ambulance\n------------------------\n\n【10】If you have had a heart attack, it's important that you rest while you wait for an ambulance, to avoid unnecessary strain on your heart.\n\n【11】If aspirin is available and you are not allergic to it, slowly chew and then swallow an adult-size tablet (300mg) while you wait for the ambulance.\n\n【12】Aspirin helps to thin your blood and improve blood flow to your heart.\n\n【13】Cardiac arrest \n---------------\n\n【14】In some cases, a complication called ventricular arrhythmia can cause the heart to stop beating.

Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person's chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers.\n2.  Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5 to 6cm on their chest.\n3.  Repeat this until an ambulance arrives.\n\n【22】Aim to do 100 to 120 compressions a minute.

This is called idiopathic PAH. In very rare cases, PAH can be inherited. \n\n【12】### Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn\n\n【13】In rare cases, newborn babies can have high pressure inside their blood vessels, which means their heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood around their body. This is known as persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).\n\n【14】Treatment in an intensive care unit may be needed if simple measures such as keeping the baby warm and giving oxygen do not increase oxygen levels to normal.\n\n【15】The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children website has more information about persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.\n\n【16】Pulmonary hypertension linked to left heart disease\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】If there are problems with the left side of the heart, the right side has to work harder to pump blood through the lungs. This increases blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.\n\n【18】Problems with the left side of the heart are thought to be one of the most common causes of pulmonary hypertension. These include mitral valve problems, left ventricle problems and aortic valve conditions.\n\n【19】Pulmonary hypertension linked with lung disease or lack of oxygen\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Pulmonary hypertension is also sometimes linked with lung diseases or lack of oxygen (hypoxia), including:\n\n【21】*   **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** – a number of lung conditions that affect breathing\n*   **interstitial lung disease** – a group of lung disorders that cause scarring of the lung tissue, which makes it difficult to get enough oxygen into your body\n*   **conditions that affect breathing while you're in a deep sleep** – such as sleep apnoea\n\n【22】Low levels of oxygen in the blood make the pulmonary arteries narrow. This squeezes the blood into a smaller space, which increases blood pressure, causing pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【23】Pulmonary hypertension caused by blood clots\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Pulmonary hypertension can sometimes be caused by scars from previous blood clots that narrow or block the pulmonary arteries. This is called chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【25】A blood clot that blocks one of the blood vessels that supply your lungs is called a pulmonary embolism.\n\n【26】Pulmonary hypertension caused by other conditions\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Other, less common, causes of pulmonary hypertension include: \n\n【28】*   conditions that cause inflammation, including sarcoidosis and vasculitis\n*   metabolic conditions such as thyroid disease and glycogen storage disease\n*   blood disorders such as sickle cell disease and thalassaemia\n*   chronic kidney disease\n*   compression of the blood vessels in the lungs – for example, as the result of a tumour\n\n【29】Read about how pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed.\n\n【30】Page last reviewed: 02 May 2023  \nNext review due: 02 May 2026\n\n【31】*   Previous : Pulmonary hypertension\n*   Next : Diagnosis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Page last reviewed: 02 May 2023\n\nNext review due: 02 May 2026\n\n【31】*   Previous : Pulmonary hypertension\n\nNext : Diagnosis\n\n", "content": "【0】Causes \\- Pulmonary hypertension\n================================\n\n【1】Contents\n--------\n\n【2】1.

Thalassaemia carriers\n\n【3】**If you're a carrier of thalassaemia, it means you carry one of the faulty genes that cause thalassaemia, but you do not have thalassaemia yourself.**\n\n【4】Being a carrier of the trait is sometimes known as having the thalassaemia trait or having thalassaemia minor.\n\n【5】If you carry thalassaemia, you will not ever develop thalassaemia, but you may sometimes experience mild anaemia.

A genetic counsellor will discuss the result and implications with you if you're found to have the trait.\n\n【22】Having children\n---------------\n\n【23】If you have the thalassaemia trait, you're at risk of having children with thalassaemia if your partner is also a carrier or has thalassaemia themselves.\n\n【24】If you're planning to have a child and you know you're a carrier, it's a good idea for your partner to be tested as well.\n\n【25】If you and your partner both have the trait for the main type of thalassaemia (beta thalassaemia), there's a:\n\n【26】*   1 in 4 chance each child you have will not have thalassaemia or carry the thalassaemia trait\n*   1 in 2 chance each child you have will be a carrier of thalassaemia, but will not have the condition themselves\n*   1 in 4 chance each child you have will be born with thalassaemia\n\n【27】If both of you are carriers and you're planning to have a baby, talk to your GP about getting a referral to a genetic counsellor, who can explain the risks to your children and what your options are.\n\n【28】These include:\n\n【29】*   having tests during pregnancy to see if your baby has thalassaemia\n*   adopting a child\n*   trying in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with a donor egg or sperm\n*   trying preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M, which used to be called PGD), although this is not widely available in the UK\n\n【30】PGT-M is similar to IVF, but the resulting embryos are tested to check they do not have thalassaemia before they're implanted in the womb. \n\n【31】The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has more information about PGT-M\n\n【32】Possible health problems\n------------------------\n\n【33】You will not develop thalassaemia at any point if you're a carrier of it.\n\n【34】You can live a normal life and generally will not have any health problems as a result of being a carrier.\n\n【35】But you may develop mild anaemia, which is where there are low levels of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) in the blood.\n\n【36】This can cause symptoms such as tiredness and pale skin, but may only be picked up with a blood test.\n\n【37】This type of anaemia is different from iron deficiency anaemia and does not need any treatment.\n\n【38】If you have anaemia, it's important not to take iron supplements for it unless you're diagnosed with iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【39】Taking iron supplements when you already have enough iron in your body could be harmful.\n\n【40】Carriers of other blood disorders\n---------------------------------\n\n【41】People who are carriers of thalassaemia are also at risk of having a child with a blood condition if their partner is a carrier of a different type of blood condition.\n\n【42】You can find more detailed information about some of the other types of carrier in the following leaflets:\n\n【43】*   GOV.UK: haemoglobin O Arab carrier\n*   GOV.UK: haemoglobin C carrier\n*   GOV.UK: haemoglobin D carrier\n*   GOV.UK: haemoglobin E carrier\n*   GOV.UK: haemoglobin Lepore carrier\n*   GOV.UK: sickle cell carrier\n\n【44】Page last reviewed: 17 October 2022  \nNext review due: 17 October 2025\n\n【45】*   Previous : Living with", "index": 4951, "show": true, "start": 4912, "end": 5326, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/02 11:07:46", "endTime": "2024/09/02 11:09:48", "cost": 122.238}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-29 01:06:43", "update_time": "2024-09-01 19:09:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-01 19:07:45"}

There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【4】Diarrhoea\n\n【5】Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【6】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【7】High temperature\n\n【8】Paracetamol will help to bring the temperature down. Drink plenty of fluids. See your doctor if it lasts for more than a few days.\n\n【9】Headaches\n\n【10】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Recovery\n7.  Complications\n8.  Prevention\n\n【3】**A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot.**\n\n【4】A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack.\n\n【5】A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.\n\n【6】Symptoms of a heart attack\n--------------------------\n\n【7】Symptoms of a heart attack can include:\n\n【8】*   chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest\n*   pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy\n*   feeling lightheaded or dizzy\n*   sweating\n*   shortness of breath\n*   feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)\n*   an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)\n*   coughing or wheezing\n\n【9】The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.\n\n【10】While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain.\n\n【11】Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications\n\n【3】**Successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.**\n\n【4】Stopping drinking alcohol\n-------------------------\n\n【5】Treatment for ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital depending on what stage the condition is at.\n\n【6】If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for a period of time (this could be months or years).\n\n【7】After this point, it's usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the NHS guidelines on alcohol units. However, it's important to check with your doctor first.\n\n【8】If you have a more serious form of ARLD (alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis) lifelong abstinence is recommended. \n\n【9】This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease.\n\n【10】Stopping drinking is not easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem.\n\n【11】Nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and do not stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.\n\n【12】### Withdrawal symptoms\n\n【13】If you're abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【14】These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes 3 to 7 days from the time of your last drink.\n\n【15】Many people initially experience disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month.\n\n【16】In some cases, you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems.\n\n【17】You may also be offered a medicine called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process.\n\n【18】Some people need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases so their progress can be closely monitored.\n\n【19】If you're staying at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or another health professional. You might see them at home, your GP surgery or a specialist NHS service.\n\n【20】### Preventing relapses\n\n【21】Once you have stopped drinking, you may need further treatment to help ensure you do not start drinking again.\n\n【22】The first treatment usually offered is psychological therapy.

Sadly, most babies with Edwards' syndrome will die before or shortly after being born.\n\n【3】A small number (about 13 in 100) babies born alive with Edwards' syndrome will live past their 1st birthday.\n\n【4】Cause of Edwards' syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【5】Each cell in your body usually contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents.\n\n【6】A baby with Edwards' syndrome has 3 copies of chromosome number 18 instead of 2. This affects the way the baby grows and develops. Having 3 copies of chromosome 18 usually happens by chance, because of a change in the sperm or egg before a baby is conceived.\n\n【7】Your chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome increases as you get older, but anyone can have a baby with Edwards' syndrome. The condition does not usually run in families and is not caused by anything the parents have or have not done.\n\n【8】Speak to a GP if you want to find out more. They may be able to refer you to a genetic counsellor.\n\n【9】**Types of Edwards' syndrome**\n------------------------------\n\n【10】The symptoms, and how seriously your baby is affected, usually depend on whether they have full, mosaic, or partial Edwards' syndrome.\n\n【11】### Full Edwards' syndrome\n\n【12】Most babies with Edwards' syndrome have an extra chromosome 18 present in all cells. This is called full Edwards' syndrome.\n\n【13】The effects of full Edward's syndrome are often more severe. Sadly, most babies with this form will die before they are born.\n\n【14】### Mosaic Edwards' syndrome\n\n【15】A small number of babies with Edwards' syndrome (about 1 in 20) have an extra chromosome 18 in just some cells. This is called mosaic Edwards' syndrome (or sometimes mosaic trisomy 18).\n\n【16】This can lead to milder effects of the condition, depending on the number and type of cells that have the extra chromosome. Most babies with this type of Edward's syndrome who are born alive will live for at least a year, and they may live to adulthood**.**\n\n【17】### Partial Edwards' syndrome\n\n【18】A very small number of babies with Edwards' syndrome (about 1 in 100) have only a section of the extra chromosome 18 in their cells, rather than a whole extra chromosome 18. This is called partial Edwards' syndrome (or sometimes partial trisomy 18).\n\n【19】How partial Edwards' syndrome affects a baby depends on which part of chromosome 18 is present in their cells.\n\n【20】Advice for new parents\n----------------------\n\n【21】There's support available for whatever you or your baby needs.\n\n【22】All babies born with Edwards' syndrome will have some level of learning disability.\n\n【23】Edwards' syndrome is associated with certain physical features and health problems. Every baby is unique and will have different health problems and needs. They will usually have a low birthweight and may also have a wide range of physical symptoms. They may also have heart, respiratory, kidney or gastrointestinal conditions.\n\n【24】Despite their complex needs, children with Edwards' syndrome can slowly start to do more things.\n\n【25】Like any child they'll:\n\n【26】*   have their own personality\n*   learn at their own pace\n*   have things that are important and unique to them\n\n【27】Try not to think too far ahead and enjoy time with your baby.\n\n【28】Screening for Edwards' syndrome\n-------------------------------\n\n【29】If you're pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. This looks at the chance of your baby having the condition.\n\n【30】This screening test is called the combined test and it works out the chance of a baby having Edwards' syndrome, Down's syndrome and Patau's syndrome.\n\n【31】During the test you'll have a blood test and an ultrasound scan to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck (nuchal translucency).\n\n【32】Read more about screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome at 10 to 14 weeks\n\n【33】If it's not possible to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck, or you're more than 14 weeks pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome as part of your 20-week scan. This is sometimes known as the mid-pregnancy scan. It's an ultrasound scan that looks at how your baby is growing.\n\n【34】Screening cannot identify which form of Edwards' syndrome your baby may have, or how it will affect them.\n\n【35】Read more about the 20-week scan\n\n【36】Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【37】If the combined test shows that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome, you'll be offered a test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.\n\n【38】This diagnostic test involves analysing a sample of your baby's cells to check if they have an extra copy of chromosome 18.\n\n【39】There are 2 different ways of getting this sample of cells:\n\n【40】*   chorionic villus sampling, which collects a sample from the placenta\n*   amniocentesis, which collects a sample of the amniotic fluid from around your baby\n\n【41】These are invasive tests that increase your chance of having a miscarriage. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n【42】### Results from the diagnostic test\n\n【43】A specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.\n\n【44】This is a very difficult situation and it's normal to feel a whole range of emotions. It may help to talk to your doctor, family and friends, or partner about what you're thinking and how you're feeling.\n\n【45】If you're told your baby has Edwards' syndrome, either before birth or afterwards, you'll be offered support and information.\n\n【46】You can visit the SOFT UK website for support and more information on Edwards' syndrome, and to contact other families affected by the condition.\n\n【47】You can also contact Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which has information about screening tests and how you might feel if you're told your baby does have, or might have, a problem.\n\n【48】ARC has a helpline that can be reached on 0845 077 2290, or 0207 713 7486 from a mobile, Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm. The helpline is answered by trained staff, who can offer information and support.\n\n【49】Read more about what happens if antenatal screening tests find something\n\n【50】Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome after birth\n----------------------------------------\n\n【51】If doctors believe your baby has Edwards' syndrome after they're born, a blood sample will be taken to see if there are extra copies of chromosome 18.\n\n【52】Treating Edwards' syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【53】There's no cure for Edwards' syndrome.\n\n【54】Treatment will focus on the symptoms of the condition, such as heart conditions, breathing difficulties and infections. Your baby may also need to be fed through a feeding tube, as they can often have difficulty feeding.\n\n【55】Edwards' syndrome has an impact on your baby's movements as they get older, and they may benefit from supportive treatment such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.\n\n【56】Depending on your baby's specific symptoms, they may need specialist care in hospital or a hospice, or you may be able to look after them at home with the right support.\n\n【57】Advice for carers\n-----------------\n\n【58】Supporting someone with Edwards' syndrome can be both rewarding and challenging.\n\n【59】If you need help, or just want someone to talk to, there's lots of support available.\n\n【60】Your guide to social care and support provides lots of advice on how you can take time to look after yourself, including:\n\n【61】*   getting a break from caring\n*   getting legal support and advocacy\n*   taking care of your wellbeing\n\n【62】### Speak to parents and families\n\n【63】It can help to speak to other parents and families who know how you're feeling.\n\n【64】You can do this by:\n\n【65】*   getting in touch with people on forums and social media\n*   going to a support group – ask your midwife or health visitor about available support groups\n\n【66】Information about your baby\n---------------------------\n\n【67】If your baby is found to have Edwards' syndrome before or after their birth, their clinical team will pass the information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【68】This helps scientists look for better ways to treat the symptoms of the condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n\n【69】Find out more about the register at GOV.UK\n\n【70】Having a child with Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】3 families share their experience of having a child with Edwards' syndrome, also called trisomy 18.

This looks at the chance of your baby having the condition.\n\n【30】This screening test is called the combined test and it works out the chance of a baby having Edwards' syndrome, Down's syndrome and Patau's syndrome.\n\n【31】During the test you'll have a blood test and an ultrasound scan to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck (nuchal translucency).\n\n【32】Read more about screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome at 10 to 14 weeks\n\n【33】If it's not possible to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck, or you're more than 14 weeks pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome as part of your 20-week scan. This is sometimes known as the mid-pregnancy scan. It's an ultrasound scan that looks at how your baby is growing.\n\n【34】Screening cannot identify which form of Edwards' syndrome your baby may have, or how it will affect them.\n\n【35】Read more about the 20-week scan\n\n【36】Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【37】If the combined test shows that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome, you'll be offered a test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.\n\n【38】This diagnostic test involves analysing a sample of your baby's cells to check if they have an extra copy of chromosome 18.\n\n【39】There are 2 different ways of getting this sample of cells:\n\n【40】*   chorionic villus sampling, which collects a sample from the placenta\n*   amniocentesis, which collects a sample of the amniotic fluid from around your baby\n\n【41】These are invasive tests that increase your chance of having a miscarriage. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n【42】### Results from the diagnostic test\n\n【43】A specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.\n\n【44】This is a very difficult situation and it's normal to feel a whole range of emotions. It may help to talk to your doctor, family and friends, or partner about what you're thinking and how you're feeling.\n\n【45】If you're told your baby has Edwards' syndrome, either before birth or afterwards, you'll be offered support and information.\n\n【46】You can visit the SOFT UK website for support and more information on Edwards' syndrome, and to contact other families affected by the condition.\n\n【47】You can also contact Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which has information about screening tests and how you might feel if you're told your baby does have, or might have, a problem.\n\n【48】ARC has a helpline that can be reached on 0845 077 2290, or 0207 713 7486 from a mobile, Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm.

This looks at the chance of your baby having the condition.\n\n【30】This screening test is called the combined test and it works out the chance of a baby having Edwards' syndrome, Down's syndrome and Patau's syndrome.\n\n【31】During the test you'll have a blood test and an ultrasound scan to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck (nuchal translucency).\n\n【32】Read more about screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome at 10 to 14 weeks\n\n【33】If it's not possible to measure the fluid at the back of your baby's neck, or you're more than 14 weeks pregnant, you'll be offered screening for Edwards' syndrome as part of your 20-week scan. This is sometimes known as the mid-pregnancy scan. It's an ultrasound scan that looks at how your baby is growing.\n\n【34】Screening cannot identify which form of Edwards' syndrome your baby may have, or how it will affect them.\n\n<mark>【35】Read more about the 20-week scan</mark>\n\n【36】Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome during pregnancy\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【37】If the combined test shows that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome, you'll be offered a test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.\n\n【38】This diagnostic test involves analysing a sample of your baby's cells to check if they have an extra copy of chromosome 18.\n\n【39】There are 2 different ways of getting this sample of cells:\n\n【40】*   chorionic villus sampling, which collects a sample from the placenta\n*   amniocentesis, which collects a sample of the amniotic fluid from around your baby\n\n【41】These are invasive tests that increase your chance of having a miscarriage. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n【42】### Results from the diagnostic test\n\n【43】A specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.\n\n【44】This is a very difficult situation and it's normal to feel a whole range of emotions. It may help to talk to your doctor, family and friends, or partner about what you're thinking and how you're feeling.\n\n【45】If you're told your baby has Edwards' syndrome, either before birth or afterwards, you'll be offered support and information.\n\n【46】You can visit the SOFT UK website for support and more information on Edwards' syndrome, and to contact other families affected by the condition.\n\n【47】You can also contact Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which has information about screening tests and how you might feel if you're told your baby does have, or might have, a problem.\n\n<mark>【48】ARC has a helpline that can be reached on 0845 077 2290, or 0207 713 7486 from a mobile, Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm. The helpline is answered by trained staff, who can offer information and support.\n\n【49】Read more about what happens if antenatal screening tests find something</mark>\n\n【50】Diagnosing Edwards' syndrome after birth\n----------------------------------------\n\n【51】If doctors believe your baby has Edwards' syndrome after they're born, a blood sample will be taken to see if there are extra copies of chromosome 18.\n\n【52】Treating Edwards' syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【53】There's no cure for Edwards' syndrome.\n\n【54】Treatment will focus on the symptoms of the condition, such as heart conditions, breathing difficulties and infections. Your baby may also need to be fed through a feeding tube, as they can often have difficulty feeding.\n\n【55】Edwards' syndrome has an impact on your baby's movements as they get older, and they may benefit from supportive treatment such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.\n\n【56】Depending on your baby's specific symptoms, they may need specialist care in hospital or a hospice, or you may be able to look after them at home with the right support.\n\n【57】Advice for carers\n-----------------\n\n【58】Supporting someone with Edwards' syndrome can be both rewarding and challenging.\n\n【59】If you need help, or just want someone to talk to, there's lots of support available.\n\n【60】Your guide to social care and support provides lots of advice on how you can take time to look after yourself, including:\n\n【61】*   getting a break from caring\n*   getting legal support and advocacy\n*   taking care of your wellbeing\n\n【62】### Speak to parents and families\n\n【63】It can help to speak to other parents and families who know how you're feeling.\n\n【64】You can do this by:\n\n【65】*   getting in touch with people on forums and social media\n*   going to a support group – ask your midwife or health visitor about available support groups\n\n【66】Information about your baby\n---------------------------\n\n【67】If your baby is found to have Edwards' syndrome before or after their birth, their clinical team will pass the information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【68】This helps scientists look for better ways to treat the symptoms of the condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n\n【69】Find out more about the register at GOV.UK\n\n【70】Having a child with Edwards' syndrome (trisomy 18)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】3 families share their experience of having a child with Edwards' syndrome, also called trisomy 18.
