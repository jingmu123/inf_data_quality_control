Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications\n7.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**Treatment for rhesus disease depends on how severe the condition is. In more severe cases, treatment may need to begin before the baby is born.**\n\n【3】Around half of all cases of rhesus disease are mild and don't usually require much treatment. However, your baby will need to be monitored regularly, in case serious problems develop.\n\n【4】In more severe cases, a treatment called phototherapy is usually needed and blood transfusions may help to speed up the removal of bilirubin (a substance created when red blood cells break down) from the body.\n\n【5】In the most serious cases, a blood transfusion may be carried out while your baby is still in the womb and a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin may be used when they're born if phototherapy isn't effective.\n\n【6】If necessary, the baby may be delivered early using medication to start inducing labour (induction) or a caesarean section, so treatment can start as soon as possible. This is usually only done after about 34 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【7】Phototherapy\n------------\n\n【8】Phototherapy is treatment with light. It involves placing the newborn baby under a halogen or fluorescent lamp with their eyes covered.\n\n【9】Alternatively, they may be placed on a blanket containing optical fibres through which light travels and shines onto the baby's back (fibre optic phototherapy).\n\n【10】The light absorbed by the skin during phototherapy lowers the bilirubin levels in the baby's blood through a process called photo-oxidation. This means that oxygen is added to the bilirubin, which helps it to dissolve in water. This makes it easier for the baby's liver to break down the bilirubin and remove it from the blood.\n\n【11】During phototherapy, fluids will usually be given into a vein (intravenous hydration) because more water is lost through your baby's skin and more urine is produced as the bilirubin is expelled.\n\n【12】Using phototherapy can sometimes reduce the need for a blood transfusion.\n\n【13】Blood transfusions\n------------------\n\n【14】In some cases, the levels of bilirubin in the blood may be high enough to require one or more blood transfusions.\n\n【15】During a blood transfusion, some of your baby's blood is removed and replaced with blood from a suitable matching donor (someone with the same blood group). A blood transfusion normally takes place through a tube inserted into a vein (intravenous cannula). \n\n【16】This process helps to remove some of the bilirubin in the baby's blood and also removes the antibodies that cause rhesus disease.\n\n【17】It's also possible for the baby to have a transfusion of just red blood cells to top up those they already have.\n\n【18】Blood transfusion to an unborn baby\n-----------------------------------\n\n【19】If your baby develops rhesus disease while still in the womb, they may need to be given a blood transfusion before birth. This is known as intrauterine foetal blood transfusion.\n\n【20】An intrauterine foetal blood transfusion requires specialist training and is not available in all hospitals. You may therefore be referred to a different hospital for the procedure.\n\n【21】A needle is usually inserted through the mother's abdomen (tummy) and into the umbilical cord, so donated blood can be injected into the baby. An ultrasound scan is used to help guide the needle to the right place.\n\n【22】Local anaesthetic is used to numb the area, but you'll be awake during the procedure. A sedative may be given to keep you relaxed and your baby may also be sedated to help stop them moving during the procedure.\n\n【23】You may need more than one intrauterine foetal blood transfusion. Transfusions can be repeated every 2 to 4 weeks until your baby is mature enough to be delivered. They may even reduce the need for phototherapy after birth, but further blood transfusions could still be necessary.\n\n【24】There's a small risk of miscarriage during an intrauterine foetal blood transfusion, so it's usually only used in particularly severe cases.\n\n【25】Intravenous immunoglobulin\n--------------------------\n\n【26】In some cases, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used alongside phototherapy if the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood continues to rise at an hourly rate.\n\n【27】The immunoglobulin is a solution of antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system to fight against disease-carrying organisms) taken from healthy donors. Intravenous means that it's injected into a vein.\n\n【28】Intravenous immunoglobulin helps to prevent red blood cells being destroyed, so the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood will stop rising. It also reduces the need for a blood transfusion.\n\n【29】However, it does carry some small risks. It's possible that your baby may have an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the immunoglobulin, although it's difficult to calculate how likely this is or how severe the reaction will be.\n\n【30】Concerns over possible side effects, and the limited supply of intravenous immunoglobulin, mean that it's only used when the bilirubin level is rising rapidly, despite phototherapy sessions.\n\n【31】Intravenous immunoglobulin has also been used during pregnancy, in particularly severe cases of rhesus disease, as it can delay the need for treatment with intrauterine foetal blood transfusions.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 November 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:11", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:21", "cost": 9.832}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:56", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:10"}

The risk of complications increases the later in pregnancy an abortion is carried out.\n\n【4】Possible complications\n----------------------\n\n【5】The risks are different depending on whether you have a medical abortion or surgical abortion, and how many weeks pregnant you are.\n\n【6】### Medical abortion\n\n【7】Before 14 weeks of pregnancy the main risks of medical abortion are:\n\n【8】*   needing another procedure to remove parts of the pregnancy that have stayed in the womb: this happens to about 70 out of 1,000 women\n*   serious complications such as heavy bleeding, damage to the womb, or sepsis: this happens to about 1 out of 1,000 women\n\n【9】From 14 weeks of pregnancy, the main risks of medical abortion are:\n\n【10】*   needing another procedure to remove parts of the pregnancy that have stayed in the womb: about 13 out of 100 women\n*   infection or injury to the womb: this happens to a small number of women\n\n【11】### Surgical abortion\n\n【12】Before 14 weeks of pregnancy, the main risks of surgical abortion are:\n\n【13】*   needing another procedure to remove parts of the pregnancy that have stayed in the womb: this happens to about 35 out of 1,000 women\n*   serious complications such as heavy bleeding, damage to the womb, or sepsis: this happens to about 1 out of 1,000 women\n\n【14】After 14 weeks of pregnancy, the main risks of surgical abortion are:\n\n【15】*   needing another procedure to remove parts of the pregnancy that have stayed in the womb: about 3 out of 100 women\n*   very heavy bleeding: between about 1 and 10 out of 100 women\n*   infection: this happens to a small number of women\n*   injury to the womb or entrance to the womb (cervix): this happens to a small number of women\n\n【16】The clinic will provide you with the number of a 24-hour helpline to call if you have any problems after an abortion.\n\n【17】Effect on fertility, health and future pregnancies\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Having an abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer or mental health issues.\n\n【19】Having an abortion will not affect your chances of becoming pregnant and having normal pregnancies in the future.\n\n【20】Many women are able to get pregnant immediately afterwards, so you should start using contraception right away if you do not want to get pregnant.\n\n【21】You should be offered the chance to talk about contraception at the time you have the abortion. If you choose a method of contraception, you should be able to get it from the hospital or clinic that provides your abortion.\n\n【22】There's a very small risk to your fertility and future pregnancies if you develop a womb infection that is not treated quickly. The infection could spread to your fallopian tubes and ovaries – known as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\n【23】PID can increase the risk of infertility or ectopic pregnancy, where an egg implants itself outside of the womb.\n\n【24】But most infections are treated before they reach this stage.\n\n【25】Talk to your doctor or an abortion advice service for more information if you're concerned about the possible risks of an abortion.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:08", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:54", "cost": 46.264}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:56", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:08"}

It works by stimulating alpha receptors in the brain. This sends signals that help to relax blood vessels in the heart, which reduces your blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n【3】It also affects small blood vessels in other parts of the body such as the brain or skin. This helps prevent migraines and treats menopausal hot flushes or sweats.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】Clonidine will start to work within 30 to 60 minutes of you taking a dose. However, it may take 2 to 4 weeks until the medicine is fully effective and you start to feel better.\n\n【6】If you're taking clonidine for high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. In these cases, you may not feel any different when you take clonidine. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【7】You'll need to keep taking clonidine regularly for it to keep working, even if you feel well. Your doctor will probably ask you to have regular check-ups to make sure clonidine is working.\n\n【8】If you do not feel that clonidine is working after a few weeks, speak to your doctor. Do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor. Stopping it suddenly can cause dangerously high blood pressure and withdrawal side effects.\n\n【9】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【10】Whatever you're taking clonidine for, stopping it suddenly can cause a dangerous increase in your blood pressure. It can also cause withdrawal side effects such as restlessness, heart palpitations, agitation, nervousness, tremor or shaking hands, headaches or feeling sick (nausea).\n\n【11】Do not stop taking clonidine without talking to a doctor. If you need to stop taking it, the dose should be reduced gradually. Your doctor can advise you how to do this safely.\n\n【12】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for high blood pressure?\n\n【13】There are several types of medicine that may be used to treat high blood pressure. They work in different ways, and certain medicines may work better for different people. You'll often need to take more than one medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.\n\n【14】Your doctor will advise which medicines are best for you depending on your age, ethnicity and any other medical conditions you have.\n\n【15】Clonidine is not used very often for high blood pressure. Other medicines are usually preferred. Because of its side effects, doctors usually only suggest trying clonidine if other blood pressure-lowering medicines have not worked or are not suitable for you.\n\n【16】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for hot flushes during the menopause?\n\n【17】Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective and widely used treatment for menopausal hot flushes or sweats.\n\n【18】Non-hormonal treatments such as clonidine are only recommended if you do not want to take HRT, or if HRT is not suitable or causes side effects.\n\n【19】Other non-hormonal alternatives are SSRI antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline or paroxetine), venlafaxine, gabapentin or pregabalin. Some research suggest these medicines are probably more effective than clonidine. However you may find clonidine works for you.\n\n【20】There are other treatments including things you can do that may help to control your menopausal symptoms. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about finding the right treatment for you.\n\n【21】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for preventing migraine or similar types of headache?\n\n【22】There are a few different medicines that may help to prevent migraines or similar types of headaches (sometimes known as vascular headaches). Your doctor will advise which might be best for you depending on your age, sex, other health conditions and other medicines you're taking.\n\n【23】The most effective treatments seem to be topiramate or propranolol. Other alternatives are amitriptyline (or other tricyclic antidepressants), sodium valproate or pizotifen.\n\n【24】Although clonidine has been used for many years, it does not seem to be as effective as other medicines for preventing migraines. For that reason it's usually only used if other medicines have not worked or are not suitable.\n\n【25】What other uses are therefore clonidine?\n\n【26】Clonidine has a number of other possible uses. Specialist doctors may sometimes suggest trying clonidine as a treatment for:\n\n【27】*   Tourette's syndrome or tics\n*   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other behavioural problems in children\n*   sleep problems in young children\n*   muscle problems such as weakness and stiffness (spasticity) or unusual muscle contractions, spasms or movements (dystonia)\n\n【28】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how to give clonidine to children, see Medicines for Children: Clonidine for Tourette's syndrome, ADHD and sleep-onset disorder.</u>\n\n【29】In hospital may occasionally be used:\n\n【30】*   to treat withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies whose mothers were taking opioid replacement medicines such as methadone during pregnancy\n*   as a sedative (a medicine to help you stay calm and a bit sleepy) before or during procedures\n*   to help diagnose growth hormone deficiency in children\n*   by injection, possibly into the spine, to treat various types of pain\n\n【31】Does clonidine help with hot flushes caused by treatments for breast cancer?\n\n【32】There is not much information, but there are studies that suggest clonidine may help with hot flushes caused by certain breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen.\n\n【33】However, there are other medicines that may work better or have fewer side effects than clonidine.\n\n【34】Talk to your specialist cancer doctor or nurse about possible treatments if you're having hot flushes due to your breast cancer treatment.\n\n【35】Should I stop taking it before surgery?\n\n【36】No, it's important to keep taking clonidine before surgery.\n\n【37】Make sure you tell the doctors and nurses treating you that you're taking clonidine.\n\n【38】Take your clonidine tablets or liquid into hospital with you. You'll need to start taking clonidine again as soon as possible after the surgery.\n\n【39】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【40】It's not a common side effect, but clonidine may occasionally cause weight gain.\n\n【41】Eating a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise can help you manage your weight.\n\n【42】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【43】Clonidine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【44】But some types of hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined pill, the contraceptive patch and the contraceptive vaginal ring, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure or migraines.\n\n【45】Talk to your doctor if you're taking or using a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【46】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【47】Clonidine can make you feel sleepy and dizzy. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools until you feel better.\n\n【48】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected.

", "content": "【0】Common questions about clonidine \\- Brand name: Catapres\n========================================================\n\n【1】How does clonidine work?\n\n【2】Clonidine is a vasodilator medicine. It works by stimulating alpha receptors in the brain. This sends signals that help to relax blood vessels in the heart, which reduces your blood pressure and heart rate.\n\n【3】It also affects small blood vessels in other parts of the body such as the brain or skin. This helps prevent migraines and treats menopausal hot flushes or sweats.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】Clonidine will start to work within 30 to 60 minutes of you taking a dose. However, it may take 2 to 4 weeks until the medicine is fully effective and you start to feel better.\n\n【6】If you're taking clonidine for high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. In these cases, you may not feel any different when you take clonidine. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【7】You'll need to keep taking clonidine regularly for it to keep working, even if you feel well. Your doctor will probably ask you to have regular check-ups to make sure clonidine is working.\n\n【8】If you do not feel that clonidine is working after a few weeks, speak to your doctor. Do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor. Stopping it suddenly can cause dangerously high blood pressure and withdrawal side effects.\n\n【9】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【10】Whatever you're taking clonidine for, stopping it suddenly can cause a dangerous increase in your blood pressure. It can also cause withdrawal side effects such as restlessness, heart palpitations, agitation, nervousness, tremor or shaking hands, headaches or feeling sick (nausea).\n\n【11】Do not stop taking clonidine without talking to a doctor. If you need to stop taking it, the dose should be reduced gradually. Your doctor can advise you how to do this safely.\n\n【12】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for high blood pressure?\n\n【13】There are several types of medicine that may be used to treat high blood pressure. They work in different ways, and certain medicines may work better for different people. You'll often need to take more than one medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.\n\n【14】Your doctor will advise which medicines are best for you depending on your age, ethnicity and any other medical conditions you have.\n\n【15】Clonidine is not used very often for high blood pressure. Other medicines are usually preferred. Because of its side effects, doctors usually only suggest trying clonidine if other blood pressure-lowering medicines have not worked or are not suitable for you.\n\n【16】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for hot flushes during the menopause?\n\n【17】Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective and widely used treatment for menopausal hot flushes or sweats.\n\n【18】Non-hormonal treatments such as clonidine are only recommended if you do not want to take HRT, or if HRT is not suitable or causes side effects.\n\n【19】Other non-hormonal alternatives are SSRI antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline or paroxetine), venlafaxine, gabapentin or pregabalin. Some research suggest these medicines are probably more effective than clonidine. However you may find clonidine works for you.\n\n【20】There are other treatments including things you can do that may help to control your menopausal symptoms. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about finding the right treatment for you.\n\n【21】How does clonidine compare to other medicines for preventing migraine or similar types of headache?\n\n【22】There are a few different medicines that may help to prevent migraines or similar types of headaches (sometimes known as vascular headaches). Your doctor will advise which might be best for you depending on your age, sex, other health conditions and other medicines you're taking.\n\n【23】The most effective treatments seem to be topiramate or propranolol. Other alternatives are amitriptyline (or other tricyclic antidepressants), sodium valproate or pizotifen.\n\n【24】Although clonidine has been used for many years, it does not seem to be as effective as other medicines for preventing migraines. For that reason it's usually only used if other medicines have not worked or are not suitable.\n\n【25】What other uses are therefore clonidine?\n\n【26】Clonidine has a number of other possible uses. Specialist doctors may sometimes suggest trying clonidine as a treatment for:\n\n【27】*   Tourette's syndrome or tics\n*   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other behavioural problems in children\n*   sleep problems in young children\n*   muscle problems such as weakness and stiffness (spasticity) or unusual muscle contractions, spasms or movements (dystonia)\n\n【28】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how to give clonidine to children, see Medicines for Children: Clonidine for Tourette's syndrome, ADHD and sleep-onset disorder.</u>\n\n【29】In hospital may occasionally be used:\n\n【30】*   to treat withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies whose mothers were taking opioid replacement medicines such as methadone during pregnancy\n*   as a sedative (a medicine to help you stay calm and a bit sleepy) before or during procedures\n*   to help diagnose growth hormone deficiency in children\n*   by injection, possibly into the spine, to treat various types of pain\n\n【31】Does clonidine help with hot flushes caused by treatments for breast cancer?\n\n【32】There is not much information, but there are studies that suggest clonidine may help with hot flushes caused by certain breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen.\n\n【33】However, there are other medicines that may work better or have fewer side effects than clonidine.\n\n【34】Talk to your specialist cancer doctor or nurse about possible treatments if you're having hot flushes due to your breast cancer treatment.\n\n【35】Should I stop taking it before surgery?\n\n【36】No, it's important to keep taking clonidine before surgery.\n\n【37】Make sure you tell the doctors and nurses treating you that you're taking clonidine.\n\n【38】Take your clonidine tablets or liquid into hospital with you. You'll need to start taking clonidine again as soon as possible after the surgery.\n\n【39】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【40】It's not a common side effect, but clonidine may occasionally cause weight gain.\n\n【41】Eating a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise can help you manage your weight.\n\n【42】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【43】Clonidine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【44】But some types of hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined pill, the contraceptive patch and the contraceptive vaginal ring, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure or migraines.\n\n【45】Talk to your doctor if you're taking or using a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【46】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【47】Clonidine can make you feel sleepy and dizzy. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools until you feel better.\n\n【48】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive.

It's important to take it on the same day each week.\n*   You'll get a patient card to record the details of your weekly dose and the day you take it. Keep this with you and show it to any healthcare staff involved in your care. You'll also usually get a booklet to record how much you take and your blood test results.\n*   Taking methotrexate can mean you're more likely to get infections. Ask your doctor for urgent advice if you get an infection, such as COVID-19, or if you've been in contact with anyone who has chickenpox or shingles while taking methotrexate.\n*   It's important to have any vaccinations when you're invited. Tell the person giving the vaccine that you take methotrexate, to make sure the vaccine is suitable for you.\n*   It's best to avoid too much caffeine, and foods that can cause an infection such as unpasteurised milk and cheeses.

Treatment can ease some of the symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely.\n\n【8】How fibromyalgia is treated\n---------------------------\n\n【9】Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with.\n\n【10】Treatment tends to be a combination of:\n\n【11】*   lifestyle changes, such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques\n*   talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)\n*   medicine, such as antidepressants\n\n【12】In particular, exercise has a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain.\n\n【13】What causes fibromyalgia?\n-------------------------\n\n【14】The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body.\n\n【15】It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents.\n\n【16】In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by things that are physical or emotional like an injury, an infection or stress.\n\n【17】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【18】Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, but it's more common in women than men.\n\n【19】The condition typically develops between the ages of 25 and 55, but people of any age can get it, including children and older people.\n\n【20】It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition.\n\n【21】Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree.\n\n【22】One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose.\n\n【23】There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions.\n\n【24】Support groups\n--------------\n\n【25】If you have fibromyalgia, support groups can provide an important network for talking to others living with the condition.\n\n【26】Fibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia.\n\n【27】If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 3333.\n\n【28】Fibromyalgia Action UK also has a number of regional co-ordinators who can put you in touch with a support group near you.\n\n【29】Another organisation you may find useful is UK Fibromyalgia.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:06:00", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:08:20", "cost": 139.626}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:56", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:08:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:06:00"}

It may be tender when you touch the area. \n\n【14】This can be a sign of a damaged, ruptured or enlarged spleen.\n\n【15】### A damaged or ruptured spleen\n\n【16】The spleen can become damaged or may burst (rupture) after an injury, such as a blow to the abdomen, a car accident, a sporting accident or broken ribs. \n\n【17】Rupture can happen straight away or it may happen weeks after the injury.\n\n【18】Signs of a ruptured spleen are:\n\n【19】*   pain behind your left ribs and tenderness when you touch this area\n*   dizziness and a rapid heart rate (a sign of low blood pressure caused by blood loss)\n\n【20】A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, as it can cause life-threatening bleeding.\n\n【21】Go straight to A&E if you think you have ruptured or damaged your spleen.\n\n【22】### An enlarged spleen\n\n【23】The spleen can become swollen after an infection or injury. It can also become enlarged as a result of a health condition, such as cirrhosis, leukaemia or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【24】An enlarged spleen does not always cause symptoms.\n\n【25】Otherwise, look out for:\n\n【26】*   feeling full very quickly after eating (an enlarged spleen can press on the stomach)\n*   feeling discomfort or pain behind your left ribs\n*   anaemia and fatigue\n*   frequent infections\n*   easy bleeding\n\n【27】Doctors can often tell if you have an enlarged spleen by feeling your abdomen. A blood test, CT scan or MRI scan can confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【28】The spleen is not usually removed if it's just enlarged. Instead, you'll receive treatment for any underlying condition and your spleen will be monitored. You may be prescribed antibiotics if there's an infection.\n\n【29】You'll need to avoid contact sports for a while, as you'll be at greater risk of rupturing the spleen while it's enlarged.\n\n【30】Surgery to remove the spleen\n----------------------------\n\n【31】You may need an operation to remove your spleen, known as a splenectomy, if it's not working properly or it's damaged, diseased or enlarged.\n\n【32】Sometimes just part of your spleen can be removed, which is called a partial splenectomy.\n\n【33】If there's time, you'll be advised to have certain vaccinations before the operation. This is because spleen removal weakens your immune system and can make you more likely to get an infection.\n\n【34】### Laparoscopy\n\n【35】Most operations to remove spleens are carried out using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy).\n\n【36】Keyhole spleen removal allows a surgeon to get inside your tummy (abdomen) to your spleen without having to make large cuts.\n\n【37】This means you'll have less scarring and may recover from the operation more quickly. But you'll still need a general anaesthetic.\n\n【38】The procedure involves:\n\n【39】*   making several small cuts in your tummy\n*   guiding a laparoscope into your body through one of the cuts so doctors can see what they're doing\n*   passing thin instruments into your tummy through the other cuts to remove your spleen (gas will be pumped into your tummy to make this easier)\n\n【40】The cuts are then stitched up or sometimes glued together. \n\n【41】You may be able to go home the same day, or you may need to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【42】If you go home the same day, someone will need to stay with you for the first 24 hours.\n\n【43】### Open surgery\n\n【44】Open surgery is where one large cut is made. It may be needed if your spleen cannot be removed using keyhole surgery. Often, in emergencies, this is the preferred method.\n\n【45】You'll need a general anaesthetic and may need to stay in hospital for a few days to recover.\n\n【46】### Recovering from spleen surgery\n\n【47】It's normal to feel sore and be bruised after a splenectomy, but you'll be given pain relief.\n\n【48】You should be able to eat and drink as normal soon after the operation.\n\n【49】Like any operation, spleen removal carries a small risk of complications, including bleeding and infection.\n\n【50】Your doctor will talk through these risks with you.\n\n【51】You should be given breathing and leg exercises to do at home to reduce your risk of getting a blood clot or a chest infection. In some cases you may also be given blood thinning injections for around 1 to 2 weeks after your surgery.\n\n【52】Another risk is the surgical wound becoming infected. If you spot any signs of infection such as a high temperature or redness and swelling around the wound, contact your GP or hospital immediately. You may need antibiotics.\n\n【53】Recovery usually takes a few weeks. Your doctor or nurse will advise when you can go back to your usual activities, such as driving.\n\n【54】Living without a spleen\n-----------------------\n\n【55】If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs, such as the liver, can take over many of the spleen's functions. \n\n【56】This means you'll still be able to cope with most infections. But there's a small risk that a serious infection may develop quickly. This risk will be present for the rest of your life.\n\n【57】Young children have a higher risk of serious infection than adults, but the risk is still small.\n\n【58】The risk is also increased if you have a health condition like sickle cell anaemia or coeliac disease, or a health condition that affects your immune system, like HIV.\n\n【59】This risk can be minimised by following simple precautions to prevent infection.\n\n【60】### Vaccinations\n\n【61】Check with your GP surgery that you have had all your routine NHS vaccinations.\n\n【62】You should also be vaccinated against:\n\n【63】*   pneumococcal infections, such as pneumonia, with a booster every 5 years\n*   flu (get the flu vaccine every year)\n*   MenACWY\n*   MenB\n\n【64】### Antibiotics\n\n【65】It's recommended that you take low-dose antibiotics for at least 2 years, and in many cases, the rest of your life, to prevent bacterial infections.\n\n【66】Antibiotics are particularly important:\n\n【67】*   for children and young people under the age of 18\n*   for adults over the age of 50\n*   for the first 2 years after your spleen is removed\n*   if your immune system does not work properly\n\n【68】### Be alert for signs of infection\n\n【69】See a GP as soon as possible if you get signs of an infection.\n\n【70】Signs of infection include:\n\n【71】*   a high temperature\n*   a sore throat\n*   a cough\n*   a severe headache\n*   a headache with drowsiness or a rash\n*   abdominal pain\n*   redness and swelling around the surgical wound\n\n【72】Your GP can prescribe a course of antibiotics so you have them ready to use if you get an infection.\n\n【73】If your infection becomes serious, you may be admitted to hospital.\n\n【74】### Beware of animal and tick bites\n\n【75】Bites from animals and small blood-sucking parasites called ticks can cause infections.\n\n【76】If you get bitten by an animal, particularly a dog, start your course of antibiotics if you have them with you, and seek medical advice urgently.\n\n【77】If you go trekking or camping regularly, you may be at risk of Lyme disease, a disease transmitted by ticks.\n\n【78】Try to avoid tick bites by wearing clothes that cover your skin, particularly long trousers.\n\n【79】If you become ill, get medical advice straight away.\n\n【80】### Tell medical staff about your spleen problems\n\n【81】Healthcare professionals will mark your health records to show that you do not have a working spleen.\n\n【82】But always remember to tell any medical professionals that you see, including your dentist.\n\n【83】### Carry medical ID\n\n【84】It's a good idea to carry or wear some medical ID.\n\n【85】For example:\n\n【86】*   if your spleen is removed, the hospital may give you a splenectomy card to take home with you\n*   you may want to buy your own medical ID, such as a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag bracelet or pendant\n\n【87】If you need help or emergency treatment, your medical ID will alert staff to your condition.\n\n【88】### Travel advice\n\n【89】If you're travelling abroad:\n\n【90】*   you may be advised to take a course of antibiotics with you\n*   check if you need any travel vaccinations\n\n【91】People without a working spleen have an increased risk of developing a severe form of malaria.\n\n【92】If possible, avoid countries where malaria is present. If you cannot avoid them, speak to a GP or local pharmacist about antimalarial medicine before you travel.\n\n【93】You should also use mosquito nets and insect repellent.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:45:32", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:19", "cost": 46.874}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:56", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:45:32"}

But many people have no side effects, or only minor ones.\n\n【2】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【3】The most common side effect of sitagliptin, which happens in more than 1 in 100 people, is headaches.\n\n【4】Talk to your doctor if headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【5】If taking sitagliptin gives you a headache, make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol.\n\n【6】Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller.\n\n【7】Low blood sugar\n---------------\n\n【8】Sitagliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or \"hypos\") when taken on its own.\n\n【9】But hypos can happen when you take sitagliptin with other diabetes medicines, such as insulin or gliclazide.\n\n【10】Early warning signs of low blood sugar include:\n\n【11】*   feeling hungry\n*   trembling or shaking\n*   sweating\n*   confusion\n*   difficulty concentrating\n\n【12】It's also possible for your blood sugar to go too low while you're asleep. If this happens, it can make you feel sweaty, tired and confused when you wake up.\n\n【13】Low blood sugar may happen if you:\n\n【14】*   take too much of some types of diabetes medicines\n*   eat meals irregularly or skip meals\n*   are fasting\n*   do not eat a healthy diet and are not getting enough nutrients\n*   change what you eat\n*   increase your physical activity without eating more to compensate\n*   drink alcohol, especially after skipping a meal\n*   take some other medicines or herbal remedies at the same time\n*   have a hormone disorder, such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n*   have kidney or liver problems\n\n【15】It's important to have regular meals, including breakfast, to prevent hypoglycaemia. Never miss or delay a meal.\n\n【16】If you're planning to exercise more than usual, make sure you eat carbohydrates like bread, pasta or cereals before, during or after exercise.\n\n【17】Always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners will not help.\n\n【18】You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.\n\n【19】If taking in sugar does not help or the hypo symptoms come back, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital.\n\n【20】Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the symptoms of low blood sugar levels so they can recognise a hypo if it happens.\n\n【21】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【22】It happens rarely, but some people may have serious side effects after taking sitagliptin.\n\n【23】Call your doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【24】*   you get severe stomach pains – this may be a sign of pancreatitis\n*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, or your skin turns yellow although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – this can be a sign of liver problems\n\n【25】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【26】It's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to sitagliptin.\n\n【27】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【28】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【29】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【30】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【31】**Other side effects**\n----------------------\n\n【32】These are not all the side effects of sitagliptin.

Recovery may take much longer from severe acute pancreatitis, and there's a risk it could be fatal.\n\n【6】Read about complications of acute pancreatitis for more information on severe cases.\n\n【7】Fluids\n------\n\n【8】Having acute pancreatitis can cause you to become dehydrated, so fluids are given through a tube into your vein (intravenous or \"IV\" fluid) to prevent dehydration.\n\n【9】Oxygen\n------\n\n【10】To make sure your body gets enough oxygen, you may be given oxygen through tubes in your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days once your condition is improving.\n\n【11】If you have severe acute pancreatitis, ventilation equipment may also be used to help with your breathing.\n\n【12】Painkillers\n-----------\n\n【13】Acute pancreatitis often causes severe tummy pain, so you'll probably need painkillers. Some of these can make you feel very drowsy.\n\n【14】If you're visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don't be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.\n\n【15】Antibiotics\n-----------\n\n【16】You may need to take antibiotics if you have an infection as well as pancreatitis – for example, if you have a chest or urinary infection.\n\n【17】Nutritional support\n-------------------\n\n【18】If you have mild acute pancreatitis but aren't feeling or being sick and don't have tummy pain, you can usually eat normally.\n\n【19】But if your condition is more severe, you may be advised not to eat solid foods for a few days or longer. This is because trying to digest solid food could put too much strain on your pancreas.\n\n【20】If you need to avoid solid food, you may be given a special liquid food mixture, with the nutrients you need, through a tube in your tummy (enteral feeding).\n\n【21】Treating the underlying cause\n-----------------------------\n\n【22】Once the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need treating.\n\n【23】### Gallstones\n\n【24】If a gallstone is causing your pancreatitis, you may need a procedure called an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), or your gallbladder may need to be removed.\n\n【25】If you need an ERCP, you'll have a long, thin tube containing a camera (an endoscope) passed down through your mouth into your tummy. This is used to help remove the gallstones.\n\n【26】Gallbladder removal surgery may be done while you're in hospital or planned for several weeks' time.\n\n【27】Having your gallbladder removed shouldn't have a big effect on your health, but it might make it more difficult for you to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods.\n\n【28】Ideally, the gallbladder should be removed within 2 weeks of your attack of pancreatitis unless you are too unwell for surgery.\n\n【29】### Alcohol consumption\n\n【30】After recovering from acute pancreatitis, you should completely avoid alcohol if this was the cause of your condition.\n\n【31】Some people with acute pancreatitis have a dependency on alcohol and need help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, see a GP to get help.\n\n【32】Treatment for alcohol dependence includes:\n\n【33】*   one-to-one counselling\n*   self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous\n*   taking a medicine called acamprosate that can reduce cravings for alcohol\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating alcohol misuse.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 May 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:51:35", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:52:27", "cost": 52.116}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:52:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:51:34"}

Overview\n2.  Risks\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Alcohol misuse is when you drink in a way that's harmful, or when you're dependent on alcohol. To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level, both men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week.**\n\n【3】A unit of alcohol is 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about:\n\n【4】*   half a pint of lower to normal-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 3.6%)\n*   a single small shot measure (25ml) of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%)\n\n【5】A small glass (125ml, ABV 12%) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about alcohol units</u>\n\n【6】Low-risk drinking advice\n------------------------\n\n【7】To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low:\n\n【8】*   men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis\n*   if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over 3 or more days\n*   if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week\n*   if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to your baby to a minimum\n\n【9】Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most days and weeks.\n\n【10】The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis.\n\n【11】Risks of alcohol misuse\n-----------------------\n\n【12】### Short term\n\n【13】The short-term risks of alcohol misuse include:\n\n【14】*   accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a head injury\n*   violent behaviour and being a victim of violence\n*   unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n*   loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones\n*   alcohol poisoning – this may lead to vomiting, fits (seizures) and falling unconscious\n\n【15】People who binge drink (drink heavily over a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are at greater risk of being in an accident.\n\n【16】### Long term\n\n【17】Persistent alcohol misuse increases your risk of serious health conditions, including:\n\n【18】*   heart disease\n*   stroke\n*   liver disease\n*   liver cancer\n*   bowel cancer\n*   mouth cancer\n*   breast cancer\n*   pancreatitis\n*   damage to the brain, which can lead to problems with thinking and memory\n\n【19】As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems for some people, such as unemployment, divorce, domestic abuse and homelessness.\n\n【20】If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism).\n\n【21】Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this. \n\n【22】Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people.\n\n【23】A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including:\n\n【24】*   hand tremors – \"the shakes\"\n*   sweating\n*   seeing things that are not real (visual hallucinations)\n*   depression\n*   anxiety\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n\n【25】This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the risks of alcohol misuse</u>\n\n【26】Am I drinking too much alcohol?\n-------------------------------\n\n【27】You could be misusing alcohol if:\n\n【28】*   you feel you should cut down on your drinking\n*   other people have been criticising your drinking\n*   you feel guilty or bad about your drinking\n*   you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover\n\n【29】Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if:\n\n【30】*   they regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week\n*   they're sometimes unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking\n*   they fail to do what was expected of them as a result of their drinking (for example, missing an appointment or work because they're drunk or hungover)\n\n【31】Getting help\n------------\n\n【32】If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to see a GP.\n\n【33】They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available. \n\n【34】Your alcohol intake may be assessed using tests, such as the:\n\n【35】*   Alcohol use disorders identification test (PDF, 224kb) – a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits\n*   Alcohol use disorders identification test consumption (PDF, 382kb) – a simpler test to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels\n\n【36】As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem.\n\n【37】For example, you may want to contact:\n\n【38】*   Drinkline national alcohol helpline on 0300 123 1110\n*   Alcohol Change UK\n*   Alcoholics Anonymous helpline on 0800 9177 650\n*   Al-Anon Family Groups helpline on 0800 0086 811\n\n【39】Treating alcohol misuse\n-----------------------\n\n【40】How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking.\n\n【41】Treatment options include:\n\n【42】*   counselling – including self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n*   medicines\n*   detoxification – this involves a nurse or doctor supporting you to safely stop drinking; this can be done by helping you slowly cut down over time or by giving you medicines to prevent withdrawal symptoms\n\n【43】There are 2 main types of medicines to help people stop drinking.\n\n【44】The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium).\n\n【45】The second is a medicine to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medicines used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone.\n\n【46】These are both given at a fixed dose, and you'll usually be on them for 6 to 12 months.\n\n【47】Further reading\n---------------\n\n【48】*   Alcohol units\n*   Carers Trust: caring for an alcoholic\n*   Tips for cutting down on your drinking\n\n【49】Alcohol and pregnancy\n---------------------\n\n【50】The Department of Health and Social Care recommends pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol.\n\n【51】Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, and the risk increases the more you drink.\n\n【52】The Chief Medical Officers for the UK recommend that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all to keep the risk to your baby to a minimum.\n\n【53】If you're worried about alcohol use during pregnancy, talk to your doctor or midwife.\n\n【54】If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more.\n\n【55】Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.\n删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【56】If you've finished what you're doing, please can you answer 2 questions about your visit today?\n\n【57】Take our survey\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Risks</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:35:45", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:36:10", "cost": 25.557}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:36:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:35:44"}

It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned.**\n\n【3】Normally, the kidneys filter the blood, removing harmful waste products and excess fluid and turning these into urine to be passed out of the body.\n\n【4】Why do I need dialysis?\n-----------------------\n\n【5】If your kidneys are not working properly – for example, because you have advanced chronic kidney disease (kidney failure) – the kidneys may not be able to clean the blood properly.\n\n【6】Waste products and fluid can build up to dangerous levels in your body. Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal.\n\n【7】Dialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens.\n\n【8】How long will I need dialysis for?\n----------------------------------\n\n【9】It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover.\n\n【10】But often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant.\n\n【11】It's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available.\n\n【12】If a kidney transplant is not suitable for you – for example, because you're not well enough to have a major operation – dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life.\n\n【13】What happens during dialysis\n----------------------------\n\n【14】There are 2 main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n【15】### Haemodialysis\n\n【16】Haemodialysis is the most common type of dialysis and the one most people are aware of.\n\n【17】During the procedure, a tube is attached to a needle in your arm. \n\n【18】Blood passes along the tube and into an external machine that filters it, before it's passed back into the arm along another tube.\n\n【19】At dialysis centres, this is usually carried out 3 days a week, with each session lasting around 4 hours.\n\n【20】It can also be done at home. Some examples of a home dialysis schedule include:\n\n【21】*   4 times a week for 4 hours\n*   5 times a week for 3 hours\n*   6 days a week for 8 hours overnight\n\n【22】### Peritoneal dialysis\n\n【23】Peritoneal dialysis uses the inside lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter, rather than a machine.\n\n【24】Like the kidneys, the peritoneum contains thousands of tiny blood vessels, making it a useful filtering device.\n\n【25】Before treatment starts, a cut (incision) is made near your belly button and a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the incision and into the space inside your abdomen (the peritoneal cavity). This is left in place permanently.\n\n【26】Fluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. As blood passes through the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid.\n\n【27】The used fluid is drained into a bag a few hours later and replaced with fresh fluid.\n\n【28】Changing the fluid usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes and normally needs to be repeated around 4 times a day.\n\n【29】If you prefer, this can be done by a machine overnight while you sleep.  \n删除7：<u>Read more about how dialysis is performed</u>\n\n【30】Which type of dialysis is best?\n-------------------------------\n\n【31】In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have and where to have it.\n\n【32】The 2 techniques are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks.\n\n【33】For example:\n\n【34】*   **haemodialysis** means you'll have 4 treatment-free days a week, but the treatment sessions last longer and you may need to visit hospital each time\n*   **home haemodialysis** – you'll usually need to have dialysis sessions more often than you would in a clinic, but you can choose a treatment plan that meets your medical needs and fits around your life\n*   **peritoneal dialysis** can be done quite easily at home and can sometimes be done while you sleep, but it needs to be done every day\n\n【35】If you're able to choose the type of dialysis you prefer, your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the advantages and disadvantages of both types of dialysis</u>\n\n【36】Side effects of dialysis\n------------------------\n\n【37】Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps.

Your doctor will consider the area of skin where you need to use it, how often you'll use it and the condition of your skin. You should wash off any steroid cream applied to your breasts before feeding your baby.\n\n【19】Very potent topical corticosteroids are not usually prescribed for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for very young children. Sometimes you may be prescribed them under the supervision of a skincare specialist (dermatologist).\n\n【20】How to use topical corticosteroids\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine. This will give details of how much to apply and how often.\n\n【22】Most people only need to use the medicine once or twice a day for 3 to 7 days. Occasionally a doctor may suggest using it less frequently over a longer period of time.\n\n【23】The medicine should only be applied to affected areas of skin. Gently smooth a thin layer onto your skin in the direction the hair grows. Wash your hands before and after you've applied the medicine, unless you are treating an area on your hands.\n\n【24】If you're using both topical corticosteroids and emollients, wait 20 to 30 minutes between using them.\n\n【25】### Fingertip units\n\n【26】Sometimes, the amount of medicine you're advised to use will be given in fingertip units (FTUs).\n\n【27】A FTU (about 500mg) is the amount needed to squeeze a line from the tip of an adult finger to the first crease of the finger. It should be enough to treat an area of skin double the size of the flat of your hand with your fingers together.\n\n【28】The recommended dosage will depend on what part of the body is being treated. This is because the skin is thinner in certain parts of the body and more sensitive to the effects of corticosteroids.\n\n【29】For adults, the recommended FTUs to be applied in a single dose are:\n\n【30】*   0.5 FTU for genitals\n*   1 FTU for hands, elbows or knees\n*   1.5 FTUs for the feet, including the soles\n*   2.5 FTUs for the face and neck\n*   3 FTUs for the scalp\n*   4 FTUs for a hand and arm together, or the buttocks\n*   8 FTUs for 1 leg and foot, the chest or back\n\n【31】For children, the recommended FTUs will depend on their age. A GP can advise you on this.\n\n【32】Side effects of topical corticosteroids\n---------------------------------------\n\n【33】If you use them correctly, topical corticosteroids rarely have serious side effects.\n\n【34】The most common side effect of topical corticosteroids is a burning or stinging sensation when the medicine is applied. However, this usually improves as your skin gets used to the treatment.\n\n【35】Less common side effects can include:\n\n【36】*   worsening or spreading of a skin infection you already have\n*   inflamed hair follicles (folliculitis)\n*   thinning of the skin, which can make the affected skin more vulnerable to damage; for example, you may bruise more easily\n*   stretch marks, which are likely to be permanent, although they'll probably become less noticeable over time\n*   contact dermatitis, which is a skin irritation caused by a mild allergic reaction to the substances in a particular topical corticosteroid\n*   acne, or worsening of acne\n*   rosacea, which is a condition that causes the face to become red and flushed\n*   changes in skin colour – this is usually more noticeable in people with dark skin\n*   excessive hair growth on the area of skin being treated\n\n【37】Side effects are more likely if you're:\n\n【38】*   using a more potent corticosteroid\n*   using it for a very long time, or over a large area\n\n【39】The elderly and very young are more vulnerable to side effects.\n\n【40】If potent or very potent topical corticosteroids are used for a long time or over a large area, there's a risk of the medicine being absorbed into the bloodstream and causing internal side effects, such as:\n\n【41】*   decreased growth in children\n*   Cushing's syndrome\n\n【42】This is not a full list of all the possible side effects. For more information on side effects, see the leaflet that comes with the medicine.\n\n【43】If you're using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid for several weeks or more, you may be given a steroid treatment card that explains how you can reduce the risk of side effects.\n\n【44】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your steroid treatment card to the doctor, dentist or pharmacist so they know that you're using topical corticosteroids.\n\n【45】### Withdrawal side effects\n\n【46】If you stop using topical corticosteroids after using them continuously for a long time (usually over 12 months in adults), you may have a withdrawal reaction. These can sometimes be severe. Your doctor may advise stopping the treatment gradually to avoid this.\n\n【47】Withdrawal side effects can include:\n\n【48】*   redness or changes in skin colour (this may not be as noticeable on brown or black skin)\n*   burning, stinging, itching or peeling of the skin, or oozing, open sores\n*   a flare up of the skin condition you were treating\n\n【49】If you’ve been using topical corticosteroids for a long time, it’s a good idea to ask your doctor to review your treatment.\n\n【50】### Reporting side effects\n\n【51】The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking. It's run by the medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\n【52】Go to the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 May 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:21", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:31", "cost": 9.673}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:21"}

This is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\n\n【8】Autoimmune conditions known to cause uveitis include:\n\n【9】*   ankylosing spondylitis – a condition where the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed\n*   reactive arthritis – a condition that causes inflammation in various areas of the body\n*   conditions that cause bowel inflammation – such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis\n*   psoriasis – a skin condition\n*   psoriatic arthritis – a type of arthritis that develops in some people with psoriasis\n*   multiple sclerosis – a condition mainly affecting the nerves\n*   Behçet's disease – a rare condition that causes mouth ulcers and genital ulcers\n*   sarcoidosis – a rare inflammatory condition that affects the lungs, skin and eyes\n*   juvenile idiopathic arthritis– a type of arthritis that affects children\n\n【10】Infection\n---------\n\n【11】Uveitis can also be caused by an infection, such as:\n\n【12】*   toxoplasmosis – an infection caused by a parasite\n*   herpes simplex virus – the virus responsible for cold sores\n*   varicella-zoster virus – the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles\n*   cytomegalovirus – a common infection that does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms, but can cause sight-threatening uveitis in people with a lowered immune system\n*   tuberculosis\n*   HIV and syphilis are rare causes\n\n【13】Other causes\n------------\n\n【14】Uveitis can also be caused by:\n\n【15】*   trauma or injury to the eyes, or eye surgery\n*   some types of cancers, such as Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, although this is a very rare cause of uveitis\n\n【16】Sometimes, a specific cause of uveitis cannot be identified.\n\n【17】Gene HLA-B27\n------------\n\n【18】Although uveitis is not passed down through families, a gene known as HLA-B27 has been linked to an increased risk of developing uveitis at the front of the eye (anterior uveitis).\n\n【19】About half of all people with anterior uveitis have the HLA-B27 gene. The gene has been found in people with certain autoimmune conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 January 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 January 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Uveitis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:26", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:40", "cost": 14.396}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:25"}

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about chlorhexidine\n\n【3】1\\. About chlorhexidine\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic and disinfectant. It helps reduce the number of germs (bacteria) in your mouth or on your skin.\n\n【5】It can help with:\n\n【6】*   mouth infections, mouth ulcers and gum disease\n*   sore throats\n*   denture care\n*   skin infections\n\n【7】Chlorhexidine is usually combined with other ingredients. Some sore throat treatments have a local anaesthetic to help numb pain.\n\n【8】Mouth and throat treatments come as mouthwashes, lozenges, gels and sprays.\n\n【9】Skin treatments come as creams, ointments and lotions.\n\n【10】Many chlorhexidine treatments are available to buy in pharmacies, and some in shops and supermarkets.\n\n【11】For nose infections, there is a nasal cream that contains chlorhexidine and neomycin, an antibiotic. This medicine is available on prescription only and is known by the brand name Naseptin.\n\n【12】Chlorhexidine is also used in hospitals and clinics to clean skin or surgical equipment before surgery. It can be used in some bladder procedures, including cleaning catheters.\n\n【13】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【14】*   You’ll usually use chlorhexidine treatments for up to 4 weeks.\n*   You’re unlikely to have any side effects with the skin creams and lotions.\n*   Common side effects with the throat spray, lozenges and dental treatments include a dry mouth and stained teeth.\n*   When using the lozenges, spray, mouthwash or dental gel, wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink. This gives the medicine a chance to work properly.\n*   Do not use bleach on clothes, bedding or other fabrics that have been in contact with chlorhexidine. It will leave yellowish-brown stains.\n\n【15】3\\. Who can and cannot use chlorhexidine\n----------------------------------------\n\n【16】Chlorhexidine throat spray, lozenges and dental treatments (including mouthwash and dental gel) can be used by adults and children aged 12 or older.\n\n【17】Chlorhexidine skin treatments can be used by adults and children.\n\n【18】To make sure chlorhexidine is safe for you, tell a pharmacist or doctor before using it if you:\n\n【19】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to chlorhexidine or any of the other ingredients\n*   have ever had an allergic reaction to any other medicine\n*   cannot drink or need to avoid alcohol. Some chlorhexidine sprays and mouthwashes may contain very small amounts of alcohol. Ask a pharmacist, doctor or dentist about medicines without alcohol.\n\n【20】4\\. How and when to use chlorhexidine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【21】If you buy a chlorhexidine treatment in a pharmacy or supermarket, follow the instructions that come with it. For prescription medicines, follow the advice from your doctor, dentist or a pharmacist.\n\n【22】Wash your hands before and after using chlorhexidine. Keep it away from your eyes and ears. If chlorhexidine gets into your eyes or ears, rinse well with water.\n\n【23】### Dosage and how to use lozenges\n\n【24】The usual dose for children aged 12 and older is up to 5 lozenges a day. Adults can have up to 10 a day.\n\n【25】Put a lozenge in your mouth and let it melt slowly.\n\n【26】Wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink.\n\n【27】### Dosage and how to use mouthwash\n\n【28】The usual dose is 10 ml, twice a day.\n\n【29】Pour 10ml into the measuring cup. Rinse the mouthwash around your mouth for about 1 minute. Spit out the mouthwash, do not swallow it.\n\n【30】Wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink.\n\n【31】### Dosage and how to use mouth spray\n\n【32】The usual dose is 2 squirts at a time, up to 12 times a day.\n\n【33】Aim the spray onto your affected tooth, gum, ulcer or the sore part of your mouth.\n\n【34】Wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink.\n\n【35】### Dosage and how to use throat spray\n\n【36】The usual dose is 3 to 5 squirts. You can repeat this dose up to 10 times a day.\n\n【37】Wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink.\n\n【38】### How to use dental gel\n\n【39】You’ll usually use the gel once or twice a day.\n\n【40】Put a small amount of gel onto your fingertip or a cotton bud. Gently wipe it across the surface of your mouth ulcer, gum or the sore part of your mouth.\n\n【41】Wait at least 30 to 60 minutes before having something to eat or drink.\n\n【42】### How to use sore throat treatments\n\n【43】Only use chlorhexidine lozenges and sore throat spray for a short time. Do not keep using them continuously.\n\n【44】Contact a doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 3 to 4 days.\n\n【45】### How to use dental treatments\n\n【46】Use your dental treatment at a different time of day to when you brush your teeth. This is because toothpaste can stop chlorhexidine working properly.\n\n【47】If you cannot use it at a different time, then rinse your mouth thoroughly with water after brushing your teeth. Wait at least 5 minutes before using chlorhexidine.\n\n【48】If your symptoms do not improve after one week, or if they get worse at any time, stop using chlorhexidine and contact your dentist or doctor.\n\n【49】#### Important\n\n【50】Carry on using chlorhexidine until you have finished the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, the infection could come back.\n\n【51】Check with your dentist, doctor or pharmacist if you’re not sure how long to use it for.\n\n【52】### Chlorhexidine skin treatments\n\n【53】Keep chlorhexidine skin treatments away from your eyes and mouth.\n\n【54】Skin treatments are usually used short-term for a few weeks, but occasionally you may have to use them for longer.\n\n【55】You can use treatments like Dermol lotion as both a body wash (soap substitute) and moisturising skin lotion.\n\n【56】#### How to use skin cream or lotion\n\n【57】Apply a thin layer of chlorhexidine cream or lotion to the affected areas of your skin. Follow the directions included in the packet.\n\n【58】##### Important: Fire warning\n\n【59】Skin cream can dry onto your clothes and bedding. This can make them more likely to catch fire. Avoid naked flames.\n\n【60】#### How to use chlorhexidine as soap substitute or wash\n\n【61】Use your chlorhexidine treatment instead of soap or shower gel when you wash. You use it in the same way as an ordinary soap or gel. However, it may not be as foamy.\n\n【62】Be careful not to slip in the bath or shower, or on a tiled floor, when using the cream or lotion.\n\n【63】If you are going into hospital, you may be sent a chlorhexidine product to wash with before you come into hospital to reduce the chances of infection. This should come with instructions on how to use it.\n\n【64】### What if I forget to use my chlorhexidine treatment?\n\n【65】If you forget your chlorhexidine dental or sore throat treatment, use it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and have your next one as normal.\n\n【66】If you forget to use your chlorhexidine skin treatment, that’s okay. Just start your routine again after the missed treatment and carry on as before.\n\n【67】If you have been prescribed chlorhexidine and forget to take it or apply it on a regular basis, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for other ways to remember your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I use too much?\n\n【69】Chlorhexidine is usually a safe medicine if you follow the instructions that come with it. However, do not use more than the recommended dose.\n\n【70】Speak to your doctor or a pharmacist now if you or your child has swallowed too much.\n\n【71】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 now for advice if:\n\n【72】*   you or child have swallowed too much chlorhexidine and feel unwell\n\n【73】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【74】Chlorhexidine treatments are generally very safe.

This should come with instructions on how to use it.\n\n【64】### What if I forget to use my chlorhexidine treatment?\n\n【65】If you forget your chlorhexidine dental or sore throat treatment, use it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.

Be careful not to overexert yourself.\n\n【29】You should be able to hold and carry your baby once you get home.\n\n【30】But you may not be able to do some activities straight away, such as:\n\n【31】*   driving\n*   exercising\n*   carrying anything heavier than your baby\n*   having sex\n\n【32】Only start to do these things again when you feel able to do so and do not find them uncomfortable. This may not be for 6 weeks or so.\n\n【33】Ask your midwife for advice if you're unsure when it's safe to start returning to your normal activities.\n\n【34】You can also ask a GP at your 6-week postnatal check.\n\n【35】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【36】Contact your midwife or a GP straight away if you have any of the following symptoms after a caesarean:\n\n【37】*   severe pain\n*   leaking urine\n*   pain when peeing\n*   heavy vaginal bleeding\n*   your wound becomes more red, painful and swollen\n*   a discharge of pus or foul-smelling fluid from your wound\n*   a cough or shortness of breath\n*   swelling or pain in your lower leg\n\n【38】These symptoms may be the sign of an infection or blood clot, which should be treated as soon as possible.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Risks</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:37:46", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:37:55", "cost": 8.712}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:37:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:37:46"}

If your doctor prescribes it twice a day, take it once in the morning and again in the afternoon.\n\n【8】You do not need to take bumetanide at the same time every day. You can occasionally take it at a different time if it's more convenient for you. For example, you could take it later if you need to go out for a few hours in the morning and will not be near a toilet.\n\n【9】Do not take bumetanide too late in the day (after 4pm) or at night, otherwise you may have to wake up to go to the toilet. Your pharmacist or doctor will advise the best times for you to take your medicine.\n\n【10】You can take bumetanide with or without food. Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.\n\n【11】If you're taking bumetanide as a liquid, it will come with a plastic spoon or syringe to help you measure the correct amount. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【12】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Depending on the reason why you're taking bumetanide, you may have to take it for a long time, even for the rest of your life.\n\n【14】**If you get ill while taking it**\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】Contact your doctor if:\n\n【16】*   you're ill with a a high temperature\n*   you're sweating and shaking\n*   you're being sick (vomiting) or have severe diarrhoea\n\n【17】Your doctor may recommend you stop taking bumetanide for 1 to 2 days until you are better. You can start taking it again when you're eating and drinking normally.\n\n【18】If you take bumetanide when you have an illness that makes you dehydrated, it can make the dehydration worse.\n\n【19】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【20】Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it is after 4pm. If this happens, leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【21】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【22】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicines.\n\n【23】Stopping bumetanide\n-------------------\n\n【24】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking bumetanide. Stopping it may cause fluid to build up in your body.\n\n【25】If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe you a different medicine.\n\n【26】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【27】Taking too much bumetanide can cause headaches, make you feel dizzy, give you a pounding or irregular heartbeat, make you faint, and make you feel thirsty.\n\n【28】The amount of bumetanide that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【29】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【30】you take more than your prescribed dose of bumetanide. This is very important if you:\n\n【31】*   feel unwell\n*   are over 65 (even if you feel well)\n*   have liver, kidney or heart problems (even if you feel well)\n\n【32】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【33】If you need advice for a child under the age of 5, call 111.\n\n【34】If you have to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you. Take the bumetanide packet, and the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n删除11：<u>More in Bumetanide\n------------------\n\n【35】*   About bumetanide\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking bumetanide with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 7 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 7 February 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:18:17", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:20:37", "cost": 140.079}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:20:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:18:16"}

It's widely used to treat indigestion and heartburn, and acid reflux. It's also taken to prevent and treat stomach ulcers.\n\n【2】Omeprazole is a type of medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Proton pumps are enzymes in the lining of your stomach that help it make acid to digest food. Omeprazole prevents proton pumps working properly which reduces the amount of acid the stomach makes.\n\n【3】Sometimes, omeprazole is taken for a rare condition caused by a tumour in the pancreas or gut called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n\n【4】Omeprazole comes as capsules, tablets and as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【5】All types of omeprazole are available on prescription. You can buy 20mg tablets from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【6】Key facts\n---------\n\n【7】*   Omeprazole starts to work within 2 to 3 days, but it may take up to 4 weeks for it to work fully.\n*   You’ll usually take omeprazole once a day, in the morning. For Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, you can take it twice a day – in the morning and in the evening.\n*   Common side effects include headaches, diarrhoea and stomach pain. These tend to be mild and go away when you stop taking the medicine.\n*   If you buy omeprazole from a pharmacy or supermarket to treat yourself, do not take it for longer than 2 weeks without checking with a doctor.\n*   Alcohol can make your stomach produce more acid than normal. This irritates the stomach lining and can make your symptoms worse.

The remaining cases are not associated with cancer and can start at any age.\n\n【4】LEMS is also known as myasthenic syndrome or Eaton-Lambert syndrome.\n\n【5】Symptoms of LEMS\n----------------\n\n【6】The symptoms of LEMS develop gradually over weeks or months.\n\n【7】The main symptoms are weakness in the legs, arms, neck and face, as well as problems with automatic body functions, such as controlling blood pressure.\n\n【8】Common symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   aching muscles\n*   feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)\n*   difficulty walking and climbing stairs\n*   difficulty lifting objects or raising the arms\n*   drooping eyelids, dry eyes and blurred vision\n*   swallowing problems\n*   dizziness upon standing\n*   a dry mouth\n*   constipation\n*   erectile dysfunction\n*   muscle weakness that gets worse with time\n\n【10】See a GP if you have a combination of these symptoms.\n\n【11】Causes of LEMS\n--------------\n\n【12】LEMS is caused by the body's natural defences (the immune system) mistakenly attacking and damaging the nerves.\n\n【13】Normally, nerve signals travel down the nerves and stimulate the nerve endings to release a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical then helps activate the muscles.\n\n【14】If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly.\n\n【15】It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer, but can occur in people without cancer.\n\n【16】Tests for LEMS\n--------------\n\n【17】The GP will first check your medical history, ask about your symptoms, carry out a physical examination, and test your reflexes.\n\n【18】If they think you have a problem with your nerves, they may refer you to a specialist called a neurologist for further tests to determine the cause.\n\n【19】Tests you may have include:\n\n【20】*   **blood tests** – a blood test can detect substances in the blood (antibodies) resulting from the immune system attacking the nerves\n*   **nerve studies** – a needle may be inserted into your skin to check how well signals are reaching the muscles from the nerves\n*   **scans** – you may have a CT scan or PET scan to check for lung cancer\n\n【21】If initial scans do not find cancer, you may be advised to have regular scans every few months for a few years to check that it does not develop later on.\n\n【22】Treatments for LEMS\n-------------------\n\n【23】There's currently no cure for LEMS, but a number of treatments can help reduce the symptoms.\n\n【24】These include:\n\n【25】*   **treatment for lung cancer** – if you have lung cancer, treating it can significantly improve the symptoms of LEMS\n*   **medicine to help nerve signals reach the muscles** – commonly used medicines include 3,4-diaminopyridine and pyridostigmine\n*   **medicine to reduce the activity of the immune system (immunosuppressants)** – commonly used medicines include steroid tablets (such as prednisolone), azathioprine and methotrexate\n*   **plasmapheresis** – a procedure to redirect your blood through a machine that filters out the antibodies attacking your nerves\n*   **immunoglobulin therapy** – injections of antibodies from donated blood that temporarily stop your immune system attacking your nerves\n\n【26】Medicine is the main treatment, although plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin therapy may be recommended in the short term, or if muscle weakness is severe and other treatments have not helped.\n\n【27】Outlook for LEMS\n----------------\n\n【28】Some people respond well to treatment and find that treatment helps keep their symptoms under control.\n\n【29】Others respond less well and find the condition affects their everyday activities and quality of life.\n\n【30】LEMS does not affect life expectancy if it's not associated with cancer. But people with lung cancer and LEMS tend to have a shorter life expectancy because by this point it's very difficult to treat.\n\n【31】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【32】If you have LEMS, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【33】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n删除7：<u>GOV.UK has more information about NCARDRS</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:44:34", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:44:40", "cost": 5.476}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:44:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:44:34"}

Wash your hands and get yourself into a comfortable position. You can either stand up or lie down.\n2.  Open the pack and remove the applicator. The tablet should already be inside it.\n3.  Hold the applicator so one finger can press the applicator plunger.\n4.  Insert the applicator carefully into your vagina. You can do this either standing up or lying down. Try to insert about half of the applicator and only go as far as you're comfortable with.\n5.  Press the applicator plunger until you feel it click. This lets you know that the tablet has been released. The tablet will then attach itself to your vaginal wall.\n6.  Gently remove the applicator and throw it away.\n\n【7】### Using vaginal gel\n\n【8】Your gel will come in a tube. It will also come with a plunger and a small, empty tube (cannula) to help you insert the gel.\n\n【9】1.  Wash your hands and remove the tube cap. If it's the first time you're using the tube, pierce the seal on the neck of the tube but do not use it if the seal is broken.\n2.  Insert the plunger into the cannula and screw the end of the cannula onto the neck of the tube.\n3.  Squeeze the gel into the applicator until it reaches the filling mark. The plunger will stop at that mark.\n4.  Unscrew the cannula from the tube and replace the cap on the tube.\n5.  Get into a comfortable position, either standing or lying down, and insert the end of the applicator into your vagina.\n6.  Push the plunger all the way down.\n7.  Gently remove the applicator. Throw the cannula away and rinse the plunger with warm and clean water so you can use it again.\n\n【10】### Using vaginal pessaries\n\n【11】1.  Wash your hands and get yourself into a comfortable position, either standing up or lying down.\n2.  Remove the pessary from its foil pack.\n3.  Standing up or lying down, gently insert the pessary as far into your vagina as you can.\n4.  Wash your hands. If you're using Vagirux, you can use the applicator again. If you're using Vagifem, throw the applicator away.\n\n【12】### Using vaginal cream\n\n【13】1.  Wash your hands and remove the cap from the tube. If it's the first time you're using the tube, pierce the seal on the neck of the tube but do not use it if the seal is broken.\n2.  Screw the end of the applicator onto the tube.\n3.  Squeeze the cream into the applicator to the red ring mark. The plunger will automatically stop at that mark.\n4.  Get into a comfortable position, either standing up or lying down. Gently insert the applicator into your vagina and push the plunger as far as it will go.\n5.  Remove the applicator and take the plunger out of it. Wash the applicator and plunger in hot, soapy water so you can use it again.\n\n【14】### Using a vaginal ring\n\n【15】1.  Wash your hands then find a position you feel comfortable in, either standing up or lying down.\n2.  With one hand, squeeze the ring into an oval shape and gently push it into your vagina. Do this in the direction of upwards, backwards and towards the small of your back.\n3.  Wash your hands when you've finished.\n\n【16】You can use your vaginal ring for up to 3 months. After that, you'll need to remove it and replace it with a new one.\n\n【17】If your ring falls out, rinse it in lukewarm water and insert it back into your vagina.\n\n【18】If you're going to have sex, you can either leave the ring in place, or remove it if you find it uncomfortable.\n\n【19】You may notice that the ring shifts when you have a poo. If this happens, you can easily push the ring back into position with your finger. If you're constipated or know you're going to find it difficult to poo, it's best to remove the ring completely and then put it back afterwards.\n\n【20】How long to use it for\n----------------------\n\n【21】You'll usually be recommended to take HRT for between 2 and 5 years to relieve symptoms but you may need to take it for longer, and there is no set limit on how long you can take it.\n\n【22】It's recommended that you speak to your doctor at least once a year, to check whether the benefits of using vaginal oestrogen still outweigh the risks.\n\n【23】If you forget to use it\n-----------------------\n\n【24】No matter what form of vaginal oestrogen you use, never insert 2 doses at the same time. Never insert an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【25】If a doctor has advised you to use vaginal oestrogen regularly and you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask a pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to use your medicine.\n\n【26】### Vaginal tablets and cream\n\n【27】Insert your missed tablet or dose of cream as soon as you remember.\n\n【28】### Pessaries\n\n【29】If you forget to insert your pessary during your 3 weeks of daily treatment, skip the missed dose then insert your next pessary at the usual time.\n\n【30】If you forget to insert one of your 2 pessaries during your 1 week of treatment, insert the forgotten dose as soon as possible.\n\n【31】### Gel\n\n【32】Insert your missed dose of gel as soon as you remember, unless it's been over 12 hours since your last dose. In this case, wait until the next one.\n\n【33】If you insert too much\n----------------------\n\n【34】Inserting an extra dose of vaginal oestrogen is unlikely to harm you. If you're worried, talk to a doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n删除11：<u>More in Vaginal oestrogen\n-------------------------\n\n【35】*   About vaginal oestrogen\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using vaginal oestrogen with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:16", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:23", "cost": 6.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:16"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**If your child is diagnosed with spina bifida, they'll be referred to a specialist team who will be involved in their care.**\n\n【3】A care plan may be drawn up to address your child's needs and any problems they have. As your child gets older, the care plan will be reassessed to take into account changes to their needs and situation.\n\n【4】There are several different treatments for the various problems spina bifida can cause.\n\n【5】Initial surgery to repair the spine\n-----------------------------------\n\n【6】In babies with spina bifida, nerves and membranes can push out of an opening in the spine and form a sac. This damages the nerves and can lead to serious infections, so your baby will usually have surgery to repair the spine within 48 hours of birth.\n\n【7】During surgery, the surgeon will put the spinal cord and any exposed tissues or nerves back into the correct place. The gap in the spine is then closed and the hole sealed with muscle and skin.\n\n【8】Although this will repair the defect, unfortunately it cannot reverse any nerve damage.\n\n【9】Treating hydrocephalus\n----------------------\n\n【10】Surgery is usually needed if your child has hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain). The surgeon will implant a thin tube called a shunt to drain away excess fluid to another part of the body, usually the tummy.\n\n【11】The shunt will usually need to remain in place for the rest of the child's life. Further surgery may be needed if:\n\n【12】*   the shunt becomes blocked or infected\n*   the child grows out of the shunt and needs a larger one\n\n【13】Read about treating hydrocephalus and complications of hydrocephalus.\n\n【14】Physiotherapy\n-------------\n\n【15】Physiotherapy is an important way of helping someone with spina bifida to become as independent as possible. The main aim is to help with movement, prevent deformity, and stop the leg muscles weakening further.\n\n【16】This may involve daily exercises to help maintain strength in the leg muscles, as well as wearing special splints to support the legs.\n\n【17】Occupational therapy\n--------------------\n\n【18】Occupational therapy can help people find ways to carry out everyday activities and become more independent.\n\n【19】An occupational therapist can help find practical solutions to problems such as getting dressed. For example, they may provide equipment, such as handrails, to make the activity easier.\n\n【20】Mobility aids\n-------------\n\n【21】People who are unable to use their legs at all will usually need a wheelchair. Electric wheelchairs are available, but using a manual wheelchair can help maintain good upper body strength.\n\n【22】Leg braces, splints and other walking aids can be used by people who have weak leg muscles.\n删除7：<u>Read more about choosing mobility equipment, wheelchairs and scooters.</u>\n\n【23】Treating bone and joint problems\n--------------------------------\n\n【24】Further corrective surgery may be needed if there are problems with bone development, such as hip dislocation or club foot (a deformity of the foot and ankle). This type of surgery is known as orthopaedic surgery.\n\n【25】Treating bladder problems\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Many people with spina bifida have problems controlling their bladder.\n\n【27】Treatments for bladder problems include:\n\n【28】*   antibiotics – lifelong antibiotics are sometimes needed to help prevent kidney and urinary infections\n*   medicines – that help relax the bladder so it can store more pee\n*   urinary catheterisation – an intermittent urinary catheter is usually needed to drain pee from the bladder several times a day to help prevent infection\n*   bladder surgery – may involve enlarging the bladder so it can hold more pee, or connecting the appendix to the bladder and making an opening in the belly so that a catheter can be used more easily\n删除7：<u>Read more about urinary incontinence.</u>\n\n【29】Treating bowel problems\n-----------------------\n\n【30】Bowel problems, particularly constipation, are often a problem for people with spina bifida.\n\n【31】Treatments for bowel problems include:\n\n【32】*   laxatives – a type of medicine to help empty the bowels\n*   suppositories and enemas – medicines put into the bottom to help stimulate the bowels and relieve constipation\n*   anal irrigation – where using special equipment, you pump water through a tube into your bottom to clean out your bowels; this can be done at home once you've been trained in using the equipment\n*   antegrade continence enema (ACE) – an operation to create a channel between the bowel and a small opening (stoma) on the surface of the tummy; this means liquids can be passed through the opening in the tummy to flush stools out of the bottom\n*   colostomy – surgery to divert one end of the large bowel through an opening in the tummy; a pouch is placed over the opening to collect stools; a colostomy may be recommended if other treatments do not work\n删除7：<u>Read more about bowel incontinence.</u>\n\n【33】Support at school\n-----------------\n\n【34】Most children with spina bifida have a normal level of intelligence and are often be able to attend a mainstream school.\n\n【35】However, they may need support to help with any learning disabilities they have, as well as any physical problems, such as incontinence.\n\n【36】If you think your child may need extra support at school or nursery, talk to their teacher or the special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO).\n删除7：<u>Read more about special educational needs (SEN).</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:44:21", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:44:47", "cost": 26.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:44:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:44:19"}

The GP will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety.\n\n【4】The GP is likely to:\n\n【5】*   ask for a urine sample to check for infection\n*   take a blood sample to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) – called PSA testing\n*   examine your prostate by inserting a gloved finger into your bottom – called digital rectal examination\n\n【6】The GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels and the results of your prostate examination, as well as your age, family history and ethnic group.\n\n【7】If you're at risk, you should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests.\n\n【8】MRI scan\n--------\n\n【9】If you have a raised PSA level, your doctor may refer you to hospital for an MRI scan of your prostate. If the scan shows a problem, it can be targeted later with a biopsy.\n\n【10】Having a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【11】There are a few types of biopsy that may be used in hospital, including the following.\n\n【12】### A transperineal biopsy\n\n【13】This is where a needle is inserted into the prostate through the skin behind the scrotum. It's usually done under a general anaesthetic (while you're asleep). It has the advantage of a reduced risk of infection.\n\n【14】### A transrectal biopsy\n\n【15】During this biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see where to pass the needle to take small samples of tissue from your prostate.\n\n【16】This procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area and minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection.\n\n【17】A biopsy may also be taken during a cystoscopy examination.\n\n【18】### Issues with biopsies\n\n【19】Although a biopsy is more reliable than a PSA test, there can still be issues, such as:\n\n【20】*   missing the cancer – doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan but might not always spot a tumour\n*   needing another biopsy if your symptoms persist or your PSA level continues to rise – you may be offered another MRI scan first\n*   finding small, low-risk cancers that do not need treatment but may cause you anxiety – and there is a possible related risk that you choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy of little to no benefit that cause side effects, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction (impotence)\n\n【21】The samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. If cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. This is called \"staging and grading\" and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【22】*   Cancer Research UK: stages, types and grades of prostate cancer\n*   Macmillan: staging and grading of prostate cancer\n\n【23】</u>\nFurther testing for advanced cancer\n-----------------------------------\n\n【24】If there's a significant chance the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended.\n\n【25】These include:\n\n【26】*   an MRI scan, CT scan or PET scan – these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body\n*   an isotope bone scan, which can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones – a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and then collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalities\n删除6：<u>Further information\n-------------------\n\n【27】*   Cancer Research UK: prostate cancer tests\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 October 2024</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : PSA testing</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:01:50", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:02:30", "cost": 40.006}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:55", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:02:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:01:49"}

Your doctors will recommend the best type for you.\n\n【9】The most common types are:\n\n【10】*   external radiotherapy, where a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the cancer\n*   radiotherapy implants (brachytherapy), where small pieces of radioactive metal are (usually temporarily) placed inside your body near the cancer\n*   radiotherapy injections, capsules or drinks (radioisotope therapy), where you swallow a radioactive liquid, or have it injected into your blood\n*   intrabeam radiotherapy, where radiation is delivered directly at the tumour during breast cancer surgery (this treatment is not available at all NHS hospitals)\n\n【11】Radiotherapy is usually given in hospital. You can usually go home soon after external radiotherapy, but you may need to stay in hospital for a few days if you have implants or radioisotope therapy.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what happens during radiotherapy.</u>\n\n【12】Side effects of radiotherapy\n----------------------------\n\n【13】As well as killing cancer cells, radiotherapy can damage some healthy cells in the area being treated.\n\n【14】This can cause some side effects, such as:\n\n【15】*   sore skin that might change colour to red, lighter or darker than your usual skin tone\n*   feeling tired\n*   hair loss in the area being treated\n*   feeling sick\n*   losing your appetite\n*   a sore mouth\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【16】Many of these side effects can be treated or prevented and most will go away after treatment stops.\n\n【17】External radiotherapy does not make you radioactive, as the radiation passes through your body.\n\n【18】The radiation from implants or injections can stay in your body for a few days, so you may need to stay in hospital and avoid close contact with other people for a few days as a precaution.\n\n【19】You may need to avoid close contact with children and pregnant women when you go home for a short time.

You could start going to bed and getting up earlier or later than usual (more like the time zone of the place you're travelling to).\n\n【5】### During your flight\n\n【6】#### Do\n\n【7】*   drink plenty of water\n\n【8】*   keep active by stretching and regularly walking around the cabin\n\n【9】*   try to sleep if it's night time at your destination\n\n【10】*   use an eye mask and earplugs if they help you sleep\n\n【11】#### Don’t\n\n【12】*   do not drink too much caffeine or alcohol – they can make jet lag worse\n\n【13】### After you arrive\n\n【14】#### Do\n\n【15】*   change your sleep schedule to the new time zone as quickly as possible\n\n【16】*   set an alarm to avoid oversleeping in the morning\n\n【17】*   go outside during the day – natural light will help your body clock adjust\n\n【18】#### Don’t\n\n【19】*   do not sleep during the day – only sleep at night time\n\n【20】Information:\n\n【21】### Short trips\n\n【22】If your trip is short (2 to 3 days), you could try not changing your eating and sleeping times to the new time zone, to avoid needing to change your schedule again when you get back.\n\n【23】Treatment for jet lag\n---------------------\n\n【24】Medicines are not usually needed for jet lag.\n\n【25】Jet lag often improves after a few days as your body clock adjusts to the new time zone.\n\n【26】Sleeping tablets may be helpful if you're having problems sleeping (insomnia). But they can be addictive so should only be used for a short time and if symptoms are severe.\n\n【27】Melatonin is a natural hormone released by the body in the evening to let your brain know it's time to sleep.\n\n【28】Melatonin tablets are not recommended on the NHS for jet lag because there's not enough evidence to show they work.\n\n【29】Symptoms of jet lag\n-------------------\n\n【30】The main symptoms of jet lag are:\n\n【31】*   difficulty sleeping at bedtime and waking up in the morning\n*   tiredness and exhaustion\n*   difficulty staying awake during the day\n*   poor sleep quality\n*   concentration and memory problems\n\n【32】Jet lag can also sometimes cause indigestion, feeling sick (nausea), constipation, changes in appetite and mild anxiety.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 May 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:19", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:26", "cost": 6.238}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:20"}

Allopurinol should be started before these particular cancer treatments to prevent the build-up of uric acid.\n\n【22】However, some cancer treatments can cause changes in the blood which can be made worse if you take allopurinol. Your doctor will monitor you carefully and take blood tests if you are at risk.\n\n【23】What effect does allopurinol have on the kidneys and liver?\n\n【24】It's rare for allopurinol to affect the liver or kidneys.\n\n【25】However, if you have serious problems with your kidneys then you may be at greater risk of an allergic reaction to allopurinol. A doctor may prescribe a lower dose of allopurinol.\n\n【26】Allopurinol can also inflame the liver.\n\n【27】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【28】Allopurinol is not commonly known to affect sex.\n\n【29】However, rarely it can cause breasts to get larger (in both men and women) or erection problems (erectile dysfunction).\n\n【30】Talk to a doctor if you get any of these symptoms.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Allopurinol does not affect any type of contraception including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】But if allopurinol makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.

It can cause painful joints and heart problems. Most people make a full recovery, but it can come back.**\n\n【2】How rheumatic fever is treated\n------------------------------\n\n【3】If you or your child are diagnosed with rheumatic fever, you'll have treatment to relieve the symptoms and control inflammation.\n\n【4】You may need:\n\n【5】*   antibiotics\n*   painkillers – given as tablets, capsules or a liquid you drink\n*   steroid injections – if your pain is severe\n*   medicines – if you're having jerky, uncontrollable movements\n\n【6】Getting plenty of bed rest will also help with your recovery.\n\n【7】Information:\n\n【8】Most people usually make a full recovery by about 3 months. But it can sometimes take longer to get better.\n\n【9】### Ongoing treatment for rheumatic fever\n\n【10】If you have had rheumatic fever once, it makes it more likely that it could come back, so make sure to get sore throats treated early.\n\n【11】You may also have to take antibiotics for several years to help stop it returning.\n\n【12】It's less likely that it will come back if it's been 5 years since you last had an episode. The younger you are, the more likely it is that rheumatic fever will come back.\n\n【13】It can also cause permanent damage to your heart (rheumatic heart disease). This can take years to show up, so you may need regular check-ups and further treatment when you're older.\n\n【14】Always ask a doctor what ongoing treatment you may need.\n\n【15】### Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n\n【16】*   you've had rheumatic fever before and you think it's come back\n*   you've had a bacterial throat infection recently and you develop symptoms of rheumatic fever\n\n【17】Symptoms of rheumatic fever\n---------------------------\n\n【18】Symptoms usually appear 1 to 5 weeks after you have had a bacterial throat infection.\n\n【19】They include:\n\n【20】*   a high temperature\n*   redness, pain and swelling of your joints (arthritis), usually ankles, knees, wrists or elbows\n*   pain in your chest, breathlessness and a fast heart rate\n*   jerky, uncontrollable movements in your hands, feet and face\n*   tiny bumps under your skin\n*   pale-red patches on your arms and tummy (abdomen)\n\n【21】Causes of rheumatic fever\n-------------------------\n\n【22】Rheumatic fever happens after a bacterial throat or skin infection. Most people who have an infection will not get rheumatic fever.\n\n【23】It's not caused by the bacteria itself but by your immune system fighting off the infection and attacking the healthy tissue instead.\n\n【24】It's not known why your immune system can suddenly stop working properly. But your genes may make it more likely that you'll get rheumatic fever.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 June 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:15:51", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:16:14", "cost": 23.339}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:16:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:15:50"}

This will help you and your baby stay healthy.\n\n【3】Many pregnancy multivitamins already contain 400IU (10 micrograms) of vitamin D so if you're taking one of these, you will not need an extra vitamin D supplement. Check the packet to see what dose of vitamin D it contains.\n\n【4】If you have been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency (where your blood levels of vitamin D are too low), your doctor or midwife may offer a higher dose of colecalciferol. Higher doses are also safe to take during pregnancy. This treatment is important to help protect your teeth and muscles, and make sure your baby develops strong bones and teeth.\n\n【5】You may need extra blood tests to make sure that you are taking enough vitamin D.\n\n【6】Colecalciferol and breastfeeding\n--------------------------------\n\n【7】You can take colecalciferol (vitamin D) while you are breastfeeding.\n\n【8】Vitamin D is a natural part of breast milk. When you take colecalciferol as a supplement or treatment, it passes into your breast milk in low amounts and helps your baby to stay healthy.\n\n【9】If you have been prescribed a very high dose of colecalciferol (over 6,000IU a day), your baby may need extra blood tests. This is to make sure they're not getting too much.\n\n【10】Babies up to the age of 1 year need 340IU to 400IU of vitamin D drops a day as a supplement. Unless you're taking very high doses of colecalciferol for long periods, it's still safe to give it to your baby, even though they are getting colecalciferol through breast milk. This ensures they are getting enough.\n\n【11】If your baby is having at least 500ml of formula milk a day, they do not need supplements as formula milk already has vitamin D added.\n\n【12】If you notice your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or you have any other concerns about your baby, contact your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n\n【13】Colecalciferol and fertility\n----------------------------\n\n【14】There's no evidence to suggest that taking colecalciferol reduces fertility in men or women.\n\n【15】Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how vitamin D supplements such as colecalciferol can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Colecalciferol\n----------------------\n\n【17】*   About colecalciferol\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:01:17", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:02:50", "cost": 93.77}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:02:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:01:16"}

This allows your cells to work properly again and your symptoms should improve.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】Taking thiamine will start increasing your body's levels of vitamin B1 within a few hours.\n\n【7】However, if you're taking it to treat vitamin B1 deficiency, it may take a few weeks before you start to feel better.\n\n【8】It's important to keep taking your thiamine for as long as the doctor tells you to.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side-effects?\n\n【10】There are usually no problems taking thiamine for a long time.\n\n【11】Your body absorbs the amount of thiamine (or vitamin B1) that it needs.

Thiamine will not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【24】Can I drink alcohol while taking thiamine?\n\n【25】Long-term drinking or heavy drinking can stop your body from absorbing thiamine (vitamin B1).\n\n【26】If you're taking thiamine for vitamin B1 deficiency, it's best to avoid drinking alcohol as this will make your symptoms worse.\n\n【27】If you're taking thiamine as a vitamin supplement, avoid drinking too much.

Cautions with other medicines\n8.  Common questions about mometasone for skin\n\n【3】1\\. About mometasone for skin\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Mometasone skin treatments are used to treat itching, swollen and irritated skin. They can help with different types of eczema (including atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis) and psoriasis.\n\n【5】Mometasone skin treatments are available on prescription only. They come as:\n\n【6】*   creams\n*   ointments\n*   scalp lotions\n\n【7】They are stronger than some other treatments. Mometasone is usually prescribed when milder steroids, like hydrocortisone, have not worked.\n\n【8】Mometasone is a type of medicine known as a steroid (also called a corticosteroid). This is not the same as an anabolic steroid.\n\n【9】It also comes as an inhaler and a nasal spray.\n\n【10】Read about:\n\n【11】*   mometasone inhalers – for asthma\n*   mometasone nasal sprays – for allergic rhinitis, hay fever and nasal polyps\n\n【12】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【13】*   It’s important to follow the instruction when using a steroid skin treatment. This helps to avoid side effects.\n*   Only use a mometasone skin treatment if your doctor prescribes it for you. Do not use someone else’s medicine.\n*   Generally mometasone is not recommended for the sensitive skin on your face. Only use it on your face if your doctor says it’s OK.\n*   Mometasone skin treatments will not help with conditions such as acne or rosacea.\n*   Only use mometasone on large areas of your body or for long periods of time if your doctor says it’s OK.\n*   If your doctor has prescribed high doses of mometasone to control your symptoms you may need to carry a steroid emergency card. Ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【14】3\\. Who can and cannot use mometasone for skin\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Most adults and children aged 2 years and older can use mometasone skin treatments.\n\n【16】Mometasone may not be suitable for some people. **Tell a doctor or pharmacist before using it if you**:\n\n【17】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to mometasone or any other medicine in the past\n*   have chickenpox or shingles\n*   have acne or rosacea\n*   have a skin infection\n*   have broken skin, cuts or itchy skin which is not inflamed or red\n*   are trying to get pregnant, are already pregnant or you’re breastfeeding\n\n【18】4\\. How and when to use mometasone for skin\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Always follow the instructions from a pharmacist, doctor or the leaflet that comes with your medicine.\n\n【20】### How to use mometasone cream or ointment\n\n【21】Creams are better for skin that is moist and weepy. Ointments are thicker and greasier, and are better for dry or flaky areas of skin.\n\n【22】You will usually use mometasone cream or ointment once a day.\n\n【23】The amount of cream or ointment you need to use is sometimes measured in fingertip units. This is the amount you can squeeze onto the end of your finger.\n\n【24】A fingertip unit of cream is generally enough to treat an area that’s twice the size of the palm of your hand.\n\n【25】A fingertip unit of cream\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【26】Mark Thomas/Science Photo Library https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/463425/view</u>\n\n【27】For children, the right amount of cream or ointment depends on their age. A doctor or pharmacist can advise you.\n\n【28】#### How to apply cream or ointment\n\n【29】1.  Wash and dry your hands and then squeeze out the right amount.\n2.  Spread the cream or ointment in a thin layer over the area of irritated skin.\n3.  Carefully smooth it into your skin in the direction that your hair grows.\n4.  Use the cream or ointment on all the irritated skin, not just the worst areas.\n5.  Be careful not to get the cream or ointment on broken skin or cuts.\n6.  Wash your hands afterwards (unless you are treating the skin on your hands).\n\n【30】Wait at least 10 minutes before using any other creams or ointments.\n\n【31】#### Important: Fire warning\n\n【32】Skin creams can dry onto your clothes and bedding. This makes them more likely to catch fire. Avoid naked flames.\n\n【33】If you need to use a dressing, like a bandage or plaster, wait at least 10 minutes after putting mometasone on.\n\n【34】If you're treating a child, do not cover the cream or ointment with dressings or bandages. This can cause more medicine to pass through the skin and into the bloodstream, leading to a higher chance of side effects. If your doctor has prescribed it to treat very severe nappy rash, ask them how much to use and how long to use it for.\n\n【35】### How to apply mometasone scalp lotion\n\n【36】You will usually use the scalp lotion once a day.\n\n【37】You can use it on wet or dry hair.\n\n【38】1.  Wash and dry your hands.\n2.  Unscrew the bottle cap and place the nozzle directly on your scalp.\n3.  Apply a few drops of scalp lotion to the affected area of the scalp.\n4.  Gently massage until the lotion disappears.\n5.  Wash your hands afterwards.\n\n【39】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【40】Once your skin starts getting better, do not stop using mometasone suddenly. Speak to your doctor, who might tell you to gradually reduce your dose or give you a milder steroid cream or ointment to use until you stop completely.\n\n【41】### How long will I use mometasone for?\n\n【42】Most people only need to use mometasone skin treatments for a short time. Stop as soon as your skin is better. You will usually only use it for a few days.\n\n【43】Children must not use mometasone skin treatments for more than 5 days, unless their doctor says to use it for longer.\n\n【44】If your doctor says you can use mometasone on your face, then it’s usually OK to use it for up to 5 days. Only use the cream or ointment for longer than 5 days if your doctor tells you to.\n\n【45】Speak to your doctor if your skin gets worse or does not get better within 14 days of using mometasone skin treatments.\n\n【46】### What if I use too much?\n\n【47】Using too much mometasone is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【48】If you’re worried, talk to a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【49】### What if I forget to put it on?\n\n【50】If you forget to use your mometasone, do not worry. Use it as soon as you remember unless it’s nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and apply the next one at the usual time.\n\n【51】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【52】Mometasone skin products are unlikely to cause any side effects if you follow the instructions.\n\n【53】Some people get a burning or stinging feeling for a few minutes when they put mometasone on their skin. This stops happening after you’ve been using it for a few days.\n\n【54】If your doctor has prescribed high doses of mometasone, or you’re also taking other steroid medicines or tablets for fungal infections or HIV, you may get underactive adrenal glands as a side effect. Ask your doctor if you need to carry a steroid emergency card.\n\n【55】### **Serious side effects**\n\n【56】Serious side effects are rare. You’re more likely to have a serious side effect if you use mometasone on a large area of skin for a long time.\n\n【57】Using mometasone for a long time can make your skin thinner or cause stretch marks. Stretch marks are likely to be permanent, but they usually fade over time.\n\n【58】Stop using mometasone and tell a doctor straight away if:\n\n【59】*   the treated skin becomes redder or swollen, or yellow fluid is weeping from your skin – these are signs of a new skin infection or an existing one getting worse\n*   you get lighter or darker patches on your skin – these are a sign of changes to the pigment in your skin\n*   you are using mometasone for psoriasis and you get raised bumps filled with pus under your skin\n*   you have a very upset stomach or you’re being sick (vomiting), feel very tired, have very bad dizziness or fainting, muscle weakness, mood changes, loss of appetite and weight loss – these can be signs of adrenal gland problems\n*   you have new problems with your eyesight after starting to use mometasone\n\n【60】#### **Children and teenagers**\n\n【61】In very rare cases, using mometasone for a long time can slow down the normal growth of children and teenagers.\n\n【62】Your child's doctor will monitor their height and weight carefully for as long as they're using this medicine. This will help them to notice if your child's growth is being affected and change their treatment if needed.\n\n【63】Even if your child's growth slows down, it does not seem to have much effect on their overall adult height.\n\n【64】Talk to your doctor if you're worried. They will be able to explain the benefits and risks of your child using mometasone.\n\n【65】#### **Serious allergic reaction**\n\n【66】It happens rarely but it is possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to mometasone.\n\n【67】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【68】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【69】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【70】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【71】These are not all the side effects of mometasone. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【72】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【73】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【74】6\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【75】### Mometasone in pregnancy\n\n【76】Mometasone skin treatments are not normally recommended if you're pregnant.\n\n【77】Only use mometasone if your doctor or dermatologist (skin specialist) prescribes it and is supervising your treatment. They will be able to explain the benefits and risks of using mometasone.\n\n【78】### Mometasone and breastfeeding\n\n【79】Only use mometasone when breastfeeding if your doctor has said it's OK.\n\n【80】If you're using mometasone on your breasts, wash off any cream or ointment from your breasts, then wash your hands before feeding your baby.\n\n【81】It's usually better to use cream rather than ointment when breastfeeding, as it's easier to wash off.\n\n【82】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【83】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【84】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how mometasone for skin might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet about steroid creams and ointments on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【85】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【86】Other medicines are unlikely to affect the way mometasone skin treatments work.\n\n【87】Tell a pharmacist or doctor if you’re taking:\n\n【88】*   medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or cobicistat\n*   medicines used to treat fungal infections, such as itraconazole\n*   other medicines that contain steroids, such as eczema creams, asthma inhalers, tablets, injections, nasal spray, and eye or nose drops\n\n【89】### Mixing mometasone with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【90】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while using mometasone. Ask a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【91】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【92】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【93】8\\. Common questions about mometasone for skin\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【94】How does mometasone work?\n\n【95】Mometasone is a steroid (also called a corticosteroid). Steroids help to reduce swelling (inflammation) in the skin (and other parts of the body).\n\n【96】Skin gets inflamed when an allergic reaction or irritation causes chemicals to be released in the skin. These make your blood vessels widen and your irritated skin becomes red, swollen, itchy and painful.\n\n【97】Mometasone skin treatments work on your skin’s cells to stop these chemicals being released. This reduces any swelling, redness and itching.\n\n【98】When will my skin get better?\n\n【99】Your skin should start to get better after you’ve used mometasone for a few days.\n\n【100】Speak to your doctor if there if your skin does not get better after 14 days, or if your skin gets worse at any time.\n\n【101】How long will I use mometasone for?\n\n【102】For long-term skin problems, such as eczema and psoriasis, you may need to use mometasone for 1 or 2 weeks, or sometimes for longer.\n\n【103】Do not use mometasone on your face for more than 5 days, unless your doctor tells you this is OK.\n\n【104】If your symptoms get worse or if they have not improved after 14 days (after 5 days for a child), ask your doctor for further advice.\n\n【105】Once your skin is better, you can use an emollient (moisturising treatment) to keep it from becoming inflamed again.\n\n【106】If you need treatment for a long time, your doctor may decide you need to use a milder cream or ointment.\n\n【107】Talk to your doctor before stopping treatment if you've been using mometasone for a long time. They may tell you to gradually use less of it, and use it less often, before you stop completely. This reduces the chance of your symptoms coming back.\n\n【108】Is it safe to use mometasone for a long time?\n\n【109】Using mometasone for a long time without stopping can mean some of the medicine gets into your bloodstream. If this happens, there’s a very small chance it can cause serious side effects, such as adrenal gland problems, high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia), thinning of your skin, or problems with your eyesight.\n\n【110】If you have been using mometasone for a long time, your doctor may tell you to gradually reduce the amount you use, or use a milder steroid, before stopping completely.\n\n【111】Can I use mometasone skin treatments on my face?\n\n【112】Do not use mometasone on your face unless a doctor has told you to.\n\n【113】The skin on your face is delicate. If mometasone skin treatments thin the skin or damage it, it’s particularly noticeable.\n\n【114】If a doctor has said you can use it on your face, do not use it for more than 5 days.\n\n【115】Do not put mometasone near your eyes or on your eyelids.\n\n【116】Can steroids make eczema worse?\n\n【117】Steroids like mometasone reduce swelling (inflammation) in your skin to help manage your symptoms. They do not cure eczema.\n\n【118】If you feel your symptoms are getting worse after using mometasone, it's important to tell a doctor.\n\n【119】When you stop using mometasone, skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis can flare up again.\n\n【120】You can avoid this by gradually reducing the amount you put on, and how often you use it. Your doctor can tell you how to do this.\n\n【121】Can I still have vaccinations?\n\n【122】Using mometasone does not stop you or your child having vaccinations.\n\n【123】But tell the doctor or nurse that you're using mometasone skin treatments so they can give the vaccine in an untreated area of your skin.\n\n【124】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【125】If you're using steroid medicines such as mometasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【126】It’s more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【127】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you’re taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【128】### Important\n\n【129】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【130】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【131】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using mometasone.\n\n【132】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【133】No. This medicine is not affected by what you eat or drink.\n\n【134】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【135】There’s no clear evidence that mometasone affects male or female fertility.\n\n【136】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you are trying to get pregnant.\n\n【137】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【138】Mometasone does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【139】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【140】Mometasone does not make you sleepy, so it’s safe to drive or ride a bike (or use tools or machinery) when using this medicine.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【141】*   Atopic eczema\n*   Psoriasis\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【142】*   HealthUnlocked: mometasone forum\n*   British Skin Foundation: charity\n*   National Eczema Society: charity\n*   Psoriasis Association: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 October 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 October 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:28", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:41:05", "cost": 37.145}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:28"}

There are things you can do to help your child cope with them:\n\n【5】Constipation\n\n【6】Give your child plenty of high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals. Get them to drink several glasses of water or other liquids each day.\n\n【7】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【8】Give co-codamol with or just after a meal or snack. Stick to simple meals and do not give them rich or spicy food.\n\n【9】If they're being sick, give them small frequent sips of water to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【10】Feelings of sickness should normally wear off after a few days. Talk to your doctor about giving your child an anti-sickness medicine if it carries on for longer.\n\n【11】Feeling sleepy\n\n【12】This side effect should wear off as your child gets used to co-codamol. Talk to their doctor if it carries on.\n\n【13】Headaches\n\n【14】Make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids. Talk to their doctor if the headaches are severe.\n\n【15】Speak to a doctor or pharmacist if the advice on how to cope does not help and a side effect is still bothering your child or does not go away.\n\n【16】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【17】Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 100 children.\n\n【18】Call a doctor or call 111 straight away if your child has:\n\n【19】*   a skin rash\n*   difficulty peeing\n*   changes in their eyesight\n*   dizziness\n\n【20】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【21】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to co-codamol.\n\n【22】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【23】*   your child's lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   they're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (they may become very wheezy or seem like they're choking or gasping for air)\n*   their throat feels tight or they're struggling to swallow\n*   their skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if they have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of their hands or soles of their feet)\n*   they suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   they faint and cannot be woken up\n*   they're limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【24】Your child may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【25】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【26】Long-term side effects\n----------------------\n\n【27】If you've bought co-codamol from a pharmacy, do not give it to your child for more than 3 days. If your child's pain has not gone away, talk to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【28】If your child needs to take co-codamol for a long time, their body can become tolerant to the codeine in it. That means they need higher doses to control their pain over time.\n\n【29】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your child's doctor will reduce the dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【30】It is possible to become addicted to the codeine in co-codamol. For this reason, your child's dose will be reviewed to make sure they're only taking the amount they need to control their pain.\n\n【31】Your child's treatment plan may include details of how and when they will stop taking co-codamol.\n\n【32】If they're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, their pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【33】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【34】These are not all the side effects of co-codamol.

There are often no signs or symptoms of lung cancer at an early stage.\n\n【4】The targeted Lung Health Check programme aims to find lung cancer early, sometimes before you have symptoms.\n\n【5】Lung health checks look at how well your lungs are working and can help diagnose lung cancer as early as possible. Early diagnosis can make lung cancer more treatable and make treatment more successful.\n\n【6】Who is eligible for a lung health check\n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】The Government has announced that the NHS will roll out targeted lung screening across England. Currently, lung health checks are only available in some parts of England. They will be available everywhere by 2029.\n\n【8】If you're eligible, you'll get a letter or phone call from your GP or a local NHS service inviting you to an appointment.\n\n【9】You may be invited if all the following apply to you:\n\n【10】*   you live in an area where lung health checks are currently offered\n*   you're aged between 55 and 74\n*   you're registered with a GP surgery\n*   you're a current or former smoker\n\n【11】### Check if lung health checks are available in your area\n\n【12】You can look for lung health checks in your area by visiting the websites below:\n\n【13】East of England\n\n【14】*   East of England\n\n【15】London\n\n【16】*   North Central London\n*   North East London\n*   South East London\n*   West London\n\n【17】North East and Yorkshire\n\n【18】*   Humber and North Yorkshire\n*   Northern Cancer Alliance (North East and North Cumbria)\n*   South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw\n*   West Yorkshire and Harrogate\n\n【19】North West\n\n【20】*   Cheshire and Merseyside\n*   Greater Manchester\n*   Lancashire and South Cumbria\n\n【21】Midlands\n\n【22】*   East Midlands\n*   West Midlands\n\n【23】South East\n\n【24】*   Kent and Medway\n*   Surrey and Sussex\n\n【25】South West\n\n【26】*   Peninsula (Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly)\n*   Somerset, Wiltshire, Avon and Gloucestershire (SWAG)\n*   Wessex (Southampton, Portsmouth and Portland)\n\n【27】What happens at a lung health check\n-----------------------------------\n\n【28】Your appointment may be in person, by phone, or online.\n\n【29】A health professional will ask about your health and lifestyle to find out more about your risk of lung cancer.\n\n【30】This includes questions about your breathing, lifestyle, and family and medical history. They will also take your height and weight measurements.\n\n【31】### What happens after your lung health check\n\n【32】At the end of the lung health check, 1 of the following things will happen:\n\n【33】*   No further action – if the lung health check suggests you are not at higher risk of developing lung cancer, then no further action is needed.\n*   Referral to your GP – if the lung health check finds problems with your breathing or lung health, you may be referred to your GP for a follow-up appointment to discuss this in more detail.\n*   Offered a CT scan of your lungs – if the lung health check finds you're at a higher risk of developing lung cancer, you may be invited for a CT scan to take a detailed picture of your lungs. This might be on the same day, or you may be invited to another appointment. The lung health check team will write to your GP with details of your appointment.\n\n【34】Information:\n\n【35】If you are a current smoker, you will be offered advice on how to stop smoking.\n\n【36】Having a CT scan\n----------------\n\n【37】If you're invited for a CT scan, it may be done in:\n\n【38】*   a mobile scanning unit in your local community – these can be in lots of different locations, such as in a supermarket car park\n*   your local hospital\n\n【39】Your appointment will last about 30 minutes. The CT scan itself will only take a few minutes and does not hurt.\n\n【40】### Getting your CT scan results\n\n【41】You will receive a letter with your results within 4 weeks of the CT scan. This will tell you what happens next.\n\n【42】If the scan shows anything concerning, you may be referred for further lung scans or treatment.\n\n【43】If you have not been invited for a lung health check\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The lung health check service is being rolled out across England. They are starting in areas with higher lung cancer rates and new locations are being added regularly.\n\n【45】If you have not been invited for a lung health check but think you should have been, you can contact your local area through the websites above to see if you can be referred.\n\n【46】They may not be available in your area currently. If a service becomes available in your local area, you will receive an invitation.\n\n【47】Information:\n\n【48】If you're not sure the GP knows that you currently smoke, or have smoked in the past, contact the GP surgery and ask them to update your record. This will make sure you are invited for a lung health check in the future.\n\n【49】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【50】You're worried about symptoms of lung cancer, such as:\n\n【51】*   a cough that does not go away after 3 weeks\n*   an existing cough that changes or gets worse\n*   chest infections that keep coming back\n*   coughing up blood\n*   being short of breath a lot\n*   unexplained tiredness\n*   an ache or pain when breathing or coughing\n*   loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss\n\n【52】Do not wait for a lung health check if you have any of these symptoms.\n删除11：<u>More information and advice\n---------------------------\n\n【53】*   Cancer Research UK: lung health checks\n*   Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: lung health checks\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 March 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:41:08", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:41:19", "cost": 11.611}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:07"}

Ask your doctors about the chances of treatment being successful for you.\n\n【10】Types of chemotherapy\n---------------------\n\n【11】Chemotherapy can be given in several ways. Your doctors will recommend the best type for you.\n\n【12】The most common types are:\n\n【13】*   chemotherapy given into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy) – this is usually done in hospital and involves medicine being given through a tube in a vein in your hand, arm or chest\n*   chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy) – this usually involves taking a course of medicine at home, with regular check-ups in hospital\n\n【14】You may be treated with one type of chemotherapy medicine or a combination of different types.\n\n【15】You'll usually have several treatment sessions, which will typically be spread over the course of a few months.\n\n【16】Side effects of chemotherapy\n----------------------------\n\n【17】As well as killing cancer cells, chemotherapy can damage some healthy cells in your body, such as blood cells, skin cells and cells in the stomach.\n\n【18】This can cause a range of unpleasant side effects, such as:\n\n【19】*   feeling tired most of the time\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   hair loss\n*   an increased risk of getting infections\n*   a sore mouth\n*   dry, sore or itchy skin\n*   diarrhoea or constipation\n\n【20】Many of these side effects can be treated or prevented and most, if not all, will pass after treatment stops.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : What happens</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:41:45", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:42:20", "cost": 35.271}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:42:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:45"}

Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Genetic testing</u>\n\n【2】**In most cases, muscular dystrophy (MD) runs in families. It usually develops after inheriting a faulty gene from one or both parents.**\n\n【3】MD is caused by mutations (alterations) in the genes responsible for healthy muscle structure and function. The mutations mean that the cells that should maintain your muscles can no longer fulfil this role, leading to muscle weakness and progressive disability.\n\n【4】Inheriting muscular dystrophy\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】You have two copies of every gene (with the exception of the sex chromosomes). You inherit a copy from one parent, and the other copy from the other parent. If one or both of your parents has a mutated gene that causes MD, it can be passed on to you.\n\n【6】Depending on the specific type of MD, the condition can be a:\n\n【7】*   recessive inherited disorder\n*   dominant inherited disorder\n*   sex-linked (X-linked) disorder\n\n【8】In a few cases, the genetic mutation that causes MD can also develop as a new event in the family. This is known as a spontaneous mutation.\n\n【9】### A recessive inherited disorder\n\n【10】If you have a recessive inherited disorder, it means you've inherited an altered version of the gene that causes the condition from both of your parents (both your copies of the gene are altered).\n\n【11】If a child only inherits an altered version of the gene from one parent, they'll become a carrier of the condition. This means they're not affected, but there's a chance that any children they have will be if their partner is also a carrier.\n\n【12】If both parents carry an altered version of the gene that causes the condition, there's a:\n\n【13】*   1 in 4 chance their child will have MD\n*   1 in 4 chance their child will be healthy but carry the mother's faulty gene\n*   1 in 4 chance their child will be healthy but carry the father's faulty gene\n*   1 in 4 chance their child will be healthy (won't inherit any mutated genes)\n\n【14】Some types of limb-girdle MD are inherited in this way.\n\n【15】#### A dominant inherited disorder\n\n【16】A dominant inherited disorder means you only need to inherit the mutated gene from one parent to be affected.\n\n【17】This means that if you have a child with an unaffected partner, there's still a 50% chance of your child developing the condition.\n\n【18】Types of MD inherited in this way include myotonic dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral MD, oculopharyngeal MD and some types of limb-girdle MD.\n\n【19】#### A sex-linked (X-linked) disorder\n\n【20】Chromosomes are long, threadlike structures of DNA. A male has one X and one Y sex chromosome, and a female has two X chromosomes.\n\n【21】A sex-linked disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. As males only have one copy of each gene on the X chromosome, they'll be affected if one of those genes is mutated.\n\n【22】As females have two copies of the X chromosome, they're less likely to develop an X-linked condition, because the normal copy of the chromosome can usually cover for (mask) the altered version. \n\n【23】Females can still be affected by X-linked disorders, but the condition is usually less severe than when the gene alteration is present in an affected male.\n\n【24】Types of MD inherited in this way include Duchenne MD and Becker MD, which is why these conditions are more common and more severe in males.\n\n【25】#### Spontaneous gene mutations\n\n【26】Spontaneous gene mutations can occasionally cause MD. This is where the genes mutate for no apparent reason, changing the way the cells function. Spontaneous gene mutations can cause MD to develop in people who don't have a family history of the condition.\n\n【27】Another way a child with no family history can be affected is when the condition is recessive. The gene mutations may have been present on both sides of the family for many generations but may not have affected anyone until a child inherited a copy of the altered gene from both parents.\n\n【28】Genes and chromosomes\n---------------------\n\n【29】Genes are units of DNA that determine many of your body's characteristics, such as the colour of your hair and eyes.\n\n【30】Genes are found on strands called chromosomes. Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents.\n\n【31】One chromosome from each pair is inherited from the mother and one from the father.\n删除7：<u>Read more about genetics.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Types</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:49:53", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:50:09", "cost": 16.683}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:50:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:49:51"}

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Treatment for a brain abscess usually involves a combination of medicines and surgery, depending on the size and number of brain abscesses.**\n\n【3】A brain abscess is a medical emergency, so you'll need treatment in hospital until your condition is stable.\n\n【4】Treatment with medicines often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【5】Medicines\n---------\n\n【6】In some cases, it may be possible to treat an abscess with medicine alone, or surgery may be too risky.\n\n【7】Medicines are recommended over surgery if you have:\n\n【8】*   several abscesses\n*   a small abscess (less than 2.5cm)\n*   an abscess deep inside the brain\n*   meningitis (an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain) as well as an abscess\n*   hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain)\n\n【9】You'll normally be given antibiotics or antifungal medicine through a drip, directly into a vein. Doctors will aim to treat the abscess and the original infection that caused it.\n\n【10】Surgery\n-------\n\n【11】If the abscess is larger than 2.5cm, it's usually necessary to drain the pus out of the abscess. However, you'll still need a course of antibiotics after surgery.\n\n【12】There are 2 surgical techniques for treating a brain abscess:\n\n【13】*   simple aspiration\n*   craniotomy\n\n【14】Simple aspiration involves using a CT scan to locate the abscess and then drilling a small hole known as a \"burr hole\" into the skull. The pus is drained and the hole sealed.\n\n【15】A simple aspiration takes around an hour to complete.\n\n【16】Open aspiration and excisions are usually carried out using a surgical procedure known as a craniotomy.\n\n【17】### Craniotomy\n\n【18】A craniotomy may be recommended if an abscess does not respond to aspiration or reoccurs at a later date.\n\n【19】During a craniotomy, the surgeon shaves a small section of your hair and removes a small piece of your skull bone (a bone flap) to gain access to your brain.\n\n【20】The abscess is then drained of pus or totally removed. CT guidance may be used during the operation, to allow the surgeon to more accurately locate the exact position of the abscess.\n\n【21】Once the abscess has been treated, the bone is replaced. The operation usually takes around 3 hours, which includes recovery from general anaesthetic, where you're put to sleep.\n\n【22】#### Complications of a craniotomy\n\n【23】As with all surgery, a craniotomy carries risks, but serious complications are uncommon.\n\n【24】Possible complications of a craniotomy may include: \n\n【25】*   swelling and bruising around your face – which is common after a craniotomy and should lessen after the operation\n*   headaches – these are common after a craniotomy and may last several months, but should eventually settle down\n*   a blood clot in the brain – further surgery may be required to remove it\n*   stiff jaw – the surgeon may need to make a small cut to a muscle that helps with chewing, which will heal but can become stiff for a few months; exercising the muscle by regularly chewing sugar-free gum should help relieve the stiffness\n*   movement of the bone flap – the bone flap in your skull may feel like it moves and you may experience a clicking sensation; this can feel strange, but it is not dangerous and will stop as the skull heals\n\n【26】The site of the cut (incision) in your skull can become infected, although this is uncommon. You're usually given antibiotics around the time of your operation to prevent infection.\n\n【27】Recovering from surgery\n-----------------------\n\n【28】Once your brain abscess has been treated, you'll probably stay in hospital for several weeks so your body can be supported while you recover.\n\n【29】You'll also receive a number of CT scans, to make sure the brain abscess has been completely removed.\n\n【30】Most people need a further 6 to 12 weeks rest at home before they're fit enough to return to work or full-time education.\n\n【31】After treatment for a brain abscess, avoid any contact sport where there's a risk of injury to the skull, such as boxing, rugby or football.\n\n【32】### Advice for drivers\n\n【33】If you've had brain surgery and you hold a driving licence, you're legally required to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\n【34】It's likely that the DVLA will suspend your driving licence due to your increased risk of having a seizure. Your licence will only be returned once your GP or surgeon confirms it's safe for you to drive.\n\n【35】For most people, this is likely to be 12 months after surgery without having any seizures during this time.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:28:58", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:29:20", "cost": 22.283}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:29:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:28:57"}

For example, if you have a sore back or period pain, you may only need to take naproxen for 1 or 2 days.\n\n【23】You may need to take it for longer if you have a long-term condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【24】If you need to take naproxen longer than that, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to protect your stomach from side effects.\n\n【25】It's best to take the lowest dose of naproxen for the shortest time to control your symptoms.\n\n【26】Talk to your doctor if you're unsure how long you need to take naproxen for.\n\n【27】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【28】Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【29】Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【30】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask a pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【31】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【32】If you take more than your prescribed dose of naproxen tablets, you're more likely to get some of the common side effects.

Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Living with\n4.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**The main risk of using a urinary catheter is that it can sometimes allow bacteria to enter your body.**\n\n【3】This can cause an infection in the urethra, bladder or, less commonly, in the kidneys. These types of infection are known as urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\n【4】Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n-------------------------------\n\n【5】UTIs caused by using a catheter are one of the most common types of infection that affect people staying in hospital. This risk is particularly high if your catheter is left in place continuously (an indwelling catheter).\n\n【6】Symptoms of a UTI associated with using a catheter include:\n\n【7】*   pain low down in your tummy or around your groin\n*   a high temperature\n*   feeling cold and shivery\n*   confusion\n\n【8】Contact your GP or community nurse if you think you have a UTI. You may need a course of antibiotics.\n\n【9】Other risks and side effects\n----------------------------\n\n【10】Bladder spasms, which feel like stomach cramps, are quite common when you have a catheter in your bladder. The pain is caused by the bladder trying to squeeze out the balloon. You may need medicine to reduce the frequency and intensity of the spasms.\n\n【11】Leakage around the catheter is another problem associated with indwelling catheters. This can happen as a result of bladder spasms or when you poo. Leakage can also be a sign that the catheter is blocked, so it's essential to check that it's draining.\n\n【12】Blood or debris in the catheter tube is also common with an indwelling catheter. This could become a problem if the catheter drainage system becomes blocked.\n\n【13】Get medical advice as soon as possible if you think your catheter may be blocked, or if you're passing large pieces of debris or blood clots.\n\n【14】Other (less common) potential problems include:\n\n【15】*   injury to the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) when the catheter is inserted\n*   narrowing of the urethra because of scar tissue caused by repeated catheter use\n*   injury to the bladder caused by incorrectly inserting the catheter\n*   bladder stones (although these usually only develop after years of using a catheter)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:12:40", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:13:22", "cost": 41.699}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:13:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:12:38"}

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**There's no simple cure for discoid eczema, but medicines can help to ease the symptoms.**\n\n【3】Treatments include:\n\n【4】*   emollients – to use all the time\n*   soap substitutes – to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products\n*   topical corticosteroids – for flare-ups\n*   antibiotics – for infected eczema\n*   antihistamines – for severe itching\n\n【5】There are many different preparations for each type of medicine and it's worth taking time with a pharmacist or GP to find the best one for you.\n\n【6】A range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription.\n\n【7】Ask a pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See a GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter product.\n\n【8】Self-help tips\n--------------\n\n【9】There are also some things you can do yourself that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as:\n\n【10】*   avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes – even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; use an emollient soap substitute instead\n*   protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves), as cuts may trigger discoid eczema\n*   taking daily lukewarm baths or showers – using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply skin treatments soon afterwards\n*   not scratching the patches of eczema – keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching\n*   making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by a GP or pharmacist\n\n【11】See a GP if you think your skin is infected. For example, if there's excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema.\n\n【12】Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.\n\n【13】Emollients\n----------\n\n【14】Emollients are moisturising treatments you apply directly to your skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They're often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.\n\n【15】### Choice of emollient\n\n【16】Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find 1 that works for you. You may also be advised to use a combination of emollients, such as:\n\n【17】*   an ointment for very dry skin\n*   a cream or lotion for less dry skin\n*   an emollient instead of soap\n*   1 emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different 1 to use on your body\n\n【18】The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\n\n【19】Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for swollen (inflamed) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed.\n\n【20】If you've been using a particular emollient for some time, it may become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, a GP will be able to prescribe a different product.\n\n【21】### How to use emollients\n\n【22】Use your emollient all the time, even if you're not experiencing symptoms, as it can help prevent the return of discoid eczema. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school.\n\n【23】To apply the emollient:\n\n【24】*   use a large amount\n*   do not rub it in – smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows\n*   for very dry skin, apply the emollient every 2 to 3 hours, or more often if necessary\n*   after a bath or shower, gently dry your skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist\n\n【25】If you're exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work.\n\n【26】Do not share emollients with other people.\n\n【27】### Side effects\n\n【28】Occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients.\n\n【29】If your skin reacts to an emollient, stop using it and speak to a GP or pharmacist who can recommend an alternative product.\n\n【30】Be aware that some emollients can be a fire hazard, so should not be used near a naked flame.\n\n【31】Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.\n\n【32】Topical corticosteroids\n-----------------------\n\n【33】To treat the patches of discoid eczema, a GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid, which you apply directly to your skin, to reduce inflammation.\n\n【34】### Choice of topical corticosteroid\n\n【35】There are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of the eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema.\n\n【36】You might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as your face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups.\n\n【37】### How to use topical corticosteroids\n\n【38】When using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by a doctor, follow the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine.\n\n【39】Do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people only have to apply it once a day.\n\n【40】To apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps:\n\n【41】1.  Apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes, until the emollient has soaked into your skin, before applying the topical corticosteroid.\n2.  Apply enough of the topical corticosteroid to cover the affected area, but try to use the smallest amount possible to control your symptoms.\n3.  Use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared, unless otherwise advised by a GP.\n\n【42】Speak to your prescriber if you've been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.\n\n【43】### Side effects\n\n【44】Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause:\n\n【45】*   thinning of the skin\n*   changes in skin colour\n*   spots (acne)\n*   increased hair growth\n\n【46】Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.\n\n【47】Generally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount, will increase your risk of getting side effects. You should use the weakest strength and the smallest amount possible to control your symptoms and never use more than the amount recommended by your doctor.\n\n【48】Sometimes people may also develop skin symptoms after they stop using a steroid cream, such as intense redness and swelling of the skin. If this happens to you then call 111 for advice immediately or visit 111 online.\n\n【49】Antibiotics\n-----------\n\n【50】If your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic.\n\n【51】### Oral antibiotics\n\n【52】If you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for 1 week.\n\n【53】If you're allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin.\n\n【54】### Topical antibiotics\n\n【55】If you have a small amount of infected eczema, you'll usually be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. These medicines come as a cream or ointment you apply directly to the affected area of skin.\n\n【56】Some topical antibiotics also contain topical corticosteroids.\n\n【57】Topical antibiotics should usually be used for up to 2 weeks as necessary.\n\n【58】Antihistamines\n--------------\n\n【59】Antihistamines are a type of medicine that stop the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching.\n\n【60】Antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it's interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin.\n\n【61】Many older types of antihistamines can make you feel sleepy (drowsy), which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask a pharmacist or GP to recommend a \"non-sedating\" antihistamine.\n\n【62】Complementary therapies\n-----------------------\n\n【63】Some people may find complementary therapies, such as herbal remedies, helpful in treating eczema, but there's little evidence to show these remedies are effective.\n\n【64】If you're thinking about using a complementary therapy, speak to a GP first to ensure the therapy is safe for you to use. Make sure you continue to use other treatments a GP has prescribed.\n\n【65】Further treatments\n------------------\n\n【66】If the treatments prescribed by a GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist).\n\n【67】Further treatments that may be available from a dermatologist include:\n\n【68】*   phototherapy – where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation\n*   bandaging – where medicated dressings are applied to your skin\n*   immunosuppressant therapy – medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Discoid eczema</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:16:02", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:16:40", "cost": 37.655}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:16:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:16:01"}

This will depend on your nationality and status and you should ask your Swiss healthcare provider about eligibility.\n\n【5】Your EHIC will cover you for treatment that becomes medically necessary during a visit to England, until you return to your country. It also covers you for the treatment of pre-existing medical conditions and for routine maternity care, providing the reason for your visit is not specifically to give birth or receive treatment.\n\n【6】Bear in mind that the healthcare system in England may be different from that in your home country. The EHIC might not cover everything you would expect to get for free back home.\n\n【7】The EHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It will not cover any private medical healthcare, being flown back home, or lost or stolen property. Therefore, it is important to have both an EHIC and a valid private travel insurance policy.\n\n【8】If your EHIC has been lost or stolen during your visit in England and you need a replacement, then you'll have to contact the relevant organisation in your home country to request a Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC).\n\n【9】If you do not have an EHIC and cannot obtain a PRC, you may have to pay for treatment.\n\n【10】Visitors from Norway can access medically necessary healthcare using a valid Norwegian passport.\n\n【11】### Visitors from Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein\n\n【12】If you're a resident of Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein and your visit began before, but ends after, 31 December 2020, you can continue to use your EHIC to access healthcare until the end of your visit to the UK.\n\n【13】From 1 January 2021, most visitors from Iceland and Liechtenstein may need to pay for NHS healthcare. Any treatment that you have to pay for will be charged at 150% of the national NHS rate.\n\n【14】If you're a UK national who moved to the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland before 31 December 2020, you can continue to use your EHIC or a PRC in the UK.\n\n【15】Getting planned treatment in England\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Planned treatment under the S2 route is only available to visitors from EU countries and Switzerland.\n\n【17】You'll need to make all the necessary arrangements yourself in advance. Planned treatment is not covered by the EHIC. If you do not have valid documentation, you'll be charged for treatment. You'll need to arrange an S2 form from the relevant organisation in your home country before you travel to England.\n\n【18】The S2 only relates to state-provided treatment and you will not be required to pay anything yourself, except any mandatory patient contributions that patients in England would have to pay, such as prescription costs.\n\n【19】If you're a resident of Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein and you requested authorisation from the relevant health authority in your home country for planned treatment in the UK on or before 31 December 2020, you may complete that treatment, even if takes place at a later date.\n\n【20】### The EU Directive route\n\n【21】The EU Directive route ceased to apply in the UK on 31 December 2020.\n\n【22】UK nationals and others whose healthcare in the EU is paid for by the UK\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】If you're a UK national living outside the UK, you should not expect to be able to use NHS services for free when visiting the UK. You should take out appropriate travel insurance when visiting the UK, as you would when visiting any other country.\n\n【24】If you were living in an EU country, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland on or before 31 December 2020 and the UK government pays for your healthcare through S1 arrangements, you'll be able to use NHS services in England without charge when visiting the UK. People who have their healthcare paid for by the UK include those who get a UK State Pension or some other UK benefits, and posted workers, who are people working abroad for UK companies or organisations.\n\n【25】If you're a UK national and you move to an EU country or Switzerland, you can only use NHS services for free if you have an EHIC, PRC or S2 to show your healthcare costs are funded by the country where you now live, or another exemption applies.\n\n【26】If you move to Iceland or Liechtenstein, you may have to pay for any treatment that you need when visiting the UK. Any treatment that you have to pay for will be charged at 150% of the national NHS rate.\n\n【27】You should check before visiting the UK whether your family members are also eligible for free healthcare in England. If you're a family member of a frontier worker you can receive NHS treatment for free if it becomes medically necessary during a temporary visit to England. However, you need to be able to present a copy of your S1 form.\n\n【28】If you return to the UK permanently and you're ordinarily resident, you'll be able to access NHS care without charge.\n\n【29】If you need to access NHS treatment while you're visiting England, you'll need to follow the same processes as people living in England. For example, most hospitals require a GP referral, issued by a GP in England, before you can have hospital treatment.\n\n【30】You may also need to show a copy of your S1 or A1 certificate or ask the healthcare provider to contact Overseas Healthcare Services to verify the status of your S1 or A1 certificate. You may also be able to apply for an S2 certificate for the treatment from the relevant organisation in your country of residence. This can then be accepted for the treatment instead of proof of a registered S1 certificate. For more information on this process, contact the NHS provider directly to check what their referral requirements are.\n\n【31】You can also make an appointment with a GP as you would if you were living in England. GPs can agree to register you as a temporary patient as long as you are in the area for more than 24 hours but less than 3 months.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about accessing NHS services in England</u>\n\n【32】You'll need to pay for some types of NHS care in the same way as people who live in England, for example, paying for prescriptions or dental treatment.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about paying NHS charges</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Visiting or moving to England\n-------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   How to access NHS services in England if you are visiting from abroad\n*   Visitors from EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland\n*   Visitors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA)\n*   Visitors who do not need to pay for NHS treatment\n*   Moving to England from EU countries or Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland\n*   Moving to England from outside the European Economic Area (EEA)\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:01", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:14", "cost": 13.31}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:01"}

Try to avoid close contact with people who you know are unwell.\n*   Hydroxychloroquine can affect your eyes. You will need to have your eyes examined every year if you have taken it for more than 5 years.

Your dose may gradually go up to 225mg a day if your specialist recommends it. The maximum dose for depression is 225mg a day\n*   pain relief or preventing migraines – 75mg a day taken in the evening. Your dose may start at 25mg a day and gradually go up to 75mg a day. The maximum dose for pain or migraine is 150mg a day\n\n【5】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【6】You'll usually take dosulepin once a day before bedtime. This is because it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【7】If you're still feeling drowsy the next day, try taking it earlier in the evening.\n\n【8】Sometimes, if you're just starting treatment, your doctor may tell you to take a lower dose, 2 or 3 times a day until you get used to the medicine. This will reduce the chance of side effects.\n\n【9】Dosulepin does not usually upset your stomach, so you can take it with or without food.\n\n【10】Swallow the tablet or capsule whole with a drink of water. It will taste bitter, so do not chew it.\n\n【11】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【12】### For depression\n\n【13】Once you're feeling better, it's likely that you'll continue to take dosulepin for several more months.\n\n【14】Most doctors recommend that you take antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after you have stopped feeling depressed. Stopping before then can make your depression come back.\n\n【15】But dosulepin is no longer recommended instead of other antidepressants, so talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking it. They may suggest taking another antidepressant.\n\n【16】Whether you change to another antidepressant or stay on dosulepin will depend on:\n\n【17】*   how severe your symptoms are\n*   how often your symptoms happen\n*   how well dosulepin works for you\n*   whether you have had any severe side effects\n\n【18】### For pain or preventing migraines\n\n【19】Some people take dosulepin for many months, or even for years. But dosulepin is no longer recommended instead of other antidepressants used to treat pain, such as amitriptyline.\n\n【20】Talk to your doctor about staying on dosulepin or switching to another medicine to treat or prevent pain.\n\n【21】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【22】If you take dosulepin once a day and forget a dose, take your next dose the next day at the usual time.\n\n【23】If you take dosulepin 2 or 3 times a day and forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【24】Never take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【25】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【26】Stopping dosulepin\n------------------\n\n【27】Do not stop taking dosulepin without talking to your doctor. You may get withdrawal symptoms, especially if you stop taking it suddenly. These side effects are a reaction to coming off the medicine.\n\n【28】The side effects are usually harmless but unpleasant. They may include headaches, flu-like symptoms, feeling sick, finding it hard to sleep, and feeling restless or anxious.\n\n【29】If you and your doctor agree that you should stop taking dosulepin, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks.\n\n【30】If you're switching to another medicine, your doctor will explain how to introduce it slowly.\n\n【31】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【32】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【33】*   you take more than your prescribed dose of dosulepin – even if you do not have any symptoms\n\n【34】You can get serious side effects within a few hours and may need urgent hospital treatment.\n\n【35】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n删除11：<u>More in Dosulepin\n-----------------\n\n【36】*   About dosulepin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking dosulepin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:45:55", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:11", "cost": 16.028}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:54", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:45:54"}

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed.**\n\n【3】The colon is the large intestine (bowel) and the rectum is the end of the bowel where poo is stored.\n\n【4】Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus.\n\n【5】Symptoms of ulcerative colitis\n------------------------------\n\n【6】The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are:\n\n【7】*   recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus\n*   tummy pain\n*   needing to poo frequently\n\n【8】You may also experience extreme tiredness (fatigue), loss of appetite and weight loss.\n\n【9】The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is.\n\n【10】For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives.\n\n【11】### Symptoms of a flare-up\n\n【12】Some people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all (remission), followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome (flare-ups or relapses).\n\n【13】During a flare-up, some people with ulcerative colitis also experience symptoms elsewhere in their body; which are known as extra-intestinal symptoms.\n\n【14】These can include:\n\n【15】*   painful and swollen joints (arthritis)\n*   mouth ulcers\n*   swollen fat under the skin causing bumps and patches – this is known as erythema nodosum\n*   irritated and red eyes\n*   problems with bones, such as osteoporosis\n\n【16】In many people, no specific trigger for flare-ups is identified, although a gut infection can occasionally be the cause.\n\n【17】Stress is also thought to be a potential factor.\n\n【18】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【19】You should see a GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of ulcerative colitis and you have not been diagnosed with the condition.\n\n【20】They can arrange blood or poo sample tests to help determine what may be causing your symptoms.\n\n【21】If necessary, they can refer you to hospital for further tests.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about diagnosing ulcerative colitis</u>\n\n【22】If you have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and think you may be having a severe flare-up, contact a GP or your care team for advice.\n\n【23】You may need to be urgently admitted to hospital for immediate care.\n\n【24】If you cannot contact your GP or care team, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service.\n\n【25】What causes ulcerative colitis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】Ulcerative colitis is thought to be an autoimmune condition.\n\n【27】This means the immune system, the body's defence against infection, goes wrong and attacks healthy tissue.\n\n【28】The most popular theory is that the immune system mistakes harmless bacteria inside the colon as a threat and attacks the tissues of the colon, causing it to become inflamed.\n\n【29】Exactly what causes the immune system to behave in this way is unclear.\n\n【30】Many experts think it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n【31】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【32】The UK Crohn's & Colitis UK charity reports at least 1 in every 227 people in the UK has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. This amounts to around 296,000 people.\n\n【33】The condition can develop at any age, but is most often diagnosed in people between 15 and 25 years old.\n\n【34】It's more common in white people of European descent, especially those descended from Ashkenazi Jewish communities, and black people.\n\n【35】The condition is rarer in people from Asian backgrounds, although the reasons for this are unclear.\n\n【36】Both men and women seem to be equally affected by ulcerative colitis.\n\n【37】How ulcerative colitis is treated\n---------------------------------\n\n【38】Treatment for ulcerative colitis aims to relieve symptoms during a flare-up and prevent symptoms from returning (maintaining remission).\n\n【39】In most people, this is achieved by taking medicine, such as:\n\n【40】*   aminosalicylates (ASAs)\n*   corticosteroids (steroid medicines)\n*   immunosuppressants\n\n【41】Mild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. But more severe flare-ups need to be treated in hospital.\n\n【42】If medicines are not effective at controlling your symptoms or your quality of life is significantly affected by your condition, surgery to remove some or all of your bowel (colon) may be an option.\n\n【43】During surgery, your small intestine can be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen known as a stoma. This type of surgery is known as an ileostomy.\n\n【44】In some cases, the stoma is only temporary and can be closed up once your bowel has healed.\n\n【45】An alternative option is to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus called an ileoanal pouch.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating ulcerative colitis</u>\n\n【46】Complications of ulcerative colitis\n-----------------------------------\n\n【47】Complications of ulcerative colitis include:\n\n【48】*   an increased risk of developing bowel cancer\n*   poor growth and development in children and young people\n\n【49】Also, the steroid medicines used to treat ulcerative colitis can cause weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) as a side effect.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the complications of ulcerative colitis</u>\n\n【50】### IBD or IBS?\n\n【51】Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term mainly used to describe 2 conditions that cause inflammation of the gut (gastrointestinal tract).\n\n【52】They are:\n\n【53】*   ulcerative colitis\n*   Crohn's disease\n\n【54】IBD should not be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a different condition and requires different treatment.\n\n【55】Information:\n\n【56】### Social care and support guide\n\n【57】If you:\n\n【58】*   need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n*   care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled (including family members)\n\n【59】Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 01 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 01 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:28:50", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:30:51", "cost": 121.708}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:30:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:28:49"}

Most infections can be cured.**\n\n【2】A sexual health clinic (SHC) or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic specialises in sexual health, and can provide tests and treatment for many STIs.\n\n【3】Visiting a sexual health clinic\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】You can make an appointment to go to a sexual health clinic.\n\n【5】Some sexual health clinics also offer a drop-in clinic, so you may not need an appointment. But it is a good idea to call the sexual health clinic first to check this is the case.\n\n【6】You might feel embarrassed, but there's no need – the staff at these clinics are used to testing for all kinds of infections. It's their job and they won't judge you. They should do their best to explain everything to you and make you feel at ease.\n\n【7】Anyone can go to a sexual health clinic regardless of their gender, age or whether they have symptoms. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents.\n\n【8】If they suspect you or another young person is at risk of harm, they might need to tell other healthcare services, but they will talk to you before they do this.\n\n【9】Find a sexual health clinic.\n\n【10】Your name and details\n---------------------\n\n【11】When you go to a sexual health clinic, you'll be asked for your name and some contact details.\n\n【12】You don't have to give your real name if you don't want to. If you do, it will be kept confidential. Your GP won't be told about your visit without your permission.\n\n【13】If you have tests and the results aren't available during your visit, the clinic will need to contact you later, so give them the correct contact details.\n\n【14】The clinic will ask how you want to receive your results. They can usually be given to you over the phone, by text, or in an unmarked letter.\n\n【15】Answering some questions\n------------------------\n\n【16】You will see a doctor or a nurse, who will ask you about your medical and sexual history.\n\n【17】Be prepared to answer questions about your sex life, including:\n\n【18】*   when you last had sex\n*   whether you've had unprotected sex\n*   whether you have any symptoms\n*   why you think you might have an infection\n\n【19】You can ask to see a female or male doctor or nurse if you prefer, but you might have to wait longer than usual for one to become available.\n\n【20】Having STI tests\n----------------\n\n【21】The doctor or nurse will tell you what tests they think you need. They should explain what is going on and why they are suggesting these tests. If you're not sure about anything, ask them to explain.\n\n【22】Let them know if you if you'd like a woman or a man to do the test or if you'd like someone else to be in the room with you (a chaperone).

Testing for HIV requires a blood sample. Testing for syphilis needs a blood sample and you may also have a swab taken if you have any ulcers.\n\n【25】Tests for herpes aren't usually done unless you have sores on your genitals or anus. In this case, a swab will be taken from a sore. This will be uncomfortable for a moment.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about:</u>\n\n【26】*   chlamydia testing\n*   herpes testing\n*   syphilis testing\n*   gonorrhoea testing\n*   HIV testing\n\n【27】Getting your test results\n-------------------------\n\n【28】With some tests, you can get the results – and treatment, if you need it – on the same day. For others, you might have to wait for a week or 2. If this is the case, the clinic will check how you would prefer to receive your results.\n\n【29】If you test positive for an STI, you will be asked to go back to the clinic to talk about your results and the treatment you need.\n\n【30】Many STIs can be cured with antibiotics. Some infections, such as HIV, have no cure, but there are treatments available. The clinic can advise you on these and put you in touch with a counsellor.\n\n【31】If possible, tell your sexual partner and any ex-partners so they can get tested and treated as well.\n\n【32】If you don't want to do this, the clinic can usually do it for you – it's called partner notification and the clinic won't reveal who you are.\n\n【33】Using condoms to protect against STIs\n-------------------------------------\n\n【34】The best way to protect yourself from getting or passing on an infection is to use a condom every time you have sex. The clinic can give you some condoms so you can practise safer sex.\n\n【35】Always buy condoms that have the CE mark or BSI kite mark on the packet. This means they've been tested to high safety standards.\n\n【36】Condoms that don't have the CE mark or BSI kite mark won't meet these standards, so don't use them. Get tips on using condoms properly.\n\n【37】Bear in mind that having had an STI once doesn't make you immune to it – you can get the same infection again.\n\n【38】Other places to go for help\n---------------------------\n\n【39】Sexual health and GUM clinics have the greatest expertise in testing and treatments for STIs, but you can also go to:\n\n【40】*   your GP\n*   a young people's sexual health service – call the National Sexual Health Helpline on 0300 123 7123\n*   a community contraception clinic\n*   a pharmacy\n\n【41】They may be able to offer tests for some infections and advise you on where to go for further help.\n\n【42】Further information\n-------------------\n\n【43】Does anal sex have any health risks?\n\n【44】How long before STI symptoms appear?\n\n【45】What infections can I catch through oral sex?\n删除11：<u>More in Sexual health\n---------------------\n\n【46】*   Where can I get sexual health advice, now?\n*   If I use a sexual health service will they tell my parents?\n*   Visiting a sexual health clinic\n*   Sexual health for gay and bisexual men\n*   Sexual health for lesbian and bisexual women\n*   Sex activities and risk\n*   Help after rape and sexual assault\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:58:40", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:00:55", "cost": 135.063}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:00:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:58:39"}

But treatment can help keep the symptoms under control, possibly for many years.**\n\n【3】The main treatments are:\n\n【4】*   healthy lifestyle changes\n*   medication\n*   devices implanted in your chest to control your heart rhythm\n*   surgery\n\n【5】In many cases, a combination of treatments will be required. \n\n【6】Treatment will usually need to continue for the rest of your life.\n\n【7】Care plan\n---------\n\n【8】If you have heart failure, you and everyone involved in your care will be given a care plan.\n\n【9】This should include:\n\n【10】*   plans for managing your heart failure, including follow-up care, rehabilitation and access to social care\n*   symptoms to look out for in case your condition worsens\n*   details of how to contact your care team or specialist\n\n【11】The care plan should be reviewed at least every 6 months by your GP.\n\n【12】Lifestyle changes\n-----------------\n\n【13】Having a healthy lifestyle, including eating a balanced diet, doing exercise and not smoking, can help with your symptoms and reduce your risk of becoming seriously ill.\n\n【14】You should be offered an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about living with heart failure</u>\n\n【15】Medicines for heart failure\n---------------------------\n\n【16】Most people with heart failure are treated with medication. Often you'll need to take 2 or 3 different medicines.\n\n【17】Some of the main medicines for heart failure include:\n\n【18】*   ACE inhibitors\n*   angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs or AIIRAs)\n*   beta blockers\n*   mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists\n*   diuretics\n*   ivabradine\n*   sacubitril valsartan\n*   hydralazine with nitrate\n*   digoxin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors\n\n【19】You may need to try a few different medicines before you find a combination that controls your symptoms but doesn't cause unpleasant side effects.\n\n【20】### ACE inhibitors\n\n【21】Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors work by relaxing and opening up your blood vessels, which makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body.\n\n【22】Examples of ACE inhibitors include ramipril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril.\n\n【23】The most common side effect of ACE inhibitors is a dry, irritating cough.\n\n【24】If you have a troublesome cough, an ACE inhibitor may be switched to an ARB.\n\n【25】ACE inhibitors can also cause your blood pressure to fall too low, and they may cause kidney problems. Your GP will monitor this.\n\n【26】### Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs)\n\n【27】Angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors by relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood pressure.\n\n【28】They tend to be used as an alternative to ACE inhibitors because they don't usually cause a cough, although they may not be quite as effective as ACE inhibitors.\n\n【29】Examples of ARBs include candesartan, losartan, telmisartan and valsartan.\n\n【30】Side effects of ARBs can include low blood pressure and high levels of potassium in your blood.\n\n【31】Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to monitor your potassium level.\n\n【32】### Important: Coronavirus advice\n\n【33】If you have coronavirus (COVID-19), or think you might have it, keep taking your blood pressure medicines as usual.\n\n【34】There is no clear evidence that taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs) will cause complications.\n\n【35】### Beta blockers\n\n【36】Beta blockers work by slowing your heart down and protecting your heart from the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline, \"fight or flight\" chemicals produced by the body.\n\n【37】There are several different beta blockers, but the main ones used to treat heart failure in the UK are bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol.\n\n【38】Possible side effects include dizziness, tiredness and blurred vision.\n\n【39】But most people taking them have either no or very mild side effects that become less troublesome with time.\n\n【40】### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)\n\n【41】MRAs make you pass more urine, and help lower blood pressure and reduce fluid around the heart, but they don't reduce potassium levels.\n\n【42】The most widely used MRAs are spironolactone and eplerenone.\n\n【43】Spironolactone may cause enlarged breasts in men (gynaecomastia) and breast tenderness and increased hair growth in women.\n\n【44】Eplerenone can cause sleeping difficulties, dizziness and headaches.\n\n【45】The most serious side effect of these medicines is that they can cause the level of potassium in your blood to become dangerously high.\n\n【46】Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to check for this.\n\n【47】### Diuretics\n\n【48】Diuretics (water pills) make you pass more urine and help relieve ankle swelling and breathlessness caused by heart failure.\n\n【49】There are many different types of diuretic, but the most widely used for heart failure are furosemide (also called frusemide) and bumetanide.\n\n【50】Possible side effects of diuretics include dehydration and reduced levels of sodium and potassium in the blood.\n\n【51】### Ivabradine\n\n【52】Ivabradine is a medicine that can help slow your heart down.\n\n【53】It's a useful alternative to beta blockers if you can't take them or they cause troublesome side effects.\n\n【54】It can also be used alongside beta blockers if they don't slow the heart enough.\n\n【55】Possible side effects include headaches, dizziness and blurred vision.\n\n【56】### Sacubitril valsartan\n\n【57】Sacubitril valsartan is a single tablet that combines an ARB and a medication called a neprilysin inhibitor.\n\n【58】It's suitable for people with more severe heart failure, whose heart is only able to pump a reduced amount of oxygenated blood around the body despite taking other medication.\n\n【59】The most common side effects of sacubitril valsartan are low blood pressure, high potassium levels and kidney problems.\n\n【60】### Hydralazine with nitrate\n\n【61】Hydralazine in combination with nitrate can help relax and open up the blood vessels.\n\n【62】These medicines are sometimes prescribed by heart specialists (cardiologists) for people who are unable to take an ACE inhibitor or ARB.\n\n【63】Side effects can include headaches, a fast heartbeat and a pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeat (palpitations).\n\n【64】### Digoxin\n\n【65】Digoxin can improve your symptoms by strengthening your heart muscle contractions and slowing down your heart rate.\n\n【66】It's normally only recommended for people who have symptoms despite treatment with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers and diuretics.\n\n【67】Possible side effects include dizziness, blurred vision, feeling and being sick, diarrhoea and an irregular heartbeat.\n\n【68】### SGLT2 inhibitors\n\n【69】SGLT2 inhibitors are tablets that can help lower your blood sugar levels.\n\n【70】Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are types of SGLT2 inhibitor. They can be used to treat some types of heart failure, as an add-on to other medicines.\n\n【71】Possible side effects include thrush, peeing more than usual, a mild skin rash and back pain.\n\n【72】### Take your medication\n\n【73】It's very important that you take any prescribed medication, even if you begin to feel better.\n\n【74】Check with your care team if:\n\n【75】*   other medicines might interfere with your medication\n*   you experience any side effects\n\n【76】Devices for heart failure\n-------------------------\n\n【77】Some people with heart failure will need to have a procedure to implant a small device in their chest that can help control or monitor their heart's rhythm.\n\n【78】The most commonly used devices are:\n\n【79】*   pacemakers\n*   cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) devices\n*   implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)\n*   CRT-Ds\n\n【80】### Pacemakers\n\n【81】You may need to have a pacemaker fitted if your heart beats too slowly.\n\n【82】A pacemaker monitors your heart rate continuously, and sends electrical pulses to your heart to keep it beating regularly and at the right speed.\n\n【83】The pacemaker is implanted under the skin by a cardiologist, usually under local anaesthetic.\n\n【84】You'll usually need to stay in hospital overnight to check it's working properly. Serious complications are unusual.\n\n【85】Pacemakers need to be checked regularly by specialist technicians at a pacemaker clinic.\n\n【86】You'll also need to be careful about things that can affect how your pacemaker works, such as hospital equipment and security systems in shops or at airports.\n删除7：<u>Read more about pacemaker implantation.</u>\n\n【87】You can also find out more about pacemakers on the British Heart Foundation website.\n\n【88】### Cardiac resynchronisation therapy\n\n【89】In some people with heart failure, the walls of the main pumping chamber (the left ventricle) don't work together and contract out of sync with each other.\n\n【90】Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a special type of pacemaker that can correct the problem by making the walls of the left ventricle all contract at the same time. This makes the heart pump more efficiently.\n\n【91】Most pacemakers only have 1 or 2 wires to the heart, but CRT requires an extra wire.\n\n【92】### Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)\n\n【93】People who have, or are at high risk of developing, an abnormal heart rhythm may need to have a device known as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.\n\n【94】An ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm.\n\n【95】If the heart starts beating dangerously fast, the ICD will try to bring it back to normal by giving it a small, controlled electrical shock (defibrillation). \n\n【96】If this fails, the ICD will deliver a larger shock.\n\n【97】As with pacemakers, ICDs are implanted in hospital, usually under local anaesthetic.\n\n【98】Like pacemakers, you'll need to avoid things that can interfere with the way the ICD works, such as airport security systems.\n删除7：<u>Read more about ICDs on the British Heart Foundation website.</u>\n\n【99】### CRT-Ds\n\n【100】Devices that combine cardiac resynchronisation and defibrillation are implanted into patients who need both.\n\n【101】These combination devices are usually called CRT-Ds.\n\n【102】### Pulmonary artery pressure sensors\n\n【103】Some people with chronic heart failure may need to have a device known as a pulmonary artery pressure sensor fitted.\n\n【104】It's implanted into your artery in hospital, under local anaesthetic.\n\n【105】The sensor sends blood pressure measurements to a monitor in your home. The monitor sends the measurements to your care team, to help them decide whether your treatment needs to be changed. This should help to manage your treatment and reduce the chance of you being admitted to hospital.\n\n【106】This is a new procedure that might not yet be available to everyone.\n\n【107】**Improving muscle strength**\n-----------------------------\n\n【108】If you are having a bad flare-up and are unable to exercise, you may be offered electrical stimulation to make your muscles stronger.\n\n【109】This is where electrodes are placed on your skin and small electrical impulses are sent to weak muscles, usually in your arms or legs.\n\n【110】Surgery\n-------\n\n【111】Medicines are the main treatment for heart failure, but for some people surgery may help.\n\n【112】Operations that can help with heart failure include:\n\n【113】*   heart valve surgery\n*   a coronary angioplasty or bypass\n*   left ventricular assist devices\n*   heart transplant\n\n【114】### Heart valve surgery\n\n【115】If the valves of your heart are damaged or diseased, your doctor may suggest valve surgery.\n\n【116】There are 2 types of valve surgery: valve replacement and valve repair.\n\n【117】The type of surgery you have will depend on what's wrong with the valve and how serious the problem is.\n\n【118】Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n【119】Read about aortic valve replacement and surgery for mitral valve problems.\n\n【120】### Angioplasty or bypass\n\n【121】If your heart failure is related to coronary heart disease, your doctor may recommend a:\n\n【122】*   coronary angioplasty – where a tiny balloon is used to stretch open a narrowed or blocked artery; usually a small mesh tube called a stent is put in the artery to support it\n*   coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) – where a blood vessel from another part of the body is used to divert blood around narrowed or clogged parts of an artery\n\n【123】These procedures will help make it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【124】### Left ventricular assist devices\n\n【125】Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are mechanical pumps that can help if your left ventricle isn't working properly and medication alone isn't helping.\n\n【126】They may be used as a permanent treatment if you can't have a heart transplant, or as a temporary measure while you wait for a transplant.\n\n【127】In addition to the pump, LVADs also include an external battery. A wire connecting this to the pump will need to be placed under your skin during the operation.\n删除7：<u>Read more about LVADs on the British Heart Foundation website.</u>\n\n【128】### Heart transplant\n\n【129】A heart transplant may be necessary if you develop severe heart failure that can't be treated effectively with medication or other types of surgery.\n\n【130】A heart transplant is a complex procedure that carries serious risks, so it's not suitable for everyone with severe heart failure.\n\n【131】There's also a shortage of hearts for transplantation, so some people have to wait years for a suitable donor heart to become available.\n删除7：<u>Read more about heart transplants.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 May 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:12", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:52", "cost": 39.759}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:10"}

Usually it's thought to be caused by raised levels of certain chemicals in the blood, such as hormones.\n\n【2】Later, as your bump grows, the skin of your tummy (abdomen) is stretched and this may also feel itchy.\n\n【3】However, itching can be a symptom of a liver condition called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), also known as obstetric cholestasis (OC).\n\n【4】ICP needs medical attention. It affects around 1 in 140 pregnant women in the UK.\n\n【5】### Symptoms of ICP\n\n【6】The main symptom is itching, usually without a rash. For many women with ICP, the itching is often:\n\n【7】*   more noticeable on the hands and feet, but can be all over the body\n*   worse at night\n\n【8】Other symptoms can include:\n\n【9】*   dark urine\n*   pale poo\n*   yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), but this is less common\n\n【10】Symptoms of ICP typically start from around 28 weeks of pregnancy, but it's possible to develop the condition earlier.\n\n【11】### Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife or GP if you have itching that's:\n\n【12】*   mild or distressing, possibly worse at night\n*   anywhere on your body, but may be worse on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet\n\n【13】Feeling itchy like this can be a sign of ICP and needs to be checked.\n\n【14】Mild itching\n------------\n\n【15】Wearing loose clothes may help prevent itching, as your clothes are less likely to rub against your skin and cause irritation.\n\n【16】You may also want to avoid synthetic materials and opt for natural ones, such as cotton, instead. These are \"breathable\" and allow the air to circulate close to your skin.\n\n【17】You may find having a cool bath or applying lotion or moisturiser can help soothe the itching.\n\n【18】Some women find that products with strong perfumes can irritate their skin, so you could try using unperfumed lotion or soap.\n\n【19】Mild itching is not usually harmful to you or your baby, but it can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition, particularly if you notice it more in the evenings or at night.\n\n【20】Let your midwife or doctor know if you are experiencing itching so they can decide whether you need to have any further investigations.\n\n【21】Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a potentially serious liver disorder that can develop in pregnancy.\n\n【23】Normally, bile acids flow from your liver to your gut to help you digest food.\n\n【24】In ICP, the bile acids do not flow properly and build up in your body instead. There's no cure for ICP, but it should go once you've had your baby.\n\n【25】ICP seems to run in families, but it can happen even if there is no family history. It is more common in women of south Asian origin, affecting around 1 in 70 to 80 pregnancies.\n\n【26】If you have had ICP in a previous pregnancy, you have a high chance of developing it again in another pregnancy.\n\n【27】Some studies have found that babies whose mothers have ICP have a higher chance of being born prematurely or stillborn.\n\n【28】Because of the link with stillbirth, you may be offered induction of labour. This could be any time from 35 weeks, depending on the level of bile acids in your blood.\n\n【29】If you have ICP, you will probably be advised to give birth in hospital under a consultant-led maternity team.\n\n【30】### **Diagnosis and treatment of ICP**\n\n【31】ICP is diagnosed by excluding other causes of the itch. Your doctor will probably talk to you about your medical and family history and advise you to have some blood tests.\n\n【32】These will include tests to check your liver function (LFT) and measure your bile acid levels (BA).\n\n【33】#### **Monitoring your condition**\n\n【34】If you are diagnosed with ICP, you will have regular liver blood tests (LFTs) and bile acid measurement tests so your doctor can monitor your condition.\n\n【35】Initially, you may be given these tests every week. You may then be given more, or less, frequent tests depending on the results and your symptoms.\n\n【36】#### **Creams and medicines for ICP**\n\n【37】Creams, such as aqueous cream with menthol, are safe to use in pregnancy and can provide some relief from itching.\n\n【38】A medicine called ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) can be prescribed to try to relive itching. But recent evidence suggests it may not be effective in reducing bile acids and easing itching.\n\n【39】UDCA is considered safe to take in pregnancy, although it is prescribed on what is known as an \"informed consent\" basis as it has not been properly tested in pregnancy. It is usually only prescribed by a hospital doctor.\n\n【40】A possible alternative, which can be helpful if itchiness is keeping you awake at night, is antihistamine medicine, such as chlorphenamine. Chlorphenamine tends to cause drowsiness so it can also help with sleep problems as well as itchiness. If you do feel drowsy do not drive or operate machinery.\n\n【41】You may also be offered a vitamin K supplement. This is because ICP can affect your absorption of vitamin K, which is important for healthy blood clotting.\n\n【42】Most experts on ICP only prescribe vitamin K if the mother-to-be reports pale poo, has a known blood clotting problem, or has very severe ICP from early in pregnancy.\n\n【43】If you are diagnosed with ICP, your midwife and doctor will discuss your health and your options with you.\n\n【44】**Further information**\n\n【45】There is information about obstetric cholestasis on the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists (RCOG) website, including what it means for you and your baby, and the treatment that's available.\n\n【46】You can also get information about intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) on the British Liver Trust website.\n\n【47】The charity ICP Support provides information about ICP.

But there are some general points that can help.**\n\n【3】Controlling your seizures\n-------------------------\n\n【4】Seizures can be dangerous, so it's important to try to keep them as well controlled as possible. There are several things you can do to help.\n\n【5】### Take your medicine\n\n【6】Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can be very effective in stopping or reducing the frequency of seizures.\n\n【7】If you've been prescribed an AED, make sure you take it every day as advised by your doctor.\n\n【8】Tell your doctor if your medicine is causing unpleasant side effects. Do not skip doses or stop taking it without getting medical advice, as this could cause you to have a seizure.\n\n【9】You might need to try several AEDs to find one that works for you and does not cause troublesome side effects.\n\n【10】You may eventually be able to stop taking your medicine once your seizures have been under control for some time. This should be done gradually under medical supervision.\n\n【11】### Identify and avoid seizure triggers\n\n【12】While not the case for everyone with epilepsy, seizures can sometimes have a trigger. Common seizure triggers include stress, lack of sleep and alcohol.\n\n【13】Keeping a seizure diary – detailing when you have seizures and what you were doing beforehand – may help you work out if you have any triggers.\n\n【14】If you identify any triggers, doing what you can to avoid them can help reduce the number of seizures you have.\n\n【15】For example, it might help to:\n\n【16】*   deal with stress\n*   avoid becoming too tired – read advice about how to get to sleep and get tips to beat insomnia\n*   cut down on alcohol\n\n【17】### Have regular reviews\n\n【18】You'll have regular reviews of your epilepsy and treatment. These are usually carried out by a GP, but sometimes may be done by your epilepsy specialist team.\n\n【19】Reviews should be carried out at least once a year, although you may need them more often if your epilepsy is not well controlled.\n\n【20】These appointments are a good opportunity to talk to your doctor about how you feel your treatment is going and any problems you're having. For example you may want to ask advice about side effects of your medicine.\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【21】*   Epilepsy Action: living with epilepsy\n*   Epilepsy Society: living with a long-term condition\n\n【22】</u>\nStaying safe\n------------\n\n【23】Having seizures can sometimes put you or others at risk of harm – for example, if they happen while you're cooking, driving or swimming.\n\n【24】If your seizures are not well controlled, there are things you can do to reduce the danger.\n\n【25】### At home\n\n【26】Some tips to help you stay safe at home include:\n\n【27】*   use guards on heaters and radiators to stop you falling directly on to them\n*   install smoke detectors to let you know that food is burning if you sometimes forget what you're doing or have seizures that cause you to lose awareness\n*   cover any furniture edges or corners that are sharp or stick out\n*   have a shower instead of a bath\n*   do not lock the bathroom door\n*   place saucepans on the back burners and with the handles turned away from the edge of the cooker\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【28】*   Epilepsy Action: safety advice for people with epilepsy\n\n【29】</u>\n### Sports and leisure\n\n【30】Most people with epilepsy can take part in sports and other leisure activities. There are some precautions you might need to take if your seizures are not well controlled.\n\n【31】For example, you may need to:\n\n【32】*   avoid swimming or doing water sports on your own\n*   wear a helmet while cycling or horse riding\n*   avoid using certain types of gym equipment – ask staff at the gym for advice\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【33】*   Epilepsy Action: sports and leisure\n\n【34】</u>\n### Driving\n\n【35】You must stop driving and tell the Driving and Vehicle Licence Agency (DVLA) if you've had a seizure.\n\n【36】Your licence may be taken away until your seizures are under control.\n\n【37】When you can reapply for a licence depends on the type of seizure you had. For example, if you've had seizures that caused you to lose consciousness, you will not be able to reapply until you have not had a seizure for at least a year.\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【38】*   GOV.UK: epilepsy and driving\n*   Epilepsy Action: driving\n*   Epilepsy Society: driving regulations for epilepsy\n\n【39】</u>\nPregnancy and contraception\n---------------------------\n\n【40】### Getting pregnant\n\n【41】Epilepsy does not affect your ability to have children and there's no reason why you cannot have a healthy pregnancy.\n\n【42】But if you're thinking of trying for a baby, it's important to discuss your plans with your doctor.\n\n【43】This is because some AEDs can harm an unborn baby.

You can do this by taking your medicine as recommended and avoiding seizure triggers when possible.\n\n【87】If you're worried your epilepsy is poorly controlled, contact your epilepsy specialist. It may be possible to refer you to a specialist epilepsy centre for further treatment.\n\n【88】A charity called SUDEP Action can offer advice and support, as well as a helpline for people who've lost a loved one as a result of epilepsy.\n删除6：<u>**Further information**\n\n【89】*   Epilepsy Action: SUDEP\n*   Epilepsy Society: SUDEP\n删除3：<u>Video: epilepsy research - MRI\n</u>\n------------------------------\n\n【90】In this video, a professor outlines the benefits of participating in MRI research.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 5 August 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 5 August 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 September 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 September 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:13", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:48:03", "cost": 109.805}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:48:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:12"}

Overview\n2.  Starting your periods\n3.  Period problems</u>\n\n【2】**Most girls start their** **periods** **when they're about 12, but they can start as early as 8, so it's important to talk to girls from an early age to make sure they're prepared.**\n\n【3】Respond to questions or opportunities as they arise and do not be embarrassed. Periods are natural.\n\n【4】Talking about periods\n---------------------\n\n【5】Try to talk about periods as an ongoing process rather than a formal sit-down talk.\n\n【6】You can use TV ads for tampons, or buying sanitary towels at the supermarket, for example, to start the conversation about periods. Or simply ask your daughter what she already knows and go from there.\n\n【7】Use clear language, like \"vagina\". Emphasise that periods are completely normal and natural – they're part of growing up.\n\n【8】Boys also need to learn about periods. Talk to them in the same way as girls about the practicalities, mood changes that can come with periods, and the biological reason behind periods. It will keep them informed, as well as help them to understand about periods.\n\n【9】When a girl starts her periods it's a sign that her body is now able to have a baby. It's important that she also knows about getting pregnant and contraception.\n\n【10】The questions girls ask about periods\n-------------------------------------\n\n【11】Here are some of the questions that you, as a parent, might get asked by girls about periods, with suggestions on how to answer them:\n\n【12】### How will I know when my periods are going to start?\n\n【13】Signs that your period is on its way are if you've grown underarm and pubic hair. Typically, you'll start your periods about 2 years after your breasts start growing. The average girl will get her first period around 12 years old, but it varies from person to person.\n\n【14】### Why have my periods not started yet?\n\n【15】Your periods will start when your body is ready. This is usually between age 8 and 17, or 2 years after your first signs of puberty.\n\n【16】Possible reasons for delayed periods include being underweight, doing lots of exercise (including dance, gymnastics and athletics), stress and a hormone imbalance.\n\n【17】See a GP if your periods have not started by age 15 (or 13 if you do not have any other signs of puberty). Your GP may suggest a blood test to check your hormone levels.\n\n【18】You may be referred to a specialist (usually a gynaecologist – a specialist in women's health) to find out what's causing your delayed periods and discuss any treatments that might help.\n\n【19】### How do I get ready for my first period?\n\n【20】Talk to your parent or another adult you trust about what you can expect before it actually happens.\n\n【21】It's a good idea to start carrying sanitary pads or tampons around with you in advance.\n\n【22】If you find yourself at school without a pad or tampon, ask a teacher or the school nurse for some.\n\n【23】### How long will my first period last?\n\n【24】Your first period might not last very long, as it can take your body some months to get into a regular pattern. As a general rule, once they're settled, you'll have a period every 23 to 35 days and it will last 2 to 7 days.\n\n【25】### How much blood will I lose?\n\n【26】It might seem a lot, but it's only about 20 to 90ml (about 1 to 5 tablespoons). It's not a sudden gush – you'll just see a reddish-brown stain on your pants or on your sheets when you wake up in the morning.\n\n【27】### What if period blood leaks through my clothes?\n\n【28】There are ways of covering up stains until you're able to change your clothes, such as tying a sweatshirt around your waist. Keep a spare pair of pants and tights at school or in your bag.\n\n【29】### Should I use pads, tampons, menstrual cups or period underwear?\n\n【30】This is up to you. Tampons, menstrual cups, disposable or reusable pads (towels) and period underwear are safe and suitable if you've just started your period. You might want to use pads for your very first period as tampons and cups can take some getting used to. It might be worth experimenting until you find the product that suits you best.\n\n【31】### Can a tampon get lost inside me?\n\n【32】No, it can't. When you insert a tampon, it stays in your vagina. All tampons come with a string at one end that is designed to stay outside your body. You can remove the tampon at any time using this string.\n\n【33】Read the full answer to Can a tampon get lost inside me?\n\n【34】### What if I forget to remove my tampon?\n\n【35】If you forget to remove your tampon, it can turn sideways or become compressed at the top of your vagina. This can make it difficult for you to pull it out. If you think you've left a tampon in and you can't get it out, go to your GP or nearest sexual health clinic. They can remove it for you.\n\n【36】Read the full answer to What if I forget to remove my tampon?\n\n【37】Further reading for girls\n-------------------------\n\n【38】*   \"Susan's Growing Up\" is a picture book about periods that has been specially developed for people with learning disabilities. It's from the Books Beyond Words series from the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n*   \"The Period Book: Everything You Don't Want to Ask (But Need to Know)\" by Karen Gravelle, and published by Piatkus, is a well-known book for any girl approaching puberty. It explains what to expect and how to cope with periods.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Periods</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Period problems</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:33", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:39", "cost": 6.526}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:32"}

But if your folate deficiency anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, you may have to take folic acid for longer, possibly for the rest of your life. Do not stop taking folic acid without talking to your doctor.\n\n【15】### Dose for preventing folate deficiency anaemia\n\n【16】To prevent anaemia, the usual dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is 5mg, taken every 1 to 7 days.\n\n【17】The dose may vary depending on your age, diet and any other health conditions you have.\n\n【18】For children under 12, the doctor will use your child's age or weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【19】### Dose if you're taking methotrexate\n\n【20】The usual dose for adults and children is 5mg once a week, on a different day of the week to your methotrexate.\n\n【21】Some people take 1mg to 5mg once a day, apart from the day when they take their methotrexate.\n\n【22】You'll usually take folic acid for as long as you take methotrexate. You may have to take it for a long time, possibly for the rest of your life.\n\n【23】Do not stop taking it without talking to your doctor. Stopping means you'll be more likely to get side effects from methotrexate, such as being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea.\n\n【24】Changes to your dose\n--------------------\n\n【25】Usually your dose will stay the same.\n\n【26】Your dose may go up, however, if you're taking folic acid to prevent or treat anaemia and blood tests show you need a higher dose.\n\n【27】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【28】You can take folic acid with or without food. Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.\n\n【29】If you're taking folic acid as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【30】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【31】Missing 1 or 2 doses probably will not matter. But if you keep forgetting to take your folic acid, or you do not want to take it, speak to your doctor.\n\n【32】If you forget to take folic acid, what to do depends on how often you take it:\n\n【33】*   **once a day** – take your missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case skip the missed dose and just take your next dose at the usual time. If you remember on the day you take your methotrexate, wait a day and take your missed dose the following day\n*   **once a week** – take your missed dose as soon as you remember, unless you take methotrexate that day. If you remember on the day you take your methotrexate, wait a day and take your missed dose the following day. After this, go back to taking your weekly dose on your usual day\n\n【34】Never take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【35】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【36】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【37】Folic acid is generally very safe. Taking too much is unlikely to cause any harm.\n\n【38】If you're worried, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n删除11：<u>More in Folic acid\n------------------\n\n【39】*   About folic acid\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking folic acid with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 5 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 5 April 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:49:12", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:49:19", "cost": 7.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:49:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:49:11"}

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on an ovary. They're very common and do not usually cause any symptoms.**\n\n【3】Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and go away in a few months without needing any treatment.\n\n【4】The ovaries\n-----------\n\n【5】The ovaries are 2 almond-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. There's 1 on each side of the womb (uterus).\n\n【6】The ovaries have 2 main functions:\n\n【7】*   to release an egg approximately every 28 days as part of the menstrual cycle\n*   to release the sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in reproduction\n\n【8】Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect 1.\n\n【9】Symptoms of an ovarian cyst\n---------------------------\n\n【10】An ovarian cyst usually only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large or twists and then blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.\n\n【11】In these cases, you may have:\n\n【12】*   pelvic pain – this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain\n*   pain during sex\n*   difficulty emptying your bowels\n*   a frequent need to urinate\n*   heavy periods, irregular periods or lighter periods than normal\n*   bloating and a swollen tummy\n*   feeling very full after only eating a little\n*   difficulty getting pregnant – although fertility is usually unaffected by ovarian cysts\n\n【13】See a GP if you have symptoms of an ovarian cyst.\n\n【14】Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n\n【15】*   you have sudden, severe pelvic pain\n*   you have pain in your tummy (abdomen) and you also feel sick (nausea) or are being sick (vomiting)\n\n【16】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online\n\n【17】Types of ovarian cyst\n---------------------\n\n【18】The 2 main types of ovarian cyst are:\n\n【19】*   functional ovarian cysts – cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type\n*   pathological ovarian cysts – cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth; these are much less common\n\n【20】Ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as endometriosis.\n\n【21】The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant).\n\n【22】Cancerous cysts are more common if you have been through the menopause.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the causes of ovarian cysts</u>\n\n【23】Diagnosing ovarian cysts\n------------------------\n\n【24】If a GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan, carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina.\n\n【25】If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or a GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health (gynaecologist).\n\n【26】If there's any concern that your cyst could be cancerous, the doctor will also arrange blood tests to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate ovarian cancer.\n\n【27】But having high levels of these chemicals does not necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, such as:\n\n【28】*   endometriosis\n*   a pelvic infection\n*   fibroids\n*   your period\n\n【29】Treating ovarian cysts\n----------------------\n\n【30】Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on:\n\n【31】*   its size and appearance\n*   whether you have any symptoms\n*   whether you have been through the menopause\n\n【32】In most cases, the cyst disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this.\n\n【33】If you are postmenopausal, there is a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer. Regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst.\n\n【34】Surgical treatment to remove the cysts may be needed if they're large, causing symptoms or potentially cancerous.\n\n【35】Ovarian cysts and fertility\n---------------------------\n\n【36】Ovarian cysts do not usually prevent you getting pregnant, although they can sometimes make it harder to conceive.\n\n【37】If you need an operation to remove your cysts, your surgeon will aim to preserve your fertility whenever possible.\n\n【38】This may mean removing just the cyst and leaving the ovaries intact, or only removing 1 ovary.\n\n【39】In some cases, surgery to remove both your ovaries may be necessary, in which case you'll no longer produce any eggs.\n\n【40】Make sure you talk to your surgeon about the potential effects on your fertility before your operation.\n删除3：<u>### Video: ovarian cysts\n\n【41】This video explores the symptoms ovarian cysts can cause, the long-term effects, and the treatment options.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:42:59", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:43:18", "cost": 19.265}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:43:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:42:59"}

It's caused by the small bowel (intestines) not being able to absorb nutrients (malabsorption).\n\n【7】Malabsorption can also lead to stools (poo) containing abnormally high levels of fat (steatorrhoea). This can make them foul smelling, greasy and frothy. They may also be difficult to flush down the toilet.\n\n【8】Other common gut-related symptoms include:\n\n【9】*   abdominal pain (stomach ache)\n*   bloating and flatulence (farting)\n*   indigestion\n*   constipation\n*   vomiting\n\n【10】And more general symptoms may include: \n\n【11】*   fatigue (extreme tiredness), which may be a sign of iron deficiency anaemia or vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\n*   unexpected weight loss\n*   an itchy rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)\n*   difficulty getting pregnant (infertility)\n*   tingling and numbness in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n*   problems with co-ordination, balance and speech (ataxia)\n\n【12】Malnutrition\n------------\n\n【13】If coeliac disease is not treated, not being able to digest food in the normal way could cause you to become malnourished, leading to tiredness and a lack of energy.\n\n【14】Malnutrition in children can result in failure to grow at the expected rate, both in terms of height and weight. Children may also have delayed puberty.\n\n【15】Dermatitis herpetiformis\n------------------------\n\n【16】Although not a symptom of coeliac disease, if you have an autoimmune response to gluten, you may develop a rash called dermatitis herpetiformis.\n\n【17】The rash is itchy and has blisters that burst when scratched. It usually happens on your elbows, knees and buttocks, although it can appear anywhere on your body.\n\n【18】It's estimated that around 1 in 4 people with coeliac disease develop dermatitis herpetiformis.\n\n【19】The exact cause of dermatitis herpetiformis is not known, but as with coeliac disease, it's associated with eating gluten. Like coeliac disease, the rash should clear up after changing to a gluten-free diet.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Coeliac disease</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:36:38", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:23", "cost": 225.619}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:36:37"}

Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Addison's disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.**\n\n【3】Problems with the immune system\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】A problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison's disease in the UK.\n\n【5】The immune system is your body's defence against infection and disease. If you're ill, your immune system produces antibodies – a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins. These antibodies attack the cause of the illness.\n\n【6】However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is called an autoimmune disorder.\n\n【7】Addison's disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex.\n\n【8】When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands will not be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you'll experience symptoms of Addison's disease.\n\n【9】It's not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families.\n\n【10】Genetics\n--------\n\n【11】Research has shown that some people with certain genes are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.\n\n【12】It's not clear how these genes lead to Addison's disease and similar conditions, but it does mean your risk of developing Addison's disease is increased if you or a close family member have another autoimmune condition, such as:\n\n【13】*   vitiligo – a long-term condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin\n*   type 1 diabetes – a long-term condition caused by your body not producing insulin\n*   underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n\n【14】Other causes\n------------\n\n【15】Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of Addison's disease worldwide, but it's rare in the UK.\n\n【16】TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs but can also spread to other parts of your body. It can cause Addison's disease if it damages your adrenal glands.\n\n【17】Other possible causes of Addison's disease include:\n\n【18】*   infections – such as those linked to AIDS, or fungal infections\n*   a haemorrhage – very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis or other types of severe sepsis\n*   cancer – if cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands\n*   amyloidosis – a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them\n*   surgical removal of both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) – for example, to remove a tumour\n*   adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) – a rare, life-limiting inherited condition that affects the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain, and is mostly seen in young boys\n*   certain treatments needed for Cushing's syndrome – a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body\n\n【19】Secondary adrenal insufficiency\n-------------------------------\n\n【20】The production of hormones from the adrenal gland can also be affected by damage to the pituitary gland – a pea-sized gland located below the brain that produces a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland. This is called secondary adrenal insufficiency and is a separate condition to Addison's disease.\n\n【21】Secondary adrenal insufficiency can occur if your pituitary gland becomes damaged – for example, because of a tumour on the pituitary gland (pituitary adenoma).\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 December 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:40", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:47:47", "cost": 66.705}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:47:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:43"}

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Tics are fast, repetitive muscle movements that result in sudden and difficult to control body jolts or sounds.**\n\n【3】They're fairly common in childhood and typically first appear at around 5 years of age. Very occasionally they can start in adulthood.\n\n【4】Tics are not usually serious and normally improve over time. But they can be frustrating and interfere with everyday activities.\n\n【5】Tourette's syndrome, a term that's used when tics have lasted for more than a year, is covered separately.\n\n【6】Types of tics\n-------------\n\n【7】There are many types of tic. Some affect body movement (motor tics) and others result in a sound (vocal or phonic tics).\n\n【8】Examples of tics include:\n\n【9】*   blinking, wrinkling the nose or grimacing\n*   jerking or banging the head\n*   clicking the fingers\n*   touching other people or things\n*   coughing, grunting or sniffing\n*   repeating a sound or phrase – in a small number of cases, this may be something obscene or offensive\n\n【10】Tics can happen randomly and they may be associated with something such as stress, anxiety, tiredness, excitement or happiness. They tend to get worse if they're talked about or focused on.\n\n【11】They often start with an unpleasant sensation that builds up in the body until relieved by the tic – known as an urge – although they can sometimes be partly suppressed.\n\n【12】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【13】Tics are not usually serious and they do not damage the brain.\n\n【14】You do not always need to see a GP if they're mild and not causing problems. Sometimes they can disappear as quickly as they appear.\n\n【15】See a GP if you're concerned about your or your child's tics, you need support or advice, or the tics:\n\n【16】*   occur very regularly, or become more frequent or severe\n*   cause emotional or social problems, such as embarrassment, bullying or social isolation\n*   cause pain or discomfort (some tics can cause the person to accidentally hurt themselves)\n*   interfere with daily activities, school or work\n*   are accompanied by anger, depression or self harm\n\n【17】A GP should be able to diagnose a tic from a description of it and, if possible, seeing it. Recording a short video can be helpful, but be careful not to draw too much attention to the tic while filming as this can make it worse.\n\n【18】Treatments for tics\n-------------------\n\n【19】Treatment is not always needed if a tic is mild and is not causing any other problems. Self-help tips, such as avoiding stress or tiredness, are often very helpful for the majority of people.\n\n【20】If a tic is more severe and is affecting everyday activities, therapies that aim to reduce how often tics occur may be recommended.\n\n【21】The main therapies for tics are:\n\n【22】*   Habit reversal therapy – this aims to help you or your child learn intentional movements that \"compete\" with tics, so the tic cannot happen at the same time\n*   Comprehensive behavioural intervention for tics (CBiT) – a set of behavioural techniques to help learn skills to reduce tics\n*   Exposure with response prevention (ERP) – this aims to help you or your child get used to the unpleasant sensations that are often felt just before a tic, which can stop the tic occurring\n\n【23】There are also medicines that can help reduce tics. These may be used alongside psychological therapies or after trying these therapies unsuccessfully.\n删除7：<u>Read more about how tics are treated.</u>\n\n【24】How long do tics last?\n----------------------\n\n【25】In most cases, tics improve over time or stop completely.\n\n【26】Sometimes they may just last a few months, but often they come and go over several years.\n\n【27】They are normally most severe from around 8 years of age until teenage years, and usually start to improve after puberty.\n\n【28】Causes of tics\n--------------\n\n【29】It's not clear what causes tics. They're thought to be due to changes in the parts of the brain that control movement.\n\n【30】They can run in families, and there's likely to be a genetic cause in many cases. They also often happen alongside other conditions, such as:\n\n【31】*   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n*   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\n\n【32】Tics can sometimes be triggered by taking illegal drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, and are occasionally caused by more serious health conditions such as cerebral palsy or Huntington's disease.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:51:32", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:51:43", "cost": 11.031}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:51:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:51:31"}

The infection may cure itself in rare cases, but you risk passing the infection on to someone else if you are not treated.**\n\n【3】Antibiotics\n-----------\n\n【4】Trichomoniasis is usually treated quickly and easily with antibiotics.\n\n【5】Most people are prescribed an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is very effective if taken correctly. You'll usually have to take metronidazole twice a day, for 5 to 7 days.\n\n【6】Sometimes this antibiotic can be prescribed in a single, larger dose. However, this may have a higher risk of side effects and it's not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women as a precaution.\n\n【7】Metronidazole can make you feel sick, be sick and cause a slight metallic taste in your mouth. It's best to take it after eating food. Contact your doctor for advice if you start vomiting, because the treatment will not be effective if you're unable to swallow the tablets.\n\n【8】Do not drink alcohol while taking metronidazole and for at least 24 hours after finishing the course of antibiotics. Drinking alcohol while taking this medicine can cause more severe side effects, including:\n\n【9】*   a fast heartbeat or heart palpitations\n*   skin flushing\n*   nausea and vomiting\n\n【10】A specialist can recommend alternative treatments if metronidazole is unsuitable for you (for example, if you're allergic to it).\n\n【11】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【12】If you take your antibiotics correctly, you will not normally need any follow-up tests or examinations for trichomoniasis.\n\n【13】However, you may require further testing to see whether your symptoms are being caused by a different sexually transmitted infection (STI) if your symptoms remain or reoccur after treatment.\n\n【14】If you have unprotected sex before your treatment is finished, you need to return to your GP surgery or sexual health clinic. You may have become reinfected. You must also return if you:\n\n【15】*   did not complete your course of antibiotics\n*   did not take your antibiotics correctly (according to the instructions)\n*   vomited shortly after taking your antibiotics\n\n【16】You may need more antibiotics or a different form of treatment.\n\n【17】Sexual partners\n---------------\n\n【18】You should avoid having sex while you're being treated for trichomoniasis, as you may become reinfected.\n\n【19】If you were prescribed a single dose of antibiotics, you need to avoid having sex for 7 days after taking the medicine.\n\n【20】It's very important that your current sexual partner and any other recent partners are also tested and treated. If your sexual partner is not treated, this increases the risk of reinfection.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 November 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Prevention</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:33:36", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:34:03", "cost": 27.136}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:34:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:33:35"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along your nerves. The tumours are usually non-cancerous (benign) but may cause a range of symptoms.**\n\n【3】Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. It's covered separately as it has different symptoms and causes.\n\n【4】Symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】NF1 is a condition you're born with, although some symptoms develop gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person.\n\n【6】In most cases, the skin is affected, causing symptoms such as:\n\n【7】*   birthmarks known as café au lait spots, which are light or dark brown patches that can be anywhere on the body\n*   soft, non-cancerous tumours on or under the skin (neurofibromas)\n*   clusters of freckles in unusual places – such as the armpits, groin and under the breast\n*   problems with the bones, eyes and nervous system\n\n【8】Certain health problems are often associated with NF1, such as learning difficulties. Less commonly, NF1 is associated with a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1</u>\n\n【9】Causes of neurofibromatosis type 1\n----------------------------------\n\n【10】NF1 is caused by a faulty gene. If the NF1 gene is faulty, it leads to uncontrolled growth (tumours) developing in the nervous system.\n\n【11】In half of all cases of NF1, the faulty gene is passed from a parent to their child. Only one parent needs to have the faulty gene for their child to be at risk of developing the condition.\n\n【12】If either the mother or father has the faulty gene, there's a 1 in 2 chance that each child they have will develop NF1.\n\n【13】In other cases, the faulty gene appears to develop spontaneously (where there is no family history of NF1). It's unclear why this happens. If you have a child who develops NF1 spontaneously, it's highly unlikely any further children you have will also develop the condition.\n\n【14】However, if you do have a child who develops NF1 spontaneously, they could pass on the condition to any children that they have.\n\n【15】Diagnosing neurofibromatosis type 1\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】It's usually easy to diagnose NF1 in adults and older children by checking for the typical symptoms.\n\n【17】It may be diagnosed in babies who show symptoms of NF1 from birth. However, it's not always possible to make a firm diagnosis in early childhood because some symptoms take years to develop.\n\n【18】If NF1 is suspected, further tests such as scans, blood tests or a biopsy may be recommended. This is to assess whether your child has other symptoms or conditions associated with NF1.\n\n【19】If there's uncertainty about the diagnosis, your child may be able to have a blood test to see whether they have the faulty NF1 gene. However, the test is not completely reliable: around 5% of children who test negative for the faulty gene still develop NF1.\n\n【20】### Before and during pregnancy\n\n【21】Couples with a family history of NF1 may wish to consider their options before having a baby. A GP can refer you to a genetic counsellor to discuss your options.\n\n【22】These may include:\n\n【23】*   having a child with a donor egg or sperm\n*   adopting a child\n*   having a test during pregnancy – either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis to see if your baby will have NF1\n*   pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and tested to make sure they do not have the NF1 gene, before being implanted into the womb\n\n【24】Treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1\n--------------------------------------\n\n【25】There's currently no cure for NF1. Treatment involves regular monitoring and treating any problems as they occur.\n\n【26】Treatment can involve:\n\n【27】*   surgery – to remove tumours and treat problems with bones\n*   medicine – to control secondary conditions, such as high blood pressure\n*   physiotherapy\n*   psychological support\n*   pain management\n\n【28】Careful monitoring and treatment can help people with NF1 live a full life. However, there's a risk of developing serious problems, such as certain types of cancer, that can reduce life expectancy.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating neurofibromatosis type 1</u>\n\n【29】NF1 and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【30】If you become pregnant while living with NF1, you should be able to have a healthy pregnancy.\n\n【31】However, the number of neurofibromas may increase because of hormone changes. Make sure you're cared for by an obstetrician with knowledge of NF1, or speak to your NF1 specialist.\n\n【32】Support from charities\n----------------------\n\n【33】Nerve Tumours UK is a charity that aims to improve the lives of people with either type of neurofibromatosis.\n\n【34】You can find out more on the Nerve Tumours UK website, call its helpline on 07939 046 030 or email info@nervetumours.org.uk.\n\n【35】The Childhood Tumour Trust also provides information and support for young people and their families who may be affected by NF1.\n\n【36】NF1 and breast cancer\n---------------------\n\n【37】Women under 50 with NF1 have an increased risk of breast cancer and should start having breast screening appointments when they're 40 years old.\n\n【38】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【39】If you or your child has NF1, your clinical team will pass information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【40】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

However, many people do not have any problems.\n\n【12】The most common symptoms experienced during an episode are:\n\n【13】*   hot flushes\n*   a forceful or rapid heartbeat (heart palpitations)\n*   feeling lighthead\n\n【14】Less common symptoms during an episode include:\n\n【15】*   headache\n*   chest pain\n*   feeling sick\n*   diarrhoea\n\n【16】The episodes are caused by the mast cells suddenly releasing excessive amounts of histamine, usually after you're exposed to certain triggers.\n\n【17】Triggers known to cause episodes include:\n\n【18】*   physical factors – such as heat, overheating, cold, fatigue and physical exertion\n*   emotional factors – such as stress and excitement\n*   insect bites or stings\n*   infection – such as a cold or flu\n*   alcohol\n*   certain medications – such as ibuprofen, aspirin and antibiotics\n*   certain foods – such as cheese, shellfish and spices\n\n【19】Abnormal mast cells in your bone marrow and organs can also cause related symptoms, including:\n\n【20】*   stomach pain caused by peptic ulcers\n*   joint pain\n*   weakness\n*   fatigue\n*   changes in mental state – such as confusion, irritability, poor attention span and impaired memory\n\n【21】In more severe cases of mastocytosis, the following symptoms may occur:\n\n【22】*   weight loss\n*   swelling of the lymph nodes\n*   swelling of the liver – which can cause jaundice and make you feel lethargic\n*   swelling of the spleen – which can cause tummy and shoulder pain\n\n【23】Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n--------------------------------\n\n【24】Some people with severe symptoms experience a sudden fall in blood pressure during an attack. \n\n【25】Low blood pressure (hypotension) can trigger a number of associated symptoms, such as:\n\n【26】*   dizziness\n*   fainting\n*   blurred vision\n*   confusion\n*   generally feeling weak\n\n【27】Severe allergic reaction\n------------------------\n\n【28】If you have systemic mastocytosis or extensive cutaneous mastocytosis, your risk of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is increased.\n\n【29】It's important to look out for the initial symptoms of anaphylaxis, which include:\n\n【30】*   itchy skin or a raised, red rash\n*   swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet\n*   feeling lightheaded or faint\n*   narrowing of the airways, which can cause wheezing and breathing difficulties\n*   stomach pain\n*   feeling and being sick\n\n【31】Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think you or someone else is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 30 December 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 30 December 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Mastocytosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:06:04", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:06:48", "cost": 44.388}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:06:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:06:02"}

If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【12】When to take it\n---------------\n\n【13】You’ll usually take furosemide once a day in the morning.\n\n【14】Sometimes you’ll take it twice a day – once in the morning and again at lunchtime. Occasionally, you take it every other day.\n\n【15】You do not need to take furosemide at the same time every day. You can occasionally take it at a different time if it's more convenient for you, for example if you need to go out for a few hours in the morning and you will not be near a toilet.\n\n【16】Try not to take furosemide too late in the day (after 4pm) or at night, otherwise you may have to wake up to go to the toilet. Your doctor or pharmacist will suggest the best times for you to take your medicine.\n\n【17】If you get ill while taking it\n------------------------------\n\n【18】Contact your doctor if:\n\n【19】*   you have a high temperature\n*   you’re sweating and shaking\n*   you’re being sick (vomiting) or have severe diarrhoea\n\n【20】Your doctor may recommend you stop taking furosemide for 1 to 2 days until you are better. You can start taking it again when you're eating and drinking normally.\n\n【21】If you take furosemide when you have an illness that makes you dehydrated, it can make the dehydration worse.\n\n【22】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【23】Depending on why you're on furosemide, you may have to take it for a long time, even for the rest of your life.\n\n【24】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【25】If you forget to take your dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is after 4pm. In this case, leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【26】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【27】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicines.\n\n【28】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【29】Taking too much furosemide can cause headaches, make you feel dizzy, have a pounding or irregular heartbeat and make you faint. You may also pee more than normal and feel thirsty.\n\n【30】The amount of furosemide that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【31】Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【32】You take more than your prescribed dose of furosemide and:\n\n【33】*   feel unwell\n*   you are over 65 (even if you feel well)\n*   you have kidney, liver or heart failure (even if you feel well)\n\n【34】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【35】Call 111 if you need advice about a child under the age of 5 years.\n\n【36】If you go to A&E, take the furosemide packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【37】Stopping furosemide\n-------------------\n\n【38】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking furosemide.\n\n【39】Stopping it may cause your blood pressure to rise, and this may increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n【40】If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe you a different medicine.\n删除11：<u>More in Furosemide\n------------------\n\n【41】*   About furosemide\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking furosemide with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 February 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:41:50", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:42:04", "cost": 13.282}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:53", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:42:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:40:37"}

The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it's likely to be.\n\n【17】Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include:\n\n【18】*   antiviral medicines\n*   steroid injections\n*   treatments to help control the immune system\n*   antibiotics or antifungal medicines\n*   painkillers to reduce discomfort or a high temperature\n*   medicine to control seizures or fits\n*   support with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator)\n\n【19】How long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months.\n\n【20】Recovering from encephalitis\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Some people eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process.\n\n【22】Many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems caused by damage to their brain.\n\n【23】Common complications include:\n\n【24】*   memory loss (amnesia)\n*   frequent seizures or fits\n*   personality and behavioural changes\n*   problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving\n*   persistent tiredness\n\n【25】These problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends.\n\n【26】But help and support is available.\n\n【27】Preventing encephalitis\n-----------------------\n\n【28】It's not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations.\n\n【29】These include the:\n\n【30】*   measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine – a routine vaccination offered to all children in England\n*   Japanese encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas, such as parts of Asia\n*   tick-borne encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to certain parts of Europe (but not the UK) and Asia\n*   rabies vaccination – recommended for travellers to at-risk where access to medical care is likely to be limited. Find out about rabies risks in terrestrial animals by country on GOV.UK.\n\n【31】Speak to a GP surgery if you're not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you're planning to travel abroad and do not know if you need any vaccinations.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:04:28", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:06:38", "cost": 129.756}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:06:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:04:27"}

Overview\n2.  What happens\n3.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Stem cell or bone marrow transplants are complex treatments that carry a significant risk of serious complications.**\n\n【3】It's important that you're aware of both the risks and possible benefits before treatment begins. You may wish to discuss them with your treatment team and your family.\n\n【4】Generally speaking, younger people who do not have any other serious conditions or those who receive transplants from a closely matched sibling are less likely to experience serious problems. People receiving transplants of their own stem cells (autologous transplants) are also less likely to experience serious side effects.\n\n【5】Graft versus host disease (GvHD)\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】Sometimes, the transplanted cells recognise the recipient's cells as \"foreign\" and attack them. This is known as graft versus host disease (GvHD).\n\n【7】GvHD can happen within a few months of the transplant or develop several months, or occasionally a year or 2, later. The condition is usually mild but can sometimes be life-threatening.\n\n【8】Symptoms of GvHD can include:\n\n【9】*   an itchy rash\n*   diarrhoea\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   a sensitive and dry mouth\n*   dry eyes\n*   dry, flaky skin\n*   shortness of breath\n*   joint pain\n*   yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin (jaundice)\n\n【10】Tell your treatment team if you develop these symptoms. GvHD can be treated with medicines that suppress your immune system and stop the transplanted stem cells attacking the rest of your body.\n\n【11】Reduced number of blood cells\n-----------------------------\n\n【12】In preparation for a stem cell transplant, you'll need to have chemotherapy to destroy the damaged or diseased blood cells. These will eventually be replaced by the transplanted stem cells, although this process can take several weeks or more.\n\n【13】Until your body starts being able to produce healthy blood cells again, you may be at risk of:\n\n【14】*   iron deficiency anaemia – a lack of red blood cells that can make you feel tired and short of breath; this may be treated with regular blood transfusions\n*   excessive bleeding or bruising caused by a lack of clotting cells called platelets; you may need transfusions of platelets if this is a problem\n*   infections – a lack of white blood cells and any immunosuppressant medicine you're taking will mean your body is not able to fight off infections\n\n【15】You'll need to stay in a special germ-free hospital room during the first few weeks after the transplant. After going home, you'll need to be careful about coming into contact with people with infections and take steps to prevent food poisoning.\n\n【16】You may also be given antibiotics to prevent or treat any bacterial infections.\n\n【17】Chemotherapy side effects\n-------------------------\n\n【18】Common side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\n【19】*   feeling and being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   loss of appetite\n*   mouth ulcers\n*   tiredness\n*   rashes\n*   hair loss\n\n【20】These side effects are usually temporary and only last a few weeks. Hair usually grows back within a few months.\n\n【21】However, high-dose chemotherapy can also have some long-lasting effects, including permanent infertility, which affects most people who have the treatment.\n\n【22】Your treatment team will talk to you about the risk before treatment starts and the possible ways of having children in the future. This may include procedures to collect and freeze eggs or sperm, although this is not always possible.\n删除7：<u>Read more about fertility and chemotherapy from Cancer Research UK</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:18", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:46", "cost": 87.521}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:17"}

This can improve your mood.\n\n【4】For pain or preventing migraines, dosulepin can change the way your nerves receive pain signals. This can help with some kinds of nerve pain, including fibromyalgia. It can also help prevent migraine attacks.\n\n【5】How long does it take to work?\n\n【6】Do not expect to feel better overnight. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they feel better.\n\n【7】For depression, it usually takes 4 to 6 weeks for dosulepin to work fully. It usually takes 2 to 6 weeks if you are taking dosulepin for pain or migraine.\n\n【8】Talk to your doctor if you're not feeling any better after taking dosulepin for 6 weeks, if you're worried about side effects, or if you're having thoughts of harming yourself.\n\n【9】How will it make me feel?\n\n【10】For depression, dosulepin helps to lift your mood so you feel better. You may notice that you sleep better and are feeling less anxious.\n\n【11】Dosulepin will not change your personality. It'll simply help you feel like yourself again.\n\n【12】Some people feel a little drowsy with dosulepin, which is why it may be better to take it in the evening.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】Dosulepin is safe to take for a long time as long as you're not getting side effects. There do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months and years.\n\n【15】Why is dosulepin prescribed less often now?\n\n【16】Dosulepin is not recommended for new patients now. It can be harmful for some people and is very dangerous if you take too much.\n\n【17】It's still sometimes prescribed for people who are already using it who have not had serious side effects.\n\n【18】If you have not had it before, it's unlikely to be prescribed for you. A specialist (such as a psychiatrist or a pain consultant) might prescribe it if other medicines have not worked and they think it's the best choice for you.\n\n【19】How does it compare with other antidepressants?\n\n【20】Dosulepin does not work any better or worse than other antidepressants, though sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than another. But it is not often prescribed now because of the greater risk of serious heart problems if you're taking a higher dose.\n\n【21】It may be safer to take a different antidepressant in the tricyclic group, such as amitriptyline, or another type of antidepressant.\n\n【22】Talk to your doctor if you are not feeling any better on dosulepin or you're worried about side effects.\n\n【23】Can I still get dosulepin if it helps my depression?\n\n【24】If you have been taking dosulepin for a while, your doctor may suggest trying a different medicine instead.\n\n【25】There are many alternative antidepressants to dosulepin now. They are safer and have fewer side effects. It's also possible you'll no longer need to take an antidepressant at all.\n\n【26】But if dosulepin works for you and you have not had any serious side effects with it, your doctor may still prescribe it for you if a consultant or another health specialist agrees this is still the best treatment option for you.\n\n【27】Can I still get dosulepin if it helps my pain?\n\n【28】Dosulepin is sometimes used to treat some types of nerve pain, such as fibromyalgia, or to prevent migraine. But it's not recommended for, or officially approved for, pain relief.\n\n【29】Because of this, your doctor will probably prescribe other medicines. If you're already taking dosulepin, they may suggest switching to something else.\n\n【30】Other possible treatments include:\n\n【31】*   painkillers, like paracetamol or co-codamol\n*   some antidepressants that also help with pain, such as amitriptyline\n*   medicines that are usually used for epilepsy, such as pregabalin\n*   medicines that are usually used to treat high blood pressure, such as bisoprolol\n\n【32】Your doctor may also suggest physiotherapy as an alternative.\n\n【33】Finding the most suitable treatment depends on how long you have had the pain, your symptoms, and what medicines have and have not worked for you in the past.\n\n【34】Are there other treatments that can help my depression?\n\n【35】Antidepressants, including dosulepin, are just one of several approaches to treating depression. Other potential treatments include:\n\n【36】*   talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n*   exercise programmes\n*   help to get a good night's sleep\n\n【37】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【38】*   how long you have had depression\n*   your symptoms\n*   whether you have had depression before\n*   whether previous treatment has worked\n*   how likely you are to stick with your treatment\n*   the potential side effects\n*   your preferences and priorities\n\n【39】If you're interested in any of these treatments, talk to your doctor.\n\n【40】Is it addictive?\n\n【41】Dosulepin is not addictive, but you may get withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking it, especially if you stop taking it suddenly. These withdrawal symptoms are the side effects of coming off the medicine.\n\n【42】The side effects are usually harmless but unpleasant. They may include headaches, flu-like symptoms, feeling sick, finding it hard to sleep, and feeling restless or anxious.\n\n【43】To help prevent these side effects, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks.\n\n【44】### Important\n\n【45】Do not stop taking dosulepin suddenly, or without talking to your doctor.\n\n【46】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【47】Dosulepin can change how hungry you feel. Some people feel more hungry when they're taking it, and others feel less hungry. So your weight may change when you first start taking it.\n\n【48】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking dosulepin, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【49】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【50】Dosulepin does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【51】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【52】The good effects of dosulepin may, after a while, improve your sex life as your mood lifts and you become interested in life and relationships again.\n\n【53】Some of the possible negative effects include:\n\n【54】*   problems with getting an erection and problems ejaculating\n*   some vaginal bleeding\n*   breast swelling\n\n【55】Sexual side effects are not common and should pass after the first couple of weeks. If they do not and this is a problem for you, go back to your doctor to see if there's another antidepressant you can try.\n\n【56】If you're a woman and you get vaginal bleeding after the menopause, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【57】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【58】Some people feel sleepy while they're taking dosulepin. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools until you feel better.\n\n【59】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking dosulepin. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【60】Can I drink alcohol while taking dosulepin?\n\n【61】You can drink alcohol while taking dosulepin, but it may make you feel sleepy. It might be best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine makes you feel.\n\n【62】The serious side effects of dosulepin can be made worse by binge drinking. If you're drinking alcohol with dosulepin, it's best to cut down the amount you drink.\n\n【63】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【64】You can eat and drink normally while taking dosulepin.\n\n【65】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【66】Taking cannabis with dosulepin can make you feel very sleepy, especially if you have just started taking the medicine. Using the two together can also give you a fast heartbeat.\n\n【67】It can be dangerous to take dosulepin with:\n\n【68】*   methadone\n*   stimulants like MDMA (ecstasy) or cocaine\n*   hallucinogens like LSD\n*   novel psychoactive substances (which used to be known as legal highs) like mephedrone\n\n【69】Dosulepin has not been properly tested with recreational drugs. Talk to your doctor if you think you might use recreational drugs while taking dosulepin.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Dosulepin\n-----------------\n\n【70】*   About dosulepin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking dosulepin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:52:07", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:55:55", "cost": 228.043}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:55:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:52:06"}

About olanzapine\n--------------------\n\n【4】Olanzapine helps to manage symptoms of mental health conditions such as:\n\n【5】*   seeing, hearing, feeling or believing things that others do not, feeling unusually suspicious or having muddled thoughts (schizophrenia)\n*   feeling agitated or hyperactive, very excited, elated, or impulsive (mania symptoms of bipolar disorder)\n\n【6】If you have bipolar disorder, olanzapine can also stop your mania symptoms coming back.\n\n【7】Olanzapine does not cure your condition, but it can help with your symptoms.\n\n【8】Olanzapine comes as tablets, including tablets that dissolve in your mouth (orodispersible), and an injection.\n\n【9】Olanzapine is only available with a prescription.\n\n【10】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【11】*   Olanzapine does not work straight away. It may take several days, or even weeks, for some of your symptoms to start improving.\n*   Soon after you first start taking olanzapine, before your other symptoms improve, it may make you feel more relaxed and calm.\n*   Common side effects include: feeling sleepy, feeling dizzy, and constipation.\n*   Olanzapine belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics. It works by affecting the naturally occurring chemical messengers in your brain (neurotransmitters), like dopamine and serotonin.\n*   It’s important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel better, unless your doctor asks you to stop.\n\n【12】3\\. Who can and cannot use olanzapine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【13】Olanzapine can be taken by adults aged 18 years and over.\n\n【14】Olanzapine is not suitable for some people.

How and when to take olanzapine\n-----------------------------------\n\n【17】Olanzapine is a prescription medicine. It’s important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【18】### Dosage and strength\n\n【19】Olanzapine tablets come in different strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg and 20mg.\n\n【20】How much you take will depend on what you’re taking it for. Your doctor may ask you to adjust your dose depending on how well olanzapine works for you.\n\n【21】If you have problems with your kidneys or liver, your doctor may ask you to take a lower dose and increase your dose very slowly.\n\n【22】#### Dosage for schizophrenia\n\n【23】The usual starting dose for:\n\n【24】*   adults aged 64 and younger is 10mg, taken once a day\n*   adults aged 65 or over is 5mg, taken once a day\n\n【25】#### Dosage for mania symptoms of bipolar disorder\n\n【26】You’ll usually start on 15mg, taken once a day. If you’re taking other medicines to help your symptoms, you may start on 10mg.\n\n【27】#### Dosage to prevent mania symptoms coming back\n\n【28】You’ll usually start on a dose of 10mg, taken once a day. If you have been taking olanzapine to treat your mania symptoms, you may stay on the same dose.\n\n【29】### How to take olanzapine\n\n【30】Take olanzapine once a day, at the same time each day.\n\n【31】You can take it with or without food.\n\n【32】#### How to take tablets\n\n【33】Swallow your tablet whole with a drink of water.\n\n【34】#### How to take tablets that dissolve in your mouth (orodispersible)\n\n【35】Place the tablet on your tongue and let it dissolve. You can have a drink of water afterwards if you want.\n\n【36】You can also put the tablet into a small glass of water, orange juice, apple juice or milk. Stir the mixture well until the tablet is dissolved and then drink all of it straight away to make sure you get the full dose.\n\n【37】#### How to have injections\n\n【38】Injections are given into the muscle of your buttock every 2 to 4 weeks by a doctor or nurse. This would usually be in a specialist clinic.\n\n【39】#### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【40】Your doctor may ask you to increase or decrease your dose, but this will depend on how well olanzapine works to help manage your symptoms.\n\n【41】Most people feel better with daily doses of 5mg to 20mg. It may take a few weeks to get to the right dose that works for you.\n\n【42】#### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【43】If you forget a dose of olanzapine, take it as soon as you remember, unless you only remember the next day. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【44】Contact your doctor if you miss 2 or more doses.\n\n【45】Do not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【46】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【47】#### What if I take too much?\n\n【48】Taking too much olanzapine can lead to serious side effects.\n\n【49】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【50】You take more than your prescribed dose of olanzapine and:\n\n【51】*   feel sleepy or tired\n*   have unusual body movements, especially face or tongue movements\n*   have problems standing and walking\n*   feel dizzy\n\n【52】Call 111 or visit 111.nhs.uk\n\n【53】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself.

How to cope with side effects of olanzapine\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【82】**What to do about:**\n\n【83】*   **feeling sleepy in the day** – do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling this way. Do not drink alcohol as this will make you feel more tired. As your body gets used to olanzapine, these side effects should wear off. If they do not get better after a few weeks, speak to your doctor.\n*   **putting on weight or an increase in your appetite** – try to eat a healthy, balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes. Do not snack on foods that contain a lot of calories, such as crisps, cakes, biscuits and sweets. If you feel hungry between meals, eat fruit and vegetables and low-calorie foods. Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable.\n*   **feeling dizzy when standing up** – stand up slowly and hold on to something to steady your balance until your dizziness has passed. It should only last a few moments. As you get used to your medicine this problem should wear off.\n*   **rash** – it may help to take an antihistamine which you can buy from a pharmacy. Ask your pharmacist which type is suitable for you to take while you are on olanzapine\n*   **constipation** – eat more high-fibre foods such as fresh fruit, vegetables and cereals. Try to drink several glasses of water or another non-alcoholic liquid every day. If you can, it may also help to increase your exercise.\n*   **sexual problems** – see your doctor.\n*   **problems with your movement** – see your doctor.\n*   **infections** – see your doctor.\n\n【84】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【85】### Olanzapine and pregnancy\n\n【86】Olanzapine can be taken during pregnancy and is not thought to be harmful to your baby. Your mental health and wellbeing are important.\n\n【87】If you become pregnant while taking olanzapine, speak to your doctor. You will be reviewed in a specialised antenatal clinic and you can discuss your medicine with the doctors in the clinic.\n\n【88】Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【89】### Olanzapine and breastfeeding\n\n【90】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take olanzapine while breastfeeding.\n\n【91】Olanzapine passes into breast milk in very small amounts and has been linked with side effects in very few breastfed babies. Many people have used it while breastfeeding without any problems.\n\n【92】It's important to keep taking olanzapine to keep you well. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【93】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy or seems irritable, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【94】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【95】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【96】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how olanzapine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【97】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【98】There are some medicines that may affect how olanzapine works.\n\n【99】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you’re taking:\n\n【100】*   carbamazepine, a medicine for epilepsy\n*   fluvoxamine, used to treat depression\n*   ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic\n*   medicines that make you feel calm or sleepy including benzodiazepines, painkillers like morphine or tramadol, or antihistamines like chlorphenamine – olanzapine can increase the effects of these medicines and make you feel more sleepy\n\n【101】### Mixing olanzapine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【102】Cannabidiol (also known as CBD) might affect how olanzapine works. Do not take cannabidiol while you are taking olanzapine.\n\n【103】There might be a problem taking some other herbal remedies and supplements with olanzapine, especially ones that make you feel sleepy or dizzy.\n\n【104】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【105】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【106】9\\. Common questions about olanzapine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【107】How does olanzapine work?\n\n【108】Olanzapine belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics. It does not cure your condition, but it can help to improve the symptoms of mental health conditions.\n\n【109】Olanzapine works by affecting naturally occurring chemical messengers in your brain (neurotransmitters), like dopamine.\n\n【110】If you have too much dopamine it can make you see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations), or think things that others do not (delusions). Dopamine is also involved in muscle movements, so too much of it can affect your muscles.\n\n【111】Olanzapine also works on other neurotransmitters such as serotonin and noradrenaline. Olanzapine rebalances these to improve your mood and behaviour.\n\n【112】Taking olanzapine will not change your personality and it is not addictive.\n\n【113】How long does it take to work?\n\n【114】Olanzapine, like many medicines, does not work straight away. It can take a few weeks to get the dose right for you.\n\n【115】It may take several days or even weeks for some of your symptoms to get better.\n\n【116】How long will I take it for?\n\n【117】This will depend on why you need olanzapine.\n\n【118】If you’re taking olanzapine for:\n\n【119】*   schizophrenia – you may need to take olanzapine for a long time, and some people take it for years\n*   bipolar disorder – you may need to take olanzapine for a few weeks or months\n\n【120】Carry on taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you to, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【121】How will olanzapine make me feel?\n\n【122】When you first start taking olanzapine, it may make you feel more relaxed and calm. Within 2 to 3 weeks, your other symptoms may start to improve.\n\n【123】You may find olanzapine makes you:\n\n【124】*   able to concentrate better, and think more clearly\n*   able to get things done and stay focused\n*   remember things more easily\n*   feel more comfortable with other people and get along with them better\n*   more aware of what is real and what is not real\n*   stop hearing voices\n\n【125】Can I take olanzapine for a long time?\n\n【126】Yes, many people take olanzapine for a long time, including for many months or years, without any problems.\n\n【127】Olanzapine can increase the amount of sugar in your blood and this can sometimes lead to diabetes. Keeping to a healthy weight can help to prevent this. It’s not a common side effect of olanzapine and affects less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【128】You will usually have a blood test before you start olanzapine treatment to see how much sugar you have in your blood.\n\n【129】You will have another test around 12 weeks after starting olanzapine to see if the amount of sugar in your blood has changed. If it’s OK, then you will have a test each year to check your blood sugar.\n\n【130】If you already have diabetes you will be monitored more closely and will have more regular blood sugar tests. For example, you may have a test every 4 weeks to start with and then around 4 times a year.\n\n【131】Taking olanzapine for a long time can sometimes affect your cholesterol. If this happens, you may need to take a statin to help lower your cholesterol.\n\n【132】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【133】Olanzapine helps to control your symptoms. Do not stop taking olanzapine suddenly otherwise your symptoms may come back.\n\n【134】If you need to stop taking olanzapine, your doctor will help you come off it by reducing your dose gradually. This will help prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【135】Withdrawal symptoms include:\n\n【136】*   feeling or being sick\n*   sweating\n*   difficulty sleeping\n\n【137】Talk to your doctor first if you want to go onto a lower dose or to stop taking olanzapine.\n\n【138】How does it compare with other antipsychotic medicines?\n\n【139】The antipsychotic medicine you are prescribed will depend on the type of symptoms you have, how bad your symptoms are, any other medical conditions you have and how well your medicine works for you.\n\n【140】It will also depend on whether it’s best for you to take your medicine as tablets or an injection, and whether the medicine has any side effects that may affect you.\n\n【141】You may have to try a few before you find the antipsychotic medicine that is right for you. It can take time to find the right type and dose to manage your symptoms.\n\n【142】Different antipsychotic medicines have different side effects. When deciding on the best medicine for you, it’s important to discuss with your doctor what the possible side effects are and how they may affect you.\n\n【143】How does olanzapine compare to lithium for bipolar disorder?\n\n【144】Lithium is usually the first medicine used to treat bipolar disorder. It’s a long-term treatment for episodes of mania and depression and is often prescribed for at least 6 months.\n\n【145】Lithium is a mood stabiliser, which means it helps to balance your mood and control symptoms of mania as well as depression.\n\n【146】Olanzapine also helps with symptoms of mania. However, you will need to take it with another medicine to also manage your depression symptoms.\n\n【147】You can discuss with your doctor which treatment will be best for you. It will depend on the type of symptoms you have, any other medical conditions you have and whether you might be more likely to have side effects with some medicines.\n\n【148】Can olanzapine be used to treat anxiety?\n\n【149】There’s been some research into using olanzapine for anxiety, but this medicine has not yet been approved as a treatment.\n\n【150】Your doctor will use other medicines as a first choice if you have anxiety.\n\n【151】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【152】It’s best not to drink alcohol for the first few days of treatment, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【153】If you drink alcohol while taking olanzapine it may make you feel sleepy and unsteady on your feet.\n\n【154】Drinking alcohol every day or in large amounts can make your symptoms worse. It also makes it harder for olanzapine to work properly.\n\n【155】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【156】You will not usually lose weight on olanzapine. It can make you feel more hungry than usual, so you may put on weight.\n\n【157】Try to eat a healthy balanced diet, without increasing your portion sizes.\n\n【158】Do not snack on foods that contain a lot of calories, such as crisps, cakes, biscuits and sweets. If you feel hungry between meals, eat fruit and vegetables and low-calorie foods.\n\n【159】If you are worried about gaining or losing weight while taking olanzapine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【160】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【161】Apart from limiting alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while taking olanzapine.\n\n【162】However, olanzapine can make you feel hungrier and put on weight.\n\n【163】If you have an increased appetite, try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes.\n\n【164】Do not snack on foods that contain a lot of calories, such as crisps, cakes, biscuits and sweets. If you feel hungry between meals, eat fruit and vegetables and low-calorie foods.\n\n【165】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【166】Olanzapine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【167】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【168】Olanzapine can affect your hormones and sometimes causes sexual problems, such as less interest in sex (reduced libido) in men or women, and problems getting an erection. It can also affect periods.\n\n【169】These effects happen in fewer than 1 in 10 people.\n\n【170】If you would like to start a family, then talk to your doctor if you have any of these problems or if you have any concerns.\n\n【171】Can olanzapine affect my sex life?\n\n【172】Olanzapine is a type of medicine called an antipsychotic. Most antipsychotic medicines can cause sexual problems, but some are more likely to cause problems than others.\n\n【173】If you feel you have a sexual problem of any kind while taking olanzapine, including less interest in sex (reduced libido) or problems getting an erection, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will be able to help you and may change your olanzapine treatment so that the sexual problems improve or go away.\n\n【174】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【175】Olanzapine can make you feel sleepy. If this happens to you, do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n\n【176】Some people find it hard to concentrate while they are taking olanzapine. When you first start taking it, it's a good idea to stop driving and cycling for the first few days until you know how the medicine makes you feel.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【177】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Schizophrenia\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【178】*   HealthUnlocked: olanzapine forum\n*   Bipolar UK: charity\n*   Mind: charity\n*   Rethink Mental Illness: charity\n*   Young Minds - Medications: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 July 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": []}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:41:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:36:37"}

About sodium valproate\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】It's occasionally used to prevent migraine headaches.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It also comes as granules that you mix with food or drink.\n\n【7】Sodium valproate can also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.\n\n【8】If taken during pregnancy, sodium valproate can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【9】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take sodium valproate then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【10】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【11】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【12】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking sodium valproate or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【13】If you do need to continue sodium valproate then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking sodium valproate.\n\n【14】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking sodium valproate. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n【16】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【17】*   You'll usually take sodium valproate once or twice a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are similar to sodium valproate and work in the same way. However these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, sodium valproate is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe sodium valproate for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【18】3\\. Who can and cannot take sodium valproate\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Sodium valproate can be taken by adults and children to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【20】It can be taken by adults (aged 18 and above) to help prevent migraine.\n\n【21】Sodium valproate is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take sodium valproate must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【22】To make sure sodium valproate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【23】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to sodium valproate or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic illness such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【24】4\\. How and when to take sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Sodium valproate is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【26】### Dosage\n\n【27】The usual dose for treating epilepsy in:\n\n【28】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses. Some people take a higher dose of 2,500mg a day\n*   younger children (aged 1 month to 11 years) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【29】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder in:\n\n【30】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【31】The usual dose for preventing migraine in:\n\n【32】*   adults – daily doses vary from a single dose of 400mg to 1,500mg split into 2 doses\n\n【33】If your doctor tells you to take sodium valproate twice a day, you'll usually take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening (to make up your full daily dose).\n\n【34】If you're taking sodium valproate and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【35】### How to take it\n\n【36】Sodium valproate comes as slow release (prolonged or sustained release) tablets, capsules and granules, gastro-resistant tablets, crushable tablets, and as a liquid.\n\n【37】Slow release medicine passes into your body gradually.\n\n【38】Gastro-resistant tablets release the medicine as soon as it passes through your stomach. This means the sodium valproate is less likely to upset your stomach.\n\n【39】You can take sodium valproate with or without food, but it's best to stick to the same way each time. Do not take it with food some days and without food on other days.\n\n【40】#### How to take slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【41】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【42】You'll usually take them once a day, unless you're on a high dose and your doctor tells you to take your medicine twice a day.\n\n【43】#### How to take slow release granules\n\n【44】Add the granules to a small drink, then stir and swallow it. If you prefer, sprinkle the granules onto any soft food that you can swallow whole. Do not chew the granules.\n\n【45】Your doctor will tell you to take these either once or twice a day.\n\n【46】#### How to take gastro-resistant tablets\n\n【47】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【48】You'll usually take these twice a day.\n\n【49】#### How to take crushable tablets\n\n【50】Crush the tablets using the back of a spoon and mix the powder with some soft food that you can swallow whole. If you prefer, add the powder to a small drink, then stir and swallow it.\n\n【51】You'll usually take this medicine twice a day.\n\n【52】#### How to take liquid\n\n【53】Use the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with your medicine to measure the correct dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【54】You'll usually take the liquid twice a day.\n\n【55】### When to take sodium valproate\n\n【56】If you're taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.\n\n【57】If you're taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【58】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【59】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【60】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.\n\n【61】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【62】If you've missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.\n\n【63】If you take sodium valproate:\n\n【64】*   **once a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within a few hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n*   **twice a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n\n【65】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【66】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【67】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I take too much?\n\n【69】Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【70】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【71】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【72】*   you take too much sodium valproate and feel unwell\n\n【73】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【74】If you need to go to A&E, take the sodium valproate packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【75】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【76】Like all medicines, sodium valproate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【77】### Common side effects\n\n【78】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【79】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【80】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【81】### Serious side effects\n\n【82】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking sodium valproate. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【83】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking sodium valproate have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【84】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【85】In rare cases, sodium valproate may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【86】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【87】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【88】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【89】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【90】These are not all the side effects of sodium valproate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【91】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【92】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【93】6\\. How to cope with side effects of sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【94】**What to do about:**\n\n【95】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take sodium valproate with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to sodium valproate, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking sodium valproate, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of sodium valproate, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and sodium valproate can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of sodium valproate. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【96】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【97】### Sodium valproate and pregnancy\n\n【98】Sodium valproate is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【99】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【100】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【101】If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【102】Your doctor may continue to prescribe sodium valproate, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【103】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to sodium valproate.\n\n【104】Information:\n\n【105】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【106】### Sodium valproate and breastfeeding\n\n【107】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take sodium valproate while breastfeeding.\n\n【108】Sodium valproate passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【109】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend sodium valproate if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【110】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【111】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【112】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n\n【113】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【114】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【115】### More information\n\n【116】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how sodium valproate can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate, available in different languages\n*   valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【117】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【118】There are some medicines that may affect how sodium valproate works. Sodium valproate can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【119】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【120】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【121】### Mixing sodium valproate with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【122】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with sodium valproate.\n\n【123】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【124】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【125】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【126】9\\. Common questions about sodium valproate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【127】How does sodium valproate work?\n\n【128】Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【129】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【130】It's not clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【131】When will I feel better?\n\n【132】It takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【133】How long will I take it for?\n\n【134】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.\n\n【135】Can I get addicted to sodium valproate?\n\n【136】Sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.\n\n【137】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【138】Many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.\n\n【139】However, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【140】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【141】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【142】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【143】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【144】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【145】Are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?\n\n【146】Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【147】If you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.\n\n【148】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【149】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【150】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【151】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【152】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【153】Sodium valproate works for several different types of epilepsy. If it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【154】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【155】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【156】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【157】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【158】Sodium valproate is not used as often for preventing migraine. However, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【159】Your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【160】How does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【161】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【162】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【163】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【164】Do I need to stick to the same brand of sodium valproate?\n\n【165】Once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. This is because it can be a problem to swap from modified release to gastro-resistant tablets.\n\n【166】Some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate. For example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. If you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.\n\n【167】However, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.\n\n【168】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【169】Do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【170】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.\n\n【171】If you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【172】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【173】Sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【174】If you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【175】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【176】Drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【177】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【178】Sodium valproate can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【179】In men sodium valproate has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【180】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Sodium valproate has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【181】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how sodium valproate may affect your fertility.\n\n【182】Sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking sodium valproate and want to start a family, it's important to talk your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking sodium valproate while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【183】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【184】Sodium valproate does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【185】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【186】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【187】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【188】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking sodium valproate. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【189】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【190】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【191】Information:\n\n【192】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【193】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【194】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【195】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls of taking sodium valproate.

About sodium valproate\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】It's occasionally used to prevent migraine headaches.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It also comes as granules that you mix with food or drink.\n\n【7】Sodium valproate can also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.\n\n【8】If taken during pregnancy, sodium valproate can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【9】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take sodium valproate then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【10】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【11】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【12】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking sodium valproate or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【13】If you do need to continue sodium valproate then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking sodium valproate.\n\n【14】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking sodium valproate. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n【16】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【17】*   You'll usually take sodium valproate once or twice a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are similar to sodium valproate and work in the same way. However these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, sodium valproate is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe sodium valproate for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【18】3\\. Who can and cannot take sodium valproate\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Sodium valproate can be taken by adults and children to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【20】It can be taken by adults (aged 18 and above) to help prevent migraine.\n\n【21】Sodium valproate is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take sodium valproate must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【22】To make sure sodium valproate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【23】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to sodium valproate or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic illness such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【24】4\\. How and when to take sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Sodium valproate is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【26】### Dosage\n\n【27】The usual dose for treating epilepsy in:\n\n【28】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses. Some people take a higher dose of 2,500mg a day\n*   younger children (aged 1 month to 11 years) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【29】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder in:\n\n【30】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【31】The usual dose for preventing migraine in:\n\n【32】*   adults – daily doses vary from a single dose of 400mg to 1,500mg split into 2 doses\n\n【33】If your doctor tells you to take sodium valproate twice a day, you'll usually take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening (to make up your full daily dose).\n\n【34】If you're taking sodium valproate and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【35】### How to take it\n\n【36】Sodium valproate comes as slow release (prolonged or sustained release) tablets, capsules and granules, gastro-resistant tablets, crushable tablets, and as a liquid.\n\n【37】Slow release medicine passes into your body gradually.\n\n【38】Gastro-resistant tablets release the medicine as soon as it passes through your stomach. This means the sodium valproate is less likely to upset your stomach.\n\n【39】You can take sodium valproate with or without food, but it's best to stick to the same way each time. Do not take it with food some days and without food on other days.\n\n【40】#### How to take slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【41】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【42】You'll usually take them once a day, unless you're on a high dose and your doctor tells you to take your medicine twice a day.\n\n【43】#### How to take slow release granules\n\n【44】Add the granules to a small drink, then stir and swallow it. If you prefer, sprinkle the granules onto any soft food that you can swallow whole. Do not chew the granules.\n\n【45】Your doctor will tell you to take these either once or twice a day.\n\n【46】#### How to take gastro-resistant tablets\n\n【47】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【48】You'll usually take these twice a day.\n\n【49】#### How to take crushable tablets\n\n【50】Crush the tablets using the back of a spoon and mix the powder with some soft food that you can swallow whole. If you prefer, add the powder to a small drink, then stir and swallow it.\n\n【51】You'll usually take this medicine twice a day.\n\n【52】#### How to take liquid\n\n【53】Use the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with your medicine to measure the correct dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【54】You'll usually take the liquid twice a day.\n\n【55】### When to take sodium valproate\n\n【56】If you're taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.\n\n【57】If you're taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【58】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【59】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【60】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.\n\n【61】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【62】If you've missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.\n\n【63】If you take sodium valproate:\n\n【64】*   **once a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within a few hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n*   **twice a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n\n【65】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【66】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【67】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I take too much?\n\n【69】Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【70】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【71】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【72】*   you take too much sodium valproate and feel unwell\n\n【73】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【74】If you need to go to A&E, take the sodium valproate packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【75】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【76】Like all medicines, sodium valproate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【77】### Common side effects\n\n【78】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【79】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【80】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【81】### Serious side effects\n\n【82】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking sodium valproate. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【83】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking sodium valproate have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【84】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【85】In rare cases, sodium valproate may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【86】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【87】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【88】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【89】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【90】These are not all the side effects of sodium valproate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【91】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【92】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【93】6\\. How to cope with side effects of sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【94】**What to do about:**\n\n【95】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take sodium valproate with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to sodium valproate, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking sodium valproate, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of sodium valproate, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and sodium valproate can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of sodium valproate. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【96】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【97】### Sodium valproate and pregnancy\n\n【98】Sodium valproate is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【99】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【100】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【101】If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【102】Your doctor may continue to prescribe sodium valproate, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【103】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to sodium valproate.\n\n【104】Information:\n\n【105】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【106】### Sodium valproate and breastfeeding\n\n【107】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take sodium valproate while breastfeeding.\n\n【108】Sodium valproate passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【109】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend sodium valproate if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【110】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【111】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【112】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n\n【113】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【114】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【115】### More information\n\n【116】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how sodium valproate can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate, available in different languages\n*   valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【117】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【118】There are some medicines that may affect how sodium valproate works. Sodium valproate can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【119】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【120】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【121】### Mixing sodium valproate with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【122】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with sodium valproate.\n\n【123】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【124】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【125】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【126】9\\. Common questions about sodium valproate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【127】How does sodium valproate work?\n\n【128】Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【129】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【130】It's not clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【131】When will I feel better?\n\n【132】It takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【133】How long will I take it for?\n\n【134】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.\n\n【135】Can I get addicted to sodium valproate?\n\n【136】Sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.\n\n【137】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【138】Many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.\n\n【139】However, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【140】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【141】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【142】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【143】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【144】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【145】Are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?\n\n【146】Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【147】If you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.\n\n【148】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【149】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【150】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【151】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【152】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【153】Sodium valproate works for several different types of epilepsy. If it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【154】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【155】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【156】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【157】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【158】Sodium valproate is not used as often for preventing migraine. However, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【159】Your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【160】How does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【161】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【162】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【163】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【164】Do I need to stick to the same brand of sodium valproate?\n\n【165】Once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. This is because it can be a problem to swap from modified release to gastro-resistant tablets.\n\n【166】Some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate. For example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. If you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.\n\n【167】However, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.\n\n【168】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【169】Do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【170】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.\n\n【171】If you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【172】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【173】Sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【174】If you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【175】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【176】Drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【177】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【178】Sodium valproate can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【179】In men sodium valproate has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【180】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Sodium valproate has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【181】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how sodium valproate may affect your fertility.\n\n【182】Sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking sodium valproate and want to start a family, it's important to talk your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking sodium valproate while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【183】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【184】Sodium valproate does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【185】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【186】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【187】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【188】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking sodium valproate. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【189】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【190】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【191】Information:\n\n【192】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【193】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【194】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【195】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls of taking sodium valproate.

About sodium valproate\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Sodium valproate is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】It's occasionally used to prevent migraine headaches.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It also comes as granules that you mix with food or drink.\n\n【7】Sodium valproate can also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital.\n\n【8】If taken during pregnancy, sodium valproate can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【9】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take sodium valproate then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【10】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【11】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【12】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking sodium valproate or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【13】If you do need to continue sodium valproate then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking sodium valproate.\n\n【14】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking sodium valproate. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n<mark>【15】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n</mark>【16】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【17】*   You'll usually take sodium valproate once or twice a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are similar to sodium valproate and work in the same way. However these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, sodium valproate is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe sodium valproate for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【18】3\\. Who can and cannot take sodium valproate\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Sodium valproate can be taken by adults and children to treat epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【20】It can be taken by adults (aged 18 and above) to help prevent migraine.\n\n【21】Sodium valproate is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take sodium valproate must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【22】To make sure sodium valproate is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【23】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to sodium valproate or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic illness such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【24】4\\. How and when to take sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【25】Sodium valproate is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【26】### Dosage\n\n【27】The usual dose for treating epilepsy in:\n\n【28】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses. Some people take a higher dose of 2,500mg a day\n*   younger children (aged 1 month to 11 years) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【29】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder in:\n\n【30】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, as 1 dose or split into 2 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【31】The usual dose for preventing migraine in:\n\n【32】*   adults – daily doses vary from a single dose of 400mg to 1,500mg split into 2 doses\n\n【33】If your doctor tells you to take sodium valproate twice a day, you'll usually take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening (to make up your full daily dose).\n\n【34】If you're taking sodium valproate and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【35】### How to take it\n\n【36】Sodium valproate comes as slow release (prolonged or sustained release) tablets, capsules and granules, gastro-resistant tablets, crushable tablets, and as a liquid.\n\n【37】Slow release medicine passes into your body gradually.\n\n【38】Gastro-resistant tablets release the medicine as soon as it passes through your stomach. This means the sodium valproate is less likely to upset your stomach.\n\n【39】You can take sodium valproate with or without food, but it's best to stick to the same way each time. Do not take it with food some days and without food on other days.\n\n【40】#### How to take slow release tablets and capsules\n\n【41】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【42】You'll usually take them once a day, unless you're on a high dose and your doctor tells you to take your medicine twice a day.\n\n【43】#### How to take slow release granules\n\n【44】Add the granules to a small drink, then stir and swallow it. If you prefer, sprinkle the granules onto any soft food that you can swallow whole. Do not chew the granules.\n\n【45】Your doctor will tell you to take these either once or twice a day.\n\n【46】#### How to take gastro-resistant tablets\n\n【47】Swallow these whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【48】You'll usually take these twice a day.\n\n【49】#### How to take crushable tablets\n\n【50】Crush the tablets using the back of a spoon and mix the powder with some soft food that you can swallow whole. If you prefer, add the powder to a small drink, then stir and swallow it.\n\n【51】You'll usually take this medicine twice a day.\n\n【52】#### How to take liquid\n\n【53】Use the plastic syringe or spoon that comes with your medicine to measure the correct dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【54】You'll usually take the liquid twice a day.\n\n【55】### When to take sodium valproate\n\n【56】If you're taking sodium valproate once a day, you can choose a time that suits you. Just try to keep to the same time every day.\n\n【57】If you're taking sodium valproate twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【58】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【59】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of sodium valproate. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【60】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may affect sodium valproate.\n\n【61】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【62】If you've missed a dose, what you do next depends on whether you usually take your medicine once or twice a day.\n\n【63】If you take sodium valproate:\n\n【64】*   **once a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within a few hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n*   **twice a day** – take the forgotten dose as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time\n\n【65】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【66】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【67】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【68】### What if I take too much?\n\n【69】Taking too much sodium valproate can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【70】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【71】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【72】*   you take too much sodium valproate and feel unwell\n\n【73】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【74】If you need to go to A&E, take the sodium valproate packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【75】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【76】Like all medicines, sodium valproate can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【77】### Common side effects\n\n【78】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【79】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【80】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【81】### Serious side effects\n\n【82】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking sodium valproate. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【83】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking sodium valproate have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【84】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【85】In rare cases, sodium valproate may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【86】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【87】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【88】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【89】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【90】These are not all the side effects of sodium valproate. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【91】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【92】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【93】6\\. How to cope with side effects of sodium valproate\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【94】**What to do about:**\n\n【95】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take sodium valproate with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to sodium valproate, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking sodium valproate, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of sodium valproate, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and sodium valproate can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of sodium valproate. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【96】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【97】### Sodium valproate and pregnancy\n\n【98】Sodium valproate is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【99】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【100】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【101】If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【102】Your doctor may continue to prescribe sodium valproate, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【103】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to sodium valproate.\n\n【104】Information:\n\n【105】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【106】### Sodium valproate and breastfeeding\n\n【107】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take sodium valproate while breastfeeding.\n\n【108】Sodium valproate passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【109】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend sodium valproate if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【110】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【111】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【112】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n\n【113】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【114】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【115】### More information\n\n【116】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how sodium valproate can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate, available in different languages\n*   valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【117】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【118】There are some medicines that may affect how sodium valproate works. Sodium valproate can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【119】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【120】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【121】### Mixing sodium valproate with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【122】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with sodium valproate.\n\n【123】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【124】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【125】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【126】9\\. Common questions about sodium valproate\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【127】How does sodium valproate work?\n\n【128】Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【129】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, sodium valproate is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【130】It's not clear how sodium valproate prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【131】When will I feel better?\n\n【132】It takes a few weeks for sodium valproate to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【133】How long will I take it for?\n\n【134】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking sodium valproate for many years.\n\n【135】Can I get addicted to sodium valproate?\n\n【136】Sodium valproate is not known to be addictive.\n\n【137】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【138】Many people can take sodium valproate safely for many months or years.\n\n【139】However, there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【140】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【141】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【142】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【143】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【144】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【145】Are there similar medicines to sodium valproate?\n\n【146】Valproic acid and semisodium valproate are very similar to sodium valproate. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【147】If you decide to try valproic acid or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off sodium valproate safely.\n\n【148】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【149】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【150】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【151】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【152】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【153】Sodium valproate works for several different types of epilepsy. If it's giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【154】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【155】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【156】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【157】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than sodium valproate at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【158】Sodium valproate is not used as often for preventing migraine. However, your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【159】Your doctor may also prescribe sodium valproate if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【160】How does sodium valproate compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【161】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【162】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like sodium valproate and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take sodium valproate instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【163】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【164】Do I need to stick to the same brand of sodium valproate?\n\n【165】Once you're on a dose of sodium valproate that suits you, you're likely to keep taking the same type or brand. This is because it can be a problem to swap from modified release to gastro-resistant tablets.\n\n【166】Some people may change brands to try a different type of sodium valproate. For example they may want to try the granules instead of the tablets. If you need to change brand your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to do so safely.\n\n【167】However, if your epilepsy has been difficult to control in the past and the brand you're taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend staying on the same one.\n\n【168】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【169】Do not stop taking sodium valproate suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【170】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However, if you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of sodium valproate gradually.\n\n【171】If you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【172】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【173】Sodium valproate can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【174】If you use recreational drugs alongside sodium valproate, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【175】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【176】Drinking alcohol while taking sodium valproate may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【177】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【178】Sodium valproate can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【179】In men sodium valproate has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【180】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Sodium valproate has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【181】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how sodium valproate may affect your fertility.\n\n【182】Sodium valproate is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking sodium valproate and want to start a family, it's important to talk your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking sodium valproate while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【183】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【184】Sodium valproate does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【185】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【186】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【187】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【188】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking sodium valproate. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【189】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【190】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【191】Information:\n\n【192】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【193】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【194】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【195】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls of taking sodium valproate.

The type you have depends on why you need the operation and how much of your womb and surrounding reproductive system can safely be left in place.\n\n【17】The main types of hysterectomy are:\n\n【18】*   total hysterectomy – the womb and cervix (neck of the womb) are removed; this is the most commonly performed operation\n*   subtotal hysterectomy – the main body of the womb is removed, leaving the cervix in place\n*   total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy – the womb, cervix, fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) and ovaries (oophorectomy) are removed\n*   radical hysterectomy – the womb and surrounding tissues are removed, including the fallopian tubes, part of the vagina, ovaries, lymph glands and fatty tissue\n\n【19】There are 3 ways to carry out a hysterectomy:\n\n【20】*   laparoscopic hysterectomy (keyhole surgery) – where small cuts are made in the tummy and the womb is removed through a cut in the vagina\n*   vaginal hysterectomy – where the womb is removed through a cut in the top of the vagina\n*   abdominal hysterectomy – where the womb is removed through a cut in the lower tummy\n\n【21】Find out how a hysterectomy is performed\n\n【22】Complications of a hysterectomy\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】There's a small risk of complications, including:\n\n【24】*   heavy bleeding\n*   infection\n*   damage to your bladder or bowel\n*   a serious reaction to the general anaesthetic\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the complications of a hysterectomy</u>\n\n【25】Recovering from a hysterectomy\n------------------------------\n\n【26】A hysterectomy is a major operation. You can be in hospital for up to 5 days after surgery, and it can take about 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover.\n\n【27】Recovery times can also vary depending on the type of hysterectomy.\n\n【28】Rest as much as possible during this time and do not lift anything heavy, such as bags of shopping. You need time for your abdominal muscles and tissues to heal.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about recovering from a hysterectomy</u>\n\n【29】Surgical menopause\n------------------\n\n【30】If your ovaries are removed during a hysterectomy, you'll go through the menopause immediately after the operation, regardless of your age. This is known as a surgical menopause.\n\n【31】If 1 or both of your ovaries are left intact, there's a chance you'll have the menopause sooner than you would have if you did not have a hysterectomy.\n\n【32】If you experience a surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy, you should be offered hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\n【33】The female reproductive system\n------------------------------\n\n【34】The female reproductive system is made up of the:\n\n【35】*   womb (uterus) – a pear-shaped organ in the middle of your pelvis where a baby develops; the lining of the womb is shed during a period\n*   cervix – the neck of the womb, where the womb meets the vagina; the cervix is the lower part of the womb and not separate\n*   vagina – a muscular tube below the cervix\n*   fallopian tubes – tubes that connect the womb to the ovaries\n*   ovaries – small organs by the fallopian tubes that release an egg each month\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Why it's necessary</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:34:29", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:35:08", "cost": 38.808}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:35:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:34:28"}

exercise.\n\n【34】However, there are limits to the exercise you should do.\n\n【35】### Sports and activities\n\n【36】After being treated for a brain tumour, you might be advised to permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing.\n\n【37】You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\n\n【38】Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for about a year after treatment because there's a risk you could have a seizure while in the water.\n\n【39】Sex and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【40】It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.\n\n【41】Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. \n\n【42】If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\n\n【43】Going back to work\n------------------\n\n【44】Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.\n\n【45】Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.\n\n【46】If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.\n\n【47】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【48】A brain tumour is often life changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained.\n\n【49】Your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker or counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\n\n【50】There are also a number of organisations that can provide help and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【20】See the NICE guidance about improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.", "content": "【0】Recovery \\- Benign brain tumour (non-cancerous)\n===============================================\n删除10：<u>Contents\n--------\n\n【1】1.

contact sports, such as rugby and boxing.\n\n【37】You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\n\n【38】Swimming unsupervised is not recommended for about a year after treatment because there's a risk you could have a seizure while in the water.\n\n【39】Sex and pregnancy\n-----------------\n\n【40】It's safe to have sex after treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour.\n\n【41】Women may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment. \n\n【42】If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\n\n【43】Going back to work\n------------------\n\n【44】Tiredness is a common symptom after receiving treatment for a brain tumour. This often restricts your ability to return to work.\n\n【45】Although you may want to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, it's probably a good idea to work part time to begin with and only go back full time when you feel ready.\n\n【46】If you have had seizures, you should not work with machinery or at heights.\n\n【47】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【48】A brain tumour is often life changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained.\n\n【49】Your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker or counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\n\n【50】There are also a number of organisations that can provide help and support, such as The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "index": 2572, "show": true, "start": 2572, "end": 2686, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:11:13", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:12:11", "cost": 58.646}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:12:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:11:11"}

These fits can be life threatening for the mother and baby, but they're rare.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:50:54", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:51:29", "cost": 35.345}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:51:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:50:53"}

If you get side effects your doctor may advise you to take it on alternate days\n*   **drops** – 4ml, taken once or twice a day\n\n【9】For children aged 12 to 17 years, the doctor will use your child's age and blood results to work out the right dose of ferrous sulfate. For children under 12 years old, the doctor will also use your child's weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【10】### Dose to prevent anaemia\n\n【11】The usual dose for adults is:\n\n【12】*   **tablets** – one 200mg tablet, taken once a day\n*   **drops** – 2.4ml to 4.8ml, taken once a day\n\n【13】For children aged 12 to 17 years, the doctor will use your child's age and blood results to work out the right dose of ferrous sulfate. For children under 12 years, the doctor will also use your child's weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【14】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【15】Ferrous sulfate works best when you take it on an empty stomach. If you can, take it 30 minutes before eating, or 2 hours after eating. But if it upsets your stomach, you can take it with or after food.\n\n【16】A doctor (or a pharmacist) may recommend taking ferrous sulfate with orange juice or a vitamin C supplement. Vitamin C is believed to increase the amount of iron absorbed by the body.\n\n【17】Swallow the tablet whole with a drink of water. Do not suck, chew or keep the tablet in your mouth as this can cause mouth ulcers or stain your teeth.\n\n【18】Do not take it with tea, coffee, eggs or dairy products, as they can reduce the amount of iron that gets into your system. When you take ferrous sulfate (or when you eat foods that are high in iron), leave a 2-hour gap before having these foods or drinks.\n\n【19】If you have difficulty swallowing the tablets tell your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【20】The drops may be easier for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets.\n\n【21】If you're taking ferrous sulfate as drops, it will come with a plastic syringe or dropper to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask a pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.\n\n【22】### Important\n\n【23】Keep ferrous sulfate out of sight and reach of children, as an overdose may be fatal.\n\n【24】Ferrous sulfate is not harmful if it's been prescribed for your child and you follow your doctor's instructions, or the instructions on the packet.\n\n【25】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【26】To prevent iron deficiency anaemia, you'll need to take ferrous sulfate for as long as you're at risk of getting this condition.\n\n【27】To treat iron deficiency anaemia, you'll need to take it for several months. Your doctor will usually advise you to keep taking it for 3 to 6 months after your condition has improved to help build up your body's iron supply.\n\n【28】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【29】If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time to take the next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【30】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【31】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.\n\n【32】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【33】Taking more than the recommended dose of ferrous sulfate can cause vomiting, stomach pain or diarrhoea.\n\n【34】In serious cases you may vomit blood, have a seizure or fit, or become unconscious.\n\n【35】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【36】*   you or your child takes more than the recommended dose of ferrous sulfate\n\n【37】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【38】If you go to A&E do not drive yourself.

It takes a few days for it to start working and can take several weeks for it to reach its full effect.\n\n【8】If you bought the spray from a pharmacy or shop, check the leaflet that comes with it. This will tell you when to speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you feel no better after using the spray. This is usually after 7 to 14 days.\n\n【9】If you use the spray for hay fever, it's best to start using it at least a couple of weeks before the hay fever season starts. Many people notice they get symptoms around the same time each year.\n\n【10】If you use the spray for nasal polyps, it can take 1 to 2 months for your symptoms to improve.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Budesonide nasal spray is unlikely to have any lasting harmful effects if you follow the instructions that come with it, or use it as your doctor recommends.\n\n【13】However, children and teenagers need to have their height and weight monitored carefully if they're using budesonide nasal spray for a long time. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth.\n\n【14】The nasal spray delivers a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【15】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【16】You may need a steroid card if you're regularly using budesonide nasal spray with other steroids, such as a steroid inhaler. This can cause your adrenal glands to make less of the hormones your body needs, such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【17】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n\n【18】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【19】Budesonide does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【20】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【21】For most people, using budesonide nasal spray will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n\n【22】Can I drink alcohol while using budesonide nasal spray?\n\n【23】Yes, you can drink alcohol if you're using budesonide nasal spray.\n删除11：<u>More in Budesonide nasal spray\n------------------------------\n\n【24】*   About budesonide nasal spray\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:58", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:33:03", "cost": 5.818}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:33:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:57"}

You'll be able to go home soon after the tests have finished and return to your normal activities.\n\n【27】Your results\n------------\n\n【28】The person carrying out the test won't usually be able to give you your results immediately.\n\n【29】The results will need to be looked at by a specialist first and will then be sent to the doctor who referred you for the test, who will discuss them with you a few days later.\n\n【30】A spirometer measures the amount of air you can breathe out in one second and the total volume of air you can exhale in one forced breath.\n\n【31】These measurements will be compared with a normal result for someone of your age, height and sex, which will help show if your lungs aren't working properly.\n\n【32】The measurements will also show whether any problem with your lungs is \"obstructive\", \"restrictive\", or a combination of the two:\n\n【33】*   **obstructive airways disease** – where your ability to breathe out quickly is affected by narrowing of the airways, but the amount of air you can hold in your lungs is normal (such as in asthma or COPD)\n*   **restrictive lung disease** – where the amount of air you can breathe in is reduced because your lungs are unable to fully expand (such as in pulmonary fibrosis).\n\n【34】Risks and side effects\n----------------------\n\n【35】Spirometry is a straightforward test and is generally considered very safe. Some people may feel dizzy, faint, shaky, sick or tired for a short period afterwards.\n\n【36】Most people are able to have a spirometry test safely. But the test increases the pressure inside your head, chest, stomach and eyes as you breathe out, so it may need to be delayed or avoided if you have a condition that could be made worse by this.\n\n【37】For example, spirometry may not be safe if you have, or have recently had, unstable angina, a heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or an operation to your head, chest, stomach or eyes.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 August 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 August 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:43:22", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:44:02", "cost": 40.165}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:44:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:43:22"}

Instead, you'll need to pay for the procedure privately.\n\n【3】Information about breast reduction for cosmetic reasons is provided elsewhere.\n\n【4】Read about cosmetic breast reduction for women and male breast reduction.\n\n【5】This page focuses on when breast reduction might be available on the NHS.\n\n【6】Eligibility criteria for NHS breast reduction\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【7】The availability of breast reduction surgery on the NHS varies, depending on the eligibility criteria decided by your local integrated care board (ICB).\n\n【8】Some ICBs do not fund breast reduction surgery at all, and others fund it selectively if you fulfil certain criteria.\n\n【9】Generally speaking, you might be considered for breast reduction on the NHS if you have problems caused by having very large breasts, such as:\n\n【10】*   backache\n*   shoulder or neck pain\n*   skin irritation\n*   rashes and skin infections under the breasts\n*   grooves on the shoulders from bra straps\n*   psychological distress, such as low self-esteem or depression\n*   an inability to exercise or take part in sports\n\n【11】ICBs also tend to have additional criteria that may include the size of your breasts, your weight, your age, whether you smoke, and whether other options (such as wearing professionally fitted bras) have been tried, but have not helped.\n\n【12】You can find out what the eligibility criteria are in your area from a GP or by contacting your local ICB.\n\n【13】The referral process\n--------------------\n\n【14】See a GP if you think you might be eligible for breast reduction surgery on the NHS.\n\n【15】They can check whether you meet the criteria of your local ICB and, if you do, they can refer you to a breast or plastic surgeon for an assessment.\n\n【16】This may involve:\n\n【17】*   asking about the problems you're having\n*   checking your weight and general health\n*   an assessment by a psychiatrist or psychologist\n*   information about the risks and results of surgery\n\n【18】The assessment will help determine whether you're suitable for surgery and whether there's a strong enough reason for this to be done on the NHS.\n\n【19】The final decision is usually made by a panel of representatives from your local ICB, which will take into account the information from your assessments and a review of your individual case.\n\n【20】Things to consider before you go ahead\n--------------------------------------\n\n【21】It's important to discuss your problems and options with a GP and an appropriately qualified surgeon before having a breast reduction.\n\n【22】This will help you get a clear idea of what changes you can expect to see and ensure you're aware of any risks involved.\n\n【23】Be aware that:\n\n【24】*   a significant reduction can alter the shape and look of your breasts\n*   there will be scarring and possibly lost or altered nipple sensation\n*   your breasts can change in size and shape after surgery – for example, they may increase or decrease in size if you put on or lose weight\n*   breasts have a tendency to droop over time\n*   your breasts can get bigger during pregnancy and you may not be able to breastfeed after surgery – so you may need to wait until you're sure you do not want to have any more children\n\n【25】For women with very large breasts, the benefits of a reduction may outweigh any potential problems.\n\n【26】But for women with only moderately large breasts, the benefits may not be worth the risks.\n\n【27】Alternatives to breast reduction surgery\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】It's sometimes possible to reduce problems caused by having large breasts without the need for surgery.\n\n【29】The following measures may help:\n\n【30】*   if you're overweight, losing weight can sometimes help reduce the amount of fatty tissue in your breasts\n*   a professional bra-fitting service – for many women with problems caused by large breasts, getting a professional to fit a correctly sized bra can reduce discomfort\n*   physiotherapy – exercises from a physiotherapist can sometimes help with aches and pains caused by large breasts\n*   psychological support and treatment – this can help if your large breasts are causing emotional or mental health issues\n\n【31】Breast reduction surgery will usually only be available on the NHS if you have first tried alternative measures.\n\n【32】Male breast reduction on the NHS\n--------------------------------\n\n【33】Male breast reduction is not normally available on the NHS.\n\n【34】This is because enlarged breasts in men (gynaecomastia) are usually a result of being overweight, and losing weight will often help to reduce their size.\n\n【35】You'll normally need to pay privately for breast reduction surgery in these cases.\n\n【36】But breast reduction on the NHS may sometimes be considered if it's caused by an underlying condition, or if losing weight has not helped.\n\n【37】A GP can advise you about whether you might be suitable for surgery on the NHS.\n\n【38】More information\n----------------\n\n【39】For more about the operation and what to expect afterwards, see our topics on cosmetic breast reduction surgery and male breast reduction.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 November 2025</u>", "tags": {},

Urinary incontinence is a common problem and it's likely the GP has seen many people with the same problem.\n\n【4】A GP will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including:\n\n【5】*   whether the urinary incontinence happens when you cough or laugh\n*   whether you need the toilet frequently during the day or night\n*   whether you have any difficulty passing urine when you go to the toilet\n*   whether you're currently taking any medicine\n*   how much fluid, alcohol or caffeine you drink\n\n【6】Bladder diary\n-------------\n\n【7】The GP may suggest that you keep a diary of your bladder habits for at least 3 days so you can give them as much information as possible about your condition.\n\n【8】This should include:\n\n【9】*   how much fluid you drink\n*   the types of fluid you drink\n*   how often you need to pass urine\n*   the amount of urine you pass\n*   how many episodes of incontinence you have\n*   how many times you experience an urgent need to go to the toilet\n\n【10】Tests and examinations\n----------------------\n\n【11】You may also need to have some tests and examinations so the GP can confirm or rule out things that may be causing incontinence.\n\n【12】### Physical examination\n\n【13】A GP may examine you to assess the health of your urinary system. If you have a vagina, the GP will do a pelvic examination, which usually involves undressing from the waist down. You may be asked to cough to see if any urine leaks.\n\n【14】The GP may also examine your vagina to check for causes of incontinence, such as prolapse where part of the bladder bulges into the vagina.\n\n【15】The GP may place their finger inside your vagina and ask you to squeeze your pelvic floor muscles.\n\n【16】These are the muscles that surround your bladder and urethra (the tube that urine passes through to leave your body). Damage to your pelvic floor muscles can lead to urinary incontinence.\n\n【17】If you have a penis, the GP may check the health of your prostate gland, which is located between the penis and bladder and surrounds the urethra.\n\n【18】You may need a digital rectal examination. This will involve the GP inserting their finger into your bottom so they can feel your prostate gland.\n\n【19】If you have an enlarged prostate gland, it can cause symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as a frequent need to urinate.\n\n【20】### Dipstick test\n\n【21】If the GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), a sample of your urine may be tested for bacteria.\n\n【22】A small chemically treated stick is dipped into your urine sample. It will change colour if bacteria are present. The dipstick test can also check for blood and protein in your urine.\n\n【23】### Residual urine test\n\n【24】If the GP thinks you have overflow incontinence, they may suggest a test called a residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you pee.\n\n【25】This usually involves an ultrasound scan of your bladder, although occasionally the amount of urine left in your bladder may be measured after your bladder is drained using a catheter.\n\n【26】A catheter is a thin, flexible tube that's inserted into your urethra and passed through to your bladder.\n\n【27】Further tests\n-------------\n\n【28】Further tests may be necessary if the cause of your urinary incontinence is not clear. The GP will usually start treating you first and may suggest further tests if treatment is not effective.\n\n【29】### Cystoscopy\n\n【30】A cystoscopy involves using a thin tube with a camera attached to it (endoscope) to look inside your bladder and urinary tract. A cystoscopy can identify abnormalities that may be causing incontinence.\n\n【31】### Urodynamic tests\n\n【32】These are a group of tests used to check the function of your bladder and urethra. You may be asked to keep a bladder diary for a few days then have several tests at a hospital or clinic.\n\n【33】Tests can include:\n\n【34】*   measuring the pressure in your bladder by inserting a catheter into your urethra\n*   measuring the pressure in your tummy (abdomen) by inserting a catheter into your bottom\n*   asking you to urinate into a special machine that measures the amount and flow of urine\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Non-surgical treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:08:22", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:10:57", "cost": 154.586}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:52", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:10:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:08:22"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Spina bifida is when a baby's spine and spinal cord does not develop properly in the womb, causing a gap in the spine.**\n\n【3】Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord.\n\n【4】The neural tube starts to form in early pregnancy and closes about 4 weeks after conception.\n\n【5】In spina bifida, part of the neural tube does not develop or close properly, leading to defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine (vertebrae).\n\n【6】It's not known what causes spina bifida, but a lack of folic acid before and in the early stages of pregnancy is a significant risk factor.\n\n【7】Types of spina bifida\n---------------------\n\n【8】There are several different types of spina bifida, including:\n\n【9】*   myelomeningocele – the most severe type of spina bifida; the baby's spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the back, allowing the spinal cord and protective membranes around it to push out and form a sac in the baby's back\n*   meningocele – another serious type of spina bifida where the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the spine; the spinal cord usually develops normally so surgery can often be used to remove the membranes without damaging the nerves\n*   spina bifida occulta – the most common and mildest type of spina bifida; 1 or more vertebrae does not form properly, but the gap in the spine is very small; spina bifida occulta does not usually cause any problems and most people are unaware they have it\n\n【10】These pages focus on myelomeningocele, the most severe type of spina bifida, and this is the type usually referred to whenever the term spina bifida is used.\n\n【11】Shine is a charity that provides help and support for people affected by spina bifida. \n删除7：<u>Their website has more information about the other types of spina bifida.</u>\n\n【12】Symptoms of spina bifida\n------------------------\n\n【13】Most people with spina bifida are able to have surgery to close the opening in the spine.\n\n【14】But the nervous system will usually already have been damaged, which can lead to problems such as:\n\n【15】*   weakness or total paralysis of the legs\n*   bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence\n*   loss of skin sensation in the legs and around the bottom – the child is unable to feel hot or cold, which can lead to accidental injury\n\n【16】Many babies will have or develop hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain), which can further damage the brain.\n\n【17】Most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, but some have learning difficulties.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of spina bifida.</u>\n\n【18】Causes of spina bifida\n----------------------\n\n【19】The cause of spina bifida is unknown, but a number of factors can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition.\n\n【20】These include: \n\n【21】*   low folic acid intake during pregnancy\n*   having a family history of spina bifida\n*   medicines – taking certain medicines such as valproic acid (used to prevent seizures) during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida\n删除7：<u>Read more about the causes of spina bifida.</u>\n\n【22】Diagnosing spina bifida\n-----------------------\n\n【23】Spina bifida is often detected during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan, which is offered to all pregnant women between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【24】If tests confirm that your baby has spina bifida, the implications will be discussed with you.\n\n【25】This will include a discussion about the possible problems associated with the condition, the treatment and support your child may need if you decide to continue with the pregnancy, and what your options are regarding ending the pregnancy, if that's your choice.\n\n【26】### Tests after birth\n\n【27】Once the baby is born, a number of tests may be carried out to find out how bad the condition is and help decide which treatments are likely to be the best option.\n\n【28】Tests may include:\n\n【29】*   monitoring your child's head growth and carrying out a brain scan, using an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI scan, to check for hydrocephalus (excess fluid on the brain)\n*   ultrasound scans of the bladder and kidneys to check whether your baby stores their pee normally\n*   an assessment of your baby's movements to check for paralysis\n\n【30】Surgery to repair the spine will usually be recommended soon after your baby is born.\n\n【31】Treating spina bifida\n---------------------\n\n【32】Treatments for the symptoms or conditions associated with spina bifida include:\n\n【33】*   surgery soon after birth to close the opening in the spine and treat hydrocephalus\n*   therapies to help make day-to-day life easier and improve independence, such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n*   assistive devices and mobility equipment, such as a wheelchair, or walking aids\n*   treatments for bowel and urinary problems\n\n【34】With the right treatment and support, many children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood.\n\n【35】It can be a challenging condition to live with, but many adults with spina bifida are able to lead independent and fulfilling lives.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating spina bifida.</u>\n\n【36】Preventing spina bifida with folic acid\n---------------------------------------\n\n【37】The best way to prevent spina bifida is to take folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy.\n\n【38】### Folic acid recommendations\n\n【39】You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while you're trying to get pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant.\n\n【40】If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant.\n\n【41】Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you.\n\n【42】You should also try to eat foods that contain folate (the natural form of folic acid), such as broccoli, spinach and chickpeas.\n删除7：<u>Read more about folic acid, including folic acid supplements and foods containing folate.</u>\n\n【43】### Recommendations for women at higher risk of spina bifida\n\n【44】Women thought to be at higher risk of having a child with spina bifida need to be prescribed a higher (5 milligram) dose of folic acid by a GP.\n\n【45】Women at higher risk include those:\n\n【46】*   with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   with a partner with a family history of neural tube defects\n*   who have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n*   with diabetes\n\n【47】A GP can advise you further about this.\n\n【48】If you're taking medicine to treat epilepsy, you should ask your GP for advice. You may also need to take a higher dose of folic acid.\n\n【49】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【50】If you have a child with spina bifida or you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by it.\n\n【51】Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with details about local support groups and organisations.\n\n【52】You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website.\n\n【53】National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】If you or your child has spina bifida, your clinical team will pass information about you or your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【55】The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

This means it works in a different way to chemotherapy medicines, although it may be used in combination with chemotherapy medicines.\n\n【3】Some types of breast and stomach cancers have large amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 helps the cancer cells grow and multiply.\n\n【4】Trastuzumab works by attaching to HER2 on the surface of the cancer cells and this stops the cancer cells from growing or multiplying. Trastuzumab also tells your immune system to destroy the cancer cells it's attached to.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】Trastuzumab might not make you feel better although it can help reduce the size of your cancer.\n\n【7】Trastuzumab works best for early breast cancer if you have treatment for a year and this helps to stop the cancer coming back. For stomach cancer or breast cancer that has spread you may continue to have trastuzumab for as long as it's helping to keep the cancer under control.\n\n【8】You may feel worse when you start to have trastuzumab if you get any side effects. Some of these should wear off as your body gets used to the treatment.\n\n【9】Trastuzumab may work more quickly for some people than others. You'll have regular check-ups while you're having treatment to make sure it's working well for you. Your doctor or nurse will also check whether any side effects are bothering you.\n\n【10】How well does trastuzumab work?\n\n【11】The success of trastuzumab depends on whether it's being used to treat early breast cancer, stomach cancer or breast cancer that has spread. Trastuzumab is sometimes used on its own and sometimes with other chemotherapy medicines.\n\n【12】In early breast cancer, clinical trials have shown that trastuzumab reduces the risk of cancer coming back.\n\n【13】In stomach cancer and breast cancer that has spread, clinical trials have shown that trastuzumab increases the time before the cancer progresses.\n\n【14】What if trastuzumab does not work?\n\n【15】You'll have regular check-ups with your doctor or nurse while you're on trastuzumab to make sure it's working well for you.\n\n【16】If trastuzumab is not working well then you and your doctor can talk about other treatment options. The choice of treatments will depend on which medicines you've already tried and whether you've been having trastuzumab with other chemotherapy.\n\n【17】Are there other cancer treatments like trastuzumab?\n\n【18】There are other treatments that are similar to trastuzumab. The choice of treatment depends on which type of cancer you have and whether it's spread. It also depends on which treatments you've already tried and whether you had any problems with them.\n\n【19】Your doctor can talk to you about which treatments will work best for your condition.\n\n【20】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【21】Most of the side effects of trastuzumab are likely to improve after you stop having treatment.\n\n【22】Trastuzumab can cause heart problems in some people. Contact your doctor or 111 now if you notice that:\n\n【23】*   your ankles or legs look swollen\n*   you have shortness of breath or a cough\n*   you've gained weight quickly\n\n【24】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\n【25】Your doctor will monitor your heart. You'll have a heart trace test called an ECG and a heart scan before you start your treatment. You'll have heart tests every few months while you're having trastuzumab and for some time after you've stopped.\n\n【26】Trastuzumab can cause lung problems in some people. If you have a cough or shortness of breath, this may be an infection. In rare cases, it may be due to swelling (inflammation) or scarring in the lungs.\n\n【27】Will I lose or put on weight?\n\n【28】You may lose your appetite while on trastuzumab as it can affect your taste or make you feel sick. This may cause you to lose weight. Try to choose foods you normally enjoy but avoid rich or spicy food. Try eating smaller meals but more often.\n\n【29】Talk to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or get worse.\n\n【30】If you gain weight quickly or have swollen legs or ankles this may be a sign of fluid build-up and it's important to talk to your doctor or nurse straight away.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Trastuzumab is not known to stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】However, if you're being sick or have severe diarrhoea, your contraception pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【34】Find out what to do if you're on the pill and you're vomiting or have severe diarrhoea.\n\n【35】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【36】You may feel sleepy or dizzy when you first start having trastuzumab. If this happens to you, do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n\n【37】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【38】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while having trastuzumab.\n删除7：<u>GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【39】Can I drink alcohol while having trastuzumab?\n\n【40】Yes, you can drink alcohol with trastuzumab, but it may make you feel sleepy or tired.\n\n【41】During the first few weeks of having trastuzumab it might be best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【42】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【43】There is no food or drink you need to avoid before or after having trastuzumab.\n删除11：<u>More in Trastuzumab (Herceptin)\n-------------------------------\n\n【44】*   About trastuzumab\n*   Who can and cannot have it\n*   How and when to have it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:33:58", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:34:17", "cost": 18.085}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:34:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:33:57"}

If you have sex without a condom, a person with urethritis and no symptoms can pass on the infection without realising it.\n\n【9】Non-urgent advice: Go to a sexual health clinic or see a GP if:\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】*   you think you might have urethritis or a sexually transmitted infection (STI)\n\n【11】It's important to get it treated to avoid it spreading to other people.\n\n【12】Find a sexual health clinic\n\n【13】What happens at your appointment\n--------------------------------\n\n【14】If you have symptoms of urethritis, you may have:\n\n【15】*   a swab test – a cotton bud takes a sample from the urethra (this can feel uncomfortable for a few seconds)\n*   a urine test – you'll be asked not to pee for at least 2 hours before giving a urine sample as this can help make the results more reliable\n\n【16】You may also be offered tests for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n【17】Healthcare professionals at the clinic or GP surgery will tell you when you'll get your test results.\n\n【18】If the test shows that you have urethritis, anyone you've had sex with recently should be contacted and asked to get tested and treated if needed. The sexual health clinic can advise you about this.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about visiting a sexual health clinic.</u>\n\n【19】Treatment for urethritis\n------------------------\n\n【20】Urethritis is usually treated with antibiotics. It may take a week or two for your symptoms to disappear completely.\n\n【21】Any current sexual partners may also need treatment.\n\n【22】Avoid having sex (including oral sex) until you and any sexual partners have finished treatment and the symptoms have gone.\n\n【23】You may be asked to come back for another appointment in 1 to 2 weeks to check the treatment has worked.\n\n【24】Causes of urethritis\n--------------------\n\n【25】Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia.\n\n【26】You can get it if you have unprotected sex (without a condom) with someone who has the infection.\n\n【27】Rarely, it can be caused by damaging the urethra (for example, from a urinary catheter).\n\n【28】Sometimes no cause for the urethritis can be found.\n\n【29】How to avoid getting urethritis\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】You can reduce your chances of getting urethritis by:\n\n【31】*   using a condom every time you have vaginal sex or anal sex\n*   using a condom to cover the penis or a latex or plastic square (dam) to cover the vagina if you have oral sex\n*   not sharing sex toys, or washing them and covering them with a new condom before anyone else uses them\n\n【32】You can get tested for urethritis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) even if you do not have symptoms. This can help you avoid passing on infections without realising it.\n\n【33】Complications of urethritis\n---------------------------\n\n【34】Although complications are rare, sometimes urethritis can cause further problems such as:\n\n【35】*   reactive arthritis  – where the immune system attacks the joints or eyes, which can cause joint pain and conjunctivitis\n*   epididymitis – where the infection spreads to the testicles\n*   pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – where the infection spreads to the womb or fallopian tubes (if untreated this can cause infertility)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 May 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:32:13", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:33:03", "cost": 50.366}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:33:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:32:13"}

Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS.\n\n【5】It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s, 30s and 40s although it can develop at any age. It's about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men.\n\n【6】MS is one of the most common causes of disability in younger adults.\n\n【7】Symptoms of multiple sclerosis\n------------------------------\n\n【8】The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body.\n\n【9】The main symptoms include:\n\n【10】*   fatigue\n*   difficulty walking\n*   vision problems, such as blurred vision\n*   problems controlling the bladder\n*   numbness or tingling in different parts of the body\n*   muscle stiffness and spasms\n*   problems with balance and co-ordination\n*   problems with thinking, learning and planning\n\n【11】Depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms may come and go in phases or get steadily worse over time (progress).\n\n【12】Getting medical advice\n----------------------\n\n【13】See a GP if you're worried you might have signs of MS.\n\n【14】The symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS.\n\n【15】Let the GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you're experiencing.\n\n【16】If they think you could have MS, you'll be referred to a specialist in conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist), who may suggest tests such as an MRI scan to check for features of MS.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about diagnosing MS</u>\n\n【17】Types of multiple sclerosis\n---------------------------\n\n【18】MS starts in 1 of 2 general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression.\n\n【19】### Relapsing remitting MS\n\n【20】Between 8 and 9 of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type.\n\n【21】Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as relapses.\n\n【22】These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period.\n\n【23】Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress.\n\n【24】The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years.\n\n【25】Periods between attacks are known as periods of remission. These can last for years at a time.\n\n【26】After many years (usually decades), many, but not all, people with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS.\n\n【27】In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage.\n\n【28】About two-thirds of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS.\n\n【29】### Primary progressive MS\n\n【30】Between 1 and 2 in every 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms.\n\n【31】In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise.\n\n【32】What causes multiple sclerosis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body – in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system.\n\n【34】In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves called the myelin sheath.\n\n【35】This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted.\n\n【36】Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved.\n\n【37】Treatments for multiple sclerosis\n---------------------------------\n\n【38】There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition and ease symptoms.\n\n【39】The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties you have.\n\n【40】It may include:\n\n【41】*   treating relapses with short courses of steroid medicine to speed up recovery\n*   specific treatments for individual MS symptoms\n*   treatment to reduce the number of relapses using medicines called disease-modifying therapies\n\n【42】Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability in people with a type of MS called relapsing remitting MS, and in some people with types called primary and secondary progressive MS, who have relapses.\n\n【43】Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of inactive progressive MS, with no relapses or MRI activity.\n\n【44】Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched.\n\n【45】Living with multiple sclerosis\n------------------------------\n\n【46】If you have been diagnosed with MS, it's important to take care of your general health.\n\n【47】Read more advice about living with MS\n\n【48】Outlook\n-------\n\n【49】MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition.\n\n【50】MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties.\n\n【51】The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average, and this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.\n\n【52】Charities and support groups for multiple sclerosis\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】There are 2 main MS charities in the UK:\n\n【54】*   MS Society\n*   MS Trust\n\n【55】These organisations offer useful advice, publications, news items about ongoing research, blogs and chatrooms.\n\n【56】They can be very useful if you, or someone you know, has just been diagnosed with MS.\n\n【57】There's also the shift.ms website, an online community for younger people affected by MS.\n\n【58】Information:\n\n【59】### Social care and support guide\n\n【60】The social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support if you:\n\n【61】*   need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n*   care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled, including family members\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 March 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:35:11", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:35:27", "cost": 16.024}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:35:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:35:10"}

Instead, the diagnosis is based on the pattern of your symptoms. Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease or a stroke.\n\n【18】You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language.\n\n【19】You will usually see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves).\n删除7：<u>Read more about how CBD is diagnosed.</u>\n\n【20】Treatments for CBD\n------------------\n\n【21】As someone with CBD can be affected in many different ways, treatment and care is best provided by a team of health and social care professionals working together. Treatments may include:\n\n【22】*   medication – to improve stiffness and muscle spasms, sleep and mood, pain or memory\n*   physiotherapy – to help with movement and balance difficulties\n*   speech and language therapy – to help with communication and swallowing problems\n*   occupational therapy – to improve the skills and abilities needed for daily activities at home\n*   palliative care and advanced care planning\n删除7：<u>Read more about treatment for CBD.</u>\n\n【23】Outlook\n-------\n\n【24】There is currently no treatment that has been shown to stop CBD getting gradually worse, although treatments can reduce many of the symptoms.\n\n【25】Good care and assistance can help someone with CBD be more independent and enjoy a better quality of life, but the condition will eventually put them at risk of serious complications.\n\n【26】CBD usually changes very slowly. Many people find it helpful to plan ahead with their doctors (GP and specialist) to make decisions about what to do in later stages of the illness.\n\n【27】Difficulty swallowing can cause choking, or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.\n\n【28】As a result of these complications, the average life expectancy for someone with CBD is around 6 to 8 years from when their symptoms start. However, this is only an average and CBD is very variable.\n\n【29】Information about you\n---------------------\n\n【30】If you have CBD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【31】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the register on the National Disease Registration Service website.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:48:09", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:49:35", "cost": 86.106}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:49:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:48:08"}

Some children can be severely ill and very occasionally may die from it, but many others may grow up without realising they have it.\n\n【3】DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem with a person's genes, called 22q11 deletion. It is not usually passed on to a child by their parents, but it is in a few cases.\n\n【4】It's often diagnosed soon after birth with a blood test to check for the genetic fault.\n\n【5】Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】DiGeorge syndrome can cause a range of problems, but most people will not have all of these.\n\n【7】Some of the most common issues are:\n\n【8】*   learning and behaviour problems – including delays in learning to walk or talk, learning disabilities and problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism\n*   speech and hearing problems – including temporary hearing loss due to frequent ear infections, being slow to start talking and having a \"nasal-sounding\" voice\n*   mouth and feeding problems – including a gap in the top of the mouth or lip (cleft lip or palate), difficulty feeding and sometimes bringing food back up through the nose\n*   heart problems – some children and adults have heart defects from birth (congenital heart disease)\n*   hormone problems – underdeveloped parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism), which can lead to problems such as shaking (tremors) and seizures (fits)\n\n【9】Other possible problems include:\n\n【10】*   a higher risk of getting infections – such as ear infections, oral thrush and chest infections – because the immune system (the body's natural defence against illness) is weaker than normal\n*   bone, muscle and joint problems – including leg pains that keep coming back, an unusually curved spine (scoliosis) and rheumatoid arthritis\n*   short stature – children and adults may be shorter than average\n*   mental health problems – adults are more likely to have problems such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders\n\n【11】Causes of DiGeorge syndrome\n---------------------------\n\n【12】DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a problem called 22q11 deletion. This is where a small piece of genetic material is missing from a person's DNA.\n\n【13】In about 9 in 10 cases (90%), the bit of DNA was missing from the egg or sperm that led to the pregnancy. This can happen by chance when sperm and eggs are made. It is not a result of anything you did before or during the pregnancy.\n\n【14】In these cases, there's usually no family history of DiGeorge syndrome and the risk of it happening again to other children is very small.\n\n【15】In around 1 in 10 cases (10%), the 22q11 deletion is passed on to a child by a parent who has DiGeorge syndrome, although they may not realise they have it if it's mild.\n\n【16】What are the chances of my next child having DiGeorge syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】If neither parent has DiGeorge syndrome, the risk of having another child with it is thought to be less than 1 in 100 (1%).\n\n【18】If 1 parent has the condition, they have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of passing it on to their child. This applies to each pregnancy.\n\n【19】Speak to a GP if you're planning a pregnancy and you have a family history of DiGeorge syndrome, or you have a child with it.\n\n【20】They may refer you for a genetic test and talk about your level of risk and discuss your options. These may include:\n\n【21】*   having a blood test to check if you or your partner carry the genetic problem that causes DiGeorge syndrome\n*   having tests during pregnancy (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) to check if your baby has the genetic problem that causes the condition – although this cannot show how severely your child will be affected\n*   pre-implantation genetic diagnosis – a type of IVF where eggs are fertilised in a laboratory and embryos are tested for genetic problems before they're implanted in the womb (this is not always available on the NHS)\n\n【22】Treatment and support for DiGeorge syndrome\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】There's currently no cure for DiGeorge syndrome. Children and adults with the condition will be closely monitored to check for problems, and these can be treated as they happen, if needed.\n\n【24】For example, someone with DiGeorge syndrome may have:\n\n【25】*   regular hearing tests, blood tests, heart scans and measurements of their height and weight\n*   an assessment of their development and learning ability before starting school – if your child has a learning disability, they may need extra support at a mainstream school, or they may benefit from attending a special school (read more about education for children with learning disabilities)\n*   speech therapy to help with speech problems and dietary changes (or sometimes a temporary feeding tube) to help with feeding problems\n*   physiotherapy for problems with strength and movement\n*   treatment from a podiatrist for foot and leg problems, and devices such as shoe inserts (orthoses) for leg pain\n*   surgery for more severe problems – for example, surgery to repair heart defects or an operation to repair a cleft palate\n\n【26】You may find it useful to speak to a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or through a doctor.\n\n【27】Charities such as Max Appeal! may also be a good source of support.\n\n【28】Read more advice about caring for a disabled child.\n\n【29】Outlook for DiGeorge syndrome\n-----------------------------\n\n【30】Everyone with DiGeorge syndrome is affected differently and it's difficult to predict how severe the condition will be. Most children survive into adulthood.\n\n【31】As someone with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, some symptoms, such as heart and speech problems, tend to become less of an issue. However, behavioural, learning, and mental health problems can continue to affect their daily life.\n\n【32】Many people with DiGeorge syndrome who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, but ongoing health problems can sometimes mean their life expectancy is a bit lower than usual. It's important to attend regular check-ups so that any problems can be found and treated early.\n\n【33】Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently.\n\n【34】Information about you or your child\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【36】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

The benefits of the medicine will only continue for as long as you take it.\n\n【15】You may want to stop rosuvastatin if you think you're having side effects. Talk to your doctor first to see if it really is a side effect of rosuvastatin or an unrelated problem. Your doctor may decide to lower your dose or change your medicine.\n\n【16】You will not get any withdrawal symptoms. But stopping rosuvastatin may cause your cholesterol to rise. This increases your risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【17】If you want to stop taking your medicine, it's important to find another way to lower your cholesterol.\n\n【18】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【19】If you forget to take a dose of rosuvastatin, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until the next day, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【20】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for the forgotten one.\n\n【21】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【22】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【23】Taking an extra dose of rosuvastatin is unlikely to harm you.

You'll hopefully be more relaxed about things that used to worry you.\n\n【7】Sertraline will not change your personality, it will simply help you feel like yourself again.\n\n【8】Do not expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.\n\n【9】When will I feel better?\n\n【10】You may see an improvement in your symptoms after 1 or 2 weeks, although it usually takes from 4 to 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits.\n\n【11】That's because it takes around a week for sertraline levels to build up in your body, and then a few weeks longer for your body to adapt and get used to it.\n\n【12】Do not stop taking sertraline just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】For most people, sertraline is safe to take for a long time.\n\n【15】A few people may get sexual side effects, such as problems getting an erection or a lower sex drive. In some cases these can continue even after stopping the medicine. Speak to your doctor if you are worried.\n\n【16】If you have diabetes, sertraline can affect your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may monitor you to check that you're on the right dose of diabetes medicine.\n\n【17】Otherwise there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking sertraline for many months and years.\n\n【18】How does sertraline compare with other antidepressants?\n\n【19】Sertraline is not any better or worse than other antidepressants. Sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than another.\n\n【20】If you are not feeling any better after 6 weeks, talk to your doctor.\n\n【21】Are there other treatments that will help?\n\n【22】Antidepressants, including sertraline, are just one of several approaches to treating depression.\n\n【23】Other potential treatments include:\n\n【24】*   talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)\n*   exercise programmes\n*   help to get a good night's sleep\n\n【25】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【26】*   how long you have had depression\n*   your symptoms\n*   whether you have had any previous periods of depression\n*   whether previous treatment has worked\n*   how likely you are to stick with your treatment\n*   the potential side effects\n*   your preferences and priorities\n\n【27】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【28】Sertraline can make you feel more or less hungry than usual, so you may gain or lose weight when you start taking it.\n\n【29】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking sertraline, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【30】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【31】Sertraline will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【32】But if you get severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours after taking sertraline, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【33】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【34】The positive effects of sertraline may, after a while, improve your sex life as your mood lifts and you become more interested in life and relationships again.\n\n【35】Some of the possible negative effects may include:\n\n【36】*   painful erections and problems with getting an erection and ejaculating\n*   vaginal bleeding and not reaching orgasm the same way as before\n*   a lower sex drive\n\n【37】Sexual side effects usually pass after the first couple of weeks. However, very rarely, they can be long lasting and may not get better even after stopping the medicine.\n\n【38】If this happens and it's a problem for you, go back to your doctor to see if there's another treatment you can try.\n\n【39】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【40】Some people cannot concentrate properly while they're taking sertraline.\n\n【41】It might be best to stop driving and cycling for the first few days of treatment until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\n【42】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected.

", "content": "【0】Common questions about sertraline\n=================================\n\n【1】How does sertraline work?\n\n【2】Sertraline is one of a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs.\n\n【3】These medicines are thought to work by increasing the levels of a mood-enhancing chemical called serotonin in the brain.\n\n【4】How will it make me feel?\n\n【5】Antidepressants like sertraline help to improve your mood so you feel better.\n\n【6】You may notice that you sleep better and get on with people more easily because you're less anxious. You'll hopefully be more relaxed about things that used to worry you.\n\n【7】Sertraline will not change your personality, it will simply help you feel like yourself again.\n\n【8】Do not expect to feel better overnight, though. Some people feel worse during the first few weeks of treatment before they begin to feel better.\n\n【9】When will I feel better?\n\n【10】You may see an improvement in your symptoms after 1 or 2 weeks, although it usually takes from 4 to 6 weeks before you feel the full benefits.\n\n【11】That's because it takes around a week for sertraline levels to build up in your body, and then a few weeks longer for your body to adapt and get used to it.\n\n【12】Do not stop taking sertraline just because you feel it is not helping your symptoms. Give the medicine at least 6 weeks to work.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】For most people, sertraline is safe to take for a long time.\n\n【15】A few people may get sexual side effects, such as problems getting an erection or a lower sex drive. In some cases these can continue even after stopping the medicine. Speak to your doctor if you are worried.\n\n【16】If you have diabetes, sertraline can affect your blood sugar levels. Your doctor may monitor you to check that you're on the right dose of diabetes medicine.\n\n【17】Otherwise there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking sertraline for many months and years.\n\n【18】How does sertraline compare with other antidepressants?\n\n【19】Sertraline is not any better or worse than other antidepressants. Sometimes people respond better to one antidepressant than another.\n\n【20】If you are not feeling any better after 6 weeks, talk to your doctor.\n\n【21】Are there other treatments that will help?\n\n【22】Antidepressants, including sertraline, are just one of several approaches to treating depression.\n\n【23】Other potential treatments include:\n\n【24】*   talking therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy)\n*   exercise programmes\n*   help to get a good night's sleep\n\n【25】Choosing a treatment that's most suitable for you depends on:\n\n【26】*   how long you have had depression\n*   your symptoms\n*   whether you have had any previous periods of depression\n*   whether previous treatment has worked\n*   how likely you are to stick with your treatment\n*   the potential side effects\n*   your preferences and priorities\n\n【27】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【28】Sertraline can make you feel more or less hungry than usual, so you may gain or lose weight when you start taking it.\n\n【29】If you start to have problems with your weight while taking sertraline, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【30】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【31】Sertraline will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【32】But if you get severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours after taking sertraline, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【33】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【34】The positive effects of sertraline may, after a while, improve your sex life as your mood lifts and you become more interested in life and relationships again.\n\n【35】Some of the possible negative effects may include:\n\n【36】*   painful erections and problems with getting an erection and ejaculating\n*   vaginal bleeding and not reaching orgasm the same way as before\n*   a lower sex drive\n\n【37】Sexual side effects usually pass after the first couple of weeks. However, very rarely, they can be long lasting and may not get better even after stopping the medicine.\n\n【38】If this happens and it's a problem for you, go back to your doctor to see if there's another treatment you can try.\n\n【39】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【40】Some people cannot concentrate properly while they're taking sertraline.\n\n【41】It might be best to stop driving and cycling for the first few days of treatment until you know how this medicine makes you feel.\n\n【42】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking sertraline.

You may need urgent treatment.\n\n【7】Seeing a GP\n-----------\n\n【8】Varicose veins are diagnosed by their appearance. The GP will examine your legs while you're standing to check for signs of swelling.\n\n【9】You may also be asked to describe any pain you have and whether there are situations that make your varicose veins worse.\n\n【10】For example, some women find their menstrual cycle (period) affects their varicose veins.\n\n【11】The GP will also want to know if you're at an increased risk of developing varicose veins, such as:\n\n【12】*   having a family history of varicose veins\n*   being pregnant\n*   whether you have a healthy body mass index (BMI)\n*   having deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body)\n*   a history of leg injury (for example, having previously broken a bone in your leg)\n\n【13】Further investigation\n---------------------\n\n【14】The GP may refer you to a vascular specialist (a doctor who specialises in veins) if you have any of the following:\n\n【15】*   varicose veins that are causing pain, aching, discomfort, swelling, heaviness or itching\n*   changes in the colour of the skin on your leg that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   skin conditions affecting your leg, such as eczema, that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   hard and painful varicose veins that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg\n*   a healed or unhealed leg ulcer (a break in the skin that has not healed within 2 weeks) below the knee\n\n【16】In most cases, a test called a duplex ultrasound scan will be carried out. This is a type of scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce a picture of the veins in your legs.\n\n【17】The picture shows the blood flow and helps the vascular specialist locate any damaged valves that might be causing your varicose veins.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 May 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 May 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:14:38", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:14:49", "cost": 10.237}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:14:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:14:37"}

They'll then sew together the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus.\n\n【22】If the gap in the oesophagus is large, your child may need to wait a few months for the operation, to allow their oesophagus to grow a bit more. During this time, they'll need to have a feeding tube temporarily placed into their stomach through their tummy.\n\n【23】Occasionally, a procedure to lengthen the oesophagus before repairing it may be carried out.\n\n【24】After surgery\n-------------\n\n【25】After surgery, your child will be kept in the intensive care unit and placed in an incubator.\n\n【26】They may also need:\n\n【27】*   antibiotics\n*   a machine to help them breathe (ventilator)\n*   a tube into their chest to drain fluids or air that might be trapped\n*   oxygen\n*   pain medicine\n\n【28】Your baby will be given nutrition intravenously at first, but you should be able to feed them after a few days using a feeding tube passed into their stomach through their nose.\n\n【29】Going home\n----------\n\n【30】You'll be able to take your baby home once they're taking food by mouth. This will usually take a week or two. You'll be advised about how to feed your child when they get home and as they get older.\n\n【31】Breast or bottle feeding will usually be recommended for at least the first few months.\n\n【32】It may then be possible to very gradually wean your child on to thicker foods. The hospital may be able to refer you to a dietitian for specific advice.\n\n【33】Contact the hospital or your GP if your child is choking or coughing on their feeds, has any difficulty swallowing or is failing to gain weight.\n\n【34】Risks of surgery\n----------------\n\n【35】With any surgery, there's a small risk of bleeding and infection.\n\n【36】For this particular operation, the additional risks are:\n\n【37】*   food or air leaking from the area being repaired\n*   narrowing of the repaired oesophagus\n*   reopening of the fistula between the oesophagus and windpipe\n\n【38】A further procedure or operation may be needed to treat these problems if they develop.\n\n【39】Outlook\n-------\n\n【40】Most children who have surgery will go on to have normal lives.\n\n【41】But there's a chance your child may experience some further problems, including:\n\n【42】*   swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)\n*   gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) – where acid leaks out of the stomach and up into the oesophagus\n*   asthma\\-like symptoms – such as persistent coughing or wheezing\n*   recurrent chest infections\n*   tracheomalacia – where the repaired section of windpipe becomes floppy and makes breathing difficult\n\n【43】Your child will be continuously monitored by specialists after their operation to pick up problems such as these and treat them early on. Some of these problems will improve as your child gets older.\n\n【44】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【45】Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula Support (TOFS) is a charity that supports people born with oesophageal atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistula and their families.\n\n【46】As well as visiting the TOFS website, you can call their helpline on 0115 961 3092.\n\n【47】National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】If your child had oesophageal atresia as a baby, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【49】The NCARDRS helps scientists to better understand oesophageal atresia. You can opt out of the register at any time.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 August 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 August 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:42:31", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:42:56", "cost": 25.122}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:42:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:42:31"}

Overview\n2.  Types\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Some types of ataxia affect children from an early age, while other types may not develop until much later in adulthood.**\n\n【3】Depending on the type of ataxia, the symptoms may stay the same, get progressively worse, or slowly improve.\n\n【4】Some of the main types of ataxia are described below. Read about the causes of ataxia for information about why these different types of ataxia develop.\n\n【5】Friedreich's ataxia\n-------------------\n\n【6】Friedreich's ataxia is the most common type of hereditary ataxia (caused by genes you've inherited). It's thought to affect at least 1 in every 50,000 people.\n\n【7】Symptoms usually first develop before the age of 25, although it can develop in people much older than this.\n\n【8】Signs and symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia can include:\n\n【9】*   problems with balance and co-ordination, often causing wobbliness, clumsiness and frequent falls\n*   increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria)\n*   increasing weakness in the legs – many people find walking difficult and need to use a wheelchair after around 10 to 20 years\n*   difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis)\n*   total or partial vision loss and hearing loss\n*   diabetes\n*   thickening of the heart muscles (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), which can cause chest pain, breathlessness and an irregular heartbeat\n*   loss of sensation in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n\n【10】The symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia usually get gradually worse over many years. People with the condition tend to have a shorter life expectancy than normal. Many people live until at least their 30s, and some can live into their 60s or beyond.\n\n【11】Ataxia-telangiectasia\n---------------------\n\n【12】Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a rarer type of hereditary ataxia. Symptoms usually begin in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop later.\n\n【13】Signs and symptoms of AT can include:\n\n【14】*   difficulty walking – most children need to use a wheelchair by 10 years of age\n*   increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria)\n*   difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   small spider-like clusters of red blood vessels in the corner of their eyes and on their cheeks (telangiectasias)\n*   very slow eye movements, which may mean the person has to move their head a lot to compensate for this\n*   a weakened immune system – children with AT are more vulnerable to infections, particularly infections of the sinuses, lungs and airways, such as pneumonia\n*   an increased risk of cancer, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma \n\n【15】The symptoms of AT tend to get worse quite quickly. People with the condition usually live until the age of 19 to 25, although some may live into their 50s.\n\n【16】Spinocerebellar ataxias\n-----------------------\n\n【17】Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of hereditary ataxias that often don't begin until adulthood, affecting people from the age of 25 up to 80, depending on the type of SCA. Occasionally, some types of SCA begin in childhood.\n\n【18】The symptoms vary depending on the type of SCA. They can include:\n\n【19】*   problems with balance and co-ordination – many people find walking difficult and need to use a wheelchair after a few years\n*   increasingly slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria)\n*   difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   muscle stiffness and cramps\n*   loss of sensation in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n*   memory loss and difficulties with spoken language\n*   slow eye movement, which means people have to move their head to compensate\n*   reduced bladder control (urinary urgency or incontinence)\n\n【20】Episodic ataxia\n---------------\n\n【21】Episodic ataxia is a rare and unusual type of hereditary ataxia where someone experiences episodes of ataxia, but the rest of the time they have no or only mild symptoms.\n\n【22】During an episode, someone with episodic ataxia may experience:\n\n【23】*   problems with balance and co-ordination\n*   slurred, slow and unclear speech (dysarthria)\n*   muscle spasms\n*   involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)\n*   vertigo, migraines and tinnitus\n\n【24】Episodic ataxia usually first develops during the teenage years. The episodes can last from several minutes to hours and are usually the result of certain triggers, such as sudden movement, stress, exercise, caffeine or alcohol.\n\n【25】The symptoms of episodic ataxia may disappear as a person gets older, although sometimes the condition gets gradually worse over time. Medication can often help control attacks, and life expectancy is usually normal.\n\n【26】Other types of ataxia\n---------------------\n\n【27】There are also a number of other types of ataxia that tend to have similar symptoms to those mentioned above. These include:\n\n【28】*   **acquired ataxia** – this can affect people of any age and usually develops very quickly over the course of a few days, or sometimes hours; it may improve over time, stay the same or get slowly worse\n*   **idiopathic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA)** – this usually begins at around 50 years of age and gets slowly worse over time\n*   **ataxia with vitamin E deficiency** – a similar condition to Friedreich's ataxia caused by problems with the body's ability to use vitamin E in the diet; it's often possible to control the symptoms with vitamin E supplements\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Ataxia</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:41", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:55", "cost": 14.703}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:40"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin reacts to a particular substance.**\n\n【3】This can be either:\n\n【4】*   an irritant – a substance that directly damages the outer layer of skin\n*   an allergen – a substance that causes your immune system to respond in a way that affects the skin\n\n【5】Irritant contact dermatitis\n---------------------------\n\n【6】Irritant contact dermatitis may be caused by frequent exposure to a weak irritant, such as soap or detergent. It may also develop if you've been in contact with a stronger irritant for a short while.\n\n【7】You're at an increased risk of irritant contact dermatitis if you also have atopic eczema, which is the most common form of eczema. \n\n【8】Common irritants include:\n\n【9】*   soaps and detergents\n*   antiseptics and antibacterials\n*   perfumes and preservatives in toiletries or cosmetics\n*   solvents\n*   oils used in machines \n*   disinfectants\n*   acids and alkalis\n*   cement\n*   powders, dust and soil\n*   water – especially hard, chalky water or heavily chlorinated water\n*   many plants – such as Ranunculus, spurge, Boraginaceae and mustards\n\n【10】If you already have irritant contact dermatitis symptoms, they can be made worse by heat, cold, friction (rubbing against the irritant) and low humidity (dry air).\n\n【11】### Exposure at work \n\n【12】You may be more at risk of irritant contact dermatitis if you work with irritants as part of your job, or if your job involves a lot of wet work.\n\n【13】If you develop the condition because of a substance you work with, it may be referred to as occupational irritant dermatitis.\n\n【14】This type of dermatitis is more common in certain occupations, including:\n\n【15】*   agricultural workers\n*   beauticians and hairdressers\n*   chemical workers\n*   cleaners\n*   construction workers\n*   cooks and caterers\n*   metal and electronics workers\n*   health and social care workers\n*   machine operators\n*   mechanics and vehicle assemblers\n\n【16】Allergic contact dermatitis\n---------------------------\n\n【17】The first time you come into contact with an allergen, your body becomes sensitised to it, but does not react to it. It's only when you're exposed to the substance again that your immune system reacts and causes the skin to become red and itchy.\n\n【18】Allergens that commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis include:\n\n【19】*   cosmetic ingredients – such as preservatives, fragrances, hair dye and nail varnish hardeners\n*   metals – such as nickel or cobalt in jewellery\n*   some topical medicines (medicines applied directly to the skin) – including topical corticosteroids, in rare cases\n*   rubber – including latex, a type of naturally occurring rubber \n*   textiles – particularly the dyes and resins that are contained in them\n*   strong glues – such as epoxy resin adhesives\n*   some plants – such as chrysanthemums, sunflowers, daffodils, tulips and primula\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 May 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:53:49", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:55:28", "cost": 98.567}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:51", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:55:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:53:48"}

If you do get a side effect, it is usually mild and will go away when you stop taking rabeprazole.\n\n【2】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【3】These common side effects of rabeprazole happen in more than 1 in 100 people. There are things you can do to help cope with them.\n\n【4】Headaches\n\n【5】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinking too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should usually go away after the first week of taking rabeprazole. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【6】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【7】It may help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Drink plenty of water by having small, frequent sips to avoid dehydration. If you're being sick, take, small, frequent sips. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【8】If you're taking contraceptive pills and rabeprazole makes you sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【9】Diarrhoea\n\n【10】Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without talking to your doctor.\n\n【11】If you're taking contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【12】Constipation\n\n【13】Get more fibre into your diet such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to increase your level of exercise, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【14】Stomach pain\n\n【15】Try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your stomach may also help. If you are in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【16】Farting\n\n【17】Avoid foods that cause wind, like lentils, peas, beans and onions. It might also help to eat smaller and more frequent meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. Some pharmacy remedies, such as simeticone, may relieve the symptoms of wind.\n\n【18】Feeling dizzy or tired\n\n【19】If rabeprazole makes you feel dizzy or tired, stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery. Do not drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse.\n\n【20】Sore throat\n\n【21】Try chewing sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n\n【22】Keep taking the medicine, but talk to your doctor if this advice does not help and the side effects bother you or do not go away.\n\n【23】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【24】Some of these serious side effects are more common than others.\n\n【25】Call a doctor or call 111 now if you:\n\n【26】*   have joint pain along with a red skin rash, especially in parts of your body exposed to the sun, such as your arms, cheeks and nose (this may be less noticeable on brown on black skin) – these can be signs of a rare condition called subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). This can happen even if you've been taking rabeprazole for a long time\n*   have diarrhoea that’s severe or that does not go away – this can be a sign of an inflamed bowel\n*   notice stomach pains that are getting worse, the whites of your eyes or your skin turns yellow, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – this can be a sign of liver problems\n*   are getting frequent infections, such as a sore throat or high temperature, or ulcers in your mouth or throat\n*   bruise or bleed easily\n\n【27】### **Serious allergic reaction**\n\n【28】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to rabeprazole.\n\n【29】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【30】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【31】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【32】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【33】Long term side effects\n----------------------\n\n【34】If you take rabeprazole for more than 3 months, the levels of magnesium in your blood may fall.\n\n【35】Low magnesium can make you feel tired, confused and dizzy, and cause muscle twitches, shakiness and an irregular heartbeat. Tell your doctor if you get any of these symptoms.\n\n【36】Taking rabeprazole for more than a year may increase your chances of certain side effects, including:\n\n【37】*   bone fractures\n*   gut infections\n*   vitamin B12 deficiency – symptoms include feeling very tired, a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers and pins and needles\n\n【38】If you take rabeprazole for longer than a year, your doctor will regularly check your health to see if you should carry on taking it.\n\n【39】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【40】These are not all the side effects of rabeprazole.

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**There are 2 types of lymphoedema – primary and secondary lymphoedema – which have different causes.**\n\n【3】Primary lymphoedema\n-------------------\n\n【4】Primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system.\n\n【5】The faulty genes cause the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid to not develop properly or not work as they should.\n\n【6】Primary lymphoedema often runs in families, although not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.\n\n【7】Secondary lymphoedema\n---------------------\n\n【8】Secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system that then becomes damaged.\n\n【9】It can have a number of different causes.\n\n【10】### Surgery for cancer\n\n【11】Treatment for cancer can involve surgery to remove sections of the lymphatic system.\n\n【12】The surgeon will try to limit damage to your lymphatic system, although this is not always possible.\n\n【13】There's a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring after treatment for any cancer where lymph glands are removed.\n\n【14】Some of the more common cancers where this happens are:\n\n【15】*   breast cancer\n*   head and neck cancer\n*   skin cancer (melanoma)\n*   gynaecological cancers – such as cervical cancer and vulval cancer\n*   genitourinary cancers – such as prostate cancer or penile cancer\n*   lymphoma\n*   advancer cancers\n\n【16】### Radiotherapy\n\n【17】Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high energy (radiation) to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue.\n\n【18】If radiotherapy is needed to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there's a risk that the lymphatic system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly.\n\n【19】### Infections\n\n【20】An infection, such as cellulitis, can sometimes cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred.\n\n【21】Filariasis can also cause lymphoedema. Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease caused by microscopic, thread-like worms.\n\n【22】The adult worms only live in the human lymphatic system and block lymph drainage. It's a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not generally a risk in the UK.\n\n【23】### Inflammation\n\n【24】Medical conditions that cause tissue to become red and swollen can also permanently damage the lymphatic system.\n\n【25】Conditions that can cause lymphoedema include:\n\n【26】*   psoriasis\n*   atopic eczema\n\n【27】### Venous diseases\n\n【28】Diseases that affect the flow of blood through the veins can cause lymphoedema in some people.\n\n【29】The abnormal or damaged veins can cause fluid to overflow from the veins into the tissue spaces.\n\n【30】This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid.\n\n【31】Some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include:\n\n【32】*   DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – a blood clot in 1 of the deep veins in the body\n*   swollen and enlarged veins (varicose veins) – where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure and more fluid overflowing into the surrounding tissues\n\n【33】### Obesity\n\n【34】Obesity is another possible cause of secondary lymphoedema.\n\n【35】People who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing swollen body parts.\n\n【36】It's not clear exactly why this is, but it's been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them.\n\n【37】Check if you are obese on the BMI healthy weight calculator.\n\n【38】In these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference to the swelling.\n\n【39】### Trauma and injury\n\n【40】In a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system.\n\n【41】For example, it can sometimes occur after a road traffic accident where there's extensive bruising or soft tissue loss.\n\n【42】### Immobility\n\n【43】Movement and exercise help lymph drainage because muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them.\n\n【44】Reduced movement can therefore lead to lymphoedema because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved along.\n\n【45】For example, people who have limited mobility for a long period of time as a result of an illness, nerve damage or arthritis may be at risk of lymphoedema.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 29 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 29 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Lymphoedema</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:32", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:47:00", "cost": 28.043}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:31"}

About promethazine\n----------------------\n\n【4】Promethazine is an antihistamine medicine that relieves the symptoms of allergies.\n\n【5】It's known as a drowsy (sedating) antihistamine, so it's more likely to make you feel sleepy than other antihistamines.\n\n【6】Promethazine is used for:\n\n【7】*   short-term sleep problems (insomnia) – including when a cough, cold or itching is keeping you awake at night\n*   allergies, including hay fever and hives (urticaria)\n*   feeling and being sick (vomiting) – due to motion sickness or vertigo\n*   cold symptoms, such as coughing and a runny nose\n\n【8】You can buy promethazine from pharmacies, where it's often sold as Avomine, Phenergan or Sominex. Promethazine is also available on prescription.\n\n【9】It comes as tablets, capsules and a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【10】You can also buy promethazine mixed with other medicines, such as paracetamol, dextromethorphan or pseudoephedrine, to treat coughs and colds or pain.\n\n【11】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【12】*   Do not drink alcohol while taking promethazine. Alcohol increases the risks of side effects.\n*   To help you sleep, take promethazine 20 minutes before you go to bed.

Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【39】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【40】For motion sickness, take it as soon as you remember.\n\n【41】For anything else, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【42】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【43】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【44】### What if I take too much?\n\n【45】Too much promethazine can be dangerous.\n\n【46】If you take more than your usual dose, you may:\n\n【47】*   feel very sleepy\n*   have a very fast, irregular or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   have breathing problems\n\n【48】In serious cases, you can become unconscious or have seizures or fits and may need emergency treatment in hospital.\n\n【49】If your child takes too much promethazine, they may also:\n\n【50】*   move unsteadily or stumble\n*   have uncontrolled movements, especially in their hands or feet\n*   see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations)\n*   have an irregular heartbeat\n\n【51】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice if:\n\n【52】*   you take more than your usual dose of promethazine\n\n【53】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【54】If you need to go to A&E do not drive yourself.

Side effects\n----------------\n\n【57】### Common side effects\n\n【58】Like all medicines, promethazine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【59】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【60】*   feeling tired during the daytime\n*   nightmares\n*   feeling dizzy or unsteady on your feet, or having difficulty concentrating\n*   headaches\n\n【61】Promethazine can sometimes make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Keep out of direct or strong sunlight and follow sun safety advice.\n\n【62】If you're over 65, you're more likely to get side effects such as:\n\n【63】*   feeling confused\n*   dry mouth\n*   blurred vision\n*   difficulty peeing\n\n【64】Talk to a doctor or call 111 straight away if you have these side effects.\n\n【65】Children are more likely to get side effects such as feeling restless or excited.\n\n【66】### Serious side effects\n\n【67】Call your doctor straight away if:\n\n【68】*   the whites of your eyes or your skin turn yellow, although this may be less obvious on black or brown skin – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you notice more bruising or bleeding than normal\n*   you have muscle stiffness or shaking, or unusual face or tongue movements\n\n【69】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【70】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to promethazine.\n\n【71】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【72】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【73】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【74】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【75】These are not all the side effects of promethazine. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【76】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【77】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【78】6\\. How to cope with side effects of promethazine\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】**What to do about:**\n\n【80】*   **feeling sleepy during the daytime** – this usually wears off 12 hours after a dose. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling this way.\n*   **nightmares** – speak to your pharmacist or doctor if these do not go away or are troubling you.\n*   **feeling dizzy or unsteady on your feet, or having difficulty concentrating** – stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. If the feeling does not go away or is troubling you, do not take any more medicine and speak to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【81】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【82】### Promethazine and pregnancy\n\n【83】Promethazine can be used in pregnancy. There is no good evidence that it is harmful to your baby, but it can have side effects such as drowsiness.\n\n【84】For the treatment of hay fever your doctor or pharmacist may recommend a non-drowsy antihistamine (loratadine).\n\n【85】### Promethazine and breastfeeding\n\n【86】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, promethazine can be used during breastfeeding. If you are prescribed promethazine, it's better to take occasional doses or only for a short time.\n\n【87】It's not known how much promethazine passes into breast milk but it is likely to be a small amount. It has been used for many years without causing babies to have side effects. However, promethazine is a drowsy antihistamine, so may also make your baby sleepy too. It may also reduce the amount of milk you produce.\n\n【88】If you're breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist, as other medicines might be better while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【89】If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy, or seems irritable, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n\n【90】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【91】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how promethazine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【92】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】Some medicines and promethazine can affect each other and increase the chance of having side effects.\n\n【94】Tell your pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\n【95】*   a type of antidepressant called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, such as phenelzine\n*   a type of painkiller called an opioid, such as codeine, morphine or oxycodone\n*   any medicine that makes you drowsy, gives you a dry mouth, or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking promethazine might make these side effects worse\n\n【96】If you're taking a cough or cold remedy or a painkiller containing promethazine, check carefully what the other ingredients are.\n\n【97】For example, promethazine often comes mixed with paracetamol. If you take 2 medicines that both contain paracetamol, there's a risk of overdose.\n\n【98】Ask your pharmacist for advice before you take this medicine together with any other painkillers or medicines.\n\n【99】### Mixing promethazine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【100】There might be a problem taking some herbal remedies and supplements alongside promethazine, especially ones that cause side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth or making it difficult to pee.\n\n【101】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【102】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【103】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【104】9\\. Common questions about promethazine\n---------------------------------------\n\n【105】How does promethazine work?\n\n【106】Promethazine is a medicine called an antihistamine. It's classed as a drowsy (sedating) antihistamine.\n\n【107】When you come into contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen or animal hair, your body produces a chemical called histamine. This can cause symptoms such as a runny nose or skin rashes.\n\n【108】Promethazine blocks the effects of histamine in your brain and this reduces symptoms.\n\n【109】It enters the brain in large quantities and this can make you feel drowsy.\n\n【110】Promethazine also blocks the effects of a chemical called dopamine, and this stops you feeling sick.\n\n【111】How is it different from other cough and cold remedies?\n\n【112】Promethazine blocks the effects of a natural chemical called acetylcholine.\n\n【113】This can help dry up a cough or runny nose, but can also cause side effects such as a dry mouth and dry nose.\n\n【114】Some cough and cold remedies claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm.\n\n【115】Although some people find them helpful, they're not usually recommended.\n\n【116】This is because there's little evidence that they're any more effective than simple home remedies and they're not suitable for everyone.\n\n【117】How long does it take to work?\n\n【118】Promethazine will start to make you feel sleepy around 20 minutes after you take it and may work for up to 12 hours.\n\n【119】If you're taking it for a cough or cold, allergies or feeling sick (nausea), your symptoms should start to improve within 20 minutes. The medicine should work for around 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【120】How long can I take it for?\n\n【121】Only take promethazine for a short time, unless your doctor says it's OK for you to take it for longer.\n\n【122】Speak to your pharmacist or doctor before taking promethazine for longer than the medicine leaflet recommends.\n\n【123】Ask them for advice if you're unsure how long you should take it for.\n\n【124】Is promethazine addictive?\n\n【125】It's unlikely that you'll get addicted to promethazine. But it's best that you only take it for a very short time, unless your doctor tells you to take it for longer.\n\n【126】If you have bought a medicine containing promethazine, do not take it for longer than recommended on the packet without speaking to your pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【127】If you have taken promethazine for a long time and suddenly stop taking it, it's possible you might feel dizzy, sweaty or sick, have a racing heart and have trouble sleeping.\n\n【128】Coming off promethazine slowly can help prevent this.\n\n【129】Speak to your doctor if you have taken promethazine for a long time and want to stop taking it.\n\n【130】How is promethazine different from other antihistamines?\n\n【131】Promethazine is known as a drowsy (sedating) antihistamine as it makes you sleepy.\n\n【132】Non-drowsy antihistamines are less likely to have this effect. These include cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine.\n\n【133】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine as it's less likely to interfere with their everyday routine.\n\n【134】You might choose to take a drowsy antihistamine, however, if you're having problems falling asleep, or if symptoms like itching or coughing are keeping you awake.\n\n【135】There is not enough information available to say whether one antihistamine is better than another for treating allergies.\n\n【136】You may need to try a few different medicines to find what works best for you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you're unsure.\n\n【137】Can I take more than one antihistamine at a time?\n\n【138】You can take 2 different antihistamines at a time, if your doctor says it's OK. If you have a severe itchy skin rash, your doctor may recommend 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【139】You could take a non-drowsy antihistamine (such as cetirizine, fexofenadine or loratadine) during the day, and a drowsy antihistamine at night if itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【140】Do not take another drowsy antihistamine together with promethazine. It'll make you very tired and sleepy.\n\n【141】Other drowsy antihistamines include chlorphenamine (Piriton) and diphenhydramine (Nytol Original).\n\n【142】#### Important\n\n【143】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless you have been advised to by your doctor.\n\n【144】Will it help me sleep?\n\n【145】Yes. If you take it for insomnia or take it at bedtime, promethazine will help you sleep.\n\n【146】If you take it during the day for other conditions, such as allergies, it might make you feel sleepy during the day as well.\n\n【147】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【148】Yes, you can take promethazine together with some painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【149】If you take promethazine with painkillers that contain codeine (such as co-codamol or other prescription painkillers), you may feel very tired and sleepy.\n\n【150】It's important to check the packaging or label of your medicine carefully. This is because some promethazine products already contain a painkiller.\n\n【151】Do not take extra painkillers if this is the case, as there's a risk of overdose.\n\n【152】Speak to your pharmacist if you're not sure whether a medicine already contains a painkiller.\n\n【153】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【154】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if promethazine makes you sleepy during the daytime, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【155】This may be more likely when you first start taking promethazine, but could happen at any time (for example, when starting another medicine).\n\n【156】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking promethazine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【157】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【158】There's no evidence to suggest that taking promethazine reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【159】But speak to a pharmacist or doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【160】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【161】Promethazine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【162】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【163】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking promethazine.\n\n【164】Alcohol and promethazine together can make you sleep very deeply.\n\n【165】You will not be able to breathe properly and may have difficulty waking up.\n\n【166】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【167】You can eat normally while taking promethazine.\n\n【168】However, do not drink alcohol. And if you take promethazine to help you sleep, try not to have drinks that contain caffeine, like coffee, tea, cola or energy drinks. Caffeine has the opposite effect to promethazine and can stop the medicine working.\n\n【169】Is it dangerous to take with recreational drugs?\n\n【170】Yes, it's dangerous to take promethazine with recreational drugs. This is because it can slow or stop your heart and lungs.\n\n【171】Mixing promethazine and codeine in large amounts slows down the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can slow breathing and heart rate.\n\n【172】It's even more dangerous when taken with alcohol or other drugs and has caused people to die.\n\n【173】Find out more the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【174】Can lifestyle changes help me sleep better?\n\n【175】Promethazine will only help you sleep while you're taking it, so there are a number of things you can do instead to help yourself have a good night's sleep:\n\n【176】*   set regular times for going to bed and waking up\n*   relax before bedtime – try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\n*   use thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\n*   avoid caffeine, cigarettes or vapes, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before bedtime\n*   do not watch TV or use phones, tablets or computers before going to bed\n*   do not nap during the day\n*   make a list of your worries and any ideas for how to solve them before you go to bed – this can help you forget about them until the morning\n\n【177】Can lifestyle changes help with hayfever and other allergies?\n\n【178】If you have hay fever, it helps if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【179】#### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【180】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【181】#### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【182】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n\n【183】The best way to prevent any sort of allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you're allergic to, if you can.\n\n【184】There are some practical steps you can follow to help prevent allergies.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【185】*   Contact dermatitis\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n*   Insomnia\n*   Motion sickness\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【186】*   HealthUnlocked: promethazine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Healthtalk: videos of real stories about sleep problems\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 October 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】本页内容\n【2】1.关于异丙嗪\n 2.关键事实\n 3.谁可以服用异丙嗪，哪些人不能服用异丙嗪\n 4.如何以及何时服用异丙嗪\n 5.副作用\n 6.如何应对异丙嗪\n的副作用 7.怀孕和母乳喂养\n 8.其他药物注意事项\n 9.关于异丙嗪的常见问题", "content": "【0】Promethazine (Phenergan) \\- Other brand names: Avomine, Sominex\n===============================================================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.

Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as you will not get the right amount.\n\n【39】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【40】For motion sickness, take it as soon as you remember.\n\n【41】For anything else, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【42】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【43】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【44】### What if I take too much?\n\n【45】Too much promethazine can be dangerous.\n\n【46】If you take more than your usual dose, you may:\n\n【47】*   feel very sleepy\n*   have a very fast, irregular or pounding heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   have breathing problems\n\n【48】In serious cases, you can become unconscious or have seizures or fits and may need emergency treatment in hospital.\n\n【49】If your child takes too much promethazine, they may also:\n\n【50】*   move unsteadily or stumble\n*   have uncontrolled movements, especially in their hands or feet\n*   see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations)\n*   have an irregular heartbeat\n\n【51】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice if:\n\n【52】*   you take more than your usual dose of promethazine\n\n【53】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【54】If you need to go to A&E do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【55】Take the promethazine packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【56】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【57】### Common side effects\n\n【58】Like all medicines, promethazine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【59】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【60】*   feeling tired during the daytime\n*   nightmares\n*   feeling dizzy or unsteady on your feet, or having difficulty concentrating\n*   headaches\n\n【61】Promethazine can sometimes make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Keep out of direct or strong sunlight and follow sun safety advice.\n\n【62】If you're over 65, you're more likely to get side effects such as:\n\n【63】*   feeling confused\n*   dry mouth\n*   blurred vision\n*   difficulty peeing\n\n【64】Talk to a doctor or call 111 straight away if you have these side effects.\n\n【65】Children are more likely to get side effects such as feeling restless or excited.\n\n【66】### Serious side effects\n\n【67】Call your doctor straight away if:\n\n【68】*   the whites of your eyes or your skin turn yellow, although this may be less obvious on black or brown skin – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you notice more bruising or bleeding than normal\n*   you have muscle stiffness or shaking, or unusual face or tongue movements\n\n【69】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【70】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to promethazine.\n\n【71】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【72】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【73】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【74】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【75】These are not all the side effects of promethazine. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【76】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【77】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【78】6\\. How to cope with side effects of promethazine\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】**What to do about:**\n\n【80】*   **feeling sleepy during the daytime** – this usually wears off 12 hours after a dose. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling this way.\n*   **nightmares** – speak to your pharmacist or doctor if these do not go away or are troubling you.\n*   **feeling dizzy or unsteady on your feet, or having difficulty concentrating** – stop what you're doing and sit or lie down until you feel better. If the feeling does not go away or is troubling you, do not take any more medicine and speak to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【81】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【82】### Promethazine and pregnancy\n\n【83】Promethazine can be used in pregnancy. There is no good evidence that it is harmful to your baby, but it can have side effects such as drowsiness.\n\n【84】For the treatment of hay fever your doctor or pharmacist may recommend a non-drowsy antihistamine (loratadine).\n\n【85】### Promethazine and breastfeeding\n\n【86】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, promethazine can be used during breastfeeding. If you are prescribed promethazine, it's better to take occasional doses or only for a short time.\n\n【87】It's not known how much promethazine passes into breast milk but it is likely to be a small amount. It has been used for many years without causing babies to have side effects. However, promethazine is a drowsy antihistamine, so may also make your baby sleepy too. It may also reduce the amount of milk you produce.\n\n【88】If you're breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist, as other medicines might be better while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【89】If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, seems unusually sleepy, or seems irritable, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n\n【90】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【91】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how promethazine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【92】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【93】Some medicines and promethazine can affect each other and increase the chance of having side effects.\n\n【94】Tell your pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\n【95】*   a type of antidepressant called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, such as phenelzine\n*   a type of painkiller called an opioid, such as codeine, morphine or oxycodone\n*   any medicine that makes you drowsy, gives you a dry mouth, or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking promethazine might make these side effects worse\n\n【96】If you're taking a cough or cold remedy or a painkiller containing promethazine, check carefully what the other ingredients are.\n\n【97】For example, promethazine often comes mixed with paracetamol. If you take 2 medicines that both contain paracetamol, there's a risk of overdose.\n\n【98】Ask your pharmacist for advice before you take this medicine together with any other painkillers or medicines.\n\n【99】### Mixing promethazine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【100】There might be a problem taking some herbal remedies and supplements alongside promethazine, especially ones that cause side effects such as sleepiness, a dry mouth or making it difficult to pee.\n\n【101】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【102】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【103】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【104】9\\. Common questions about promethazine\n---------------------------------------\n\n【105】How does promethazine work?\n\n【106】Promethazine is a medicine called an antihistamine. It's classed as a drowsy (sedating) antihistamine.\n\n【107】When you come into contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen or animal hair, your body produces a chemical called histamine. This can cause symptoms such as a runny nose or skin rashes.\n\n【108】Promethazine blocks the effects of histamine in your brain and this reduces symptoms.\n\n【109】It enters the brain in large quantities and this can make you feel drowsy.\n\n【110】Promethazine also blocks the effects of a chemical called dopamine, and this stops you feeling sick.\n\n【111】How is it different from other cough and cold remedies?\n\n【112】Promethazine blocks the effects of a natural chemical called acetylcholine.\n\n【113】This can help dry up a cough or runny nose, but can also cause side effects such as a dry mouth and dry nose.\n\n【114】Some cough and cold remedies claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm.\n\n【115】Although some people find them helpful, they're not usually recommended.\n\n【116】This is because there's little evidence that they're any more effective than simple home remedies and they're not suitable for everyone.\n\n【117】How long does it take to work?\n\n【118】Promethazine will start to make you feel sleepy around 20 minutes after you take it and may work for up to 12 hours.\n\n【119】If you're taking it for a cough or cold, allergies or feeling sick (nausea), your symptoms should start to improve within 20 minutes. The medicine should work for around 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【120】How long can I take it for?\n\n【121】Only take promethazine for a short time, unless your doctor says it's OK for you to take it for longer.\n\n【122】Speak to your pharmacist or doctor before taking promethazine for longer than the medicine leaflet recommends.\n\n【123】Ask them for advice if you're unsure how long you should take it for.\n\n【124】Is promethazine addictive?\n\n【125】It's unlikely that you'll get addicted to promethazine. But it's best that you only take it for a very short time, unless your doctor tells you to take it for longer.\n\n【126】If you have bought a medicine containing promethazine, do not take it for longer than recommended on the packet without speaking to your pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【127】If you have taken promethazine for a long time and suddenly stop taking it, it's possible you might feel dizzy, sweaty or sick, have a racing heart and have trouble sleeping.\n\n【128】Coming off promethazine slowly can help prevent this.\n\n【129】Speak to your doctor if you have taken promethazine for a long time and want to stop taking it.\n\n【130】How is promethazine different from other antihistamines?\n\n【131】Promethazine is known as a drowsy (sedating) antihistamine as it makes you sleepy.\n\n【132】Non-drowsy antihistamines are less likely to have this effect. These include cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine.\n\n【133】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine as it's less likely to interfere with their everyday routine.\n\n【134】You might choose to take a drowsy antihistamine, however, if you're having problems falling asleep, or if symptoms like itching or coughing are keeping you awake.\n\n【135】There is not enough information available to say whether one antihistamine is better than another for treating allergies.\n\n【136】You may need to try a few different medicines to find what works best for you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you're unsure.\n\n【137】Can I take more than one antihistamine at a time?\n\n【138】You can take 2 different antihistamines at a time, if your doctor says it's OK. If you have a severe itchy skin rash, your doctor may recommend 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【139】You could take a non-drowsy antihistamine (such as cetirizine, fexofenadine or loratadine) during the day, and a drowsy antihistamine at night if itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【140】Do not take another drowsy antihistamine together with promethazine. It'll make you very tired and sleepy.\n\n【141】Other drowsy antihistamines include chlorphenamine (Piriton) and diphenhydramine (Nytol Original).\n\n【142】#### Important\n\n【143】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless you have been advised to by your doctor.\n\n【144】Will it help me sleep?\n\n【145】Yes. If you take it for insomnia or take it at bedtime, promethazine will help you sleep.\n\n【146】If you take it during the day for other conditions, such as allergies, it might make you feel sleepy during the day as well.\n\n【147】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【148】Yes, you can take promethazine together with some painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【149】If you take promethazine with painkillers that contain codeine (such as co-codamol or other prescription painkillers), you may feel very tired and sleepy.\n\n【150】It's important to check the packaging or label of your medicine carefully. This is because some promethazine products already contain a painkiller.\n\n【151】Do not take extra painkillers if this is the case, as there's a risk of overdose.\n\n【152】Speak to your pharmacist if you're not sure whether a medicine already contains a painkiller.\n\n【153】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【154】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if promethazine makes you sleepy during the daytime, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【155】This may be more likely when you first start taking promethazine, but could happen at any time (for example, when starting another medicine).\n\n【156】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking promethazine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【157】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【158】There's no evidence to suggest that taking promethazine reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【159】But speak to a pharmacist or doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【160】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【161】Promethazine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【162】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【163】Do not drink alcohol while you're taking promethazine.\n\n【164】Alcohol and promethazine together can make you sleep very deeply.\n\n【165】You will not be able to breathe properly and may have difficulty waking up.\n\n【166】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【167】You can eat normally while taking promethazine.\n\n【168】However, do not drink alcohol. And if you take promethazine to help you sleep, try not to have drinks that contain caffeine, like coffee, tea, cola or energy drinks. Caffeine has the opposite effect to promethazine and can stop the medicine working.\n\n【169】Is it dangerous to take with recreational drugs?\n\n【170】Yes, it's dangerous to take promethazine with recreational drugs. This is because it can slow or stop your heart and lungs.\n\n【171】Mixing promethazine and codeine in large amounts slows down the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can slow breathing and heart rate.\n\n【172】It's even more dangerous when taken with alcohol or other drugs and has caused people to die.\n\n【173】Find out more the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n\n【174】Can lifestyle changes help me sleep better?\n\n【175】Promethazine will only help you sleep while you're taking it, so there are a number of things you can do instead to help yourself have a good night's sleep:\n\n【176】*   set regular times for going to bed and waking up\n*   relax before bedtime – try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\n*   use thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\n*   avoid caffeine, cigarettes or vapes, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before bedtime\n*   do not watch TV or use phones, tablets or computers before going to bed\n*   do not nap during the day\n*   make a list of your worries and any ideas for how to solve them before you go to bed – this can help you forget about them until the morning\n\n【177】Can lifestyle changes help with hayfever and other allergies?\n\n【178】If you have hay fever, it helps if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【179】#### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【180】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【181】#### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【182】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n\n【183】The best way to prevent any sort of allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you're allergic to, if you can.\n\n【184】There are some practical steps you can follow to help prevent allergies.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【185】*   Contact dermatitis\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n*   Insomnia\n*   Motion sickness\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【186】*   HealthUnlocked: promethazine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Healthtalk: videos of real stories about sleep problems\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 October 2024</u>", "index": -1, "show": true, "start": -1, "end": 122, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:02:32", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:09:05", "cost": 392.779}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:09:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:02:31"}

They're sometimes called \"blood-thinning\" medicines, although they don't actually make the blood thinner.\n\n【5】Although they're used for similar purposes, anticoagulants are different to antiplatelet medicines, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel.\n\n【6】Types of anticoagulants\n-----------------------\n\n【7】The most commonly prescribed anticoagulant is warfarin.\n\n【8】Newer types of anticoagulants are also available and are becoming increasingly common. These include:\n\n【9】*   rivaroxaban (Xarelto)\n*   dabigatran (Pradaxa)\n*   apixaban (Eliquis)\n*   edoxaban (Lixiana)\n\n【10】Warfarin and the newer alternatives are taken as tablets or capsules. There's also an anticoagulant called heparin that can be given by injection.删除7：<u>Read more about heparin on the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) website.</u>\n\n【11】When anticoagulants are used\n----------------------------\n\n【12】If a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through a blood vessel, the affected part of the body will become starved of oxygen and will stop working properly.\n\n【13】Depending on where the clot forms, this can lead to serious problems such as:\n\n【14】*   strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (\"mini-strokes\")\n*   heart attacks\n*   deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n*   pulmonary embolism\n\n【15】Treatment with anticoagulants may be recommended if your doctor feels you're at an increased risk of developing one of these problems. This may be because you've had blood clots in the past or you've been diagnosed with a condition such as atrial fibrillation that can cause blood clots to form.\n\n【16】You may also be prescribed an anticoagulant if you've recently had surgery, as the period of rest and inactivity you need during your recovery can increase your risk of developing a blood clot.\n删除7：<u>Read more about when anticoagulants are used.</u>\n\n【17】How to take anticoagulants\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Your doctor or nurse should tell you how much of your anticoagulant medicine to take and when to take it. \n\n【19】Most people need to take their tablets or capsules once or twice a day with water or food.\n\n【20】The length of time you need to keep taking your medicine for depends on why it's been prescribed. In many cases, treatment will be lifelong.\n\n【21】If you're unsure how to take your medicine, or are worried that you missed a dose or have taken too much, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it or ask your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist what to do. You can also call NHS 111 for advice.\n删除7：<u>Read more about anticoagulant dosage.</u>\n\n【22】Things to consider when taking anticoagulants\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【23】There are several things you need to be aware of when taking anticoagulant medicines.\n\n【24】If you're going to have surgery or a test such as an endoscopy, make sure your doctor or surgeon is aware that you're taking anticoagulants, as you may have to stop taking them for a short time.\n\n【25】Speak to your GP, anticoagulant clinic or pharmacist before taking any other medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as some medicines can affect how your anticoagulant works.\n\n【26】If you're taking warfarin, you'll also need to avoid making significant changes to what you normally eat and drink, as this can affect your medicine.\n\n【27】Most anticoagulant medicines aren't suitable for pregnant women. Speak to your GP or anticoagulant clinic if you become pregnant or are planning to try for a baby while taking anticoagulants.\n删除7：<u>Read more about things to consider when taking anticoagulants.</u>\n\n【28】Side effects of anticoagulants\n------------------------------\n\n【29】Like all medicines, there's a risk of experiencing side effects while taking anticoagulants.\n\n【30】The main side effect is that you can bleed too easily, which can cause problems such as:\n\n【31】*   passing blood in your urine\n*   passing blood when you poo or having black poo\n*   severe bruising\n*   prolonged nosebleeds\n*   bleeding gums\n*   vomiting blood or coughing up blood\n*   heavy periods in women\n\n【32】For most people, the benefits of taking anticoagulants will outweigh the risk of excessive bleeding.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the side effects of anticoagulants.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Uses</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:43:25", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:43:51", "cost": 25.411}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:43:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:43:25"}

They can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary.\n\n【10】A GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed.\n\n【11】They'll also check other aspects of your health and carry out a physical examination.\n\n【12】They may also organise some blood tests and ask about any medicines you're taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n\n【13】You'll usually be asked some questions and to carry out some memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning.\n\n【14】This can help a GP decide if you need to be referred to a specialist for more assessments.\n\n【15】Referral to a specialist\n------------------------\n\n【16】If a GP is unsure about whether you have Alzheimer's disease, they may refer you to a specialist, such as:\n\n【17】*   a psychiatrist (usually called an old age psychiatrist)\n*   an elderly care physician (sometimes called a geriatrician)\n*   a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system)\n\n【18】The specialist may be based in a memory clinic alongside other professionals who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.\n\n【19】There's no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, but the staff at the memory clinic will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking.\n\n【20】They'll assess your memory and other areas of mental ability and, if necessary, arrange more tests to rule out other conditions.\n\n【21】### Mental ability tests \n\n【22】A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities, such as memory or thinking, using tests known as cognitive assessments.\n\n【23】Most cognitive assessments involve a series of pen and paper tests and questions, each of which carries a score.\n\n【24】These tests assess a number of different mental abilities, including:\n\n【25】*   short- and long-term memory\n*   concentration and attention span\n*   language and communication skills\n*   awareness of time and place (orientation)\n*   abilities related to vision (visuospatial abilities)\n\n【26】It's important to remember that test scores may be influenced by a person's level of education.\n\n【27】For example, someone who cannot read or write very well may have a lower score, but they may not have Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【28】Similarly, someone with a higher level of education may achieve a higher score, but still have dementia.\n\n【29】These tests can therefore help doctors work out what's happening, but they should never be used by themselves to diagnose dementia.\n\n【30】### Other tests\n\n【31】To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan.\n\n【32】This could be a:\n\n【33】*   CT scan – several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer puts the images together\n*   MRI scan – a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your brain\n删除7：<u>Read more about tests for diagnosing dementia.</u>\n\n【34】After diagnosis\n---------------\n\n【35】It may take several appointments and tests over many months before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be confirmed, although often it may be diagnosed more quickly than this.\n\n【36】It takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family.\n\n【37】Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news.\n\n【38】It might help to talk things through with family and friends, and to seek support from the Alzheimer's Society.\n\n【39】As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis are often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you have just been diagnosed with dementia.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 July 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 July 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:33:27", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:36:17", "cost": 170.166}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:36:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:33:27"}

Most warts are firm, raised off the skin and have a rough surface.\n*   Moles are usually found on areas of skin exposed to the sun. They are usually a different colour to the rest of your skin and can be pink, light brown, brown or darker brown depending on the colour of your skin tone. Moles are usually flat and round or oval.\n\n【13】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】You have a skin tag that:\n\n【15】*   gets bigger\n*   becomes painful\n*   starts bleeding\n*   develops into lots of skin tags\n\n【16】Treatment for skin tags\n-----------------------\n\n【17】Skin tags do not need to be removed, but if they're causing problems they can be removed:\n\n【18】*   using heat\n*   by freezing them\n*   by cutting them off with a surgical blade or scissors\n\n【19】Once a skin tag is removed it does not usually return.\n\n【20】Removing skin tags can cause scarring or darken skin (hyperpigmentation) where the skin tag was, particularly on black or brown skin. These effects are usually temporary, although it can sometimes be permanent.\n\n【21】Information:\n\n【22】You cannot get your skin tag removed on the NHS because it is considered cosmetic surgery. You will usually need to pay to have your skin tags removed.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about choosing a professional to remove your skin tag.</u>\n\n【23】### Important: Do not remove your own skin tag\n\n【24】Do not try to remove a skin tag yourself unless a GP recommends it. Risks include infection, bleeding and scarring.\n\n【25】Causes of skin tags\n-------------------\n\n【26】The cause of skin tags is not always known, but they are sometimes caused by skin rubbing against skin.\n\n【27】Anyone can get skin tags and they cannot be prevented, but you may be more likely to get them if:\n\n【28】*   you're living with obesity or have skin folds that rub together\n*   you have type 2 diabetes, because severe insulin resistance is thought to cause more skin tags to grow\n*   you're pregnant, as hormonal changes are thought to cause skin tag growth\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:59", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:14", "cost": 15.13}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:34"}

About betamethasone\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Betamethasone for eyes, ears and nose is used to treat allergies and inflammation. It relieves swelling, redness and irritation.\n\n【5】It can help symptoms that affect your eyes and nose caused by hay fever or allergic rhinitis.\n\n【6】It's also used to treat inflammation in your outer ear, such as that caused by eczema, water or ear plugs.\n\n【7】Betamethasone is a type of medicine called a steroid (also known as a corticosteroid). This is not the same as an anabolic steroid.\n\n【8】Betamethasone is available on prescription only. It comes as an eye ointment or as drops for eyes, ears and nose.\n\n【9】It also comes combined with neomycin (an antibiotic). Betamethasone with neomycin drops are used when there's both inflammation and bacterial infection in the eye, nose or ear.\n\n【10】Betamethasone also comes as:\n\n【11】*   tablets and injections – for many conditions, including asthma and rheumatoid arthritis\n*   skin treatments – for eczema, contact dermatitis and psoriasis\n\n【12】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【13】*   You need to use betamethasone for eyes, ears and nose regularly for it to work, as advised by your doctor.\n*   Common side effects for eyes include irritation and blurry vision. For your nose, it can be sneezing and changes in your sense of smell and taste.\n*   If you're using betamethasone in your ears, you're unlikely to have any side effects.\n*   Only use a steroid treatment if your doctor prescribes it for you. Do not use someone else's medicine.\n*   Brand names include Betnesol and Vistamethasone. Betamethasone with neomycin is known by the brand name Betnesol-N.\n*   If your doctor has prescribed high doses of betamethasone to control your symptoms you may need to carry a steroid emergency card. Ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【14】3\\. Who can and cannot use betamethasone\n----------------------------------------\n\n【15】Adults, children and babies aged 1 month or over can use betamethasone.\n\n【16】It's not suitable for some people. **To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:**\n\n【17】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to betamethasone, or any other medicine in the past\n*   have tuberculosis (TB)\n\n【18】If you're using it for your eyes, also tell them if you:\n\n【19】*   have an infection in your eye, or it's producing pus\n*   have shingles\n*   have glaucoma\n*   have a thinning of your cornea (the part of your eye that covers your iris and pupil) or sclera (the white of your eyeball)\n*   have redness in your eyes that's not caused by an allergy or inflammation\n*   wear soft contact lenses\n\n【20】If you're using it for your nose, tell them if you:\n\n【21】*   have an infection of the lining of your nose (that's not being treated)\n*   have recently had surgery on your nose (that's not healed yet)\n\n【22】Do not use betamethasone in your ears if you have a perforated ear drum.\n\n【23】4\\. How and when to use betamethasone\n-------------------------------------\n\n【24】Always follow your doctor's instructions, or the leaflet that comes with your medicine.\n\n【25】### How to use the eye ointment\n\n【26】Betamethasone eye ointment is generally used 2 or 3 times a day.\n\n【27】However, if you use the eye drops during the day, you'll only need to use the ointment at night. This is because the effect of the eye ointment lasts longer than the eye drops.\n\n【28】To reduce the risk of betamethasone affecting your sleep, some doctors prescribe eye drops to use during the day and ointment to use at night.\n\n【29】1.  Wash and dry your hands.\n2.  If you wear contact lenses, remove them before you use the eye ointment.\n3.  Tilt your head back.\n4.  Gently pull down your lower eyelid.\n5.  Hold the tube with the nozzle close to your eye and gently squeeze about 1 to 2 centimetres of the ointment into the space between your lower lid and your eye.\n6.  Close your eye for a few minutes, so the ointment can spread.\n7.  Repeat for your other eye, if treating both eyes.\n8.  Wait 15 minutes before putting your contact lenses back in.\n\n【30】### How to use the eye drops\n\n【31】The usual dose is 1 or 2 drops in your eye every 1 or 2 hours. Once the redness, itching and soreness starts to feel better, the drops can be used less often.\n\n【32】1.  Wash and dry your hands.\n2.  If you wear contact lenses, remove them before you use the eye drops.\n3.  Tilt your head back.\n4.  Gently pull down your lower eyelid.\n5.  Place drops in the gap between your lower lid and eye (squeeze the bottle very gently if necessary).\n6.  Blink a few times to spread out the drops.\n7.  Repeat for your other eye, if treating both eyes.\n8.  Wait 15 minutes before putting your contact lenses back in.\n\n【33】#### Regular eye check-ups\n\n【34】If you use betamethasone for your eyes for several weeks, your doctor may ask you to have check-ups. These are to make sure your medicine is working properly and that the dose is right for you.\n\n【35】Your doctor will check your eyes for:\n\n【36】*   an increase in pressure\n*   infection\n\n【37】### How to use the ear drops\n\n【38】The usual dose is 2 or 3 drops into the ear every 2 or 3 hours. Once the redness, itching and soreness starts to feel better, use the drops less often.\n\n【39】1.  Tilt your head to one side, with the ear you are treating turned upwards.\n2.

How to cope with side effects of betamethasone\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【77】**What to do about:**\n\n【78】*   **irritation, burning, stinging and itching in your eye** – if you get these symptoms after putting in the eye drops, they should go after a few minutes as your eye gets used to the medicine. If they last longer and do not improve, stop using the eye drops or ointment and tell your doctor.\n*   **blurred or cloudy vision** – you may get some blurred or cloudy vision straight after putting the drops or ointment in your eye. If your sight does not go back to normal after a few minutes, or you think your sight is slowly getting worse, stop using the eye drops or ointment and tell your doctor.\n*   **sneezing, blocked, irritated or dry nose, or nosebleeds** – these will usually settle down as you get used to the medicine.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【80】### Betamethasone and pregnancy\n\n【81】It's generally OK to use betamethasone drops or ointment while pregnant. Very little is absorbed into your blood and this small amount is unlikely to cause any problems.\n\n【82】For safety your doctor will only prescribe betamethasone in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. They will prescribe the lowest dose that works for you.\n\n【83】If you're using the eye drops, you can further reduce the amount of betamethasone reaching your blood by pressing your finger onto the inner corner of your eye for 1 minute after using the drops.\n\n【84】### Betamethasone and breastfeeding\n\n【85】Betamethasone drops and ointment are generally safe to use while breastfeeding. This is because only a small amount of betamethasone passes into your blood.\n\n【86】If you're using the eye drops, you can further reduce the amount of betamethasone reaching your blood by pressing your finger onto the inner corner of your eye for 1 minute after using the drops.\n\n【87】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【88】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【89】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how using steroid nose drops might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet on treating allergic rhinitis on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【90】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【91】It’s very unlikely that other medicines will affect how betamethasone eye ointment or eye, ear or nose drops work.\n\n【92】However, tell a pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\n【93】*   ritonavir (for HIV infection)\n*   cobicistat\n*   itraconazole (for a fungal infection)\n*   other medicines that contain steroids such as eczema creams, asthma inhalers, tablets, injections, eye or nose drops, and other nasal sprays\n\n【94】These medicines can increase the level of betamethasone in your body and increase the chances of side effects.\n\n【95】### Mixing betamethasone with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【96】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while using betamethasone. Ask a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【97】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【98】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【99】9\\. Common questions about betamethasone\n----------------------------------------\n\n【100】How does betamethasone work?\n\n【101】Betamethasone is a corticosteroid (steroid) medicine.\n\n【102】Steroids closely copy the effects of natural hormones produced in your adrenal glands. These are next to your kidneys.\n\n【103】Betamethasone works on your immune system to reduce the symptoms of inflammatory conditions and allergic reactions such as swelling, redness and itching.\n\n【104】How long does betamethasone take to work?\n\n【105】Your eye, ear or nose condition should start to improve quickly within a few days. Tell your doctor if you do not feel better after 7 days.\n\n【106】How long will I take use it for?\n\n【107】Most people will only need to use betamethasone for a few days.\n\n【108】However your doctor may ask you to use it for up to 6 to 8 weeks, depending on your condition.\n\n【109】Once your symptoms are better, your doctor may tell you to reduce your dose slowly before stopping completely.\n\n【110】Is it safe to use for a long time?\n\n【111】Once your condition has settled down your doctor will generally recommend that you stop using this medicine.\n\n【112】If you have been using betamethasone eye, ear or nose products for a long time a doctor may advise you to gradually reduce the amount you use before stopping completely.\n\n【113】Using betamethasone continuously for a long time can increase the risk of side effects.\n\n【114】There's also a risk that some of the medicine gets into your blood, especially if you are using the nose drops. If this happens, there's a very small chance it can cause serious side effects.\n\n【115】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【116】You may stop using betamethasone when your condition has improved. Talk to a doctor if you want to stop treatment after using betamethasone for a long time.\n\n【117】If you've been using the ointment or drops for more than a few weeks, your doctor may tell you to use them less often before you stop completely. This is to reduce the chances of your condition coming back.\n\n【118】Talk to your doctor if your condition comes back after you have stopped betamethasone.\n\n【119】What are betamethasone drops combined with an antibiotic used for?\n\n【120】Betamethasone can be combined with an antibiotic called neomycin. These drops are known by the brand name Betnesol-N.\n\n【121】They can be prescribed when there is inflammation and signs of a bacterial infection. They are often used to treat infections in the ear canal (known as \"swimmer's ear\").\n\n【122】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【123】If you're using steroid medicines such as betamethasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【124】It’s more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【125】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you’re taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【126】### Important\n\n【127】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【128】Can I drink alcohol with betamethasone?\n\n【129】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using betamethasone drops or ointment.\n\n【130】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【131】No, you can eat and drink normally while using betamethasone drops or ointment.\n\n【132】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【133】Betamethasone drops and ointment do not interfere with any type of contraception, including the combined pill or the emergency contraception.\n\n【134】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【135】There's no clear evidence to suggest that betamethasone reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【136】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【137】For most people, taking betamethasone will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle. However, it might help to wait 15 minutes after using the eye drops or ointment, so that your vision returns to normal.\n\n【138】Do not drive if your eyesight is blurred or cloudy.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【139】*   Allergic rhinitis\n*   Hay fever\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【140】*   HealthUnlocked: betamethasone forum\n*   Action Against Allergy: charity\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 6 November 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 6 November 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】On this page", "content": "【0】Betamethasone for eyes, ears and nose \\- Brand names: Betnesol, Vistamethasone\n==============================================================================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.

If this happens, there's a very small chance it can cause serious side effects.\n\n【115】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【116】You may stop using betamethasone when your condition has improved. Talk to a doctor if you want to stop treatment after using betamethasone for a long time.\n\n【117】If you've been using the ointment or drops for more than a few weeks, your doctor may tell you to use them less often before you stop completely. This is to reduce the chances of your condition coming back.\n\n【118】Talk to your doctor if your condition comes back after you have stopped betamethasone.\n\n【119】What are betamethasone drops combined with an antibiotic used for?\n\n【120】Betamethasone can be combined with an antibiotic called neomycin. These drops are known by the brand name Betnesol-N.\n\n【121】They can be prescribed when there is inflammation and signs of a bacterial infection. They are often used to treat infections in the ear canal (known as \"swimmer's ear\").\n\n【122】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【123】If you're using steroid medicines such as betamethasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【124】It’s more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【125】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you’re taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【126】### Important\n\n【127】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【128】Can I drink alcohol with betamethasone?\n\n【129】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using betamethasone drops or ointment.\n\n【130】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【131】No, you can eat and drink normally while using betamethasone drops or ointment.\n\n【132】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【133】Betamethasone drops and ointment do not interfere with any type of contraception, including the combined pill or the emergency contraception.\n\n【134】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【135】There's no clear evidence to suggest that betamethasone reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【136】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【137】For most people, taking betamethasone will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle. However, it might help to wait 15 minutes after using the eye drops or ointment, so that your vision returns to normal.\n\n【138】Do not drive if your eyesight is blurred or cloudy.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【139】*   Allergic rhinitis\n*   Hay fever\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【140】*   HealthUnlocked: betamethasone forum\n*   Action Against Allergy: charity\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 6 November 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 6 November 2023</u>", "index": 162, "show": true, "start": 162, "end": 177, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:17:30", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:20:35", "cost": 184.381}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:20:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:17:29"}

How to cope with side effects of brinzolamide\n7.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about brinzolamide\n\n【3】1\\. About brinzolamide\n----------------------\n\n【4】Brinzolamide is a medicine that treats high pressure inside the eye (ocular hypertension) and helps with glaucoma.\n\n【5】High pressure can happen when too much fluid builds up inside your eye. Brinzolamide helps the eye to produce less fluid.\n\n【6】If not treated, high pressure can damage your optic nerve and cause vision loss or blindness.\n\n【7】Brinzolamide is available on prescription only. It comes as eye drops. It contains a preservative (benzalkonium chloride) to keep it sterile.\n\n【8】Your doctor may also prescribe timolol or brimonidine eye drops to use with brinzolamide.\n\n【9】There are some combined eye drops. The brand Azarga contains brinzolamide and timolol, and Simbrinza contains brinzolamide and brimonidine.\n\n【10】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【11】*   Usually you use brinzolamide eye drops 2 to 3 times a day.\n*   It may take up to 4 weeks for brinzolamide eye drops to reach their full effect, when used twice a day.\n*   If it works for you, you will usually use brinzolamide for the rest of your life.\n*   It's important to use your eye drops regularly and to go for check-ups, to make sure your vision is not getting worse.\n*   Common side effects include an itchy or painful eye and a feeling that something's in your eye.\n\n【12】3\\. Who can and cannot use brinzolamide\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】Most adults aged 18 years and over can use brinzolamide eye drops. Children can only use brinzolamide if it's prescribed by a specialist.\n\n【14】Brinzolamide is not suitable for everyone. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor before starting brinzolamide if you:\n\n【15】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to brinzolamide or any other medicine\n*   have liver or kidney problems\n*   have a condition called hyperchloraemic acidosis (where your blood becomes too acidic)\n*   have dry eyes or problems with your cornea (the clear outer layer of your eye)\n*   normally wear contact lenses (you can still use brinzolamide, but you will need to remove the contact lenses before using the eye drops)\n\n【16】4\\. How and when to use brinzolamide\n------------------------------------\n\n【17】It's important to use brinzolamide as your doctor has advised.\n\n【18】### Dosage\n\n【19】The usual dose for adults and children is 1 drop into the affected eye or eyes twice a day, in the morning and at night.\n\n【20】Your doctor may increase this to 1 drop into the affected eye or eyes 3 times a day, if needed.\n\n【21】### How to use eye drops\n\n【22】Always refer to the patient information leaflet. Instructions can vary between different manufacturers, as some bottles look different and work differently. You may find using a mirror helps.\n\n【23】If you wear contact lenses, make sure you remove them before using your eye drops. Wait 15 minutes before putting your lenses back in.\n\n【24】The drops may make your vision blurred, cause irritation and may change the colour of the contact lenses.\n\n【25】1.  Wash your hands.\n2.  Shake the bottle and twist off the cap. If it does not come with a separate dropper and you have not used these eye drops before, practise gently squeezing the bottle away from your eye first, to get used to the pressure and the time it takes for 1 drop to fall out.\n3.  Make sure the tip of the bottle does not touch your eye, eyelashes, eyelid, your skin, or any other surface.\n4.  Tilt your head back. Use your finger to gently pull down your lower eyelid.\n5.  Hold the dropper over your eye, look up, squeeze gently and allow 1 drop to fall into your lower eyelid. If the drop misses your eye, try again.\n6.  Close your eye. Gently press your finger over the inside corner of your eye (over the eyelid) for about a minute. This helps to keep the drop in the eye.\n7.  Wipe away any extra liquid with a clean tissue.\n8.  Repeat in your other eye if your doctor has told you to do this.\n9.  Put the cap back on the bottle as soon as you've finished using it.\n\n【26】If you find it hard to use eye drops, ask a pharmacist for advice. They may be able to recommend an eye drop dispenser.\n\n【27】If you use brinzolamide with other eye drops or eye ointment, wait at least 5 minutes before using them. They can wash out the brinzolamide and it may not work as well. It's best to use eye ointments last.\n\n【28】### Expiry dates\n\n【29】Use the brinzolamide eye drops within the expiry date on the bottle and within 4 weeks of opening. This will help to prevent the risk of eye infections and the eye drops not working so well.\n\n【30】You could write the date you opened the bottle or packet on the label or the box. This will help you to know when you need to start using a new one.\n\n【31】### What if I forget to use it?\n\n【32】If you forget a dose by less than 2 hours, use the eye drops as soon as you remember, then return to your normal routine for your next dose.\n\n【33】If you forget a dose by more than 2 hours, skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the normal time.\n\n【34】Never use 2 doses at the same time. Never use an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【35】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember your medicines.\n\n【36】### What if I use too much?\n\n【37】Using too many drops can irritate your eye and make it water and turn red. If you get too much brinzolamide in your eye, rinse it all out with water. Do not put any more drops in until it is time for your next dose.\n\n【38】Any irritation, watering or redness should get better, but if you are worried about it ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【39】Contact your doctor if you swallow brinzolamide.\n\n【40】5\\. Side effects of brinzolamide\n--------------------------------\n\n【41】Like all medicines, brinzolamide can cause side effects, but not everyone gets them.\n\n【42】### Common side effects\n\n【43】These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【44】Keep using the medicine, but talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【45】*   an itchy or painful eye and a feeling that something's in your eye, blurred vision, or watery eyes\n*   your eyes become sensitive to bright light (photophobia)\n*   a bad or unusual taste in your mouth\n\n【46】### Serious side effects\n\n【47】Serious side effects are less common. Do not use any more brinzolamide and call a doctor straight away if you:\n\n【48】*   become short of breath\n*   have asthma or COPD and your breathing gets worse\n*   get an irregular, slow or fast heart rate (palpitations)\n\n【49】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 if:\n\n【50】*   you have chest pain – this can be a sign of reduced blood flow to the heart (angina)\n\n【51】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【52】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to brinzolamide.\n\n【53】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【54】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【55】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【56】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【57】These are not all the side effects of brinzolamide. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【58】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【59】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【60】6\\. How to cope with side effects of brinzolamide\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】**What to do about:**\n\n【62】*   **an itchy or painful eye and a feeling that something's in your eye, blurred vision, or watery eyes** - this should go away on its own but talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are concerned about this. If the eye drops irritate your eyes and make them water so much that you think about stopping using the drops, talk to your doctor straight away. They may prescribe something different for you. Do not drive, cycle, use tools or operate heavy machinery until your eyes feel comfortable again and your vision is clear.\n*   **your eyes become sensitive to bright light** - wearing sunglasses may help.\n*   **a bad or unusual taste in your mouth** - this usually only lasts up to 5 minutes. Drink some water or juice, or chew some sugar-free gum.\n\n【63】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【64】It's important that high pressure in your eye or glaucoma is treated while you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n【65】### Brinzolamide and pregnancy\n\n【66】Treating high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is essential and so treatment with brinzolamide should continue in pregnancy.\n\n【67】As it is applied to the eye, very little gets into the bloodstream and to your baby. The small amount that might get to your baby is unlikely to cause harm, however there is not much information on this.\n\n【68】### Brinzolamide and breastfeeding\n\n【69】There's not much information on the use of brinzolamide while breastfeeding, but only very small amounts are likely to pass into breast milk.\n\n【70】This is due to how brinzolamide works and because it's used as eye drops, rather than injected or swallowed.\n\n【71】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your midwife, health visitor or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【72】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【73】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【74】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how brinzolamide can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet about treating glaucoma in pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【75】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【76】There are some medicines that do not mix well with brinzolamide and can affect how well it works.\n\n【77】Tell a doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any of these medicines before you start using brinzolamide:\n\n【78】*   other eye drops that work in a similar way to brinzolamide, such as acetazolamide or dorzolamide\n*   antifungals such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole\n*   ritonavir (an antiviral medicine)\n*   metformin (a medicine used for diabetes)\n\n【79】### Mixing brinzolamide with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【80】There's very little information about taking herbal medicines and supplements with brinzolamide.\n\n【81】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【82】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【83】9\\. Common questions about brinzolamide\n---------------------------------------\n\n【84】How does brinzolamide work?\n\n【85】Brinzolamide is from a group of medicines known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n\n【86】It works by reducing the production of fluid in your eye. This lowers the pressure within your eye. If you're taking it for glaucoma, it helps to stop your glaucoma getting worse.\n\n【87】How long does it take to work?\n\n【88】Brinzolamide may take 1 to 4 weeks to reach its full effect.\n\n【89】How long will I use it for?\n\n【90】You will usually use brinzolamide for the rest of your life. However, if it does not work well enough your doctor may recommend different or additional eye drops.\n\n【91】It's important to use your eye drops regularly and go for check-ups, to make sure your vision is not getting worse.\n\n【92】Can I use brinzolamide for a long time?\n\n【93】Yes, you can use brinzolamide eye drops for a long time. Most people use them for many years with no problems.\n\n【94】Can I stop using brinzolamide?\n\n【95】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop using brinzolamide eye drops.\n\n【96】Stopping using them may cause the pressure in your eye to rise and could lead to a loss of sight.\n\n【97】If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe you a different medicine.\n\n【98】Are there other treatments for high pressure in the eye?\n\n【99】Dorzolamide eye drops work in the same way as brinzolamide. They are both carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.\n\n【100】There are several other types of medicine that work in a different way to reduce high pressure in the eye and treat glaucoma. They include:\n\n【101】*   prostaglandins, such as latanoprost\n*   beta blockers, such as timolol\n*   alpha agonists, such as brimonidine\n*   chlolinergic agonists, such as pilocapine\n\n【102】If brinzolamide does not reduce the pressure in your eye enough, or you cannot use it because of side effects, you may be switched to another type of eye drops.\n\n【103】Some people will need to use a combination of different eye drops. If you need 2 types of medicine, a combination eye drop may be available.\n\n【104】Most people can use eye drops for their glaucoma. However, if eye drops are not enough to reduce the pressure in your eyes, there are other options.\n\n【105】Treatments for glaucoma can include laser treatment or surgery, to improve how fluid drains from your eyes, or reduce the amount of fluid produced in your eyes. These treatments cannot reverse any loss of vision, but they can help to stop it getting worse.\n\n【106】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【107】Yes, you can drink alcohol with brinzolamide eye drops.\n\n【108】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【109】You can eat and drink normally while using brinzolamide eye drops.\n\n【110】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【111】Brinzolamide eye drops do not stop contraceptive pills working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【112】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【113】There's no evidence to suggest that using brinzolamide eye drops reduces fertility in men or women.\n\n【114】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【115】You might have blurred vision or other changes in your vision for a short time after you've put the drops in.\n\n【116】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or operate machinery until you can see clearly again.\n\n【117】Brinzolamide can make you feel dizzy, sleepy or clumsy although this is rare. If this happens to you, do not drive, ride a bike, use tools, or operate machinery until it's worn off.\n\n【118】Many people with glaucoma can continue driving a car or motorbike, but their eyesight must be up to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)'s standards.\n删除7：<u>GOV.UK has more information on glaucoma and driving</u>\n\n【119】Can brinzolamide make heart problems worse?\n\n【120】In rare cases, side effects of brinzolamide can cause chest pain (angina), heart palpitations or a slow heart rate (bradycardia).\n\n【121】However, if you have an existing heart condition such as atrial fibrillation, there are no reports of brinzolamide making it worse.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【122】*   Glaucoma\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【123】*   HealthUnlocked: brinzolamide forum\n*   Glaucoma UK: charity\n*   Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB): charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 2 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 2 June 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:47:44", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:48:20", "cost": 35.79}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:48:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:47:44"}

It also stops symptoms such as wheezing and coughing developing.\n\n【4】It does not help to treat an asthma attack when you suddenly get coughing, wheezing and breathlessness.\n\n【5】### Important\n\n【6】If you're coughing, wheezing or breathless, use your reliever inhaler, which is usually blue.\n\n【7】When will I feel better?\n\n【8】Fluticasone does not work immediately for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【9】You'll usually start to wheeze less often after you have been using fluticasone for 3 to 7 days.\n\n【10】Once your symptoms have improved, you may find you use your other inhaler (called a reliever) less often.\n\n【11】If your shortness of breath or wheezing does not get better after 7 days of using fluticasone, or if it gets worse, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible.\n\n【12】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【13】If you use your inhaler or nebuliser as recommended by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist, you're unlikely to get any lasting side effects.\n\n【14】Inhalers generally deliver a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【15】However, for children and teenagers using a high dose steroid inhaler, their height and weight needs to be monitored carefully. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth. Talk to their doctor if you're worried. They'll be able to explain the benefits and risks of giving your child fluticasone.\n\n【16】Equally, adults taking high doses (using either an inhaler or a nebuliser) have an increased risk of getting adrenal gland problems or weak bones (osteoporosis) over time. This is because more of the steroid gets into your body.\n\n【17】Your doctor will monitor you closely and may prescribe medicines to help strengthen your bones. Calcium-rich foods (such as milk and cheese, or non-dairy milks with added calcium) and regular exercise can also help keep bones healthy.\n\n【18】What will happen if I stop taking fluticasone?\n\n【19】Do not stop using your inhaled fluticasone without speaking to your doctor first.\n\n【20】If you have an inhaler or nebuliser to control asthma or COPD, your breathing problems may return if you suddenly stop using it.\n\n【21】You might feel wheezy or short of breath. Your chest may feel tight and you could start to cough.\n\n【22】Do I need to stop taking fluticasone before having surgery?\n\n【23】You do not need to stop fluticasone before surgery. Your breathing could worsen if you suddenly stop treatment.\n\n【24】If you're having surgery or having emergency treatment, for example after an accident, tell the person treating you that you're taking fluticasone. Your doctor may decide you need extra steroids for a while.\n\n【25】If you've been given a blue steroid treatment card, show your card to anyone treating you so they can plan your treatment.\n\n【26】How does it compare with other inhalers?\n\n【27】Fluticasone inhalers are used to help prevent symptoms in people with asthma and COPD.\n\n【28】There are similar preventer inhalers that contain other steroids, such as beclometasone, budesonide and mometasone. They can look very different and some are for adults only.\n\n【29】It's important to only use your own fluticasone inhaler. Your inhaler may be different to a friend or relative's. Their inhaler might contain a different dose of fluticasone.\n\n【30】Preventer inhalers are different from the inhalers used during asthma attacks. These are called bronchodilators or reliever inhalers.\n\n【31】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【32】### Steroid emergency card (red card)\n\n【33】If you're prescribed steroid medicines such as fluticasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【34】It's more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【35】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card. This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【36】#### Important\n\n【37】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【38】### Blue steroid card\n\n【39】If you're on a high dose of fluticasone, your doctor or pharmacist will also give you a blue steroid treatment card. It tells you how you can reduce the risks of side effects. It also gives details of your doctor, how much fluticasone you take and how long the treatment will last for.\n\n【40】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue steroid card to the doctor or dentist.\n\n【41】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【42】Fluticasone does not affect any type of contraception including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【43】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【44】For most people, using inhaled fluticasone will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n\n【45】Can I drink alcohol while using fluticasone?\n\n【46】Yes, you can drink alcohol while using fluticasone.\n\n【47】Can I smoke if I use fluticasone?\n\n【48】Try not to smoke. Smoking irritates the lungs and will make your breathing problem worse.\n\n【49】Fluticasone will also work better if you do not smoke.\n\n【50】Speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you're finding it hard to stop smoking. Stop smoking treatments are available on the NHS.\n\n【51】Can lifestyle changes help with my breathing?\n\n【52】There are several things you can do to help your condition when you're living with asthma or COPD. These include:\n\n【53】*   stopping smoking – not smoking can significantly reduce how severe and frequent your symptoms are\n*   exercising regularly – exercise is unlikely to trigger your symptoms once you're getting appropriate treatment\n*   healthy eating – aim for a healthy, balanced diet and lose excess weight if you need to\n*   getting vaccinated – it's a good idea to have the annual flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccination\n\n【54】Some people say that using an air filter or air purifier helps with their asthma symptoms. However, there needs to be more research into this.\n删除11：<u>More in Fluticasone inhalers\n----------------------------\n\n【55】*   About inhaled fluticasone\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:09:43", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:11:10", "cost": 86.549}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:11:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:09:42"}

Surgery may be recommended if medicines do not help.\n\n【4】It's also important to make healthy lifestyle changes.\n\n【5】Read about living with angina for information about this\n\n【6】Medicines\n---------\n\n【7】### Medicines to treat attacks\n\n【8】If you have stable angina (the most common type), you'll usually be given medicine to take when you have an angina attack.\n\n【9】This is usually glyceryl trinitrate, or GTN. It comes as a mouth spray or tablets that dissolve under your tongue.\n\n【10】If you have an angina attack:\n\n【11】1.  Stop what you're doing and rest.\n2.  Use your GTN medicine.\n3.  Take another dose after 5 minutes if the first one does not help.\n4.  Call 999 for an ambulance if you still have symptoms 5 minutes after taking the second dose.\n\n【12】You can also use GTN to avoid an attack before doing something like exercise. You may have a headache, flushing or dizziness soon after using it.\n\n【13】GTN tablets usually expire about 8 weeks after the packet is opened, at which point you'll need to replace them. GTN spray lasts much longer, so may be more convenient.\n\n【14】### Medicines to prevent attacks\n\n【15】To help avoid more attacks, you'll also need to take at least 1 other medicine every day for the rest of your life. Some people need to take 2 or more medicines.\n\n【16】The main medicines used to prevent angina attacks are:\n\n【17】*   beta blockers – to make the heart beat slower and with less force\n*   calcium channel blockers – to relax the arteries, increasing blood supply to the heart muscle\n\n【18】If you cannot have either of these medicines, you may be given another medicine such as ivabradine, nicorandil or ranolazine.\n\n【19】### Medicines to prevent hearts attacks and strokes\n\n【20】Angina is a warning sign that you're at a higher risk of serious problems like heart attacks or strokes.\n\n【21】You may also need to take extra medicines to reduce this risk.\n\n【22】These include:\n\n【23】*   a low dose of aspirin to prevent blood clots\n*   statins to reduce your cholesterol (blood fats) level\n*   ACE inhibitors to reduce your blood pressure\n\n【24】Surgery\n-------\n\n【25】Surgery may be recommended if medicines are not helping control your angina.\n\n【26】The 2 main types of surgery for angina are:\n\n【27】*   coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) – a section of blood vessel is taken from another part of the body and used to reroute blood around a blocked or narrow section of artery\n*   coronary angioplasty and stent insertion – a narrowed section of artery is widened using a tiny tube called a stent\n\n【28】Both of these operations are similarly effective. The best one for you depends on your circumstances. If surgery is recommended, talk to your doctor or surgeon about your options.\n\n【29】You'll probably need to continue taking some medicines after surgery.\n\n【30】Unstable angina\n---------------\n\n【31】If you have unstable angina (where symptoms develop unpredictably), you'll need medicines to prevent blood clots and reduce your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\n【32】You may be given:\n\n【33】*   low-dose aspirin\n*   clopidogrel\n*   an injection of a blood-thinning medicine soon after you're diagnosed\n\n【34】Surgery (either CABG or PCI) may be recommended if you have a high risk of having another angina attack, or you're at a high risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:36:29", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:40:50", "cost": 260.716}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:40:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:36:28"}

A pouch can be placed over the stoma to collect your poo (stools).\n\n【4】A colostomy can be permanent or temporary.\n\n【5】When a colostomy is needed\n--------------------------\n\n【6】A colostomy may be needed if you cannot pass stools through your anus. This could be the result of an illness, injury or problem with your digestive system.\n\n【7】You may have a colostomy to treat:\n\n【8】*   bowel cancer\n*   Crohn's disease\n*   diverticulitis\n*   anal cancer\n*   vaginal cancer or cervical cancer\n*   bowel incontinence\n*   Hirschsprung's disease\n\n【9】A colostomy is often used after a section of the colon has been removed and the bowel cannot be joined back together.\n\n【10】This may be temporary and followed by another operation to reverse the colostomy at a later date, or it may be permanent.\n删除7：<u>Read more about reversing a colostomy</u>\n\n【11】How a colostomy is carried out \n-------------------------------\n\n【12】A colostomy is carried out while you're asleep under general anaesthetic, using either:\n\n【13】*   **open surgery (laparotomy)** – where a long cut (incision) is made in the tummy to access the colon, or\n*   **laparoscopic (keyhole surgery)** – where the surgeon makes several smaller incisions and uses a tiny camera and surgical instruments to access the colon\n\n【14】Generally, keyhole surgery is the preferred option because recovery is quicker and the risk of complications is lower.\n\n【15】There are 2 main types of colostomy: a loop colostomy and an end colostomy. The specific technique used will depend on your circumstances. \n\n【16】A loop colostomy is often used if the colostomy is temporary as it's easier to reverse.\n\n【17】### Loop colostomy\n\n【18】In a loop colostomy, a loop of colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy. The loop is opened up and stitched to your skin to form an opening called a stoma.\n\n【19】The stoma has 2 openings that are close together. One is connected to the functioning part of your bowel, where waste leaves your body after the operation.\n\n【20】The other opening is connected to the inactive part of your bowel, leading to your anus.\n\n【21】In some cases, a support device (a rod or bridge) may be used to hold the loop of colon in place while it heals. It's usually removed after a few days.\n\n【22】### End colostomy\n\n【23】With an end colostomy, 1 end of the colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy and stitched to the skin to create a stoma.\n\n【24】An end colostomy is often permanent. Temporary end colostomies are sometimes used in emergencies.\n\n【25】### The stoma\n\n【26】The position of the stoma will depend on the section of your colon that's diverted, but it's usually on the left-hand side of your tummy, below your waist.\n\n【27】If the operation is planned in advance, you'll meet a specialist stoma nurse to discuss the positioning of the stoma.\n\n【28】The stoma will be red and moist and may bleed slightly, particularly in the beginning – this is normal. It should not be painful as it does not have a nerve supply.\n\n【29】Recovering from a colostomy\n---------------------------\n\n【30】After having a colostomy, you'll need to recover in hospital for a few days.\n\n【31】You may have:\n\n【32】*   a drip in your vein to provide fluids\n*   a catheter to drain urine from your bladder\n*   an oxygen mask to help you breathe\n\n【33】A clear colostomy bag will be placed over the stoma so it can be easily monitored and drained. The first bag is often quite large – it'll usually be replaced with a smaller bag before you go home.\n\n【34】### Stoma nurse\n\n【35】While you recover in hospital, a stoma nurse will show you how to care for your stoma, including how to empty and change the bag.\n\n【36】The nurse will teach you how to keep your stoma and surrounding skin clean and free from irritation, and give you advice about preventing infection.\n\n【37】They'll also explain the different types of equipment available and how to get new supplies.\n\n【38】When you leave hospital, a local stoma nurse will visit you at home, or you may be asked to go to a stoma care clinic.\n\n【39】### Going home\n\n【40】Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 10 days after having a colostomy.\n\n【41】Once home, avoid strenuous activities that could place a strain on your abdomen, such as lifting heavy objects.\n\n【42】Your stoma nurse will give you advice about how soon you can go back to normal activities.\n\n【43】At first you will pass wind through your stoma and then, usually within 2 or 3 days, you poo through it.\n\n【44】This should start to improve as your bowel recovers from the effects of the operation.\n\n【45】Living with a colostomy\n-----------------------\n\n【46】Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people get used to it in time.\n\n【47】Colostomy equipment is discreet and secure, and you should be able to do most of the activities you enjoyed before.\n\n【48】Your specialist stoma nurse will be able to give you further support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy.\n删除7：<u>Read more about living with a colostomy and complications of a colostomy.</u>\n\n【49】### Colostomy UK\n\n【50】Colostomy UK provides support, reassurance and practical advice to anyone who's had, or is about to have, stoma surgery.\n\n【51】Their website has information about products you may find useful, and also provides details of stoma support groups in your area.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 September 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 September 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Reversal</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:08:40", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:09:38", "cost": 58.073}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:09:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:08:39"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Aphasia affects everyone differently, but most people will have difficulty expressing themselves or understanding things they hear or read.**\n\n【3】If aphasia has been caused by a sudden brain injury, such as a stroke or severe head injury, symptoms usually develop straight after the injury.\n\n【4】In cases where there's gradual damage to the brain as a result of a condition that gets worse over time, such as dementia or a brain tumour, the symptoms may develop gradually.\n\n【5】Expressive aphasia\n------------------\n\n【6】Someone with expressive aphasia experiences difficulty communicating their thoughts, ideas and messages to others.\n\n【7】This may affect speech, writing, gestures or drawing, and causes problems with everyday tasks like using the telephone, writing an email, or speaking to family and friends.\n\n【8】People with expressive aphasia may have some of the following signs and symptoms:\n\n【9】*   slow and halting speech – with difficulty constructing a sentence\n*   struggling to get certain words out – such as the names of objects, places or people\n*   only using basic nouns and verbs – for example, \"want drink\" or \"go town today\"\n*   spelling or grammatical errors\n*   using a wrong but related word – such as saying \"chair\" instead of \"table\"\n*   including nonsense words or their speech not making sense (speech-sound errors)\n\n【10】Receptive aphasia\n-----------------\n\n【11】A person with receptive aphasia experiences difficulty understanding things they hear or read. They may also have difficulty interpreting gestures, drawings, numbers and pictures.\n\n【12】This can affect everyday activities such as reading an email, managing finances, having conversations, listening to the radio, or following TV programmes.\n\n【13】People with receptive aphasia may have some of the following signs and symptoms:\n\n【14】*   difficulty understanding what people say\n*   difficulty understanding written words\n*   misinterpreting the meaning of words, gestures, pictures or drawings\n*   giving responses that may not make sense if they've misunderstood questions or comments\n*   not being aware of their difficulties with understanding, or their own speech errors\n\n【15】Aphasia symptoms associated with dementia\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【16】People with the most common types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, usually have a mild form of aphasia.\n\n【17】This often involves problems finding words and can affect names, even of people they know well.\n\n【18】It doesn't mean they don't recognise the person or don't know who they are, they just can't access the name or get mixed up.\n\n【19】### Primary progressive aphasia\n\n【20】This is a rare type of dementia, where language is heavily affected. As it's a primary progressive condition, the symptoms get worse over time.\n\n【21】Usually, the first problem people with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) notice is difficulty finding the right word or remembering somebody's name.\n\n【22】The problems gradually get worse, and can include:\n\n【23】*   speech becoming hesitant and difficult, and making mistakes with the sounds of words or grammar\n*   speech becoming slow with short, simple sentences\n*   forgetting the meaning of complicated words, and later also simple ones, making it more difficult for them to understand other people\n*   speech becoming more vague and the person having difficulty being specific or clarifying what they're saying\n*   becoming less likely to join in with or start conversations\n\n【24】A person with PPA may also experience other symptoms later in their illness, including:\n\n【25】*   changes in their personality and behaviour\n*   difficulties with memory and thinking – similar to Alzheimer's disease\n*   difficulties with movement – similar to Parkinson's disease\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Aphasia</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:52", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:39:58", "cost": 6.519}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:39:52"}

Their free helpline number is 0800 018 0527.</u>\n\n【27】You can also find a tinnitus support group near you on the BTA website.\n\n【28】Treatments for tinnitus\n-----------------------\n\n【29】If the cause of your tinnitus is unknown or cannot be treated, your GP or specialist may refer you for a type of talking therapy.\n\n【30】This could be:\n\n【31】*   tinnitus counselling – to help you learn about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it\n*   cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – to change the way you think about your tinnitus and reduce anxiety\n*   tinnitus retraining therapy – using sound therapy to retrain your brain to tune out and be less aware of the tinnitus\n\n【32】Tinnitus retraining therapy may be available on the NHS for people with severe or persistent tinnitus. It's unclear if tinnitus retraining therapy works for everyone. It's widely available privately.\n\n【33】If tinnitus is causing you hearing loss, hearing aids may be recommended.\n删除3：<u>Video: Tinnitus (BSL version)\n-----------------------------\n\n【34】In this video, learn about tinnitus, its possible causes and the effects and how to deal with it.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 June 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 June 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 October 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 October 2023</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:54:18", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:55:01", "cost": 42.274}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:55:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:54:18"}

The usual dose is 100mg to 200mg, taken once or twice a day.\n\n【4】You might take a lower dose, such as 40mg once a day or 20mg twice a day, for rosacea or gum infections.\n\n【5】Children younger than 12 years old may need to take a lower dose than adults. The dose depends on your child's age and weight. If you're taking doxycycline more than once a day, try to space your doses evenly throughout the day.\n\n【6】### Dose for malaria\n\n【7】You'll usually take 100mg once a day in the morning.\n\n【8】Important\n---------\n\n【9】Carry on taking doxycycline until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, the infection could come back, or you may no longer be protected against malaria.\n\n【10】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【11】If you're taking a lower dose of 40mg of doxycycline a day for rosacea or gum infections, take it at least 1 hour before food.\n\n【12】If you're taking a higher dose of 100mg or more for other types of infection, you can take it with or without food. But you're less likely to feel sick if you have it with food.\n\n【13】It's important to take doxycycline while you're in an upright position. You can be sitting, standing or walking. This will stop the medicine irritating your food pipe or stomach. Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking doxycycline.\n\n【14】If you take it twice a day, this could be first thing in the morning, and in the evening – before you go to bed. Try to avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking doxycycline. This helps to prevent any irritation.\n\n【15】If you're taking doxycycline for malaria, start your treatment 1 or 2 days before going to an area with malaria. Stop taking it 4 weeks after leaving the area. Check with your doctor or pharmacist that doxycycline is the best medicine to prevent malaria in the country you are travelling to.\n\n【16】### How to take capsules or standard tablets\n\n【17】Swallow your doxycycline whole with at least 150ml of water. Not swallowing them with enough water can cause swelling and irritation in your throat (oesophagitis).\n\n【18】### How to take dispersible tablets\n\n【19】Dissolve the tablet in a small amount of water. Let the tablet break up fully then swallow the drink.\n\n【20】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【21】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. If that happens, just leave out the dose you missed and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【22】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【23】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicines.\n\n【24】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【25】Taking 1 extra dose of doxycycline is unlikely to harm you. But speak to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried, or you have taken more than 1 extra dose.\n删除11：<u>More in Doxycycline\n-------------------\n\n【26】*   About doxycycline\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking doxycycline with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 January 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:03:30", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:03:45", "cost": 15.434}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:03:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:03:29"}

If you become pregnant during treatment with isotretinoin capsules, stop taking the capsules and speak to your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【4】It's very important that you do not get pregnant while you're taking isotretinoin capsules. You'll be asked by your doctor to follow strict rules to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for 1 month afterwards.\n\n【5】Before starting treatment with isotretinoin capsules, if you are able to become pregnant you must agree to:\n\n【6】*   use at least 1 very reliable method of contraception (such as an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant or injection) or 2 effective methods of contraception that work in different ways (such as a hormonal contraceptive pill and a barrier method such as condoms) – do not use barrier methods of contraception on their own\n*   use your chosen contraception for 1 month before starting isotretinoin capsules, during treatment, and for 1 month after treatment has stopped\n*   use contraception even if you do not have periods or you are not sexually active (unless you doctor decides this is not necessary)\n\n【7】Discuss your contraception with your specialist.\n\n【8】You will need to have a pregnancy test before starting isotretinoin, during treatment (ideally monthly), and 1 month after the end of treatment.\n\n【9】Your doctor will give you information, including a patient reminder card for isotretinoin.\n\n【10】Read this card and the information leaflet that comes with your medicine before you start taking isotretinoin capsules.\n\n【11】**Men and isotretinoin capsules**\n---------------------------------\n\n【12】Men can safely take isotretinoin capsules if they and their partner are trying for a baby, or their partner is pregnant.\n\n【13】Isotretinoin does not seem to damage sperm.

It does this by blocking calcium going into muscles in the heart and blood vessels.\n\n【4】Muscles need calcium to contract, so when you block the calcium, it makes the muscle cells relax. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【5】In angina, felodipine works by improving the blood and oxygen supply to your heart. Angina is chest pain that comes on when not enough blood gets to the muscles of the heart. It usually happens because the arteries to the heart have become hardened and narrowed.\n\n【6】How long does it take to work?\n\n【7】Felodipine starts to work on the day you start taking it, but it may take a couple of weeks for you to feel the full effect.\n\n【8】If you're taking felodipine for high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. In this case, you may not feel any different when you take it. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it. Your doctor will check your blood pressure to see how well it is working.\n\n【9】If you're taking felodipine for angina, it will probably take a couple of weeks before you feel better. Until then, you will still get chest pain. Make sure you have your medicine (spray or tablets) for treating angina attacks with you at all times, and use it if you need to.\n\n【10】Keep taking felodipine every day and you should have fewer attacks within a couple of weeks. Talk to your doctor if your chest pain (angina) does not get any better after a couple of weeks. If it gets worse (happens more often or is more severe) tell your doctor immediately.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Felodipine is generally safe to take for a long time without any long-term side effects. In fact, it works best when you take it for a long time.\n\n【13】Can I stop taking felodipine now my blood pressure is lower?\n\n【14】Even if felodipine lowers your blood pressure, it's best to carry on taking it. If you stop taking felodipine, your blood pressure could rise back up again.\n\n【15】If you are taking felodipine for angina, stopping it will increase your chances of having more angina attacks.\n\n【16】If you need medicines to lower your blood pressure, you'll probably need to take them for the rest of your life.\n\n【17】Remember, by keeping your blood pressure low, you're protecting yourself against having a heart attack or stroke in the future.\n\n【18】How does felodipine compare to other medicines for high blood pressure?\n\n【19】There are several other calcium channel blockers which lower blood pressure in the same way as felodipine. They include amlodipine, nifedipine, lacidipine and lercanidipine.\n\n【20】There are also lots of other types of medicines to lower your blood pressure. They work in a different way to calcium channel blockers and include:\n\n【21】*   ACE inhibitors – for example ramipril and lisinopril\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers – for example candesartan\n*   beta blockers – for example bisoprolol\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) – for example bendroflumethiazide\n\n【22】If you cannot take felodipine or other calcium channel blockers because of side effects, you may be able to switch to another medicine. Your doctor will advise which one is best for you depending on your age, ethnicity and medical history.\n\n【23】How does felodopine compare to other medicines for angina?\n\n【24】There are several other calcium channel blockers which prevent angina in the same way as felodipine. They include amlodipine and nifedipine.\n\n【25】There are other calcium channel blockers used for angina, which work differently, such as diltiazem and verapamil.\n\n【26】There are also other medicines for angina which work in a different way. They include:\n\n【27】*   beta blockers like bisoprolol\n*   nitrates like isosorbide dinitrate\n*   nicorandil\n\n【28】Is felodipine addictive?\n\n【29】No, there's no evidence that felodipine is addictive.\n\n【30】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【31】Felodipine will not affect your contraception.\n\n【32】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, like the combined contraceptive pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【33】Talk to your doctor if you're taking or using combined hormonal contraceptives.\n\n【34】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【35】Felodipine can make some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n\n【36】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking felodipine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【37】Can I drink alcohol while taking felodipine?\n\n【38】Yes, you can drink alcohol with felodipine. However, drinking alcohol can increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of felodipine, which can make you feel dizzy or light-headed.\n\n【39】If this happens to you, it's best to stop drinking alcohol while you're taking it.\n\n【40】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【41】Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. Grapefruit can make the side effects of felodipine worse.\n\n【42】Otherwise, you can eat and drink normally while taking felodipine.\n\n【43】Can lifestyle changes help the health of my heart?\n\n【44】You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes.\n\n【45】These will also help if you have high blood pressure or angina.\n\n【46】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and also makes heart failure worse. Men and women should not drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day is enough.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and lean proteins. It's a good idea to cut down on salt too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily, and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse, too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n*   Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you've had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.\n删除11：<u>More in Felodipine\n------------------\n\n【47】*   About felodipine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking felodipine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 February 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:31:58", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:05", "cost": 6.907}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:31:58"}

Studies have shown that it's safe to have a flu vaccine during any stage of pregnancy, from the first few weeks up to your expected due date.\n\n【10】Women who have had a flu vaccine while pregnant also pass some protection on to their babies, which lasts for the first few months of their lives.\n\n【11】It's safe for women who are breastfeeding to have a flu vaccine if they're eligible (for example, because of a long-term health condition).\n\n【12】When should I have the flu jab?\n-------------------------------\n\n【13】The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, before flu starts circulating.\n\n【14】If you've missed this time, you can be vaccinated later in the winter although it's better to get it earlier.\n\n【15】Do not worry if you find that you're pregnant later in the flu season – you can have the vaccine then if you have not already had it.\n\n【16】How do I get the flu vaccine?\n-----------------------------\n\n【17】To get a flu vaccine you can:\n\n【18】*   contact your GP surgery to book an appointment\n*   find a pharmacy that offers NHS flu vaccination (if you're aged 18 or over)\n*   contact your midwife – in some areas you may be able to get a flu vaccine through a maternity service\n\n【19】If I had the flu jab last year, do I need to have it again now?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Yes, because the viruses that cause flu change every year. This means the flu strains the vaccines are designed to prevent this year may be different from last year. The protection from a flu vaccine also goes down with time.\n\n【21】If you had the flu vaccine during the last flu season because you were pregnant (same pregnancy or a previous pregnancy), or because you're in a vulnerable group, you need to have it again this year.\n\n【22】Will the flu jab give me flu?\n-----------------------------\n\n【23】No. Injected flu vaccines do not contain any live viruses, and cannot cause flu. Some people get a slightly raised temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards, and you may feel sore at the injection site.\n\n【24】Can I have the flu jab at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Yes, you can have a flu vaccine at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine, but do not delay your flu jab so you can have both at the same time.\n\n【26】Pregnant women are at risk of severe illness from flu at any stage of pregnancy, so you need to have a flu vaccine as soon as possible.\n\n【27】The best time to get vaccinated against whooping cough is from 16 weeks up to 32 weeks of pregnancy. \n\n【28】If you miss having the vaccine for any reason, you can still have it up until you go into labour.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy.</u>\n\n【29】I'm pregnant and think I have flu. What should I do?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Talk to a GP as soon as possible. If you do have flu, there's a prescribed medicine you can take that might help, or reduce your risk of complications, but it needs to be taken very soon after symptoms appear.\n删除11：<u>More information\n----------------\n\n【31】*   GOV.UK: vaccines to protect you and your baby during and after pregnancy\n</u>删除11：<u>More in Keeping well in pregnancy\n---------------------------------\n\n【32】*   Have a healthy diet in pregnancy\n*   Vegetarian or vegan and pregnant\n*   Foods to avoid in pregnancy\n*   Vitamins, supplements and nutrition in pregnancy\n*   Exercise in pregnancy\n*   Medicines in pregnancy\n*   Mental health in pregnancy\n*   Depression in pregnancy\n*   Sex in pregnancy\n*   Travelling in pregnancy\n*   Work and pregnancy\n*   Your baby's movements\n*   Reducing the risk of stillbirth\n*   Drinking alcohol while pregnant\n*   Stop smoking in pregnancy\n*   Illegal drugs in pregnancy\n*   Vaccinations in pregnancy\n*   The flu jab in pregnancy\n*   Whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy\n*   Infections in pregnancy that may affect your baby\n*   Pregnancy and COVID-19\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 5 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 5 September 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:31:39", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:31:58", "cost": 19.379}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:31:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:31:38"}

Overview\n2.  Features\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Tuberous sclerosis, also known as tuberous sclerosis complex, is a rare genetic condition that causes mainly non-cancerous (benign) tumours to develop in different parts of the body.**\n\n【3】The tumours most often affect the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes and lungs.\n\n【4】Tuberous sclerosis is present from birth, although it may not cause obvious problems immediately.\n\n【5】What problems can tuberous sclerosis cause?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The tumours caused by tuberous sclerosis can result in a range of associated health problems, including:\n\n【7】*   epilepsy – a condition that causes seizures (fits)\n*   learning disabilities\n*   hyperactivity\n*   an autistic spectrum disorder\n*   skin abnormalities – such as patches of light-coloured or thickened skin, or red acne-like spots on the face\n*   the kidneys not working properly\n*   breathing difficulties\n*   a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus)\n\n【8】These problems can range from mild to severe, and it's possible to have only a few of these problems or a wide range. Members of the same family may be affected very differently by tuberous sclerosis. \n删除7：<u>Read more about the features of tuberous sclerosis and diagnosing tuberous sclerosis.</u>\n\n【9】What causes tuberous sclerosis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【10】Tuberous sclerosis is caused by changes (mutations) in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. These genes are involved in regulating cell growth, and the mutations lead to uncontrolled growth and multiple tumours throughout the body.\n\n【11】In around 3 in every 4 cases, the genetic fault occurs for no apparent reason in people without any other affected family members.\n\n【12】In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, the fault is passed on to a child by their parents. Only one parent needs to carry the faulty gene to pass it on, and a parent who has one of the faulty genes has a 1 in 2 chance of passing it on to each child they have.\n\n【13】The parent carrying the faulty gene will also have tuberous sclerosis, although sometimes it may be so mild they do not realise.\n\n【14】How tuberous sclerosis is treated\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, but there is a range of treatments for many of the problems caused by the condition.\n\n【16】For example:\n\n【17】*   epilepsy may be controlled with medicine or, in some cases, surgery\n*   extra educational support can help children with learning disabilities\n*   challenging behaviour and psychiatric problems – such as anxiety or depression – can be treated with behavioural interventions and medicine\n*   brain tumours can be surgically removed or shrunk with medicine\n*   the facial rash can be treated with laser therapy or medication applied to the skin\n*   medicine can control symptoms caused by reduced kidney function and can help shrink kidney tumours\n*   lung problems can be treated with medication\n\n【18】Research has found that a type of medicine known as an mTOR inhibitor, which interrupts the chemical reactions needed for tumours to grow, may be a useful treatment in the future.\n\n【19】People with tuberous sclerosis will also need to have regular tests to monitor the function of the organs that can be affected by the condition.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating tuberous sclerosis.</u>\n\n【20】Outlook\n-------\n\n【21】The outlook for people with tuberous sclerosis can vary considerably.\n\n【22】Some people have few symptoms and the condition has little effect on their life, while others – particularly those with a faulty TSC2 gene or obvious problems from an early age – can have severe and potentially life-threatening problems that require lifelong care.\n\n【23】Many people will have a normal lifespan, although a number of life-threatening complications can develop. These include a loss of kidney function, a serious lung infection called bronchopneumonia and a severe type of epileptic seizure called status epilepticus.\n\n【24】People with tuberous sclerosis may also have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as kidney cancer, but this is rare.\n\n【25】Tuberous Sclerosis Association (TSA)\n------------------------------------\n\n【26】The TSA provides information, advice and support to individuals and families affected by tuberous sclerosis.\n\n【27】You can visit the TSA website for more information and to access their online community.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about loratadine\n\n【3】1\\. About loratadine\n--------------------\n\n【4】Loratadine is an antihistamine medicine that helps with the symptoms of allergies. It's used to treat:\n\n【5】*   hay fever\n*   conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)\n*   eczema\n*   hives (urticaria)\n*   reactions to insect bites and stings\n*   some food allergies\n\n【6】Loratadine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's much less likely to make you feel sleepy than some other antihistamines.\n\n【7】Loratadine is available on prescription. You can also buy it from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【8】It comes as tablets or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   You'll usually take loratadine once a day.\n*   Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine, but some people still find it makes them feel slightly sleepy.\n*   Children may have a headache and feel tired or nervous after taking loratadine.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take loratadine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Adults and children aged 2 years and older can take loratadine.\n\n【13】Loratadine is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking loratadine if you:\n\n【14】*   have ever had an allergy to loratadine or any other medicines\n*   have severe liver failure\n*   have an allergy to food additives\n*   have epilepsy or another illness that puts you at risk of seizures or fits\n*   are due to have an allergy test – taking loratadine may affect the results, so you might need to stop taking it a few days before the test\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take loratadine\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】If you or your child have been prescribed loratadine, follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to take it.\n\n【17】If you've bought loratadine from a pharmacy or shop, follow the instructions that come with the packet.\n\n【18】### Dosage\n\n【19】Loratadine comes as 10mg tablets and as a liquid medicine (labelled either 5mg/5ml or 1mg/1ml).\n\n【20】The usual dose in adults is 10mg once a day.\n\n【21】Doses are usually lower for people with liver problems.\n\n【22】For children, your doctor will use your child's weight or age to work out the right dose. Children aged between 6 and 12 years can only take loratadine tablets if they weigh more than 30kg. Give children loratadine liquid instead of tablets if they are under 6 or weigh 30kg or less.\n\n【23】### How to take it\n\n【24】Loratadine comes as 2 different types of tablet: ordinary and melt-in-the-mouth tablets.\n\n【25】Swallow ordinary loratadine tablets with a drink of water, milk or juice. If the tablet has a score line across the middle, you can break it in half if you find it hard to swallow it whole. Do not chew it.\n\n【26】Melt-in-the-mouth tablets dissolve instantly on your tongue without needing a drink. Be careful not to crush them when you take them out of the packet.\n\n【27】You can take loratadine with or without food.\n\n【28】Loratadine liquid may be easier for children to take than tablets. The medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【29】### When to take it\n\n【30】You may only need to take loratadine on a day when you have symptoms, for instance if you've been exposed to a trigger such as animal hair. Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as hay fever during spring and summer.\n\n【31】Try to take loratadine at about the same time every day. Choose a time that is easy to remember.\n\n【32】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【33】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【34】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【35】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【36】### What if I take too much?\n\n【37】Loratadine is generally very safe. If you or your child take too much, it is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【38】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice if:\n\n【39】You've taken more than your usual dose of loratadine and:\n\n【40】*   you get a headache, have a fast heartbeat or feel sleepy\n*   you're concerned\n\n【41】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【42】Call 111 if you're asking about a child under the age of 5 years.\n\n【43】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【44】Like all medicines, loratadine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【45】### Common side effects\n\n【46】The most common side effect of loratadine is feeling sleepy. This happens in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【47】Side effects in children may include:\n\n【48】*   headaches\n*   feeling tired or nervous\n\n【49】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【50】In rare cases, loratadine may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【51】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【52】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【53】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【54】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【55】These are not all the side effects of loratadine. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【56】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【57】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【58】6\\. How to cope with side effects of loratadine\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【59】**What to do about:**\n\n【60】*   **feeling sleepy** – try a different non-drowsy antihistamine. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should normally go away after the first week of taking loratadine. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired or nervous** – talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects do not go away. They may be able to offer you a different antihistamine.\n\n【61】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【62】### Loratadine and pregnancy\n\n【63】Loratadine can be taken in pregnancy. There is no good evidence that it can harm your baby.\n\n【64】### Loratadine and breastfeeding\n\n【65】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take loratadine while breastfeeding.\n\n【66】There is some information available which shows that only tiny amounts get into breast milk. It has been used for many years in breastfeeding women without side effects in their babies.\n\n【67】If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how loratadine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【68】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【69】Some medicines affect how loratadine works or can increase the chances of you having side effects.\n\n【70】Tell your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【71】*   amiodarone, a medicine used to treat an irregular heartbeat\n*   cimetidine, an indigestion medicine\n*   erythromycin, an antibiotic\n*   ketoconazole, a medicine to treat fungal infections\n*   any medicine that makes you feel sleepy, gives you a dry mouth or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking loratadine might make these side effects worse\n\n【72】### Mixing loratadine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【73】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with loratadine. But there might be a problem with some of them, especially ones that cause sleepiness or a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee.\n\n【74】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【75】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【76】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【77】9\\. Common questions about loratadine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【78】How does loratadine work?\n\n【79】Loratadine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine.\n\n【80】When you come into contact with something you have an allergy to, such as pollen, animal hair or fur, house dust or insect bites, your body produces a chemical called histamine.\n\n【81】Usually, histamine is a useful substance but in an allergic reaction it causes unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watery eyes, running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.\n\n【82】Loratadine blocks the effects of histamine and so reduces these symptoms.\n\n【83】Loratadine is a non-drowsy antihistamine, so it does not make you feel as sleepy as other medicines like it.\n\n【84】When will I feel better?\n\n【85】You should start to feel better within an hour.\n\n【86】How long should I take loratadine for?\n\n【87】It depends on why you're taking it.\n\n【88】You may only need to take loratadine for a short time or as a one-off dose. If you have a reaction to an insect bite, you may only need to take loratadine for a day or two.\n\n【89】You may need to take it for longer if you're taking it to prevent hay fever symptoms when the pollen count is high.\n\n【90】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure how long you need to take loratadine for.\n\n【91】Is it safe to take loratadine for a long time?\n\n【92】Loratadine is unlikely to do you any harm if you take it for a long time. However, it's best to take it only for as long as you need to.\n\n【93】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【94】It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine, as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【95】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【96】You can eat and drink normally while taking loratadine.\n\n【97】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【98】Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine but it's still possible to feel sleepy after taking it.\n\n【99】If this happens to you, do not drive a car or ride a bike until you feel better.\n\n【100】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking loratadine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【101】What's the difference between loratadine and other antihistamines?\n\n【102】Loratadine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's less likely to make you feel sleepy than other, so-called, sedating antihistamines such as Piriton (chlorphenamine).\n\n【103】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine instead of a sedating one. An exception is when you want the medicine to make you sleepy – for example, if you have itchy skin that's keeping you awake.\n\n【104】What's the difference between loratadine and other non-drowsy antihistamines?\n\n【105】Other non-drowsy antihistamines like cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine seem to work as well as loratadine.\n\n【106】However, loratadine, desloratadine and fexofenadine seem to be less likely to make you feel sleepy than cetirizine.\n\n【107】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【108】Yes, you can take loratadine together with paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【109】Can I take 2 different antihistamines together?\n\n【110】Sometimes, doctors recommend that people with a severe, itchy skin rash take 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【111】As well as taking a non-drowsy antihistamine like loratadine during the day, your doctor may tell you to take a sedating antihistamine at night if the itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【112】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless recommended by your doctor.\n\n【113】Can I take loratadine with other hay fever treatments?\n\n【114】Yes, it's fine to take loratadine together with some other types of hay fever treatment, including steroid nasal sprays (such as Beconase, Rhinacort Aqua and Flixonase Nasules), or eyedrops.\n\n【115】Can I take loratadine at higher doses than on the packet?\n\n【116】Your doctor might suggest you or your child take a higher dose of loratadine (up to 4 times the usual dose) for severe itchy skin rash or swelling underneath the skin (angioedema).\n\n【117】Taking high doses of loratadine is not suitable for everyone though.\n\n【118】Speak to your doctor if you think loratadine is not working for you.\n\n【119】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【120】There's no evidence to suggest that taking loratadine will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【121】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【122】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【123】Loratadine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【124】Can lifestyle changes relieve hay fever?\n\n【125】It will help if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【126】#### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【127】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you've been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【128】#### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【129】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【130】*   Atopic eczema\n*   Conjunctivitis\n*   Food allergy\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n*   Insect bites and stings\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【131】*   HealthUnlocked: loratadine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n*   Medicines for Children: loratadine for allergy symptoms\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 October 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除7：Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you’re unsure whether it’s safe for you to drive while taking loratadine.", "content": "【0】Loratadine (Clarityn)\n=====================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.

Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   You'll usually take loratadine once a day.\n*   Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine, but some people still find it makes them feel slightly sleepy.\n*   Children may have a headache and feel tired or nervous after taking loratadine.\n*   It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take loratadine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Adults and children aged 2 years and older can take loratadine.\n\n【13】Loratadine is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking loratadine if you:\n\n【14】*   have ever had an allergy to loratadine or any other medicines\n*   have severe liver failure\n*   have an allergy to food additives\n*   have epilepsy or another illness that puts you at risk of seizures or fits\n*   are due to have an allergy test – taking loratadine may affect the results, so you might need to stop taking it a few days before the test\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take loratadine\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】If you or your child have been prescribed loratadine, follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to take it.\n\n【17】If you've bought loratadine from a pharmacy or shop, follow the instructions that come with the packet.\n\n【18】### Dosage\n\n【19】Loratadine comes as 10mg tablets and as a liquid medicine (labelled either 5mg/5ml or 1mg/1ml).\n\n【20】The usual dose in adults is 10mg once a day.\n\n【21】Doses are usually lower for people with liver problems.\n\n【22】For children, your doctor will use your child's weight or age to work out the right dose. Children aged between 6 and 12 years can only take loratadine tablets if they weigh more than 30kg. Give children loratadine liquid instead of tablets if they are under 6 or weigh 30kg or less.\n\n【23】### How to take it\n\n【24】Loratadine comes as 2 different types of tablet: ordinary and melt-in-the-mouth tablets.\n\n【25】Swallow ordinary loratadine tablets with a drink of water, milk or juice. If the tablet has a score line across the middle, you can break it in half if you find it hard to swallow it whole. Do not chew it.\n\n【26】Melt-in-the-mouth tablets dissolve instantly on your tongue without needing a drink. Be careful not to crush them when you take them out of the packet.\n\n【27】You can take loratadine with or without food.\n\n【28】Loratadine liquid may be easier for children to take than tablets. The medicine will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【29】### When to take it\n\n【30】You may only need to take loratadine on a day when you have symptoms, for instance if you've been exposed to a trigger such as animal hair. Or you may need to take it regularly to prevent symptoms, such as hay fever during spring and summer.\n\n【31】Try to take loratadine at about the same time every day. Choose a time that is easy to remember.\n\n【32】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【33】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【34】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【35】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【36】### What if I take too much?\n\n【37】Loratadine is generally very safe. If you or your child take too much, it is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【38】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice if:\n\n【39】You've taken more than your usual dose of loratadine and:\n\n【40】*   you get a headache, have a fast heartbeat or feel sleepy\n*   you're concerned\n\n【41】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【42】Call 111 if you're asking about a child under the age of 5 years.\n\n【43】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【44】Like all medicines, loratadine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【45】### Common side effects\n\n【46】The most common side effect of loratadine is feeling sleepy. This happens in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【47】Side effects in children may include:\n\n【48】*   headaches\n*   feeling tired or nervous\n\n【49】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【50】In rare cases, loratadine may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【51】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【52】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【53】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【54】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【55】These are not all the side effects of loratadine. For a full list see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【56】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【57】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【58】6\\. How to cope with side effects of loratadine\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【59】**What to do about:**\n\n【60】*   **feeling sleepy** – try a different non-drowsy antihistamine. If this does not help, talk to your doctor.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Headaches should normally go away after the first week of taking loratadine. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired or nervous** – talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects do not go away. They may be able to offer you a different antihistamine.\n\n【61】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【62】### Loratadine and pregnancy\n\n【63】Loratadine can be taken in pregnancy. There is no good evidence that it can harm your baby.\n\n【64】### Loratadine and breastfeeding\n\n【65】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take loratadine while breastfeeding.\n\n【66】There is some information available which shows that only tiny amounts get into breast milk. It has been used for many years in breastfeeding women without side effects in their babies.\n\n【67】If your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, health visitor or midwife.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how loratadine can affect you and your baby during pregnancy on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【68】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【69】Some medicines affect how loratadine works or can increase the chances of you having side effects.\n\n【70】Tell your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【71】*   amiodarone, a medicine used to treat an irregular heartbeat\n*   cimetidine, an indigestion medicine\n*   erythromycin, an antibiotic\n*   ketoconazole, a medicine to treat fungal infections\n*   any medicine that makes you feel sleepy, gives you a dry mouth or makes it difficult for you to pee – taking loratadine might make these side effects worse\n\n【72】### Mixing loratadine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【73】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with loratadine. But there might be a problem with some of them, especially ones that cause sleepiness or a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee.\n\n【74】Ask your pharmacist for advice.\n\n【75】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【76】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【77】9\\. Common questions about loratadine\n-------------------------------------\n\n【78】How does loratadine work?\n\n【79】Loratadine is a type of medicine called an antihistamine.\n\n【80】When you come into contact with something you have an allergy to, such as pollen, animal hair or fur, house dust or insect bites, your body produces a chemical called histamine.\n\n【81】Usually, histamine is a useful substance but in an allergic reaction it causes unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watery eyes, running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.\n\n【82】Loratadine blocks the effects of histamine and so reduces these symptoms.\n\n【83】Loratadine is a non-drowsy antihistamine, so it does not make you feel as sleepy as other medicines like it.\n\n【84】When will I feel better?\n\n【85】You should start to feel better within an hour.\n\n【86】How long should I take loratadine for?\n\n【87】It depends on why you're taking it.\n\n【88】You may only need to take loratadine for a short time or as a one-off dose. If you have a reaction to an insect bite, you may only need to take loratadine for a day or two.\n\n【89】You may need to take it for longer if you're taking it to prevent hay fever symptoms when the pollen count is high.\n\n【90】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure how long you need to take loratadine for.\n\n【91】Is it safe to take loratadine for a long time?\n\n【92】Loratadine is unlikely to do you any harm if you take it for a long time. However, it's best to take it only for as long as you need to.\n\n【93】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【94】It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking loratadine, as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【95】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【96】You can eat and drink normally while taking loratadine.\n\n【97】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【98】Loratadine is classed as a non-drowsy antihistamine but it's still possible to feel sleepy after taking it.\n\n【99】If this happens to you, do not drive a car or ride a bike until you feel better.\n\n【100】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking loratadine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【101】What's the difference between loratadine and other antihistamines?\n\n【102】Loratadine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's less likely to make you feel sleepy than other, so-called, sedating antihistamines such as Piriton (chlorphenamine).\n\n【103】Most people prefer to take a non-drowsy antihistamine instead of a sedating one. An exception is when you want the medicine to make you sleepy – for example, if you have itchy skin that's keeping you awake.\n\n【104】What's the difference between loratadine and other non-drowsy antihistamines?\n\n【105】Other non-drowsy antihistamines like cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine seem to work as well as loratadine.\n\n【106】However, loratadine, desloratadine and fexofenadine seem to be less likely to make you feel sleepy than cetirizine.\n\n【107】Can I take it with painkillers?\n\n【108】Yes, you can take loratadine together with paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【109】Can I take 2 different antihistamines together?\n\n【110】Sometimes, doctors recommend that people with a severe, itchy skin rash take 2 different antihistamines together for a few days.\n\n【111】As well as taking a non-drowsy antihistamine like loratadine during the day, your doctor may tell you to take a sedating antihistamine at night if the itching is making it difficult to sleep.\n\n【112】Do not take 2 antihistamines together unless recommended by your doctor.\n\n【113】Can I take loratadine with other hay fever treatments?\n\n【114】Yes, it's fine to take loratadine together with some other types of hay fever treatment, including steroid nasal sprays (such as Beconase, Rhinacort Aqua and Flixonase Nasules), or eyedrops.\n\n【115】Can I take loratadine at higher doses than on the packet?\n\n【116】Your doctor might suggest you or your child take a higher dose of loratadine (up to 4 times the usual dose) for severe itchy skin rash or swelling underneath the skin (angioedema).\n\n【117】Taking high doses of loratadine is not suitable for everyone though.\n\n【118】Speak to your doctor if you think loratadine is not working for you.\n\n【119】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【120】There's no evidence to suggest that taking loratadine will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【121】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【122】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【123】Loratadine will not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【124】Can lifestyle changes relieve hay fever?\n\n【125】It will help if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【126】#### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【127】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you've been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【128】#### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【129】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【130】*   Atopic eczema\n*   Conjunctivitis\n*   Food allergy\n*   Hay fever\n*   Hives\n*   Insect bites and stings\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【131】*   HealthUnlocked: loratadine forum\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n*   Itchy Sneezy Wheezy: website for parents\n*   Medicines for Children: loratadine for allergy symptoms\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 October 2024</u>", "index": 11461, "show": true, "start": 11461, "end": 11575, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:45:36", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:46:15", "cost": 38.769}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:50", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:46:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:45:36"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a family of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children.**\n\n【3】When you get mumps, the virus moves from your respiratory tract (your nose, mouth and throat) into your parotid glands (saliva-producing glands found either side of your face), where it begins to reproduce. This causes the glands to swell.\n\n【4】The virus can also enter your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spine. Once the virus has entered the CSF, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain, pancreas, testicles (in boys and men) and ovaries (in girls and women).\n\n【5】How mumps is spread\n-------------------\n\n【6】Mumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by:\n\n【7】*   an infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person\n*   an infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract\n*   sharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person\n\n【8】People with mumps are usually most infectious from a few days before their parotid glands swell until a few days afterwards. For this reason, it's advisable to avoid work or school for 5 days after your symptoms first develop if you're diagnosed with mumps.\n\n【9】Mumps can also be passed on by people who are infected with the virus but don't have any obvious symptoms.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:44:44", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:44:51", "cost": 7.044}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:44:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:44:45"}

This can be useful for them to know in case of a medical emergency.\n\n【11】If you do not have a patient alert card, you can ask your specialist for one.\n\n【12】How you will receive adalimumab\n-------------------------------\n\n【13】Your adalimumab medicine will be delivered to your home by a homecare provider.\n\n【14】A homecare support nurse will show you how to use the injection so you can give yourself or your child the injection at home.\n\n【15】You'll need to store the injections in your fridge.\n\n【16】### Biosimilar injections\n\n【17】If you're switching from Humira to an adalimumab biosimilar, the way the injection works might be different.\n\n【18】You can ask your specialist, homecare support nurse or pharmacist for training on the new injection if you need it.\n\n【19】### Biosimilar syringes\n\n【20】There's not much difference between the Humira syringe and other biosimilar syringes.\n\n【21】The Humira, Amgevita and Yuflyma syringes come with a needle shield.\n\n【22】The Hyrimoz, Idacio and Imraldi syringes have a retracting needle, where the needle goes back into the main part of the syringe once the injection has finished.\n\n【23】A needle shield or retractable needle helps reduce the risk of accidental needle injuries.\n\n【24】### Biosimilar injection pens\n\n【25】There's not much difference between the Humira injection pen and other biosimilar pens.\n\n【26】All the injection pens start with a loud click and have a small window on the injection, which changes colour when the injection has finished.\n\n【27】You may hear a second click with the Amgevita, Hyrimoz, Imraldi and Yuflyma pens. This means your injection is almost done.\n\n【28】If you forget your dose\n-----------------------\n\n【29】If you forget to give yourself an injection, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose on the original scheduled day.\n\n【30】If you do not remember until close to the day of your next dose, speak to your specialist. They'll let you know whether to skip the missed dose.\n\n【31】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【32】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【33】*   you have taken more than your prescribed dose of adalimumab\n\n【34】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【35】Have the medicine packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【36】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n删除11：<u>More in Adalimumab\n------------------\n\n【37】*   About adalimumab\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking adalimumab with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:21:04", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:26:56", "cost": 352.178}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:26:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:21:03"}

Carry this with you all the time. It tells healthcare professionals that you're taking an anticoagulant. This can be useful for them to know in case of a medical emergency.\n\n【26】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your anticoagulant alert card to the nurse, doctor or dentist. This includes before you have vaccinations and routine sessions with the dental hygienist.\n\n【27】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking edoxaban or reduce your dose for a short time.\n\n【28】Switching from warfarin to edoxaban\n-----------------------------------\n\n【29】If you need to switch from warfarin to edoxaban, your doctor will advise you when to stop taking warfarin. This will probably be a few days before you start edoxaban.\n\n【30】Your doctor or anticoagulant clinic will do a blood test called the international normalised ratio (INR) to check how quickly your blood's clotting. This is to help decide exactly when you should start taking edoxaban.\n\n【31】Switching from edoxaban to warfarin\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】If you need to switch from edoxaban to warfarin, you may need to take both medicines together for a few days.\n\n【33】Your doctor or anticoagulant clinic will do a blood test called the international normalised ratio (INR) to check how quickly your blood's clotting.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**There's currently no cure for haemochromatosis, but there are treatments that can reduce the amount of iron in your body.**\n\n【3】This can help relieve some of the symptoms and reduce the risk of damage to organs such as the heart, liver and pancreas.\n\n【4】Venesection (phlebotomy)\n------------------------\n\n【5】The most commonly used treatment for haemochromatosis is a procedure to remove some of your blood, known as a venesection or phlebotomy.\n\n【6】The procedure is similar to giving blood. You lie back in a chair and a needle is used to drain a small amount of blood, usually about 500ml, from a vein in your arm.\n\n【7】The removed blood includes red blood cells that contain iron, and your body will use up more iron to replace them, helping to reduce the amount of iron in your body.\n\n【8】There are 2 main stages to treatment:\n\n【9】*   **induction** – blood is removed on a frequent basis (usually weekly) until your iron levels are normal; this can sometimes take up to a year or more\n*   **maintenance** – blood is removed less often (usually 2 to 4 times a year) to keep your iron levels under control; this is usually needed for the rest of your life\n\n【10】Chelation therapy\n-----------------\n\n【11】A treatment called chelation therapy may be used in a small number of cases where regular phlebotomies are not possible because it's difficult to remove blood regularly – for example, if you have very thin or fragile veins.\n\n【12】This involves taking medicine that removes iron from your blood and releases it into your urine or poo.\n\n【13】Commonly used medicines are deferasirox and desferrioxamine.\n\n【14】Deferasirox is unlicensed for the treatment of haemochromatosis, which means it has not undergone extensive clinical trials for this use. But your doctor may recommend it if they feel the possible benefits outweigh any risks.\n\n【15】Diet and alcohol\n----------------\n\n【16】You do not need to make any big changes to your diet, such as avoiding all foods containing iron, if you have haemochromatosis.\n\n【17】This is unlikely to be of much extra help if you're having 1 of the treatments above, and could mean you do not get all the nutrition you need.\n\n【18】You'll usually be advised to:\n\n【19】*   have a generally healthy, balanced diet\n*   avoid breakfast cereals that have been \"fortified\" with extra iron\n*   avoid taking iron and vitamin C supplements – these may be harmful for people with high iron levels\n*   be careful not to eat raw oysters and clams – these may contain a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections in people with high iron levels\n*   avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol – this can increase the level of iron in your body and put extra strain on your liver\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 29 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 29 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:47:36", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:48:13", "cost": 36.772}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:48:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:47:35"}

In many cases, it causes no or very few symptoms, although you may notice a swelling or lump in your tummy (abdomen) or groin.\n\n【3】The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down.

Nitrates are used to treat angina.\n\n【3】Angina is chest pain that happens when not enough blood gets to the muscles of the heart. It usually happens because your arteries have become hardened and narrowed.\n\n【4】Your heart muscles need the oxygen in blood to work. If your heart needs to work harder, during exercise for example, it needs increased blood flow to get more oxygen.\n\n【5】In angina, GTN works by widening blood vessels (veins and arteries). This increases the blood supply to your heart, which gets more oxygen to your heart muscles and this reduces chest pain.\n\n【6】By widening blood vessels GTN also makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body, so your heart muscles get more oxygen, reducing the risk of getting chest pain.\n\n【7】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【8】There are no issues with taking GTN for a long time. Most people can take it with no problems.\n\n【9】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【10】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking GTN.\n\n【11】If you've been taking GTN regularly and you stop taking it, your angina may get worse. This may increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke.\n\n【12】If you're taking GTN and are bothered by side effects, speak to your doctor. They may be able to change your dose or prescribe a different medicine instead.\n\n【13】Are there other medicines for angina?\n\n【14】GTN is the only medicine available for fast relief of angina symptoms and to prevent pain before exercise or physical effort.\n\n【15】There are other medicines that can be taken regularly to prevent angina attacks, including:\n\n【16】*   long-acting nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate\n*   beta blockers such as atenolol\n*   calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem\n*   medicines such as ranolazine, nicorandil or ivabradine\n\n【17】Your doctor will advise you on which is the best medicine for you.\n\n【18】Do GTN tablets go out of date?\n\n【19】GTN tablets go out of date (expire) 8 weeks after the bottle is opened. This is because the active ingredient can evaporate, which means the tablets will not work properly after that time.\n\n【20】To make sure your tablets do not lose their strength before 8 weeks:\n\n【21】*   keep them in the bottle they came in\n*   close the lid tightly after you have taken each tablet out\n*   do not put anything else inside your tablet bottle\n\n【22】It may help to make a note of the date you first opened the bottle. You could write this on the bottle as long as you do not cover anything else on the label.\n\n【23】Make sure you have a new supply of GTN to use after each pack expires. Always check the expiry date on the pack.\n\n【24】After 8 weeks, if you have any tablets left in the bottle, return that bottle to a pharmacy so they can dispose of it in the right way.\n\n【25】Can I take it before surgery or before tests?\n\n【26】If you're having surgery, let the doctors know that you take GTN. They might ask you to stop taking GTN for a short time before surgery.\n\n【27】This is because some of the medicines used to make you sleep and not feel pain during surgery (anaesthetic) can make the side effects of GTN worse.\n\n【28】You must tell the doctor or nurse if you're wearing a GTN patch if you're going to have certain types of tests and treatments including:\n\n【29】*   an MRI scan\n*   diathermy treatment (treatment using hot wires)\n*   electrical treatment on your heart\n\n【30】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【31】Some people with angina worry that having sex will trigger an angina attack, but the risk of this happening is low. It's as safe as other forms of exercise with similar levels of effort.\n\n【32】If you're worried about having an angina attack during sex:\n\n【33】*   keep your GTN nearby, so you can use it quickly if you need to\n*   think about taking a tablet or using your spray before you have sex, to reduce the risk of an attack\n\n【34】GTN is not likely to affect your sex life in any other way.\n\n【35】Talk to your doctor if you're having problems with your sex life.\n\n【36】You cannot take medicines for erection problems if you're using GTN. These include:\n\n【37】*   avanafil\n*   sildenafil (Viagra)\n*   tadalafil (Cialis)\n*   vardenafil\n\n【38】If you've used one of these medicines, do not use or take GTN for at least 24 hours after sildenafil or vardenafil, and at least 48 hours after tadalafil.\n\n【39】If you have an angina attack after using one of these medicines for erection problems, stop sexual activity immediately and rest. Do not use GTN.\n\n【40】### Immediate action required: Call 999 if:\n\n【41】*   you still have chest pain after 10 minutes\n\n【42】Do I need to avoid playing sports?\n\n【43】It's important to stay active if you have angina.\n\n【44】You might worry that exercising could trigger your symptoms or cause a heart attack, but the risk is low if you:\n\n【45】*   build up your activity level gradually and take regular breaks\n*   keep your GTN tablets or spray with you in case you need them\n*   use your GTN tablets or spray before starting exercise, if you need to\n\n【46】Talk to your doctor if you're not sure whether it's safe for you to exercise.\n\n【47】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【48】GTN does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【49】If you have angina, oral contraceptives are not recommended because they increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n【50】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【51】GTN can make some people feel dizzy, sleepy or faint. If this happens to you, do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n\n【52】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking GTN. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【53】Can I drink alcohol while taking GTN?\n\n【54】Alcohol increases the blood pressure lowering effect of GTN, so it can make you feel dizzy, faint or sleepy.\n\n【55】If this happens to you, it's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking or using GTN. If this does not happen to you, it's still better to not drink too much alcohol while you're taking or using GTN.\n\n【56】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【57】Apart from avoiding too much alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while you're taking or using GTN, but angina is a warning sign that you're at risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【58】You can help reduce your risk of problems like these by:\n\n【59】*   eating a balanced diet\n*   cutting down on alcohol\n*   losing weight if you are overweight\n\n【60】Can lifestyle changes help with angina?\n\n【61】Angina is a warning sign that you're at risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【62】If you've been prescribed GTN, you can also boost your health by making some key lifestyle changes.\n\n【63】*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and lean proteins. This should help you to stay healthy or lose weight, which reduces your risk of heart attacks and strokes. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol is not good for the health of your heart. Try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol each week, spread across 3 or more days. A medium glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking will cut your risk of heart attack and stroke. Try to avoid secondhand smoke too.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise keeps your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic – walking every day will help. Use your GTN tablets or spray before exercise if you need to.\n删除11：<u>More in Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)\n---------------------------------\n\n【64】*   About GTN\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:48:16", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:48:36", "cost": 20.095}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:48:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:48:15"}

They can cause problems if you have other health conditions or if they're taken alongside other medicines.**\n\n【2】Some of the issues you and your doctor will need to bear in mind when taking SSRIs, or when considering using them, include:\n\n【3】Medical conditions\n------------------\n\n【4】SSRIs may not be suitable if you have any of the following conditions:\n\n【5】*   bipolar disorder and you're in a manic phase (a period of extremely excitable mood), although they can be useful for depressive phases\n*   a bleeding disorder, such as haemophilia\n*   type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes\n*   epilepsy – SSRIs should only be taken if your epilepsy is well controlled, and they should be stopped if your epilepsy gets worse\n*   narrow angle glaucoma\n*   serious kidney, liver or heart problems\n\n【6】SSRIs may need to be used with caution or not at all if you have one of these conditions, because the medicine could increase your chance of experiencing serious side effects.\n\n【7】Pregnancy\n---------\n\n【8】If you're pregnant and think you may be depressed, you should discuss the risks and benefits of using SSRIs with your doctor.\n\n【9】You should also speak to your doctor for advice if you become pregnant while you're taking SSRIs.\n\n【10】As a precaution, SSRIs aren't usually recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the first 3 months (the first trimester). This is because there may be a risk to the baby.\n\n【11】However, exceptions can be made if the risk posed by depression (or another mental health condition) outweighs the potential risks of treatment.\n\n【12】Possible risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy include:\n\n【13】*   loss of the pregnancy\n*   birth defects affecting the baby’s heart (congenital heart disease)\n*   the baby being born with a rare condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn (PPHN), which causes breathing and circulation problems\n\n【14】Breastfeeding\n-------------\n\n【15】If you're prescribed SSRIs when breastfeeding, paroxetine or sertraline are usually recommended and are considered safe to use.\n\n【16】However, other SSRIs may be used if it's thought that the benefits of treatment and benefits of breastfeeding your baby outweigh the potential risks.\n\n【17】Children and young people\n-------------------------\n\n【18】SSRIs aren't usually recommended for children and young people under the age of 18. This is because there's evidence of an increased risk of self-harm and thoughts about suicide in this age group.\n\n【19】There are also concerns that the use of SSRIs could affect brain development in children and young people.\n\n【20】However, children and young people under the age of 18 may be offered an SSRI if talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), alone haven't helped, or as a treatment to be used alongside talking therapies. \n\n【21】An SSRI will only be prescribed in addition to a talking therapy and treatment must be supervised by a psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions).\n\n【22】If an SSRI is recommended, fluoxetine is usually the first choice.\n\n【23】Driving and operating machinery\n-------------------------------\n\n【24】Some SSRIs can cause dizziness, drowsiness and blurred vision, particularly when you first start taking them.\n\n【25】If you do experience these symptoms, you shouldn't drive or use heavy tools and machinery. The symptoms should be temporary, but speak to your doctor if you're unsure.\n\n【26】Interactions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【27】SSRIs can react unpredictably with certain other medicines (known as \"interacting\"), potentially increasing the risk of side effects such as bleeding or a problem known as \"serotonin syndrome\".\n\n【28】Some of the medicines that can interact with some SSRIs include:\n\n【29】*   **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** – a common type of painkiller that includes ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen\n*   **antiplatelets** – a type of medicine used to prevent blood clots, such as low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel\n*   **theophylline** – a medicine used to treat asthma\n*   **clozapine and pimozide** – medicines used to treat schizophrenia and psychosis\n*   **lithium** – a medicine used to treat severe depression and bipolar disorder\n*   **triptans** – a type of medicine, such as naratriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, used to treat migraines\n*   **other** **antidepressants** – including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n【30】However, this isn't an exhaustive list of all the medicines that can interact with SSRIs, and not all of these interactions apply to all types of SSRI.\n\n【31】You should always make sure you carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medicine to see if there are any medicines you should avoid. If in doubt, your pharmacist or GP should be able to advise you.\n\n【32】Interactions with food and drink\n--------------------------------\n\n【33】Alcohol isn't usually recommended if you're taking an SSRI, because it can increase any drowsiness you may experience and can make feelings of depression worse.\n\n【34】The SSRI, fluvoxamine, is also known to enhance the effects of caffeine, so people who drink large amounts of caffeine may experience unpleasant symptoms such as heart palpitations, feeling sick, restlessness and insomnia.\n\n【35】You should therefore avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee, energy drinks and cola, while taking fluvoxamine.\n\n【36】St John's wort\n--------------\n\n【37】St John's wort is a popular herbal remedy promoted for the treatment of depression.\n\n【38】While there's some evidence that St John's wort may help mild to moderate depression, many experts advise against using it because the amount of active ingredient can vary significantly and you can never be sure what sort of effect it will have on you.\n\n【39】Taking St John's wort alongside SSRIs can also potentially cause serious health problems.\n删除11：<u>More in Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】*   Overview - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Cautions - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Dosage - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   Side effects - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 8 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 8 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:24:42", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:27:47", "cost": 184.367}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:27:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:24:41"}

It may take several weeks to see the full benefits.\n\n【9】You'll usually start to wheeze less or feel less breathless after using mometasone for 3 to 7 days.\n\n【10】Once your symptoms have improved, you may find you need to use your other inhaler (called a reliever) less often.\n\n【11】If your shortness of breath or wheezing does not get better after 7 days of using mometasone, or if it gets worse, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible.\n\n【12】It's important to keep using your mometasone inhaler every day even if you feel better.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】If you use your inhaler as recommended by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist you're unlikely to get any lasting side effects.\n\n【15】Inhalers generally deliver a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【16】However, for children and teenagers using high doses of a steroid inhaler, their height and weight need to be monitored carefully. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth. Talk to their doctor if you're worried. They'll be able to explain the benefits and risks of giving your child mometasone.\n\n【17】Adults taking high doses have an increased risk of getting adrenal gland problems or weak bones (osteoporosis) over time. This is because more of the steroid gets into your body.\n\n【18】Your doctor will monitor you closely and may prescribe medicines to help strengthen your bones. Calcium-rich foods (such as milk and cheese, or non-dairy milks with added calcium) and regular exercise can also help keep bones healthy.\n\n【19】What will happen if I stop using my mometasone inhaler?\n\n【20】Do not stop using your mometasone inhaler without speaking to your doctor or specialist nurse first.\n\n【21】If you have an inhaler to control your asthma, your breathing problems may return if you suddenly stop using it.\n\n【22】You might feel wheezy or short of breath. Your chest may feel tight and you could start to cough.\n\n【23】Do I need to stop using mometasone before having surgery?\n\n【24】You do not need to stop using your mometasone inhaler before surgery. Suddenly stopping treatment can make you feel unwell and may give you symptoms.\n\n【25】If you're having surgery or having emergency treatment, for example after an accident, tell the person treating you that you're taking mometasone. Your doctor may decide you need extra steroids for a while.\n\n【26】If you've been given a blue steroid treatment card, or a red steroid emergency card, show your card to anyone treating you so they can plan your treatment.\n\n【27】How does mometasone compare with other preventer inhalers?\n\n【28】As well as mometasone inhalers, there are other preventer inhalers that contain steroids such as beclometasone, budesonide, ciclesonide and fluticasone.\n\n【29】They can look very different, and some are for adults only.\n\n【30】These steroid inhalers all work in the same way, but there are differences between how strong they are and how likely they are to cause side effects.\n\n【31】Talk to your doctor or specialist nurse about which is the best choice of steroid inhaler for you or your child.\n\n【32】It's important to only ever use your own mometasone inhaler. Your inhaler may be different to a friend's or relative's. Their inhaler might contain a different dose of mometasone.\n\n【33】Preventer inhalers are different from the inhalers used during asthma attacks. These are called bronchodilators or reliever inhalers.\n\n【34】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【35】### Steroid emergency card (red card)\n\n【36】If you're prescribed steroid medicines such as mometasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【37】It's more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【38】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card. This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【39】#### Important\n\n【40】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【41】### Blue steroid card\n\n【42】If you're on a high dose of mometasone, your doctor or pharmacist will also give you a blue steroid treatment card. It tells you how you can reduce the risks of side effects. It also gives details of your doctor, how much mometasone you take and how long the treatment will last for.\n\n【43】If you need any medical or dental treatment, show your blue steroid card to the doctor or dentist.\n\n【44】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【45】Mometasone does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【46】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【47】For most people, using mometasone inhalers will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n\n【48】However, if your eyesight is affected in any way, do not drive or cycle.\n\n【49】Can I drink alcohol while using mometasone inhalers?\n\n【50】Yes, you can drink alcohol with mometasone inhalers.\n\n【51】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【52】You can eat and drink normally while using mometasone inhalers.\n\n【53】Can I smoke if I use a mometasone inhaler?\n\n【54】Try not to smoke. Smoking irritates the lungs and will make your breathing problem worse.\n\n【55】Mometasone will also work better if you do not smoke.\n\n【56】Speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you're finding it hard to stop smoking. Stop smoking treatments are available on the NHS.\n\n【57】Can lifestyle changes help with my breathing?\n\n【58】There are several things you can do to help your condition when you're living with asthma. These include:\n\n【59】*   stopping smoking – not smoking can significantly reduce how severe and frequent your symptoms are\n*   exercising regularly – exercise is unlikely to trigger your symptoms once you're on appropriate treatment\n*   healthy eating – aim for a healthy, balanced diet and lose excess weight if you need to\n*   getting vaccinated – it's a good idea to have the annual flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccination when it's offered\n*   trying an air filter – they do not remove all the allergens but some people find they help their symptoms\n删除11：<u>More in Mometasone inhalers\n---------------------------\n\n【60】*   About mometasone inhalers\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using them with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 6 September 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 6 September 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:38:48", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:39:55", "cost": 66.38}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:39:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:38:47"}

It can be treated with antibiotics but can be serious if not treated. There's a vaccine that helps protect some people who are at risk from TB.**\n\n【2】Check if you have tuberculosis (TB)\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】Symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) usually come on gradually.\n\n【4】Common symptoms include:\n\n【5】*   a cough that lasts more than 3 weeks – you may cough up mucus (phlegm) or mucus with blood in it\n*   feeling tired or exhausted\n*   a high temperature or night sweats\n*   loss of appetite\n*   weight loss\n*   feeling generally unwell\n\n【6】Children may also have difficulty gaining weight or growing.\n\n【7】If TB has spread to another part of your body such as your glands (lymph nodes), bones or brain, you may also have other symptoms, including:\n\n【8】*   swollen glands\n*   body aches and pains\n*   swollen joints or ankles\n*   tummy or pelvic pain\n*   constipation\n*   dark or cloudy pee\n*   a headache\n*   being sick\n*   feeling confused\n*   a stiff neck\n*   a rash on the legs, face or other part of the body\n\n【9】If you have TB and you have symptoms, it's called active TB.\n\n【10】Sometimes you can have TB in your body but have no symptoms. This is called latent TB.\n\n【11】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【12】*   you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks\n*   you're feeling tired or exhausted and you're not sure why\n*   you have a high temperature or night sweats that do not go away\n*   you often do not feel hungry\n*   you keep losing weight without changing your diet or exercise routine\n*   you've spent a lot of time with someone who has tuberculosis (TB) and has symptoms (for example, you live with someone who has it)\n\n【13】Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】*   you're coughing up blood or mucus (phlegm) with blood in it\n\n【15】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【16】Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】*   you have a stiff neck and a severe headache\n*   it's painful to look at bright lights\n*   you've had a seizure or fit\n*   you've had a change in behaviour – such as sudden confusion\n*   you have weakness or loss of movement in part of the body\n\n【18】These could be signs that tuberculosis (TB) has spread to your brain (meningitis).\n\n【19】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【20】Tests to check for tuberculosis (TB)\n------------------------------------\n\n【21】If you have symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), tests you may have include:\n\n【22】*   an X-ray, ultrasound, echocardiogram or CT scan of your chest or the part of your body that may be affected\n*   taking samples of your mucus (phlegm)\n*   a biopsy to take a sample of tissue, cells or fluid from the affected area\n\n【23】If you have no symptoms but are at risk from TB (for example, you've been in close contact with someone who has TB) you may have a Mantoux test or blood tests to check if you have it.\n\n【24】A Mantoux test is a skin test where a small amount of liquid is injected under the skin in your arm. This liquid will cause a small reaction on your skin if you have TB.\n\n【25】Treatment for tuberculosis (TB)\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months.\n\n【27】If TB has spread to your brain, spinal cord or the area around your heart, you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks.\n\n【28】If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months_._\n\n【29】### Important\n\n【30】It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, TB could come back.\n\n【31】Causes of tuberculosis (TB)\n---------------------------\n\n【32】Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB).\n\n【33】When someone with active TB coughs, they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time.\n\n【34】Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active TB in the future.\n\n【35】### People who are more likely to get TB\n\n【36】Anyone can get TB, but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it, including people who:\n\n【37】*   spend a lot of time with someone who has active TB, such as people living in the same house\n*   were born in or lived in an area where TB is more common\n*   have a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV, a kidney transplant or who are having certain treatment like chemotherapy\n*   are under 5 years of age\n*   live in overcrowded or unhealthy conditions, such as people who are homeless\n*   regularly smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs\n*   have had TB before and it was not treated properly\n\n【38】Tuberculosis (TB) vaccination\n-----------------------------\n\n【39】There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine.\n\n【40】It's recommended for some people who are at higher risk of catching TB or getting seriously ill from it, including:\n\n【41】*   babies who live in areas of the UK where TB is more common\n*   babies and children who live with someone who has TB\n*   babies and children who were born or lived in a country where TB is more common\n*   babies and children whose parents or grandparents were born in a country where TB is more common\n*   people aged 35 and under who are spending more than 3 months in a country where TB is more common\n*   people at risk of getting TB through their work, such as healthcare workers who work with people who have TB\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (TB)</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:52:29", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:52:41", "cost": 11.659}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:52:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:52:29"}

It usually gets better on its own in 7 to 10 days.\n\n【36】To help the symptoms:\n\n【37】*   drink fluids to prevent dehydration and avoid acidic drinks, such as fruit juice\n*   eat soft foods like yoghurt and avoid hot and spicy foods\n*   take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help ease a sore mouth or throat\n\n【38】A pharmacist can help with hand, foot and mouth disease\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Ask a pharmacist for advice about treatments, such as mouth ulcer gels, sprays and mouthwashes, to relieve pain.\n\n【40】They can tell you which ones are suitable for children.\n\n【41】Find a pharmacy\n\n【42】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【43】*   your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve after 7 to 10 days\n*   you or your child has a very high temperature, or feels hot and shivery\n*   you're worried about your child's symptoms\n*   your child is dehydrated (they're not peeing as often as usual)\n*   you're pregnant and get hand, foot and mouth disease\n\n【44】Hand, foot and mouth disease can be spread to other people.\n\n【45】Check with your GP surgery before going. They may suggest a phone consultation.\n\n【46】How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in the blisters. You can get it more than once.\n\n【48】You can start spreading it from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you're most likely to spread it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start.\n\n【49】To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:\n\n【50】*   wash your hands often with soap and water, and children's hands too\n*   use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze\n*   bin used tissues as quickly as possible\n*   do not share towels or household items like cups or cutlery\n*   wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash\n\n【51】### Staying off school or nursery\n\n【52】Keep your child off school or nursery while they're feeling unwell.\n\n【53】But as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed.\n\n【54】Keeping your child away from other children for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading.\n\n【55】Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【56】Although there's usually no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it's best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\n【57】This is because:\n\n【58】*   having a high temperature during the first 3 months of pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, although this is very rare\n*   getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before giving birth can mean your baby is born with a mild version of it\n\n【59】Speak to a GP or your midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 February 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 February 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:04:07", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:04:26", "cost": 18.989}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:04:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:04:06"}

Check with a GP if you think surgery could be an option for you.\n\n【6】National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on obesity recommend that surgery should be provided on the NHS if you meet all of the following criteria:\n\n【7】*   you have a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more, or a BMI between 35 and 40 and a serious condition that might improve if you lost weight (such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure)\n*   you've tried all other weight loss methods, such as dieting and exercise, but have struggled to lose weight or keep it off\n*   you agree to long-term follow-up after surgery – such as making healthy lifestyle changes and attending regular check-ups\n*   you're fit and healthy enough to have surgery under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep)\n*   you've been receiving or will receive treatment from a specialist obesity team\n\n【8】If your BMI is 50 or over, surgery may be considered without needing to try other weight loss methods first.\n\n【9】If you've been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, particularly if you have a south Asian background, an assessment to see if surgery is suitable may be considered if your BMI is below 35.\n\n【10】Private weight loss surgery\n---------------------------\n\n【11】The cost of private weight loss surgery can vary.\n\n【12】Typical prices are:\n\n【13】*   gastric band surgery – £4,000 to £8,000\n*   gastric bypass – £8,000 to £15,000\n*   sleeve gastrectomy – £8,000 to £10,000\n\n【14】You may not need a referral from a GP for private treatment, but it's a good idea to speak to one for advice first.\n\n【15】Before approaching a private clinic or surgeon, do as much research as possible into the different types of weight loss surgery and think about the questions you want to ask.\n\n【16】Some people consider having treatment abroad, where costs for private treatment can be cheaper, but make sure you weigh up any potential savings against the potential risks.\n\n【17】Standards may not be as strict in clinics outside the UK, and aftercare is not always straightforward. Clinics in other countries may not provide follow-up care, or it may not be the same standard as in the UK.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Weight loss surgery</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Types</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:03:12", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:03:27", "cost": 14.699}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:03:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:03:11"}

This means it can have an effect that is different to what you expected.**\n\n【3】If you want to check that your medicines are safe to take with your antibiotics, ask your GP or local pharmacist.\n\n【4】Some antibiotics need to be taken with food, while others need to be taken on an empty stomach. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\n\n【5】Alcohol\n-------\n\n【6】It's a good idea to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medicine or feeling unwell.\n\n【7】But it's unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you're taking the most common antibiotics.\n\n【8】However, some antibiotics can have side effects such as feeling sick or dizzy, which might be made worse by drinking alcohol.\n\n【9】Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure whether you can drink alcohol while taking antibiotics.\n\n【10】### Metronidazole and tinidazole\n\n【11】It's best to completely avoid alcohol while taking:\n\n【12】*   metronidazole – an antibiotic sometimes used for dental or vaginal infections, skin infections, infected leg ulcers and pressure sores\n*   tinidazole – an antibiotic sometimes used to treat many of the same infections as metronidazole, as well as to help clear bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) from the gut\n\n【13】Continue to avoid alcohol for 48 hours after you stop taking metronidazole and 72 hours after you stop taking tinidazole.\n\n【14】Drinking alcohol with metronidazole or tinidazole can cause very unpleasant side effects, such as:\n\n【15】*   feeling and being sick\n*   stomach pain\n*   hot flushes\n*   a fast or irregular heartbeat\n*   headaches\n*   feeling dizzy\n*   feeling drowsy\n\n【16】### Other antibiotics\n\n【17】It may be best to avoid drinking alcohol if you're taking:\n\n【18】*   linezolid – this medicine can be affected by undistilled (fermented) alcoholic drinks, such as wine, beer, sherry and lager\n*   doxycycline – alcohol can affect this medicine, and it may also be less effective in people with a history of drinking heavily\n\n【19】The contraceptive pill\n----------------------\n\n【20】Some antibiotics, such as rifampicin and rifabutin, can reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill.\n\n【21】If you're prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, while taking antibiotics. Speak to your GP, nurse or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【22】Mixing medicines\n----------------\n\n【23】Some antibiotics do not mix well with certain medicines and herbal supplements.\n\n【24】You may be prescribed a different antibiotic or told to stop taking some medicines or herbal supplements.\n\n【25】Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine and tell your doctor if you're taking any medicines or herbal remedies.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Side effects</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Antibiotic resistance</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:32:21", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:32:28", "cost": 7.057}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:32:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:32:19"}

As with all types of surgery, there's a risk of complications.**\n\n【3】Some complications can happen soon after the operation, while others may develop months, or even years, later.\n\n【4】Rejection\n---------\n\n【5】One of the most common complications of a pancreas transplant is rejection of the donor pancreas.\n\n【6】This happens in between 10 to 15 out of 100 people who have a pancreas transplant.\n\n【7】Rejection is where the immune system recognises the transplanted pancreas as foreign and attacks it.\n\n【8】It usually occurs in the days, weeks or months after the transplant, although it can sometimes happen years later.\n\n【9】Immunosuppressant medicine can reduce the risk of rejection.\n\n【10】Symptoms of rejection include:\n\n【11】*   pain and swelling in your tummy\n*   a high temperature\n*   being sick\n*   chills and aches\n*   extreme tiredness\n*   puffy, swollen ankles\n*   shortness of breath\n\n【12】Contact a GP or your transplant team as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\n\n【13】Rejection can usually be treated by increasing your dose of immunosuppressant medicine.\n\n【14】Immunosuppressant side effects\n------------------------------\n\n【15】The immunosuppressant medicines you need to take to prevent rejection can have a number of significant side effects.\n\n【16】These can include:\n\n【17】*   an increased risk of getting infections\n*   shaky hands\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   high blood pressure\n*   hair loss or thinning\n*   mood swings\n*   weight gain\n*   an upset stomach\n*   a rash\n*   weakened bones (osteoporosis)\n*   an increased risk of certain types of cancer, particularly skin cancer\n\n【18】Speak to your transplant team if you have any troublesome side effects.\n\n【19】Do not stop taking your medicine without getting medical advice first.\n\n【20】Infections\n----------\n\n【21】Immunosuppressant medicine will weaken your immune system and make you more likely to get an infection.\n\n【22】While taking the medicine, it's a good idea to:\n\n【23】*   report any possible symptoms of an infection to a GP or your transplant team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature, aching muscles, diarrhoea or headaches\n*   ensure your vaccinations are up to date – speak to a GP or your transplant team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need as some are not safe if you're taking immunosuppressant medicines\n*   avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it's an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox\n\n【24】To help prevent infection, you may be given antibiotics, antifungal medicine or antiviral medicine to take for the first few weeks or months after your transplant.\n\n【25】Blood clots\n-----------\n\n【26】Blood clots can sometimes form in the blood vessels that supply the new pancreas, which can stop it working properly.\n\n【27】The risk of this happening is highest in the days after the operation, so you'll be closely monitored in hospital to check for any signs of a blood clot.\n\n【28】You'll also be given blood-thinning medicine to reduce the chances of a clot forming.\n\n【29】If a blood clot does develop in the new pancreas, the pancreas transplant will often need to be removed completely.\n\n【30】Blood clots can also form in other blood vessels after surgery, such as those in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or supplying your lungs (pulmonary embolism), but taking blood-thinning medicine should help prevent this.\n\n【31】Pancreatitis\n------------\n\n【32】Pancreatitis is swelling of the pancreas and is common in the first few days after surgery.\n\n【33】Symptoms of pancreatitis include:\n\n【34】*   a dull pain in your tummy\n*   feeling sick\n*   vomiting\n\n【35】Pancreatitis should pass within a few days.\n\n【36】But sometimes tubes may need to be placed in your tummy to drain any excess fluid off the donor pancreas.\n\n【37】In a few cases, it may be necessary to remove the donor pancreas.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:48:13", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:48:20", "cost": 6.791}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:48:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:48:11"}

But there are some ways to help reduce its impact.**\n\n【3】Looking after yourself\n----------------------\n\n【4】It's important to take good care of yourself if you have COPD.\n\n【5】Some of the main things you'll be advised to do are outlined below.\n\n【6】### Take your medicine\n\n【7】It's important to take any prescribed medicine, including inhalers, as this can help prevent bad flare-ups.\n\n【8】It's also a good idea to read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements.\n\n【9】Check with your care team if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers or nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with your medicine.\n\n【10】Also speak to your care team if you have any concerns about the medicine you're taking or you're experiencing any side effects.\n\n【11】### Stop smoking\n\n【12】If you smoke, stopping can help slow down or prevent further damage to your lungs.\n\n【13】Help is available from a GP and NHS stop smoking services.\n\n【14】Find about more about how to stop smoking.\n\n【15】### Exercise regularly\n\n【16】Exercising regularly can help improve your symptoms and quality of life.\n\n【17】The amount of exercise you can do will depend on your individual circumstances. Exercising until you're a little breathless is not dangerous, but do not push yourself too far.\n\n【18】It's a good idea to speak to a GP for advice before starting a new exercise programme if your symptoms are severe or you have not exercised in a while.\n\n【19】You may be advised to participate in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, which will include a structured exercise plan tailored to your needs and ability.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treatments for COPD, including pulmonary rehabilitation.</u>\n\n【20】### Maintain a healthy weight\n\n【21】Carrying extra weight can make breathlessness worse, so it's a good idea to lose weight through a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet if you're overweight.\n\n【22】Some people with COPD find that they unintentionally lose weight. Eating foods that are high in protein and taking in enough calories is important to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n【23】You may see a dietitian as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme if necessary.\n\n【24】### Get vaccinated\n\n【25】COPD can put a significant strain on your body and mean you're more vulnerable to infections.\n\n【26】Everyone with COPD is encouraged to have the annual flu jab and the one-off pneumococcal vaccination.\n\n【27】You can get these vaccinations at your GP surgery or a local pharmacy that offers a vaccination service.\n\n【28】### Check the weather\n\n【29】Cold spells and periods of hot weather and humidity can cause breathing problems if you have COPD.\n\n【30】It's a good idea to keep an eye on the weather forecast and make sure you have enough of your medicine to hand in case your symptoms get temporarily worse.\n\n【31】The Met Office issues cold weather alerts during winter, which can warn you about cold spells.\n\n【32】### Watch what you breathe\n\n【33】There are certain things that should be avoided, if possible, to reduce COPD symptoms and the chances of a flare-up, including:\n\n【34】*   dusty places\n*   fumes, such as car exhausts\n*   smoke\n*   air freshener sprays or plug-ins\n*   strong-smelling cleaning products (unless there's plenty of ventilation)\n*   hairspray\n*   perfume\n删除7：<u>Asthma + Lung UK has more information about indoor air pollution</u>\n\n【35】Regular reviews and monitoring\n------------------------------\n\n【36】You'll have regular contact with your care team to monitor your condition.\n\n【37】These appointments may involve:\n\n【38】*   talking about your symptoms – such as whether they're affecting your normal activities or are getting worse\n*   talking about your medicine – including whether you think you might be experiencing any side effects\n*   tests to monitor your health\n\n【39】It's also a good opportunity to ask any questions you have or raise any other issues you'd like to discuss with your care team.\n\n【40】Contact your GP or care team if your symptoms get suddenly worse or you develop new symptoms between check-ups.\n\n【41】Breathing techniques\n--------------------\n\n【42】There are various breathing techniques that some people find helpful for breathlessness.\n\n【43】These include breathing control, which involves breathing gently using the least effort, with the shoulders supported. This can help when people with COPD feel short of breath.\n\n【44】Breathing techniques for people who are more active include:\n\n【45】*   relaxed, slow, deep breathing\n*   breathing through pursed lips, as if whistling\n*   breathing out hard when doing an activity that needs a big effort\n*   paced breathing, using a rhythm in time with the activity, such as climbing stairs\n\n【46】If you have a chesty cough that produces a lot of phlegm, you may be taught a specific technique to help you clear your airways called the active cycle breathing technique.\n删除7：<u>Asthma + Lung UK has more information about how to manage breathlessness</u>\n\n【47】Talk to others\n--------------\n\n【48】If you have questions about your condition and treatment, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you.\n\n【49】You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information about these.\n\n【50】Some people find it helpful to talk to other people who have COPD, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【51】*   Asthma + Lung UK: Online support group\n*   HealthUnlocked: Lung conditions community\n\n【52】</u>\nRelationships and sex\n---------------------\n\n【53】Having a long-term illness such as COPD can put a strain on any relationship.\n\n【54】### Relationships with friends and family\n\n【55】Difficulty breathing and coughing can make you feel tired and depressed.\n\n【56】Your spouse, partner or carer may also have a lot of concerns about your health. It's important to talk about your worries together.\n\n【57】Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. But do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that's what you want.\n\n【58】### Your sex life\n\n【59】As COPD progresses, the increasing breathlessness can make it difficult to take part in strenuous activities. The breathlessness may happen during sexual activity.\n\n【60】Talk to your partner and stay open-minded. Explore what you both like sexually. Simply touching, being touched and being close to someone helps a person feel loved and special.\n\n【61】Your doctor, nurse or physiotherapist may also be able to suggest ways to help manage breathlessness during sex.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【62】*   Asthma + Lung UK: Having sex with a lung condition\n\n【63】</u>\nFlying with COPD\n----------------\n\n【64】If you have COPD and are planning to fly, go to your GP for a fitness-to-fly assessment. This involves checking your breathing using spirometry and measuring your oxygen levels.\n\n【65】Before travelling, remember to pack all your medicine, such as inhalers, in your hand luggage.\n\n【66】If you're using oxygen therapy, tell your travel operator and airline before you book your holiday, as you may need to get a medical form from your GP.\n\n【67】If you're using long-term oxygen therapy, you'll need to make sure you have an adequate oxygen supply for your flight as well as for your time away.\n\n【68】Airlines generally do not allow you to bring oxygen cylinders with you but may permit portable oxygen concentrator devices.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【69】*   Healthcare abroad\n*   Asthma + Lung UK: Travelling with a lung condition\n\n【70】</u>\nMoney and financial support\n---------------------------\n\n【71】People with COPD often have to give up work because their breathlessness stops them doing what they need to do for their job.\n\n【72】If you're unable to work, there are several benefits you may be eligible for:\n\n【73】*   if you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\n*   if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n*   if you are caring for someone with COPD, you may be entitled to Carer's Allowance\n\n【74】You may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【75】*   Benefits for carers\n*   Citizens Advice\n*   Asthma + Lung UK: Benefits and financial support\n*   GOV.UK: Benefits\n\n【76】</u>\nEnd of life care\n----------------\n\n【77】COPD is a serious condition that can eventually reach a stage where it becomes life threatening.\n\n【78】Talking about this and planning your end of life care, also called palliative care, in advance can be helpful.\n\n【79】It can be difficult to talk about dying with your doctor, and particularly with family and friends, but many people find it helps. Support is also available for your family and friends.\n\n【80】It may be helpful to discuss the symptoms you may have as you become more seriously ill, and the treatments available to manage these.\n\n【81】As COPD progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your wishes. This will include whether you would prefer to go to hospital or a hospice, or be looked after at home as you become more ill.\n\n【82】You may want to discuss writing an advance decision, also called a living will, which sets out your wishes for treatment if you become too ill to be consulted.\n\n【83】This might include whether you want to be resuscitated if you stop breathing, and whether you want artificial ventilation to be continued.\n删除6：<u>### Want to know more?\n\n【84】*   End of life care\n*   Asthma + Lung UK: End of life\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 April 2026</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:34:52", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:35:39", "cost": 46.44}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:35:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:34:52"}

DHT can cause your prostate to grow bigger (benign prostate enlargement). It can also stop your hair growing.\n\n【4】Finasteride stops DHT being produced and this helps shrink your prostate and reduce hair loss.\n\n【5】How long does it take to work?\n\n【6】You may notice an improvement a little while after you start taking finasteride.\n\n【7】However, for an enlarged prostate it can take up to 6 months for this medicine to work fully.\n\n【8】For hair loss, you can expect to see some improvement after 3 to 6 months.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Finasteride is generally safe to take for a long time. Many people take it for many months or even years without any problems.\n\n【11】However, there have been reports of breast cancer in some men taking finasteride, but this is rare. Speak to your doctor if you get any changes in your chest area such as lumps, pain or swelling, or discharge from your nipples.\n\n【12】Some men have reported that sexual side effects (such as not being able to get an erection) continued to bother them even after they stopped taking finasteride.\n\n【13】Talk to your doctor if you're bothered by any of these side effects.\n\n【14】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【15】Finasteride is not thought to stop any type of contraception working. However, this medicine is not usually taken by women.\n\n【16】The manufacturers of finasteride recommend using a condom when having sex because very small amounts of finasteride get into semen, but the actual risk is unlikely to be significant. Most experts agree that this is not necessary.\n\n【17】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【18】Finasteride will not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machinery.\n\n【19】Can I drink alcohol while taking finasteride?\n\n【20】You can drink alcohol with finasteride.\n\n【21】Is there any food or and drink I need to avoid?\n\n【22】You can eat and drink normally when taking finasteride.\n\n【23】Can lifestyle changes help symptoms of an enlarged prostate?\n\n【24】Making some simple changes to your lifestyle can help with symptoms of an enlarged prostate.\n\n【25】*   Drink fewer fizzy drinks and less alcohol, caffeine and artificial sweeteners – they can irritate the bladder and make urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Quit smoking – nicotine can irritate the bladder and make urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Drink less in the evening – try to reduce the amount you drink and avoid drinking anything for 2 hours before bedtime. This might help you avoid getting up in the night. Make sure you're still drinking enough fluids earlier in the day.\n*   Empty your bladder – remember to go to the toilet before long journeys or other situations when you know you may not be able to reach a toilet easily.\n*   Try double voiding – this is when you finish peeing, wait a few moments, then try to go again. This can help you empty your bladder properly (but take care not to strain or push).\n*   Check your medicines – ask a doctor whether any medicines you take, such as antidepressants or decongestants, may be making your urinary symptoms worse.\n*   Eat more fruit and fibre – this can help you avoid constipation. Being constipated can put pressure on the bladder and make your symptoms worse.\n删除11：<u>More in Finasteride\n-------------------\n\n【26】*   About finasteride\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Fertility and pregnancy\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 2 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 2 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:34:08", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:34:20", "cost": 11.441}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:34:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:34:07"}

It causes a child to perform less well than expected in daily activities for their age, and appear to move clumsily.**\n\n【3】This topic is about DCD in children, although the condition often causes continued problems into adulthood. \n删除7：<u>Find out more about DCD in adults.</u>\n\n【4】Symptoms of DCD\n---------------\n\n【5】Early developmental milestones of crawling, walking, self-feeding and dressing may be delayed in young children with DCD. Drawing, writing and performance in sports are also usually behind what is expected for their age.\n\n【6】Although signs of the condition are present from an early age, children vary widely in their rate of development. This means a definite diagnosis of DCD does not usually happen until a child with the condition is 5 years old or more.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about symptoms of DCD in children.</u>\n\n【7】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【8】If you're concerned about your child's health or development, talk to a GP or health visitor, or speak to a nurse, doctor or special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) at your child's school.\n\n【9】They may refer your child to an occupational therapist, paediatrician, or another health professional who can assess them and try to identify any developmental problems.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about diagnosing DCD in children.</u>\n\n【10】Causes of DCD\n-------------\n\n【11】Doing co-ordinated movements is a complex process that involves many different nerves and parts of the brain.\n\n【12】Any problem in this process could potentially lead to difficulties with movement and co-ordination.\n\n【13】It's not usually clear why co-ordination doesn't develop as well as other abilities in children with DCD.\n\n【14】However, a number of risk factors that can increase a child's likelihood of developing DCD have been identified.\n\n【15】These include:\n\n【16】*   being born prematurely, before the 37th week of pregnancy\n*   being born with a low birth weight\n*   having a family history of DCD, although it is not clear exactly which genes may be involved in the condition\n*   the mother drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs while pregnant\n\n【17】Treating DCD\n------------\n\n【18】There's no cure for DCD, but a number of therapies can help children to manage their problems.\n\n【19】These include:\n\n【20】*   being taught ways of do activities they find difficult, such as breaking down difficult movements into smaller parts and practicing them regularly\n*   adapting tasks to make them easier, such as using special grips on pens and pencils so they are easier to hold\n\n【21】Although DCD does not affect how intelligent a child is, it can make it more difficult for them to learn and they may need extra help to keep up at school.\n\n【22】Treatment for DCD will be tailored to your child and usually involves a number of different healthcare professionals working together.\n\n【23】Although the physical co-ordination of a child with DCD will remain below average, this may be less of a problem as they get older and develop coping strategies. Some children may continue to have problems.\n\n【24】However, difficulties in school – particularly producing written work – can become much more prominent and require extra help from parents and teachers.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treating DCD in children.</u>\n\n【25】Dyspraxia or DCD?\n-----------------\n\n【26】While many people in the UK use the term dyspraxia to refer to the difficulties with movement and co-ordination that first develop in young children, this term is used less often by healthcare professionals.\n\n【27】Instead, most healthcare professionals use the term developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) to describe the condition.\n\n【28】This term is generally preferred by healthcare professionals because dyspraxia can have several meanings.\n\n【29】For example, dyspraxia can be used to describe movement difficulties that happen later in life because of damage to the brain, such as from a stroke or head injury.\n\n【30】Some healthcare professionals may also use the term specific developmental disorder of motor function (SDDMF) to refer to DCD.\n删除3：<u>Video: childhood dyspraxia - James' story\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【31】This video is about dyspraxia, a disability that can affect movement and coordination.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:03", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:38:14", "cost": 10.924}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:38:01"}

Less than 1 in 10,000 people have a serious side effect when using fluticasone nasal spray or drops.\n\n【15】Very little medicine is absorbed into the rest of your body, so it's not likely to give you serious side effects.\n\n【16】However, serious side effects are more likely if you use high doses of fluticasone for more than a few months.\n\n【17】Call your doctor or call 111 immediately if you get:\n\n【18】*   problems with your breathing\n*   damage to your nose or sores inside your nose\n*   changes in your eyesight, such as blurred vision or a cloudy lens in the eye – these can be signs of increased pressure in your eyes (glaucoma) or a cataract\n\n【19】If your doctor has prescribed high doses of fluticasone, or you're also taking other steroid medicines or tablets for fungal infections or HIV, you may get symptoms of underactive adrenal glands as a side effect.

Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat.\n6.  Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable.\n\n【21】If you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.\n\n【22】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】*   you have non-allergic rhinitis and the symptoms get worse\n*   you get asthma symptoms or your asthma gets worse\n*   your symptoms are affecting your sleep and everyday life\n*   it's not clear what's causing your symptoms\n*   treatments from a pharmacist are not working\n\n【24】Treatments for non-allergic rhinitis from a GP\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Non-allergic rhinitis often gets better on its own without any treatment.\n\n【26】If needed, a GP may prescribe stronger medicine, such as prescription nasal sprays.\n\n【27】They may also change any medicine you're taking if they think it may be causing your symptoms.\n\n【28】You may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment if it's not clear what's causing your symptoms or they're severe.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:47:30", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:47:45", "cost": 14.81}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:49", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:47:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:47:29"}

This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\n\n【20】Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and talk to you about your options.\n\n【21】In some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\n\n【22】Second cancers\n--------------\n\n【23】Having treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. This is known as a second cancer.\n\n【24】The risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells.\n\n【25】This damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.\n\n【26】You can help reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle through not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\n\n【27】You should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you're invited to.\n\n【28】Other health problems\n---------------------\n\n【29】Treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain conditions at a younger age than normal, such as:\n\n【30】*   heart disease\n*   lung disease\n\n【31】Having a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk of depression.\n\n【32】You should report unexpected symptoms, such as increasing shortness of breath, to your GP.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 June 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 June 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:59", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:48:49", "cost": 110.647}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:48:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:58"}

Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe pain that develops suddenly in the centre of your tummy.**\n\n【3】This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back.\n\n【4】Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:\n\n【5】*   feeling or being sick (vomiting)\n*   indigestion\n*   a high temperature of 38C or more (fever)\n*   yellowing of the whites of the eyes, and yellowing of the skin although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin (jaundice)\n*   tenderness or swelling of the tummy\n*   fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or rapid breathing\n\n【6】Eating or drinking may make you feel worse very quickly, especially if you eat fatty foods.\n\n【7】Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often makes it worse.\n\n【8】Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking an excessive amount of alcohol.\n\n【9】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【10】See a GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe pain in your tummy. If this isn't possible, you can call NHS 111 for advice. You may be admitted to hospital for further tests and treatment.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 May 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Acute pancreatitis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:13:24", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:13:32", "cost": 8.067}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:13:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:13:23"}

About mometasone nasal spray\n--------------------------------\n\n【4】Mometasone nasal (nose) spray is used to treat cold-like symptoms caused by allergic rhinitis. This is inflammation of the inside of the nose that can be brought on by hay fever.\n\n【5】Mometasone is also used to treat other conditions, such as nasal polyps in adults.\n\n【6】Mometasone is a type of medicine known as a steroid (or corticosteroid). Corticosteroids are a copy of a hormone that your body makes naturally. They are not the same as anabolic steroids.\n\n【7】Mometasone nasal spray is available on prescription for adults and children.\n\n【8】Adults can buy it from pharmacies for treating symptoms caused by allergic rhinitis, where it is often sold as Clarinaze.\n\n【9】It also comes as:\n\n【10】*   a cream, ointment or scalp lotion for eczema and psoriasis\n*   an inhaler (puffer) for asthma\n*   skin treatments for eczema and psoriasis\n\n【11】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【12】*   You need to use mometasone nasal spray regularly for it to work.\n*   It works by reducing swelling and irritation in your nose.\n*   The most common side effects are an unpleasant smell and a dry or sore nose or throat.\n*   Under-18s can only use mometasone nasal spray if their doctor prescribes it.\n*   If your doctor has prescribed high doses of mometasone to control your symptoms you may need to carry a steroid emergency card. Ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【13】3\\. Who can and cannot take mometasone nasal spray\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Most adults can use mometasone nasal spray for nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis and hay fever.\n\n【15】Children aged 3 years and over can use mometasone nasal spray for allergic rhinitis and hay fever.\n\n【16】Mometasone is not suitable for some people. **To make sure this nasal spray is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:**\n\n【17】*   are allergic to mometasone or any other medicines\n*   are taking or have recently taken other steroid medicines\n*   have had nose surgery\n*   have an infection in your nose\n*   are pregnant or trying to get pregnant\n*   have ever had TB (tuberculosis)\n*   have ever had glaucoma or cataracts\n\n【18】4\\. How and when to take mometasone nasal spray\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Mometasone nasal spray needs to be used regularly for it to work.\n\n【20】For allergic rhinitis the usual dose is 1 or 2 sprays into each nostril once a day. Do not use more than 2 sprays per nostril in 24 hours.\n\n【21】For nasal polyps the usual dose is 1 or 2 sprays into each nostril once or twice a day. Do not use more than 4 sprays per nostril in 24 hours.\n\n【22】### **How to use it**\n\n【23】Follow the instructions that come with your nasal spray.\n\n【24】If you're using a new bottle, it may not work first time. Pump the spray a few times until a fine mist comes out. You'll also need to do this if the bottle has not been used for a few days.\n\n【25】Gently shake the bottle and remove the cap.\n\n【26】1.  Blow your nose gently, then close one nostril with your finger.\n2.  Bend your head forward slightly and carefully put the nozzle into your other nostril.\n3.  Slowly breathe in through your nose and press down on the widest part of the nozzle to squirt the spray once.\n4.  Breathe out through your mouth.\n5.  Follow steps 3 and 4 again to squirt a second spray into the same nostril, if necessary.\n6.  Remove the nozzle from your nose.\n7.  Repeat the process with the other nostril if you need to.\n\n【27】After using your spray, wipe the nozzle with a clean tissue and replace the cap.\n\n【28】### **Will my dose go up or down?**\n\n【29】You'll be able to use your nasal spray less often once your symptoms are under control.\n\n【30】For example, you might go from using 2 sprays in each nostril once a day, to 1 spray in each nostril once a day.\n\n【31】You may need to increase your dose again if your symptoms get worse after reducing it.\n\n【32】If you have mometasone nasal spray on prescription, your doctor will tell you how often to use the nasal spray and when to change your dose.\n\n【33】### **What if I forget to take it?**\n\n【34】If you forget to take a dose, use it as soon as you remember. Unless it's almost time for your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take your next one as usual.\n\n【35】Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【36】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【37】### **What if I use too much?**\n\n【38】Using too much mometasone nasal spray by accident is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【39】5\\. Side effects of mometasone nasal spray\n------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Like all medicines, mometasone can cause side effects although not everyone gets them.\n\n【41】With mometasone nasal spray, very little medicine is absorbed into the rest of your body, so it's not likely to give you serious side effects.#\n\n【42】If your doctor has prescribed high doses of mometasone, or you’re also taking other steroid medicines or tablets for fungal infections or HIV, you may get underactive adrenal glands as a side effect. Ask your doctor if you need to carry a steroid emergency card.\n\n【43】### **Common side effects**\n\n【44】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【45】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【46】*   headaches\n*   unpleasant taste or smell\n*   sneezing\n*   nosebleeds, dry or sore nose or throat\n\n【47】### **Serious side effects**\n\n【48】Very few people have serious side effects when using mometasone nasal spray.\n\n【49】You are more likely to have a serious side effect if you use high doses of mometasone for more than a few months.\n\n【50】Tell a doctor straight away if you have a serious side effect, including:\n\n【51】*   problems with your breathing\n*   damage to your nose or sores inside your nose\n*   changes in your eyesight, such as blurred vision or a cloudy lens in the eye – these can be signs of increased pressure in your eyes (glaucoma) or a cataract\n\n【52】### **Serious allergic reaction**\n\n【53】It's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to mometasone.\n\n【54】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【55】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【56】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【57】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【58】These are not all the side effects of mometasone. See the leaflet inside your medicine's packet for a full list.\n\n【59】Information:\n\n【60】You can report any suspected side effect to the UK safety scheme.\n\n【61】6\\. How to cope with side effects of mometasone nasal spray\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】**What to do about:**\n\n【63】*   headaches – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller and talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   unpleasant taste or smell – rinsing your mouth out with water or brushing your teeth after you use your nasal spray may help.\n*   sneezing – this will usually settle down as you get used to the medicine.\n*   nosebleeds or dry or sore nose or throat – stop using mometasone for a few days then start again. Speak to your doctor or a pharmacist if these side effects do not go away.\n\n【64】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【65】### **Mometasone and pregnancy**\n\n【66】There's no clear evidence that mometasone will harm your unborn baby. For safety, your doctor will only prescribe mometasone in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. They will prescribe the lowest dose that works for you.\n\n【67】If you're pregnant, speak to your doctor before buying mometasone nasal spray at a pharmacy or supermarket.\n\n【68】### **Mometasone and breastfeeding**\n\n【69】It's generally OK to use mometasone while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【70】However, always check with your doctor first. Your baby may need extra monitoring if you use mometasone nasal spray twice a day for more than a few months.\n\n【71】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【72】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【73】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how using a steroid nasal spray might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet on treating allergic rhinitis on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【74】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【75】Some medicines and mometasone can affect each other. This can increase your chances of side effects, or it may mean changing your mometasone dose.\n\n【76】Check with a pharmacist or your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【77】*   medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or cobicistat\n*   antifungal medicines such as ketoconazole or itraconazole\n*   other medicines that contain steroids such as eczema creams, asthma inhalers, tablets, injections and eyedrops\n\n【78】### **Mixing mometasone with herbal remedies and supplements**\n\n【79】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking mometasone. Ask a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【80】### Important\n\n【81】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【82】9\\. Common questions about mometasone nasal spray\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【83】How does mometasone work?\n\n【84】Mometasone is a steroid (corticosteroid) medicine.\n\n【85】Steroids closely copy the effects of natural hormones produced in your adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are above your kidneys.\n\n【86】Mometasone works on your immune system to reduce the symptoms of inflammatory conditions and allergic reactions, such as redness, swelling and itching.\n\n【87】The nasal spray reduces swelling and mucus in your nose. It can take a little longer to work than antihistamine sprays but the effects last for longer.\n\n【88】If you're using it to treat nasal polyps, mometasone will reduce swelling and reduce the size of the polyps.\n\n【89】How long does it take to work?\n\n【90】You will not notice any immediate improvement in your symptoms when you first start using mometasone nasal spray.\n\n【91】It takes a few days for a steroid nasal spray to start working. It can take several weeks to reach its full effect.\n\n【92】If you use the spray for hay fever it is best to start using it at least a couple of weeks before the hay fever season starts.\n\n【93】Many people notice they get symptoms at about the same time each year.\n\n【94】How long will I use it for?\n\n【95】If you buy mometasone nasal spray from a pharmacy or supermarket, check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. This will tell you how long you can use it for.\n\n【96】You can usually use it for up to 3 months, but tell your doctor if you feel no better after using it for 14 days.\n\n【97】If you are prescribed mometasone, your doctor may advise you to use it for longer.\n\n【98】Is it safe to use mometasone for a long time?\n\n【99】Mometasone is unlikely to have any lasting harmful effects if you follow the instructions that come with your medicine, or use it as recommended by your doctor.\n\n【100】However, children and teenagers need to have their height and weight monitored carefully if they're using high doses of a steroid nasal spray like mometasone for a long time. Taking mometasone for a long time can slow down their normal growth.\n\n【101】The nasal spray delivers a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【102】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【103】If you're using steroid medicines such as mometasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【104】It’s more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【105】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you’re taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【106】### Important\n\n【107】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【108】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【109】Yes, you can drink alcohol with mometasone.\n\n【110】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【111】You can eat and drink normally while you're using mometasone.\n\n【112】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【113】Mometasone does not affect any type of contraception, including the contraceptive pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【114】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【115】There's no clear evidence to suggest that using mometasone will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【116】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you are trying to get pregnant.\n\n【117】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【118】For most people, taking mometasone nasal spray will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【119】*   Allergic rhinitis\n*   Hay fever\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【120】*   HealthUnlocked: mometasone forum\n*   Action Against Allergy: charity\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 July 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 July 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】On this page\n【2】1.

Repeat the process with the other nostril if you need to.\n\n【27】After using your spray, wipe the nozzle with a clean tissue and replace the cap.\n\n【28】### **Will my dose go up or down?**\n\n【29】You'll be able to use your nasal spray less often once your symptoms are under control.\n\n【30】For example, you might go from using 2 sprays in each nostril once a day, to 1 spray in each nostril once a day.\n\n【31】You may need to increase your dose again if your symptoms get worse after reducing it.\n\n【32】If you have mometasone nasal spray on prescription, your doctor will tell you how often to use the nasal spray and when to change your dose.\n\n【33】### **What if I forget to take it?**\n\n【34】If you forget to take a dose, use it as soon as you remember. Unless it's almost time for your next dose, in which case skip the missed dose and take your next one as usual.\n\n【35】Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【36】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【37】### **What if I use too much?**\n\n【38】Using too much mometasone nasal spray by accident is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【39】5\\. Side effects of mometasone nasal spray\n------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Like all medicines, mometasone can cause side effects although not everyone gets them.\n\n【41】With mometasone nasal spray, very little medicine is absorbed into the rest of your body, so it's not likely to give you serious side effects.#\n\n【42】If your doctor has prescribed high doses of mometasone, or you’re also taking other steroid medicines or tablets for fungal infections or HIV, you may get underactive adrenal glands as a side effect. Ask your doctor if you need to carry a steroid emergency card.\n\n【43】### **Common side effects**\n\n【44】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【45】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【46】*   headaches\n*   unpleasant taste or smell\n*   sneezing\n*   nosebleeds, dry or sore nose or throat\n\n【47】### **Serious side effects**\n\n【48】Very few people have serious side effects when using mometasone nasal spray.\n\n【49】You are more likely to have a serious side effect if you use high doses of mometasone for more than a few months.\n\n【50】Tell a doctor straight away if you have a serious side effect, including:\n\n【51】*   problems with your breathing\n*   damage to your nose or sores inside your nose\n*   changes in your eyesight, such as blurred vision or a cloudy lens in the eye – these can be signs of increased pressure in your eyes (glaucoma) or a cataract\n\n【52】### **Serious allergic reaction**\n\n【53】It's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to mometasone.\n\n【54】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【55】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【56】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【57】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【58】These are not all the side effects of mometasone. See the leaflet inside your medicine's packet for a full list.\n\n【59】Information:\n\n【60】You can report any suspected side effect to the UK safety scheme.\n\n【61】6\\. How to cope with side effects of mometasone nasal spray\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】**What to do about:**\n\n【63】*   headaches – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller and talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   unpleasant taste or smell – rinsing your mouth out with water or brushing your teeth after you use your nasal spray may help.\n*   sneezing – this will usually settle down as you get used to the medicine.\n*   nosebleeds or dry or sore nose or throat – stop using mometasone for a few days then start again. Speak to your doctor or a pharmacist if these side effects do not go away.\n\n【64】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【65】### **Mometasone and pregnancy**\n\n【66】There's no clear evidence that mometasone will harm your unborn baby. For safety, your doctor will only prescribe mometasone in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. They will prescribe the lowest dose that works for you.\n\n【67】If you're pregnant, speak to your doctor before buying mometasone nasal spray at a pharmacy or supermarket.\n\n【68】### **Mometasone and breastfeeding**\n\n【69】It's generally OK to use mometasone while you're breastfeeding.\n\n【70】However, always check with your doctor first. Your baby may need extra monitoring if you use mometasone nasal spray twice a day for more than a few months.\n\n【71】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【72】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【73】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how using a steroid nasal spray might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, read this leaflet on treating allergic rhinitis on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.</u>\n\n【74】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【75】Some medicines and mometasone can affect each other. This can increase your chances of side effects, or it may mean changing your mometasone dose.\n\n【76】Check with a pharmacist or your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【77】*   medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or cobicistat\n*   antifungal medicines such as ketoconazole or itraconazole\n*   other medicines that contain steroids such as eczema creams, asthma inhalers, tablets, injections and eyedrops\n\n【78】### **Mixing mometasone with herbal remedies and supplements**\n\n【79】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements while taking mometasone. Ask a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【80】### Important\n\n【81】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal remedies, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【82】9\\. Common questions about mometasone nasal spray\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【83】How does mometasone work?\n\n【84】Mometasone is a steroid (corticosteroid) medicine.\n\n【85】Steroids closely copy the effects of natural hormones produced in your adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are above your kidneys.\n\n【86】Mometasone works on your immune system to reduce the symptoms of inflammatory conditions and allergic reactions, such as redness, swelling and itching.\n\n【87】The nasal spray reduces swelling and mucus in your nose. It can take a little longer to work than antihistamine sprays but the effects last for longer.\n\n【88】If you're using it to treat nasal polyps, mometasone will reduce swelling and reduce the size of the polyps.\n\n【89】How long does it take to work?\n\n【90】You will not notice any immediate improvement in your symptoms when you first start using mometasone nasal spray.\n\n【91】It takes a few days for a steroid nasal spray to start working. It can take several weeks to reach its full effect.\n\n【92】If you use the spray for hay fever it is best to start using it at least a couple of weeks before the hay fever season starts.\n\n【93】Many people notice they get symptoms at about the same time each year.\n\n【94】How long will I use it for?\n\n【95】If you buy mometasone nasal spray from a pharmacy or supermarket, check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. This will tell you how long you can use it for.\n\n【96】You can usually use it for up to 3 months, but tell your doctor if you feel no better after using it for 14 days.\n\n【97】If you are prescribed mometasone, your doctor may advise you to use it for longer.\n\n【98】Is it safe to use mometasone for a long time?\n\n【99】Mometasone is unlikely to have any lasting harmful effects if you follow the instructions that come with your medicine, or use it as recommended by your doctor.\n\n【100】However, children and teenagers need to have their height and weight monitored carefully if they're using high doses of a steroid nasal spray like mometasone for a long time. Taking mometasone for a long time can slow down their normal growth.\n\n【101】The nasal spray delivers a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【102】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【103】If you're using steroid medicines such as mometasone, your adrenal glands may not make as much of some of the hormones your body needs such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【104】It’s more likely to happen if you take high doses for a long time (especially tablets and injections) or if you regularly use different kinds of steroids at the same time (such as a steroid nasal spray and a steroid inhaler).\n\n【105】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you’re taking, and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n删除7：<u>The Addison's Disease Self-Help Group (ADSHG) website has more information about the NHS steroid emergency card.</u>\n\n【106】### Important\n\n【107】If you need any medical or dental treatment, or are having surgery or an invasive procedure, show your steroid emergency card to your doctor or dentist. This is important so they know you're having steroid treatment and can give you extra steroids as needed.\n\n【108】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【109】Yes, you can drink alcohol with mometasone.\n\n【110】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【111】You can eat and drink normally while you're using mometasone.\n\n【112】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【113】Mometasone does not affect any type of contraception, including the contraceptive pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【114】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【115】There's no clear evidence to suggest that using mometasone will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\n【116】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you are trying to get pregnant.\n\n【117】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【118】For most people, taking mometasone nasal spray will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【119】*   Allergic rhinitis\n*   Hay fever\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【120】*   HealthUnlocked: mometasone forum\n*   Action Against Allergy: charity\n*   Allergy UK: charity\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 July 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 July 2023</u>", "index": 120, "show": true, "start": 120, "end": 511, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:34:44", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:35:39", "cost": 54.677}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:35:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:34:43"}

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Most cases of kyphosis don't require treatment.**\n\n【3】Kyphosis caused by poor posture (postural kyphosis) can usually be corrected by improving your posture.\n\n【4】If a child has kyphosis as a result of abnormally shaped vertebrae (Scheuermann's kyphosis), treatment depends on factors such as:\n\n【5】*   the person's age\n*   their sex\n*   the severity of the curve\n*   how flexible the curve is\n\n【6】The condition usually stops progressing once a child is older and has stopped growing.\n\n【7】Surgery is often required for children born with congenital kyphosis.\n\n【8】Mild kyphosis\n-------------\n\n【9】If you have mild to moderate kyphosis, it may be possible to control your symptoms using painkillers and exercise.\n\n【10】### Painkillers and exercise\n\n【11】Over-the-counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, can help relieve any back pain.\n\n【12】Regular exercise and a course of physiotherapy may be recommended to help strengthen the muscles in your back.\n\n【13】Back pain can also be helped by maintaining a healthy weight and activities which strengthen core muscles. For example, yoga, pilates or some martial arts.\n\n【14】### Bracing\n\n【15】Teenagers with mild to moderate kyphosis may need to wear a back brace. The brace is worn while the bones are still growing and prevents the curve getting worse.\n\n【16】Wearing a brace may feel restrictive at first. However, most people get used to them after a while. Modern braces are designed to be convenient, so it should still be possible to take part in a wide range of physical activities.\n\n【17】You'll need to wear the brace until the spine stops growing, which is usually around 14 or 15 years old.\n\n【18】Bracing isn't usually recommended for adults who have stopped growing because it won't correct the position of the spine.\n\n【19】Surgery\n-------\n\n【20】Surgery can usually correct the appearance of the back and may help to relieve pain but it carries quite a high risk of complications. \n\n【21】Surgery is only recommended for more severe cases of kyphosis, where it's felt the potential benefits of surgery outweigh the risks.\n\n【22】Surgery for kyphosis would usually be recommended if:\n\n【23】*   the curve of your spine is very pronounced\n*   the curve is causing persistent pain that can't be controlled with medication\n*   the curve is disrupting your body's other important functions, such as breathing and the nervous system\n*   without surgery it's likely that the structure of your spine would deteriorate further\n\n【24】A technique called spinal fusion is usually used to treat kyphosis. It involves joining together the vertebrae responsible for the curve of the spine.\n\n【25】During the operation, an incision is made in your back. The curve in your spine is straightened using metal rods, screws and hooks, and your spine is fused into place using bone grafts. Bone grafts usually use donated bone but it may taken from another place in your body, such as the pelvis.\n\n【26】The procedure takes 4 to 8 hours and is carried out under general anaesthetic.\n\n【27】You may need to stay in hospital for up to a week after the operation, and you may have to wear a back brace to support your spine while it heals.\n\n【28】You should be able to return to school, college or work after 4 to 6 weeks, and be able to play sports about a year after surgery.\n\n【29】### Complications\n\n【30】Complications of spinal fusion surgery can include:\n\n【31】*   infection after the operation\n*   excessive bleeding at the site of the surgery\n*   accidental damage to the nerves that run through the spine, which could result in a paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel function\n\n【32】Before deciding whether to have spinal surgery, you should discuss the benefits and risks with the doctor in charge of your care.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 May 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:45:46", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:05", "cost": 19.051}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:45:46"}

About propranolol\n2.  Key facts\n3.  Who can and cannot take propranolol\n4.  How and when to take propranolol\n5.  Side effects\n6.  How to cope with side effects of propranolol\n7.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about propranolol\n\n【3】1\\. About propranolol\n---------------------\n\n【4】Propranolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta blockers. It's used to treat heart problems, help with some of the symptoms of anxiety and prevent migraines.\n\n【5】If you have a heart problem, you can take propranolol to:\n\n【6】*   treat high blood pressure\n*   treat conditions that cause an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), like atrial fibrillation\n*   help prevent future heart disease, heart attacks and strokes\n*   help prevent chest pain caused by angina\n\n【7】Propranolol can help reduce your symptoms if you have too much thyroid hormone in your body (thyrotoxicosis). You'll usually take it together with medicines to treat an overactive thyroid.\n\n【8】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets, slow release capsules, or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Propranolol slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n*   It's usually prescribed for high blood pressure and other heart problems, but it can also help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, like sweating and shaking.\n*   Your very first dose of propranolol may make you feel dizzy, so take it at bedtime. After that, if you do not feel dizzy, you can take it in the morning.\n*   The main side effects of propranolol are feeling dizzy or tired, cold hands or feet, difficulties sleeping and nightmares. These side effects are usually mild and short-lived.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take propranolol\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Most adults and children aged 12 and over can take propranolol. But it is not officially approved for treating high blood pressure in children under 12 years old.\n\n【13】Propranolol is not suitable for everyone. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor before starting to take propranolol if you:\n\n【14】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to propranolol or any other medicine\n*   have low blood pressure or a slow heart rate\n*   have heart failure which is getting worse\n*   have ever had depression or had thoughts about harming yourself\n*   have diabetes\n*   have liver or kidney problems\n*   have severe blood circulation problems in your limbs (such as Raynaud's phenomenon), which may make your fingers and toes tingle or turn paler than usual or blue\n*   have metabolic acidosis, when there is too much acid in your blood\n*   have lung disease or asthma\n*   are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take propranolol\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Propranolol comes as 2 different types of medicine:\n\n【17】*   standard release – this releases propranolol into your body quickly, so you may need to take it several times a day depending on your dose\n*   slow release – this releases the medicine slowly so you do not have to take it as often, once a day is usually enough\n\n【18】If you are taking it once a day, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose before bedtime, because it can make you feel dizzy. After the first dose, if you do not feel dizzy, take propranolol in the morning.\n\n【19】### Important\n\n【20】Keep taking propranolol even if you feel well. You will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.\n\n【21】### Dosage and strength\n\n【22】Propranolol tablets come in strengths of 10mg, 40mg, 80mg or 160mg. The slow release capsules are 80mg or 160mg. The liquid comes in strengths of 5mg, 10mg, 40mg or 50mg in 5ml.\n\n【23】How much you take depends on why you need propranolol.\n\n【24】The usual doses for adults are:\n\n【25】*   **high blood pressure** – the starting dose is usually 80mg, taken twice a day. If this dose is not working well enough to reduce your blood pressure, your doctor may increase it to a maximum of 160mg twice a day\n*   **migraine or angina (chest pain)** – 40mg, taken 2 or 3 times a day. This can be increased to 120mg to 240mg a day. Your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to split the dose over the day\n*   **irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)** – 10mg to 40mg, taken 3 or 4 times a day\n*   **anxiety** – 40mg taken once a day which can be increased to 40mg taken 3 times a day\n*   **too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)** – 10mg to 40mg, taken 3 or 4 times a day\n\n【26】Doses are usually lower for people aged over 65 or people with a kidney or liver problem.\n\n【27】If your child needs propranolol, your doctor will usually use your child's weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【28】### How to take it\n\n【29】Propranolol does not usually upset your stomach so you can take it with or without food. It's best to do the same each day.\n\n【30】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find the tablets difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.\n\n【31】If you're taking capsules, swallow them whole with a drink of water. Do not break, chew or crush them.\n\n【32】If you're taking propranolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.\n\n【33】### If you forget to take it\n\n【34】If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【35】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【36】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【37】### If you take too much\n\n【38】An overdose of propranolol can be very serious. It can significantly slow your heart rate, cause dizziness, trembling and seizures or fits, and make it difficult to breathe.\n\n【39】The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【40】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【41】*   you take more than your prescribed dose of propranolol\n\n【42】Call 111 or go to 111 online\n\n【43】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【44】Take the propranolol packet or leaflet inside it plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【45】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【46】You take more than your prescribed dose of propranolol and you:\n\n【47】*   have a slow heart rate\n*   have breathing problems\n*   feel dizzy or shaky\n*   have a seizure or fit\n\n【48】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【49】Like all medicines, propranolol can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.\n\n【50】Side effects often improve as your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【51】### Common side effects\n\n【52】These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and short-lived.\n\n【53】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if the side effects bother you or last more than a few days:\n\n【54】*   headaches\n*   feeling tired, dizzy or weak\n*   cold fingers or toes\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), or diarrhoea\n*   stomach pain\n\n【55】### Serious side effects\n\n【56】It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking propranolol.\n\n【57】Tell a doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【58】*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, your skin turns yellow although this may be less obvious on brown on black skin, or you have pale poo or dark pee – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you get nosebleeds that last for more than 10 minutes, unexplained bruising, or you bruise more easily than usual – these can be signs of low numbers of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)\n\n【59】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:\n\n【60】*   you have shortness of breath with a cough which gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat – these are signs of heart problems\n*   you have shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest – these can be signs of lung problems\n\n【61】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【62】In rare cases, propranolol may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【63】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【64】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【65】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【66】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【67】These are not all the side effects of propranolol. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【68】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【69】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【70】6\\. How to cope with side effects of propranolol\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】**What to do about**:\n\n【72】*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired, dizzy or weak** – as your body gets used to propranolol, these side effects should wear off. If propranolol makes you feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better. It's best not to drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse. Do not drive or ride a bike until you feel better.\n*   **cold fingers or toes** – put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine in, as this can make your blood vessels narrower and further restrict blood flow to your hands and feet. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Do not wear tight watches or bracelets.\n*   **feeling or being sick or diarrhoea** – stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your propranolol after a meal or snack. Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea and vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor. If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick or have severe diarrhoea, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n*   **stomach pain** – try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your tummy may also help. If you are in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【73】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【74】### Propranolol and pregnancy\n\n【75】Propranolol is not thought to be harmful during pregnancy, but it may affect your baby's growth in later pregnancy. Discuss taking propranolol with your doctor or midwife as you may need extra scans to check your baby's growth.\n\n【76】If you're trying to get pregnant or you're already pregnant, talk to your doctor about the benefits and possible harms of taking propranolol. There may be other medicines that are better to use during pregnancy.\n\n【77】### Propranolol and breastfeeding\n\n【78】If your doctor or health visitor says that your baby is healthy, it's OK to take propranolol while breastfeeding.\n\n【79】Propranolol passes into breast milk in tiny amounts. It has not been known to cause any side effects in breastfed babies.\n\n【80】It's important to treat your high blood pressure to keep you well. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【81】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, then talk to your doctor or health visitor.\n\n【82】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【83】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【84】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how propranolol can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, visit the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【85】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【86】There are some medicines that may affect the way propranolol works.\n\n【87】Tell your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【88】*   other medicines for high blood pressure. The combination with propranolol can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. This may make you feel dizzy or faint. If this keeps happening to you, your doctor may change your dose\n*   other medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainide\n*   other medicines which can lower your blood pressure. These include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an enlarged prostate gland like tamsulosin, or Parkinson's disease medicines such as levodopa\n*   asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medicines\n*   diabetes medicines, particularly insulin – propranolol may make it more difficult to recognise the warning signs of low blood sugar. Speak to your doctor if you have low blood sugar levels without getting any of the usual warning signs. Check your blood sugar after exercise, and follow usual advice about checking it before driving, cycling or operating machinery\n*   medicines to treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)\n*   medicines for allergies, such as ephedrine, noradrenaline or adrenaline\n*   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen. These medicines may increase your blood pressure, so it's best to keep them to a minimum\n\n【89】### Mixing propranolol with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【90】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with propranolol. They are not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines.\n\n【91】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【92】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【93】9\\. Common questions about propranolol\n--------------------------------------\n\n【94】How does propranolol work?\n\n【95】Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker.\n\n【96】Like other beta blockers, propranolol works by changing the way your body responds to some nerve impulses, including in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【97】It works differently if you're using it for anxiety. When you are anxious, your brain makes chemical messengers called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These make your heart rate faster and make you sweat or shake. Propranolol helps block the effects of these chemical messengers. This reduces the physical signs of anxiety.\n\n【98】It's not fully understood how propranolol prevents migraines. It may work by relaxing the blood vessels involved, or by reducing activity in the visual cortex. This is the part of the brain where migraines are believed to start.\n\n【99】How long does propranolol take to work?\n\n【100】Propranolol usually starts to work in a few hours.\n\n【101】For heart conditions or high blood pressure, propranolol can take up to a week to reach its full effect. You may not feel any different but that does not mean it is not working. It's important to keep taking your medicine.\n\n【102】For migraines, it can take several weeks for propranolol to start making a real difference, so keep taking it.\n\n【103】How long will I take it for?\n\n【104】This depends on why you're taking propranolol.\n\n【105】For heart conditions or high blood pressure, treatment is usually long term and may be for the rest of your life.\n\n【106】For anxiety, you'll usually take propranolol for a short amount of time, to help with your physical symptoms. Speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking it for more than a few months. This will depend on your symptoms, whether it's a one-off or a recurring problem, how well propranolol works for you and whether you get side effects.\n\n【107】For migraines, treatment can last for several months or years, depending on how bad your symptoms are.\n\n【108】Can I take propranolol for a long time?\n\n【109】Propranolol is generally safe to take for a long time.\n\n【110】If you're taking it for a heart condition, or to prevent migraines, it works best when you take it long term.\n\n【111】If you're taking it for anxiety, there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects if you take it for several months or years. But it's best to take propranolol only for as long as you need it.\n\n【112】You'll need to have your blood pressure checked regularly if you're taking propranolol for a long time for migraines or anxiety.\n\n【113】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【114】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking propranolol. If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine instead.\n\n【115】Stopping propranolol suddenly may make your health problem worse. In addition, if you stop suddenly after taking it for a long time, you may get extra side effects as a reaction to stopping it. These include an irregular heart rate, sweating and shaking.\n\n【116】If you stop taking propranolol, it will take about 1 to 2 days for it to be completely out of your body but the side effects can last for up to 1 week.\n\n【117】How does propranolol compare with other heart medicines?\n\n【118】Propranolol works as well as other beta blockers for reducing blood pressure. The main difference between propranolol and other beta blockers is that it does not just affect your heart. It can affect other parts of your body too, such as your lungs.\n\n【119】There are lots of other medicines to lower your blood pressure and treat chest pain. They work in a different way to beta blockers and include:\n\n【120】*   ACE inhibitors like ramipril and lisinopril\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers like candesartan\n*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) like furosemide\n\n【121】Beta blockers are not usually the first choice for high blood pressure. The medicine your doctor prescribes depends on your age and ethnicity.\n\n【122】If you're under 55 and not of African Caribbean or black African origin, you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.\n\n【123】If you're 55 or older, or you're any age and of African Caribbean or black African origin, you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker.\n\n【124】Sometimes you may have to try other blood pressure-lowering medicines if you get side effects. Many people need to take a combination of different medicines to lower their blood pressure.\n\n【125】How does it compare with other medicines for preventing migraine?\n\n【126】Atenolol, metoprolol, timolol and nadolol are all beta blockers and they work well in preventing migraines. However, most doctors prescribe propranolol.\n\n【127】There are some other medicines that are known to prevent migraines but they are not officially approved in the UK. They include amitriptyline, sodium valproate and gabapentin and they may have different side effects.\n\n【128】Topiramate can also be used to prevent migraines. It works just as well as propranolol. However, topiramate has not been officially approved for migraine for children under the age of 16.\n\n【129】Ask your doctor or pharmacist which medicine is best for you.\n\n【130】How does it compare with other medicines for anxiety?\n\n【131】Propranolol treats the physical symptoms of anxiety – for example, it stops your heart beating too fast. You'll usually only take propranolol for a short time.\n\n【132】The physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant like sertraline to treat these imbalances. You usually take antidepressants long term.\n\n【133】Many doctors prefer medicine-free treatments for anxiety. These include talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy. If you're having talking therapy, your doctor may prescribe propranolol at the same time. This will help you with your physical symptoms.\n\n【134】Will I need to stop taking propranolol before surgery?\n\n【135】Tell your doctor that you're taking propranolol if you're going to be put to sleep using general anaesthetic, or you're having any kind of major operation.\n\n【136】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking propranolol before surgery. This is because propranolol can lower your blood pressure too much when it's combined with some anaesthetics.\n\n【137】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【138】Drinking alcohol can increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of propranolol, which can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n【139】During the first few days of taking propranolol or after an increase in your dose, it's best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【140】If you find propranolol makes you feel dizzy it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【141】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【142】Apart from being careful with alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while taking propranolol.\n\n【143】Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help if you have high blood pressure or another heart condition.\n\n【144】Will it make me put on weight?\n\n【145】Some people on propranolol say they put on weight, especially in the first few months of taking it. This is not known to be a common side effect of taking propranolol, and there is not enough information to say for sure why some people put on weight.\n\n【146】It could, for example, be because propranolol can make you feel tired which could make you less active. It could also affect the way your body uses energy.\n\n【147】If you're worried about putting on weight with propranolol, speak to your doctor.\n\n【148】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【149】Propranolol will not stop your contraception working.\n\n【150】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, like the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you're taking propranolol or other medicines for high blood pressure. This is because some hormonal contraceptives can raise your blood pressure and stop propranolol working properly.\n\n【151】Talk to your doctor if you're taking a hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【152】If propranolol makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【153】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【154】There is no evidence that propranolol affects fertility in men or women.\n\n【155】If you're trying to get pregnant, or you're having problems getting pregnant while on propranolol, speak to your doctor.\n\n【156】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【157】Some people on propranolol say their sex drive goes down and some men find they cannot get an erection. However, this is not a common side effect and there is not enough evidence to say for sure that propranolol is causing it.\n\n【158】If you're having problems with your sex life, talk to your doctor.\n\n【159】Do I need to avoid playing sports?\n\n【160】You do not need to stop playing sports if you take propranolol. But do not push yourself too much.\n\n【161】Regular exercise is good for you because it lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\n\n【162】Be aware, though, that in some sports propranolol is not allowed if you're competing at a high level.\n\n【163】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【164】Propranolol can make some people feel dizzy, especially when they first start taking it or after taking a bigger dose. If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery.\n\n【165】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking propranolol. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【166】Can lifestyle changes help?\n\n【167】If you have heart problems, you can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These changes will also help if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【168】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid second-hand smoke too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking alcohol while you're taking propranolol can make you feel dizzy or light headed. Also drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and makes heart failure worse. It's best to keep to the recommended limit of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day will help.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n\n【169】If you get severe headaches, there are steps you can take to help prevent migraines. This includes working out what things trigger an attack so you can avoid them.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【170】*   Angina\n*   Anxiety, fear and panic\n*   Arrhythmia\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart failure\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【171】*   HealthUnlocked: propranolol forum\n*   Anxiety UK: charity\n*   Blood Pressure UK: charity\n*   Migraine Trust: charity\n*   Healthtalk: videos of real stories of heart attacks\n*   NHS Health Check: free health check-up\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 November 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "删除7：Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you’re unsure whether it’s safe for you to drive while taking propranolol.", "content": "【0】Propranolol \\- Brand names: Bedranol, Beta-prograne, Half Beta-prograne\n=======================================================================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about propranolol\n\n【3】1\\. About propranolol\n---------------------\n\n【4】Propranolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta blockers. It's used to treat heart problems, help with some of the symptoms of anxiety and prevent migraines.\n\n【5】If you have a heart problem, you can take propranolol to:\n\n【6】*   treat high blood pressure\n*   treat conditions that cause an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), like atrial fibrillation\n*   help prevent future heart disease, heart attacks and strokes\n*   help prevent chest pain caused by angina\n\n【7】Propranolol can help reduce your symptoms if you have too much thyroid hormone in your body (thyrotoxicosis). You'll usually take it together with medicines to treat an overactive thyroid.\n\n【8】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets, slow release capsules, or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【9】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【10】*   Propranolol slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n*   It's usually prescribed for high blood pressure and other heart problems, but it can also help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, like sweating and shaking.\n*   Your very first dose of propranolol may make you feel dizzy, so take it at bedtime. After that, if you do not feel dizzy, you can take it in the morning.\n*   The main side effects of propranolol are feeling dizzy or tired, cold hands or feet, difficulties sleeping and nightmares. These side effects are usually mild and short-lived.\n\n【11】3\\. Who can and cannot take propranolol\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Most adults and children aged 12 and over can take propranolol. But it is not officially approved for treating high blood pressure in children under 12 years old.\n\n【13】Propranolol is not suitable for everyone. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor before starting to take propranolol if you:\n\n【14】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to propranolol or any other medicine\n*   have low blood pressure or a slow heart rate\n*   have heart failure which is getting worse\n*   have ever had depression or had thoughts about harming yourself\n*   have diabetes\n*   have liver or kidney problems\n*   have severe blood circulation problems in your limbs (such as Raynaud's phenomenon), which may make your fingers and toes tingle or turn paler than usual or blue\n*   have metabolic acidosis, when there is too much acid in your blood\n*   have lung disease or asthma\n*   are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding\n\n【15】4\\. How and when to take propranolol\n------------------------------------\n\n【16】Propranolol comes as 2 different types of medicine:\n\n【17】*   standard release – this releases propranolol into your body quickly, so you may need to take it several times a day depending on your dose\n*   slow release – this releases the medicine slowly so you do not have to take it as often, once a day is usually enough\n\n【18】If you are taking it once a day, your doctor may advise you to take your first dose before bedtime, because it can make you feel dizzy. After the first dose, if you do not feel dizzy, take propranolol in the morning.\n\n【19】### Important\n\n【20】Keep taking propranolol even if you feel well. You will still be getting the benefits of the medicine.\n\n【21】### Dosage and strength\n\n【22】Propranolol tablets come in strengths of 10mg, 40mg, 80mg or 160mg. The slow release capsules are 80mg or 160mg. The liquid comes in strengths of 5mg, 10mg, 40mg or 50mg in 5ml.\n\n【23】How much you take depends on why you need propranolol.\n\n【24】The usual doses for adults are:\n\n【25】*   **high blood pressure** – the starting dose is usually 80mg, taken twice a day. If this dose is not working well enough to reduce your blood pressure, your doctor may increase it to a maximum of 160mg twice a day\n*   **migraine or angina (chest pain)** – 40mg, taken 2 or 3 times a day. This can be increased to 120mg to 240mg a day. Your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to split the dose over the day\n*   **irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)** – 10mg to 40mg, taken 3 or 4 times a day\n*   **anxiety** – 40mg taken once a day which can be increased to 40mg taken 3 times a day\n*   **too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)** – 10mg to 40mg, taken 3 or 4 times a day\n\n【26】Doses are usually lower for people aged over 65 or people with a kidney or liver problem.\n\n【27】If your child needs propranolol, your doctor will usually use your child's weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【28】### How to take it\n\n【29】Propranolol does not usually upset your stomach so you can take it with or without food. It's best to do the same each day.\n\n【30】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find the tablets difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.\n\n【31】If you're taking capsules, swallow them whole with a drink of water. Do not break, chew or crush them.\n\n【32】If you're taking propranolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.\n\n【33】### If you forget to take it\n\n【34】If you forget to take a dose of propranolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just leave out the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【35】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【36】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【37】### If you take too much\n\n【38】An overdose of propranolol can be very serious. It can significantly slow your heart rate, cause dizziness, trembling and seizures or fits, and make it difficult to breathe.\n\n【39】The amount of propranolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.\n\n【40】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【41】*   you take more than your prescribed dose of propranolol\n\n【42】Call 111 or go to 111 online\n\n【43】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【44】Take the propranolol packet or leaflet inside it plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【45】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【46】You take more than your prescribed dose of propranolol and you:\n\n【47】*   have a slow heart rate\n*   have breathing problems\n*   feel dizzy or shaky\n*   have a seizure or fit\n\n【48】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【49】Like all medicines, propranolol can cause side effects in some people, but many people have no side effects or only minor ones.\n\n【50】Side effects often improve as your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【51】### Common side effects\n\n【52】These common side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and short-lived.\n\n【53】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if the side effects bother you or last more than a few days:\n\n【54】*   headaches\n*   feeling tired, dizzy or weak\n*   cold fingers or toes\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting), or diarrhoea\n*   stomach pain\n\n【55】### Serious side effects\n\n【56】It happens rarely, but some people have serious side effects when taking propranolol.\n\n【57】Tell a doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【58】*   the whites of your eyes turn yellow, your skin turns yellow although this may be less obvious on brown on black skin, or you have pale poo or dark pee – these can be signs of liver problems\n*   you get nosebleeds that last for more than 10 minutes, unexplained bruising, or you bruise more easily than usual – these can be signs of low numbers of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)\n\n【59】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:\n\n【60】*   you have shortness of breath with a cough which gets worse when you exercise (like walking up stairs), swollen ankles or legs, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat – these are signs of heart problems\n*   you have shortness of breath, wheezing and tightening of your chest – these can be signs of lung problems\n\n【61】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【62】In rare cases, propranolol may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【63】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【64】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale (if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【65】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【66】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【67】These are not all the side effects of propranolol. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【68】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【69】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【70】6\\. How to cope with side effects of propranolol\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】**What to do about**:\n\n【72】*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **feeling tired, dizzy or weak** – as your body gets used to propranolol, these side effects should wear off. If propranolol makes you feel dizzy, sit or lie down until you feel better. It's best not to drink alcohol as it will make you feel worse. Do not drive or ride a bike until you feel better.\n*   **cold fingers or toes** – put your hands or feet under warm running water, massage them and wiggle your fingers and toes. Do not smoke or have drinks with caffeine in, as this can make your blood vessels narrower and further restrict blood flow to your hands and feet. Try wearing mittens (they're warmer than gloves) and warm socks. Do not wear tight watches or bracelets.\n*   **feeling or being sick or diarrhoea** – stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. It might help to take your propranolol after a meal or snack. Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea and vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor. If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick or have severe diarrhoea, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n*   **stomach pain** – try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Putting a heat pad or covered hot water bottle on your tummy may also help. If you are in a lot of pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【73】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【74】### Propranolol and pregnancy\n\n【75】Propranolol is not thought to be harmful during pregnancy, but it may affect your baby's growth in later pregnancy. Discuss taking propranolol with your doctor or midwife as you may need extra scans to check your baby's growth.\n\n【76】If you're trying to get pregnant or you're already pregnant, talk to your doctor about the benefits and possible harms of taking propranolol. There may be other medicines that are better to use during pregnancy.\n\n【77】### Propranolol and breastfeeding\n\n【78】If your doctor or health visitor says that your baby is healthy, it's OK to take propranolol while breastfeeding.\n\n【79】Propranolol passes into breast milk in tiny amounts. It has not been known to cause any side effects in breastfed babies.\n\n【80】It's important to treat your high blood pressure to keep you well. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【81】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or seems unusually sleepy, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, then talk to your doctor or health visitor.\n\n【82】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【83】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【84】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information about how propranolol can affect you and your baby during pregnancy, visit the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website.</u>\n\n【85】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【86】There are some medicines that may affect the way propranolol works.\n\n【87】Tell your doctor if you're taking:\n\n【88】*   other medicines for high blood pressure. The combination with propranolol can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. This may make you feel dizzy or faint. If this keeps happening to you, your doctor may change your dose\n*   other medicines for an irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone or flecainide\n*   other medicines which can lower your blood pressure. These include some antidepressants, nitrates (for chest pain), baclofen (a muscle relaxant), medicines for an enlarged prostate gland like tamsulosin, or Parkinson's disease medicines such as levodopa\n*   asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medicines\n*   diabetes medicines, particularly insulin – propranolol may make it more difficult to recognise the warning signs of low blood sugar. Speak to your doctor if you have low blood sugar levels without getting any of the usual warning signs. Check your blood sugar after exercise, and follow usual advice about checking it before driving, cycling or operating machinery\n*   medicines to treat nose or sinus congestion, or other cold remedies (including those you can buy in the pharmacy)\n*   medicines for allergies, such as ephedrine, noradrenaline or adrenaline\n*   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen. These medicines may increase your blood pressure, so it's best to keep them to a minimum\n\n【89】### Mixing propranolol with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【90】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with propranolol. They are not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines.\n\n【91】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【92】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【93】9\\. Common questions about propranolol\n--------------------------------------\n\n【94】How does propranolol work?\n\n【95】Propranolol is a type of medicine called a beta blocker.\n\n【96】Like other beta blockers, propranolol works by changing the way your body responds to some nerve impulses, including in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【97】It works differently if you're using it for anxiety. When you are anxious, your brain makes chemical messengers called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These make your heart rate faster and make you sweat or shake. Propranolol helps block the effects of these chemical messengers. This reduces the physical signs of anxiety.\n\n【98】It's not fully understood how propranolol prevents migraines. It may work by relaxing the blood vessels involved, or by reducing activity in the visual cortex. This is the part of the brain where migraines are believed to start.\n\n【99】How long does propranolol take to work?\n\n【100】Propranolol usually starts to work in a few hours.\n\n【101】For heart conditions or high blood pressure, propranolol can take up to a week to reach its full effect. You may not feel any different but that does not mean it is not working. It's important to keep taking your medicine.\n\n【102】For migraines, it can take several weeks for propranolol to start making a real difference, so keep taking it.\n\n【103】How long will I take it for?\n\n【104】This depends on why you're taking propranolol.\n\n【105】For heart conditions or high blood pressure, treatment is usually long term and may be for the rest of your life.\n\n【106】For anxiety, you'll usually take propranolol for a short amount of time, to help with your physical symptoms. Speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking it for more than a few months. This will depend on your symptoms, whether it's a one-off or a recurring problem, how well propranolol works for you and whether you get side effects.\n\n【107】For migraines, treatment can last for several months or years, depending on how bad your symptoms are.\n\n【108】Can I take propranolol for a long time?\n\n【109】Propranolol is generally safe to take for a long time.\n\n【110】If you're taking it for a heart condition, or to prevent migraines, it works best when you take it long term.\n\n【111】If you're taking it for anxiety, there do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects if you take it for several months or years. But it's best to take propranolol only for as long as you need it.\n\n【112】You'll need to have your blood pressure checked regularly if you're taking propranolol for a long time for migraines or anxiety.\n\n【113】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【114】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking propranolol. If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine instead.\n\n【115】Stopping propranolol suddenly may make your health problem worse. In addition, if you stop suddenly after taking it for a long time, you may get extra side effects as a reaction to stopping it. These include an irregular heart rate, sweating and shaking.\n\n【116】If you stop taking propranolol, it will take about 1 to 2 days for it to be completely out of your body but the side effects can last for up to 1 week.\n\n【117】How does propranolol compare with other heart medicines?\n\n【118】Propranolol works as well as other beta blockers for reducing blood pressure. The main difference between propranolol and other beta blockers is that it does not just affect your heart. It can affect other parts of your body too, such as your lungs.\n\n【119】There are lots of other medicines to lower your blood pressure and treat chest pain. They work in a different way to beta blockers and include:\n\n【120】*   ACE inhibitors like ramipril and lisinopril\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers like candesartan\n*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) like furosemide\n\n【121】Beta blockers are not usually the first choice for high blood pressure. The medicine your doctor prescribes depends on your age and ethnicity.\n\n【122】If you're under 55 and not of African Caribbean or black African origin, you'll usually be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.\n\n【123】If you're 55 or older, or you're any age and of African Caribbean or black African origin, you'll usually be offered a calcium channel blocker.\n\n【124】Sometimes you may have to try other blood pressure-lowering medicines if you get side effects. Many people need to take a combination of different medicines to lower their blood pressure.\n\n【125】How does it compare with other medicines for preventing migraine?\n\n【126】Atenolol, metoprolol, timolol and nadolol are all beta blockers and they work well in preventing migraines. However, most doctors prescribe propranolol.\n\n【127】There are some other medicines that are known to prevent migraines but they are not officially approved in the UK. They include amitriptyline, sodium valproate and gabapentin and they may have different side effects.\n\n【128】Topiramate can also be used to prevent migraines. It works just as well as propranolol. However, topiramate has not been officially approved for migraine for children under the age of 16.\n\n【129】Ask your doctor or pharmacist which medicine is best for you.\n\n【130】How does it compare with other medicines for anxiety?\n\n【131】Propranolol treats the physical symptoms of anxiety – for example, it stops your heart beating too fast. You'll usually only take propranolol for a short time.\n\n【132】The physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant like sertraline to treat these imbalances. You usually take antidepressants long term.\n\n【133】Many doctors prefer medicine-free treatments for anxiety. These include talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy. If you're having talking therapy, your doctor may prescribe propranolol at the same time. This will help you with your physical symptoms.\n\n【134】Will I need to stop taking propranolol before surgery?\n\n【135】Tell your doctor that you're taking propranolol if you're going to be put to sleep using general anaesthetic, or you're having any kind of major operation.\n\n【136】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking propranolol before surgery. This is because propranolol can lower your blood pressure too much when it's combined with some anaesthetics.\n\n【137】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【138】Drinking alcohol can increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of propranolol, which can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n【139】During the first few days of taking propranolol or after an increase in your dose, it's best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【140】If you find propranolol makes you feel dizzy it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【141】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【142】Apart from being careful with alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while taking propranolol.\n\n【143】Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help if you have high blood pressure or another heart condition.\n\n【144】Will it make me put on weight?\n\n【145】Some people on propranolol say they put on weight, especially in the first few months of taking it. This is not known to be a common side effect of taking propranolol, and there is not enough information to say for sure why some people put on weight.\n\n【146】It could, for example, be because propranolol can make you feel tired which could make you less active. It could also affect the way your body uses energy.\n\n【147】If you're worried about putting on weight with propranolol, speak to your doctor.\n\n【148】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【149】Propranolol will not stop your contraception working.\n\n【150】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, like the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you're taking propranolol or other medicines for high blood pressure. This is because some hormonal contraceptives can raise your blood pressure and stop propranolol working properly.\n\n【151】Talk to your doctor if you're taking a hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【152】If propranolol makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【153】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【154】There is no evidence that propranolol affects fertility in men or women.\n\n【155】If you're trying to get pregnant, or you're having problems getting pregnant while on propranolol, speak to your doctor.\n\n【156】Will it affect my sex life?\n\n【157】Some people on propranolol say their sex drive goes down and some men find they cannot get an erection. However, this is not a common side effect and there is not enough evidence to say for sure that propranolol is causing it.\n\n【158】If you're having problems with your sex life, talk to your doctor.\n\n【159】Do I need to avoid playing sports?\n\n【160】You do not need to stop playing sports if you take propranolol. But do not push yourself too much.\n\n【161】Regular exercise is good for you because it lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\n\n【162】Be aware, though, that in some sports propranolol is not allowed if you're competing at a high level.\n\n【163】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【164】Propranolol can make some people feel dizzy, especially when they first start taking it or after taking a bigger dose. If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery.\n\n【165】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking propranolol. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【166】Can lifestyle changes help?\n\n【167】If you have heart problems, you can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These changes will also help if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【168】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid second-hand smoke too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking alcohol while you're taking propranolol can make you feel dizzy or light headed. Also drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and makes heart failure worse. It's best to keep to the recommended limit of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day will help.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n\n【169】If you get severe headaches, there are steps you can take to help prevent migraines. This includes working out what things trigger an attack so you can avoid them.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【170】*   Angina\n*   Anxiety, fear and panic\n*   Arrhythmia\n*   Heart attack\n*   Heart failure\n*   High blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【171】*   HealthUnlocked: propranolol forum\n*   Anxiety UK: charity\n*   Blood Pressure UK: charity\n*   Migraine Trust: charity\n*   Healthtalk: videos of real stories of heart attacks\n*   NHS Health Check: free health check-up\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 November 2024</u>", "index": 25342, "show": true, "start": 25342, "end": 25457, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:48:59", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:49:27", "cost": 28.276}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:49:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:48:59"}

It usually improves without treatment.\n\n【9】But further tests may be recommended if the condition lasts this long, to check for any underlying health problems.\n\n【10】If your baby's jaundice does not improve over time, or tests show high levels of bilirubin in their blood, they may be admitted to hospital and treated with phototherapy or an exchange transfusion.\n\n【11】These treatments are recommended to reduce the risk of a rare but serious complication of newborn jaundice called kernicterus, which can cause brain damage.\n\n【12】Phototherapy\n------------\n\n【13】Phototherapy is treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight). \n\n【14】It's sometimes used to treat newborn jaundice by making it easier for your baby's liver to break down and remove the bilirubin from your baby's blood.\n\n【15】Phototherapy aims to expose your baby's skin to as much light as possible.\n\n【16】Your baby will be placed under a light either in a cot or incubator with their eyes covered.\n\n【17】It will usually be stopped for 30 minutes so you can feed your baby, change their nappy and give them a cuddle.\n\n【18】If your baby's jaundice does not improve, intensified phototherapy may be offered. \n\n【19】This involves increasing the amount of light used or using another source of light, such as a light blanket, at the same time.\n\n【20】Treatment cannot be stopped for breaks during intensified phototherapy, so you will not be able to breastfeed or hold your baby. But you can give your baby expressed milk.\n\n【21】During phototherapy, you baby's temperature will be monitored to make sure they're not getting too hot, and they'll be checked for signs of dehydration.\n\n【22】Intravenous fluids may be needed if your baby is becoming dehydrated and they are not able to drink enough.\n\n【23】The bilirubin levels will be tested every 4 to 6 hours after phototherapy has started, to check if the treatment is working.\n\n【24】Once your baby's bilirubin levels have stabilised or started to fall, they will be checked every 6 to 12 hours.\n\n【25】Phototherapy will be stopped when the bilirubin levels fall to a safe level, which usually takes a day or two.\n\n【26】Phototherapy is generally very effective for newborn jaundice and has few side effects.\n\n【27】Exchange transfusion\n--------------------\n\n【28】If your baby has a very high level of bilirubin in their blood or phototherapy has not been effective, they may need a complete blood transfusion, known as an exchange transfusion.\n\n【29】During an exchange transfusion, your baby's blood will be removed through a thin plastic tube placed in blood vessels in their umbilical cord, arms or legs.\n\n【30】The blood is replaced with blood from a suitable matching donor (someone with the same blood group).\n\n【31】As the new blood will not contain bilirubin, the overall level of bilirubin in your baby's blood will fall quickly.\n\n【32】Your baby will be closely monitored throughout the transfusion process, which can take several hours to complete. Any problems that may arise, such as bleeding, will be treated.\n\n【33】Your baby's blood will be tested within 2 hours of treatment to check if it's been successful.\n\n【34】If the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood remains high, the procedure may need to be repeated.\n\n【35】Other treatments\n----------------\n\n【36】If jaundice is caused by an underlying health problem, such as an infection, this usually needs to be treated.\n\n【37】If the jaundice is caused by rhesus disease (when the mother has rhesus-negative blood and the baby has rhesus-positive blood), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used.\n\n【38】IVIG is usually only used if phototherapy alone has not worked and the level of bilirubin in the blood is continuing to rise.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 February 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Kernicterus</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:33:09", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:33:56", "cost": 46.566}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:33:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:33:08"}

This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. This can improve the symptoms of heart failure.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】If you're taking perindopril for high blood pressure or after a heart attack, you may not have any symptoms. In these cases, you may not feel any different when you take perindopril. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【6】Perindopril starts to work within a few hours to reduce high blood pressure, but it may take up to a month to achieve its full effect.\n\n【7】If you're taking perindopril for heart failure, it may take weeks, even months, before you feel better.\n\n【8】Are there any long term side effects?\n\n【9】Perindopril is generally safe to take for a long time. In fact, it works best when you take it for a long time.\n\n【10】However, taking perindopril for a long time can sometimes cause your kidneys to not work as well as they should. Your doctor will check how well your kidneys are working with regular blood tests.\n\n【11】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【12】Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking perindopril.\n\n【13】Stopping perindopril may cause your blood pressure to rise. This may increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n【14】If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe you a different medicine.\n\n【15】Can I stop taking perindopril now my blood pressure is lower?\n\n【16】Even if perindopril has successfully lowered your blood pressure, it's best to carry on taking it.\n\n【17】If you stop taking perindopril your blood pressure could rise back up again.\n\n【18】If you need blood pressure-lowering medicines, you'll probably need to take them for the rest of your life.\n\n【19】Remember, by keeping your blood pressure low, you're protecting yourself against having a heart attack or stroke in the future.\n\n【20】How does perindopril compare with other medicines for high blood pressure?\n\n【21】There are lots of other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medicines that work in the same way as perindopril. They include enalapril, captopril, ramipril and lisinopril.\n\n【22】There are also lots of other types of medicines that lower your blood pressure:\n\n【23】*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) like candesartan\n*   beta blockers like bisoprolol\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) like bendroflumethiazide\n\n【24】If you cannot take perindopril or other ACE inhibitor medicines because of side effects such as a dry cough, you may be able to switch to another type of medicine to lower your blood pressure.\n\n【25】This will usually be a medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker, such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan or valsartan.\n\n【26】How does perindopril compare with other ACE inhibitors?\n\n【27】Perindopril works as well as other ACE inhibitors when you take it to lower blood pressure and for heart failure. The side effects are also similar to those of other ACE inhibitors.\n\n【28】There are a few differences, though, between perindopril and other ACE inhibitors:\n\n【29】*   perindopril can be used after a heart attack to prevent further ones, but some other ACE inhibitors are not officially approved for this\n*   some ACE inhibitors are officially approved to be used in diabetic kidney disease, but perindopril is not\n*   you only need to take perindopril once a day, while some other ACE inhibitors need to be taken 3 times a day\n\n【30】Can I take perindopril before surgery?\n\n【31】Tell your doctor that you're taking perindopril if you're going to be put to sleep for an operation or are going to have a major operation, such as a caesarean section, without a general anaesthetic.\n\n【32】Perindopril can reduce your blood pressure when it's used with a general anaesthetic.\n\n【33】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking it 24 hours before surgery.\n\n【34】Is perindopril addictive?\n\n【35】No, there's no evidence that perindopril is addictive.\n\n【36】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【37】Perindopril will not affect any type of contraception.\n\n【38】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, including the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【39】Talk to your doctor if you're taking a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【40】If perindopril makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【41】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【42】Perindopril can cause blurred vision and make some people feel dizzy, especially when they first start taking it or after taking a bigger dose.\n\n【43】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery.\n\n【44】If you've had a stroke or a heart attack then it may not be safe for you to drive.\n\n【45】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【46】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking perindopril.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the law on driving:</u>\n\n【47】*   GOV.UK – medical conditions, disability and driving\n*   GOV.UK – drugs and driving: the law\n\n【48】Can I drink alcohol while taking perindopril?\n\n【49】Drinking alcohol can increase the effect of perindopril, so that it lowers your blood pressure too much, which can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n【50】During the first few days of taking perindopril or after your dose increases, it's best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【51】If you find perindopril makes you feel dizzy, it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【52】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【53】Do not use salt substitutes such as Lo-Salt. This is because they are high in potassium. When mixed with perindopril they may make the level of potassium in your blood too high.\n\n【54】There are no other foods or drinks you need to be careful with while taking perindopril.\n\n【55】Eating well can help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【56】Can lifestyle changes help the health of my heart?\n\n【57】You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These will also help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【58】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time. It makes heart failure worse too. Try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day will help.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n*   Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you've had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.\n删除11：<u>More in Perindopril\n-------------------\n\n【59】*   About perindopril\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking perindopril with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 8 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 8 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "】* GOV.UK – 医疗状况、残疾和驾驶\n\nGOV.UK – 毒品和驾驶：法律", "content": "【0】Common questions about perindopril\n==================================\n\n【1】How does perindopril work?\n\n【2】Perindopril is a type of medicine called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\n\n【3】Like other ACE inhibitors, perindopril relaxes and widens the blood vessels.

They include enalapril, captopril, ramipril and lisinopril.\n\n【22】There are also lots of other types of medicines that lower your blood pressure:\n\n【23】*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) like candesartan\n*   beta blockers like bisoprolol\n*   medicines that make you pee more (diuretics) like bendroflumethiazide\n\n【24】If you cannot take perindopril or other ACE inhibitor medicines because of side effects such as a dry cough, you may be able to switch to another type of medicine to lower your blood pressure.\n\n【25】This will usually be a medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker, such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan or valsartan.\n\n【26】How does perindopril compare with other ACE inhibitors?\n\n【27】Perindopril works as well as other ACE inhibitors when you take it to lower blood pressure and for heart failure. The side effects are also similar to those of other ACE inhibitors.\n\n【28】There are a few differences, though, between perindopril and other ACE inhibitors:\n\n【29】*   perindopril can be used after a heart attack to prevent further ones, but some other ACE inhibitors are not officially approved for this\n*   some ACE inhibitors are officially approved to be used in diabetic kidney disease, but perindopril is not\n*   you only need to take perindopril once a day, while some other ACE inhibitors need to be taken 3 times a day\n\n【30】Can I take perindopril before surgery?\n\n【31】Tell your doctor that you're taking perindopril if you're going to be put to sleep for an operation or are going to have a major operation, such as a caesarean section, without a general anaesthetic.\n\n【32】Perindopril can reduce your blood pressure when it's used with a general anaesthetic.\n\n【33】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking it 24 hours before surgery.\n\n【34】Is perindopril addictive?\n\n【35】No, there's no evidence that perindopril is addictive.\n\n【36】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【37】Perindopril will not affect any type of contraception.\n\n【38】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, including the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【39】Talk to your doctor if you're taking a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【40】If perindopril makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【41】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【42】Perindopril can cause blurred vision and make some people feel dizzy, especially when they first start taking it or after taking a bigger dose.\n\n【43】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery.\n\n【44】If you've had a stroke or a heart attack then it may not be safe for you to drive.\n\n【45】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【46】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking perindopril.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the law on driving:</u>\n\n【47】*   GOV.UK – medical conditions, disability and driving\n*   GOV.UK – drugs and driving: the law\n\n【48】Can I drink alcohol while taking perindopril?\n\n【49】Drinking alcohol can increase the effect of perindopril, so that it lowers your blood pressure too much, which can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\n\n【50】During the first few days of taking perindopril or after your dose increases, it's best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【51】If you find perindopril makes you feel dizzy, it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【52】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【53】Do not use salt substitutes such as Lo-Salt. This is because they are high in potassium. When mixed with perindopril they may make the level of potassium in your blood too high.\n\n【54】There are no other foods or drinks you need to be careful with while taking perindopril.\n\n【55】Eating well can help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【56】Can lifestyle changes help the health of my heart?\n\n【57】You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These will also help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【58】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time. It makes heart failure worse too. Try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day will help.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n*   Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you've had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.\n删除11：<u>More in Perindopril\n-------------------\n\n【59】*   About perindopril\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking perindopril with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 8 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 8 December 2024</u>", "index": 5640, "show": true, "start": 5640, "end": 5681, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/04 10:27:31", "endTime": "2024/09/04 10:28:19", "cost": 48.464}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 18:28:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 18:27:30"}

Overview\n2.  How it is performed</u>\n\n【2】**Root canal treatment is carried out by your dentist over 2 or more appointments.**\n\n【3】Unless you're entitled to free NHS dental treatment, you'll have to pay for root canal treatment.\n\n【4】Read about NHS dental charges and how to get help with dental costs.\n\n【5】If the work is particularly complex, your dentist may refer you to a specialist in root canal treatment, known as an endodontist.\n\n【6】All registered dental specialists in the UK are listed on the General Dental Council (GDC) website.\n\n【7】Preparing for root canal treatment\n----------------------------------\n\n【8】Before having root canal treatment, your dentist may take a series of X-rays of the affected tooth.\n\n【9】This allows them to build up a clear picture of the root canal and assess the extent of any damage.\n\n【10】Root canal treatment is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, a painkilling medicine that numbs your infected tooth and the gum around it.\n\n【11】In some cases where the tooth has died and is no longer sensitive, it may not be necessary to use a local anaesthetic.\n\n【12】Removing the pulp\n-----------------\n\n【13】Your dentist will place a rubber sheet (dam) around the tooth to ensure it's dry during treatment.\n\n【14】The dam also prevents you swallowing or breathing in any chemicals the dentist uses.\n\n【15】Your dentist will use a drill to open your tooth through the crown, the flat part at the top, to access the soft tissue at the centre of the tooth (pulp). They'll then remove any infected pulp that remains. \n\n【16】If you have a dental abscess, which is a pus-filled swelling, your dentist will be able to drain it at the same time.\n\n【17】Cleaning and filling the root canal\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】After the pulp has been removed, your dentist will clean and enlarge the root canal.\n\n【19】The root canal is usually very narrow, which makes it difficult to fill.\n\n【20】Your dentist will use a series of small files to enlarge the canals and make them a regular shape so they can be filled.\n\n【21】This part of the treatment may take several hours, and may need to be carried out over a number of visits.\n\n【22】Your front incisor and canine teeth (biting teeth) usually have a single root containing 1 root canal.\n\n【23】The premolars and back molar teeth (chewing teeth) have 2 or 3 roots, each containing either 1 or 2 root canals.\n\n【24】The more roots a tooth has, the longer the treatment will take to complete.\n\n【25】If the treatment needs to be carried out over several sessions, your dentist may put a small amount of medicine in the cleaned canal in between visits to kill any remaining bacteria.\n\n【26】The tooth will then be sealed using a temporary filling.\n\n【27】If you have symptoms from the infection, such as a raised temperature or large swelling, you may be given antibiotics to help manage and prevent further infection.\n\n【28】Sealing and fixing the tooth\n----------------------------\n\n【29】At your next visit, the temporary filling and medicine within the tooth is removed and the root canal filling will be inserted.\n\n【30】This, along with a filling, seals the tooth and prevents reinfection.\n\n【31】Root-filled teeth are more likely to break than healthy unrestored teeth, so your dentist may suggest placing a crown on the tooth to protect it.\n\n【32】In some cases a root-filled tooth may darken, particularly if it's died as a result of injury like a knock to the tooth.\n\n【33】There are several ways your dentist can treat discolouration, such as whitening the tooth using chemicals.\n\n【34】Adding a crown\n--------------\n\n【35】A crown is a cap that completely covers a real tooth. It might be necessary to use a crown after root canal treatment to prevent the tooth fracturing.\n\n【36】Crowns can be made from:\n\n【37】*   metal or porcelain (or both)\n*   a ceramic material\n*   powdered glass\n\n【38】The dentist will use a drill to reduce the size of your tooth and use the crown to replace what's removed.\n\n【39】A mould of your tooth will be taken to ensure the crown is the right shape and size, and fits your tooth accurately.\n\n【40】When fitting the crown, cement will be used to glue the crown to the trimmed-down tooth.\n\n【41】If there's only a small amount of tooth left after the root canal treatment, a post can be cemented in the root canal and used to help keep the crown in place.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what NHS dental fillings and crowns are made of</u>\n\n【42】How successful is root canal treatment?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【43】Root canal treatment is usually successful at saving the tooth and clearing the infection.\n\n【44】Around 9 out of 10 root-treated teeth survive for 8 to 10 years.\n\n【45】Having a crown fitted to the tooth after root canal treatment is important for improving tooth survival rates.\n\n【46】If you keep your teeth clean, your treated tooth should survive for a long time.\n\n【47】The survival of your tooth depends on a number of factors, including:\n\n【48】*   how much of the natural tooth remains\n*   how well you keep your teeth clean\n*   the biting forces on the tooth\n\n【49】But if an infection does return, the root canal treatment can be repeated.\n\n【50】Or if treatment has already been carried out to a high standard and the infection remains, a small operation to remove the root tip (an apicoectomy) may be carried out to treat the infection.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 January 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Root canal treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:27:53", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:28:05", "cost": 11.162}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:28:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:27:52"}

There's often no obvious reason why.\n\n【10】Sometimes it's caused or made worse by:\n\n【11】*   certain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods\n*   being overweight\n*   smoking\n*   pregnancy - find out more about indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy\n*   stress and anxiety\n*   an increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen\n*   some medicines, such as anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen)\n*   a hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach moves up into your chest\n*   a stomach ulcer\n*   a bacterial infection in your stomach\n\n【12】How you can ease heartburn and acid reflux yourself\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn.\n\n【14】### Do\n\n【15】*   eat smaller, more frequent meals\n\n【16】*   try to lose weight if you're overweight\n\n【17】*   try to find ways to relax\n\n【18】### Don’t\n\n【19】*   do not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms\n\n【20】*   do not eat within 3 or 4 hours before bed\n\n【21】*   do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist\n\n【22】*   do not smoke\n\n【23】*   do not drink too much alcohol\n\n【24】*   do not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first\n\n【25】You may find that using wood, bricks or books to raise the head of your bed by around 10 to 20cm, so your chest and head are above your waist, helps relieve symptoms.

Some medicines can affect your weight, for example.\n\n【12】Healthy eating for weight management\n------------------------------------\n\n【13】*   **Shopping for food:** support the person you care for to plan their meals a week in advance. Help them to make healthy choices using the Eatwell guide and write a shopping list together. Using pictures is helpful if they are shopping on their own and have trouble reading. Visit A Picture of Health or the Easyhealth website for pictures of healthy foods.\n*   **Between meals:** encourage the person you care for to make healthier choices when buying snacks, for example, by swapping biscuits for fruit, or sugary drinks for sugar-free squash or water.\n*   **Out and about:** if the person you care for eats out regularly in a canteen or at a day centre, encourage them to make healthy choices from the menu and ask staff to support them with this.\n*   **Portion size:** if the person you support eats large portions at mealtimes, encourage them to reduce these slightly. Fill up to half their plate with vegetables or salad at mealtimes\n*   **Keep records:** if you feel the person you care for is not eating properly, keep records of the food they eat and the foods they do not, to build up a picture of their eating habits.\n\n【14】If you need more support in helping the person you care for to manage their weight, go with them to see a GP. The GP can advise on physical activity and healthy eating.\n\n【15】There may also be community weight management programmes available that are suitable for people with learning disabilities – ask a GP for more information.\n\n【16】### Annual Health Checks\n\n【17】If the person you look after is on the GP's learning disability register, they will be offered an Annual Health Check.

Or try offering smaller meals and snacks throughout the day.\n\n【25】If they still cannot eat much, or their weight is low, you may need to offer special calorie-enriched foods or drinks, as well as their usual diet. These often contain extra vitamins and minerals, too.\n\n【26】A GP can advise you on calorie-enriched foods and supplements, and prescribe them if necessary. They can also refer the person you look after to a dietitian if they need more support.\n\n【27】Get more advice for underweight children and underweight adults.\n\n【28】Physical activity and learning disabilities\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Exercise is key to managing weight. It helps burn calories for people who need to lose weight. It can also stimulate appetite for people who need to gain weight.\n\n【30】Ask the person you look after what activities they're interested in. Try to think of ones that will fit into their routine and that they enjoy.\n\n【31】If you can, organise some regular physical activity and support the person you care for to make sure it happens.\n\n【32】Mobile adults aged 19 to 64 are recommended to be active every day and do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week, such as cycling or fast walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week, such as running.\n\n【33】Special Olympics Great Britain helps people with learning disabilities get involved in sports – see the Special Olympics Great Britainir Facebook page.\n删除11：<u>More information\n----------------\n\n【34】*   Mencap has a selection of leaflets about health\n*   The Caroline Walker Trust has a leaflet called Eating Well: children and adults with learning disabilities (PDF, 2Mb)\n*   Find more help and advice in our learning disabilities section\n</u>删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【35】Can you answer some questions about your visit today?\n\n【36】Click here to take our survey\n\n【37】</u>删除11：<u>More in Managing your weight\n----------------------------\n\n【38】*   Understanding calories\n*   How to lose weight in a wheelchair\n*   Managing weight with a learning disability\n*   Healthy ways to gain weight\n*   Tips to help you lose weight\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 November 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 November 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:40:43", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:41:42", "cost": 59.314}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:41:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:40:42"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus (excess fluid in the brain) can cause complications.**\n\n【3】Shunt problems\n--------------\n\n【4】A shunt is a delicate piece of equipment that can malfunction, usually by becoming blocked or infected.\n\n【5】Sometimes, a scan after the operation shows the shunt is not in the best position and further surgery is needed to reposition it.\n\n【6】If a baby or child has a shunt fitted, the shunt may become too small as the child grows, and it will need to be replaced. As most people need a shunt for the rest of their life, more than one replacement may be needed.\n\n【7】There can occasionally be bleeding when a shunt is positioned. This can cause nerve problems, such as weakness down one side. There's also a small risk of fits after any type of brain surgery.\n\n【8】In younger children, particularly babies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can run alongside the shunt rather than down it, and the fluid can leak through the skin wound. Additional stitches will be needed to stop the leak.\n\n【9】### Shunt blockage\n\n【10】A shunt blockage can be very serious as it can lead to a build-up of excess fluid in the brain, which can cause brain damage. This will cause the symptoms of hydrocephalus.\n\n【11】Emergency surgery will be needed to replace the malfunctioning shunt.\n\n【12】### Shunt infection\n\n【13】Shunt infection is also a relatively common complication after shunt surgery. Infections are more likely to develop during the first few months after surgery.\n\n【14】The symptoms of a shunt infection may include:\n\n【15】*   redness and tenderness along the line of the shunt\n*   a high temperature\n*   headache\n*   vomiting\n*   neck stiffness\n*   tummy pain if the shunt drains into your tummy\n*   irritability or sleepiness in babies\n\n【16】Contact your care team immediately if you or your child has these symptoms. \n\n【17】Antibiotics may be needed to treat the infection and, in some cases, surgery may be required to replace the shunt.\n\n【18】### Shunt alert cards\n\n【19】The hydrocephalus and spina bifida charity Shine has produced a series of shunt alert cards for adults and children. You carry the card with you if you've had a shunt fitted.\n\n【20】The card is useful in a medical emergency if you have symptoms of a blockage or infection.\n\n【21】The healthcare professionals treating you will be aware that you have a shunt fitted and will check whether this is causing your symptoms.\n\n【22】To apply for a shunt alert card, you can fill out a form on the Shine website or call 01733 555 988.\n\n【23】Complications of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is surgery to create a small hole in the floor of the brain to drain the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n【25】Possible complications after ETV surgery include:\n\n【26】*   the hole can close\n*   your brain may not be able to absorb the CSF that's now draining through it\n*   you may develop an infection – although this is less likely than after shunt surgery\n*   you may have bleeding inside your brain – this is usually minor\n\n【27】If there's a problem with the hole, it may be possible to repeat the procedure, or you may need to have a shunt fitted.\n\n【28】Other risks of ETV include nerve problems, such as weakness down 1 side of the body, double vision or hormone imbalances. Most nerve problems will get better, but there's a small risk of permanent problems.\n\n【29】There's also a small risk of epilepsy, and a very small risk of an injury to a blood vessel in the brain, which may be fatal.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:39:57", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:40:29", "cost": 31.562}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:40:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:39:56"}

The scans are painless, have no known side effects on mothers or babies, and can be carried out at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or obstetrician about any concerns you have.\n\n【2】Having a scan in pregnancy is usually a happy event, but be aware that ultrasound scans may detect some serious health conditions. It's your choice whether to have screening. Your midwife can discuss your options with you.\n删除8：<u>See If antenatal screening tests find something for more information on if a scan or other screening test suggests your baby may be more likely to have a condition.</u>\n\n【3】What will happen at the scan?\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Most scans are carried out by sonographers. The scan is carried out in a dimly lit room so the sonographer is able to get good images of your baby.\n\n【5】You'll be asked to lie on your back and reveal your tummy.\n\n【6】The sonographer will put ultrasound gel on your tummy, which makes sure there is good contact between the machine and your skin.\n\n【7】The sonographer passes a probe over your tummy and a picture of the baby will appear on the ultrasound screen.\n\n【8】During the exam, sonographers need to keep the screen in a position that gives them a good view of the baby.\n\n【9】The sonographer will carefully examine your baby's body. The sonographer may need to apply slight pressure on your tummy to get the best views of the baby.\n\n【10】How long will a scan take?\n--------------------------\n\n【11】A scan usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes. However, the sonographer may not be able to get good views if your baby is lying in an awkward position or moving around a lot.\n\n【12】If it's difficult to get a good image, the scan may take longer or have to be repeated at another time.\n\n【13】Can an ultrasound scan harm me or my baby?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are no known risks to the baby or the mother from having an ultrasound scan, but it's important that you consider carefully whether to have the scan or not.\n\n【15】This is because the scan can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests, such as amniocentesis, that have a risk of miscarriage.\n\n【16】When are scans offered?  \n-------------------------\n\n【17】Hospitals in England offer at least 2 ultrasound scans during pregnancy:\n\n【18】*   at 11 to 14 weeks\n*   and between 18 and 21 weeks\n\n【19】The first scan is called the 12-week scan. The sonographer estimates when your baby is due (the estimated date of delivery, or EDD) based on the baby's measurements.\n\n【20】The dating scan can include a nuchal translucency (NT) scan, which is part of the combined screening test for Down's syndrome, if you choose to have this screening.\n\n【21】The second scan offered during pregnancy is the 20-week screening scan. It usually takes place between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy. It's sometimes called the anomaly scan or mid-pregnancy scan. This scan checks for 11 physical conditions in your baby.\n\n【22】You may be offered more than 2 scans, depending on your health and the pregnancy.\n\n【23】When will I get the results?\n----------------------------\n\n【24】The sonographer will be able to tell you the results of the scan at the time.\n\n【25】Do I have to have ultrasound scans?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【26】No, not if you do not want to. Some people want to find out if their baby is more likely to have a condition, while others do not. The 12-week dating scan and 20-week screening scan will be offered to you, but you do not have to have them.\n\n【27】Your choice will be respected if you decide not to have the scans, and your antenatal care will continue as normal. You'll be given the chance to discuss it with your maternity team before making your decision.\n\n【28】What can an ultrasound scan be used for?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【29】An ultrasound scan can be used to:\n\n【30】*   check your baby's size – at the 12-week dating scan, this gives a better idea of how many weeks pregnant you are; your due date, which is originally calculated from the first day of your last period, may be adjusted according to the ultrasound measurements\n*   check whether you're having more than 1 baby\n*   detect some physical conditions\n*   show the position of your baby and the placenta – for example, when the placenta is low down in late pregnancy, a caesarean section may be advised\n*   check that the baby is growing normally – this is particularly important if you're carrying twins, or you've had problems in this pregnancy or a previous pregnancy\n\n【31】Can I bring family or friends with me when I have the scan?\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Yes. You may like someone to come with you to the scan appointment.\n\n【33】Most hospitals do not allow children to attend scans as childcare is not usually available. Please ask your hospital about this before your appointment.\n\n【34】Remember, an ultrasound scan is an important medical examination and it is treated in the same way as any other hospital investigation. Ultrasound scans can sometimes find problems with the baby.\n\n【35】If everything appears normal, what happens next?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Most scans show that the baby is developing normally and no problems are found. This is because most babies are healthy. You can continue with your routine antenatal care.\n\n【37】Scans cannot pick up all health conditions so it's important to speak to a doctor or midwife if you're worried that something is not right.\n\n【38】If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, what happens next?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, the sonographer may ask for a second opinion from another member of staff. You might be offered another test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.\n\n【40】If you're offered further tests, you will be given more information about them so you can decide whether or not you want to have them. You'll be able to discuss this with your midwife or consultant.\n\n【41】If necessary, you will be referred to a specialist, possibly in another hospital.\n\n【42】Can I find out the sex of my baby?\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】Finding out the sex of your baby is not offered as part of the national screening programme.\n\n【44】If you want to find out the sex of your baby, you may be able to during the 20-week screening scan but this depends on the policy of your hospital. Tell the sonographer at the start of the scan that you'd like to know your baby's sex.\n\n【45】Be aware, though, that it's not possible for the sonographer to be 100% certain about your baby's sex. For example, if your baby is lying in an awkward position, it may be difficult or impossible to tell.\n\n【46】Some hospitals have a policy of not telling patients the sex of their baby. Speak to your sonographer or midwife to find out more.\n\n【47】Can I have a picture of my baby?\n--------------------------------\n\n【48】You will need to check if your hospital provides this service. If they do, there may be a charge.\n删除3：<u>Video: What happens at a scan and what will they tell me?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】In this video, a midwife explains what happens at your ultrasound scans during pregnancy.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 4 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 4 April 2026</u>\n\n【50】</u>删除11：<u>More in Your pregnancy care\n---------------------------\n\n【51】*   Your antenatal care\n*   Your antenatal appointments\n*   Antenatal support: meet the team\n*   Antenatal care with twins\n*   Antenatal checks and tests\n*   12-week scan\n*   20-week screening scan\n*   Ultrasound scans in pregnancy\n*   Screening tests in pregnancy\n*   Screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome\n*   Screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis\n*   Screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia\n*   If antenatal screening tests find something\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 November 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 November 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:45:15", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:45:52", "cost": 37.667}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:45:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:45:14"}

The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball.**\n\n【2】Symptoms of a ganglion cyst\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth lump under the skin.\n\n【4】They're made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement.\n\n【5】Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common on the wrists (particularly the back of the wrist), hands and fingers.\n\n【6】Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they do not cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years.\n\n【7】It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to happen when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac.\n\n【8】Treatment for a ganglion cyst\n-----------------------------\n\n【9】Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint.\n\n【10】The 2 main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are:\n\n【11】*   draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe (aspiration)\n*   cutting the cyst out using surgery\n\n【12】Availability on the NHS\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Most integrated care boards (ICBs) do not fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities.\n\n【14】If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment.\n\n【15】Aspiration\n----------\n\n【16】Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital.\n\n【17】Your doctor will use a needle and syringe to remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible.\n\n【18】The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence this reduces the risk of it coming back.\n\n【19】After the procedure, a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin. This can be removed about 6 hours after the procedure.\n\n【20】Aspiration is simple and painless, and you'll be able to leave the hospital straight after.\n\n【21】It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery.\n\n【22】But around half of all ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary.\n\n【23】Surgery\n-------\n\n【24】There are 2 ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst:\n\n【25】*   open surgery – where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2in) long, over the site of the affected joint or tendon\n*   arthroscopy – a type of keyhole surgery where smaller cuts are made and a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint; using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the cut to remove the cyst\n\n【26】Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you're awake but will not feel any pain, or general anaesthetic, where you're asleep during the operation.\n\n【27】The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer and what your surgeon thinks is best.\n\n【28】### Open or keyhole surgery?\n\n【29】Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning.\n\n【30】Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but waiting times are often longer.\n\n【31】After the operation\n-------------------\n\n【32】The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area.\n\n【33】This helps keep it clean, reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps.\n\n【34】The wound is not usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation.\n\n【35】If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days.\n\n【36】This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible.\n\n【37】Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation.\n\n【38】You'll usually experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly.\n\n【39】There's also a small possibility of temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection treatable with antibiotics.\n\n【40】Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy.\n\n【41】How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on your job and where the ganglion is.\n\n【42】If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off.\n\n【43】You can usually start driving again once it feels safe.\n\n【44】Complications\n-------------\n\n【45】Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious.\n\n【46】But a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery.\n\n【47】If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs. \n\n【48】Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible.\n\n【49】There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 October 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:42:23", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:43:30", "cost": 66.755}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:43:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:42:23"}

Overview\n2.  Causes\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment\n5.  Living with\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**There are some things you can do to help keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under control and reduce your risk of complications.**\n\n【3】Dietary advice\n--------------\n\n【4】Although a specific diet is not thought to play a role in causing ulcerative colitis, some changes to your diet can help control the condition.\n\n【5】For example, you may find it useful to:\n\n【6】*   eat small meals – eating more frequent smaller meals a day, rather than 3 main meals, may help control your symptoms\n*   drink plenty of fluids – it's easy to become dehydrated when you have ulcerative colitis, as you can lose a lot of fluid through diarrhoea; water is the best source of fluids, and you should avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these will make your diarrhoea worse, and fizzy drinks, which can cause flatulence (gas)\n*   take food supplements – ask your GP, gastroenterologist or dietitian if you need food supplements, as you might not be getting enough vitamins and minerals in your diet\n\n【7】### Keep a food diary\n\n【8】Keeping a food diary that documents what you eat can also be helpful. \n\n【9】You may find you can tolerate some foods, while others make your symptoms worse.\n\n【10】By keeping a record of what and when you eat, you should be able to identify problem foods and eliminate them from your diet.\n\n【11】But you should not eliminate entire food groups (such as dairy products) from your diet without speaking to your care team, as you may not get enough of certain vitamins and minerals.\n\n【12】If you want to try a new food, it's best to only try 1 type a day because it's then easier to spot foods that cause problems.\n\n【13】### Low-residue diet\n\n【14】Temporarily eating a low-residue or low-fibre diet can sometimes help improve symptoms of ulcerative colitis during a flare-up.\n\n【15】These diets are designed to reduce the amount and frequency of the stools you pass.\n\n【16】Examples of foods that can be eaten as part of a low-residue diet include:\n\n【17】*   white bread\n*   refined (non-wholegrain) breakfast cereals, such as cornflakes\n*   white rice, refined (low-fibre) pasta and noodles\n*   cooked vegetables (but not the peel, seeds or stalks)\n*   lean meat and fish\n*   eggs\n\n【18】If you're considering trying a low-residue diet, make sure you talk to your care team first.\n\n【19】Stress relief\n-------------\n\n【20】Although stress does not cause ulcerative colitis, successfully managing stress levels may reduce the frequency of symptoms.\n\n【21】The following advice may help:\n\n【22】*   exercise – this has been proven to reduce stress and boost your mood; your GP or care team can advise on a suitable exercise plan\n*   relaxation techniques – breathing exercises, meditation and yoga are good ways of teaching yourself to relax\n*   communication – living with ulcerative colitis can be frustrating and isolating; talking to others with the condition can help\n\n【23】Emotional impact\n----------------\n\n【24】Living with a long-term condition that's as unpredictable and potentially debilitating as ulcerative colitis can have a significant emotional impact.\n\n【25】In some cases, anxiety and stress caused by ulcerative colitis can lead to depression.\n\n【26】Signs of depression include feeling very down, hopeless and no longer taking pleasure in activities you used to enjoy.\n\n【27】If you think you might be depressed, contact your GP for advice.\n\n【28】You may also find it useful to talk to others affected by ulcerative colitis, either face-to-face or via the internet.\n\n【29】Crohn's & Colitis UK is a good resource, with details of local support groups and a large range of useful information on ulcerative colitis and related issues.\n\n【30】Bowel cancer screening\n----------------------\n\n【31】You have a higher risk of getting bowel cancer if you have ulcerative colitis.\n\n【32】It's recommended that you have regular bowel cancer screening so any cancer can be found early, which may mean it’s easier to treat. Bowel cancer screening for people with ulcerative colitis usually involves having a colonoscopy.\n\n【33】How often you need screening depends on your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. You can ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【34】Fertility\n---------\n\n【35】The chances of a woman with ulcerative colitis becoming pregnant are not usually affected by the condition.\n\n【36】But infertility can be a complication of surgery carried out to create an ileoanal pouch.\n\n【37】This risk is much lower if you have surgery to divert the small intestine through an opening in your abdomen (an ileostomy).\n\n【38】Pregnancy\n---------\n\n【39】The majority of women with ulcerative colitis who decide to have children will have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby.\n\n【40】But if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, you should discuss it with your care team.\n\n【41】If you become pregnant during a flare-up or have a flare-up while pregnant, there's a risk you could give birth early (premature birth) or have a baby with a low birthweight.\n\n【42】For this reason, doctors usually recommend trying to get ulcerative colitis under control before getting pregnant.\n\n【43】Most ulcerative colitis medicines can be taken during pregnancy, including corticosteroids, most 5-ASAs and some types of immunosuppressant medicine.\n\n【44】But there are certain medicines, such as some types of immunosuppressant, that may need to be avoided as they're associated with an increased risk of birth defects.\n\n【45】In some cases, your doctors may advise you to take a medicine that's not normally recommended during pregnancy.\n\n【46】This might happen if they think the risks of having a flare-up outweigh the risks associated with the medicine.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 01 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 01 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 13:34:22", "endTime": "2024/09/04 13:35:09", "cost": 46.298}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 21:35:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 21:34:21"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**The symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) typically start during the late teens or early 20s, but they may develop at any age.**\n\n【3】Most of the problems are caused by non-cancerous (benign) tumours growing in various parts of the body.\n\n【4】Ear problems\n------------\n\n【5】Most people with NF2 develop non-cancerous tumours along the nerves used by the brain to help with hearing and balance. The tumours are known as vestibular schwannomas and can cause problems such as:\n\n【6】*   hearing loss that gradually gets worse over time\n*   a constant ringing or buzzing sound (tinnitus)\n*   balance problems, such as feeling dizzy – usually made worse by walking on uneven ground or moving around in the dark\n\n【7】The tumours tend to only cause problems in 1 ear at first, but both ears are often affected eventually.\n\n【8】Less common symptoms include vertigo – when it feels like you or everything around you is spinning – and feeling and being sick.\n\n【9】It's likely the tumours will grow larger over time, eventually causing additional symptoms such as:\n\n【10】*   numbness in parts of your face\n*   weakness of your tongue – this can cause slurred or unusual-sounding speech and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   facial pain – although this is less common\n\n【11】Cataracts\n---------\n\n【12】About 2 in 3 people with NF2 develop cloudy patches in the lens of the eye (cataracts).\n\n【13】Cataracts can make a person's vision blurred or misty. However, they're usually mild in NF2 and rarely cause serious vision problems.\n\n【14】Cataracts are normally associated with old age, but they can develop in children and young adults with NF2.\n删除7：<u>Read more about childhood cataracts</u>\n\n【15】Skin problems\n-------------\n\n【16】Just over half of people with NF2 develop benign tumours on or underneath the surface of their skin. These are called schwannomas.\n\n【17】They often take the form of skin plaques: small, coloured, raised patches of skin, usually less than 2cm across.\n\n【18】Tumours that develop under the skin can grow to around the size of a golf ball and can be painful if they develop along a section of nerves.\n\n【19】Some people with NF2 may also develop a small number of coffee-coloured patches on their skin, called café au lait spots. But having lots of these spots is usually a sign of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).\n\n【20】Peripheral neuropathy\n---------------------\n\n【21】Many people with NF2 will develop a condition called peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:\n\n【22】*   pins and needles in the affected body part\n*   numbness and a reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes – particularly in your feet\n*   a burning pain – usually in the feet and legs, followed by the hands and arms as the neuropathy progresses\n*   muscle weakness\n删除7：<u>Read more about peripheral neuropathy</u>\n\n【23】Brain problems\n--------------\n\n【24】Around 1 in 2 people with NF2 develop 1 or more benign tumours inside their brain. These are called meningiomas.\n\n【25】Meningiomas may cause no noticeable problems. However, they can sometimes lead to an increase in pressure in and around the brain, causing symptoms such as:\n\n【26】*   headaches\n*   being sick\n*   seizures (fits)\n*   vision disturbances – such as double vision\n\n【27】The tumours can also disrupt certain brain functions. Depending on where they are, they may cause:\n\n【28】*   personality changes\n*   weakness or numbness in 1 side of the body\n*   difficulty speaking, understanding words, writing and reading (aphasia)\n*   vision problems\n*   fits or blackouts\n*   memory problems\n*   a loss of smell (anosmia) or a sensation of strange smells (phantosmia)\n*   unsteadiness, loss of co-ordination and difficulty walking\n*   difficulty speaking and swallowing\n\n【29】Spinal cord problems\n--------------------\n\n【30】Around 1 in 2 people with NF2 develop 1 or more benign tumours inside their spinal cord. These are called ependymomas.\n\n【31】Of those who develop ependymomas, about half will not have any noticeable symptoms. But those who do may experience:\n\n【32】*   back pain\n*   muscle weakness\n*   unpleasant physical sensations in certain parts of the body – such as numbness, tingling, or a \"crawling\" sensation on the skin\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Neurofibromatosis type 2</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:44:03", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:44:15", "cost": 12.172}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:48", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:44:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:44:03"}

It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from people involved in your care.\n\n【8】It includes what you do every day to stay fit and maintain good physical and mental health, prevent illness and accidents, and manage minor ailments and long-term conditions.\n\n【9】People who have a long-term condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can benefit enormously from being supported to care for themselves. They can live longer, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent.\n\n【10】Take your medicine\n------------------\n\n【11】It's important to take your medicine as instructed, even if you start to feel better, as medicine can help prevent flare-ups and reduce the risk of further problems, such as joint damage.\n\n【12】If you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking or side effects, talk to your healthcare team.\n\n【13】It may also be useful to read the information leaflet that comes with the medicine, as this tells you about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements.\n\n【14】Check with your healthcare team before taking any over-the-counter remedies, such as painkillers or nutritional supplements. These may interfere with your medicine.\n\n【15】Regular reviews\n---------------\n\n【16】As rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition, you'll be in contact with your healthcare team regularly so they can check if your condition is being well controlled and if your treatment is right for you.\n\n【17】You may have a disease activity score (DAS) measured regularly, which can help your healthcare team to decide on the best treatment.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the DAS score on the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) website.</u>\n\n【18】The more your healthcare team know, the more they can help you, so discuss any concerns you have with them.\n\n【19】### Reducing your medicine\n\n【20】Some people find their symptoms go away or get much better. If your symptoms stay better for at least 1 year without needing to take steroids, your treatment can be reviewed.\n\n【21】Your doctor may suggest slowly reducing your dose of medicine, then seeing if you can stop taking it.\n\n【22】You'll be monitored during this time. If your symptoms come back, you'll need to start taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) straight away.\n\n【23】Keeping well\n------------\n\n【24】If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you may be advised to have a yearly flu vaccination to protect against flu.\n\n【25】You may also be advised to have a pneumococcal vaccination, a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\n【26】Try to get plenty of rest during a flare-up, when your joints can be particularly painful and inflamed.\n\n【27】Healthy eating and exercise\n---------------------------\n\n【28】Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with rheumatoid arthritis. \n\n【29】They can help reduce your risk of many conditions, including heart disease and many forms of cancer.\n\n【30】Exercising regularly can help relieve stress, help keep your joints mobile, and strengthen the muscles supporting your joints.\n\n【31】Exercise can also help you lose weight if you're overweight, which can put extra strain on your joints.\n\n【32】But it's important to find a balance between rest and exercise. Rest will make inflamed joints feel more comfortable, but without movement your joints will stiffen and your muscles will become weaker.\n\n【33】Find the best activities and the right balance for you. It's usually best to increase the amount of exercise you do gradually.\n\n【34】If a particular activity causes your joints to become warm and swollen, or it causes severe pain, then stop and rest. If it does not cause problems, then it is usually fine to continue.\n\n【35】If a particular activity always causes a flare-up, it's best to avoid it and find an alternative.\n\n【36】High-impact activities, such as running or contact sports like rugby and football, are more likely to cause problems.\n\n【37】Try low-impact activities that put less strain on your joints, such as swimming, cycling, walking and aqua aerobics.\n\n【38】If you need more guidance, a physiotherapist is a good person to advise you on suitable types of exercise.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【39】*   Versus Arthritis: exercise and pain management\n*   Healthtalk: rheumatoid arthritis\n*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: living with rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【40】</u>\nSelf-management\n---------------\n\n【41】Taking control of rheumatoid arthritis will help you cope with its impact on your lifestyle.\n\n【42】A self-management programme specifically for people with rheumatoid arthritis has been developed by the NRAS.\n\n【43】The 6-week programme can help you learn more about your condition and provide practical tips on how to manage everyday life, such as:\n\n【44】*   how to get the best from your medicine\n*   techniques to manage pain\n*   goal-setting exercises\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【45】*   National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society: managing your rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【46】</u>\nTalk to others\n--------------\n\n【47】Many people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position.

with the unpredictable nature of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【53】Some days the pain and stiffness will be much worse than others, and there may be no way of knowing when a flare-up will happen.\n\n【54】The difficult nature of rheumatoid arthritis can mean some people develop depression or feelings of stress and anxiety.\n\n【55】Sometimes these feelings can be related to poorly controlled pain or fatigue.\n\n【56】Living with a long-term condition makes you more likely to have emotions such as frustration, fear, anger and resentment.\n\n【57】Speak to your healthcare team if you're struggling to deal with your feelings about your condition.\n\n【58】They may be able to offer medicine or suggest mental health services that may help.\n\n【59】Starting and raising a family\n-----------------------------\n\n【60】If you're taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or you're worried about becoming pregnant while taking medicine.\n\n【61】Some medicines, such as methotrexate, leflunomide and biological treatments should not be taken by men or women while they're trying for a baby.\n\n【62】Your healthcare team will work with you to try to keep your rheumatoid arthritis under control while you're trying to get pregnant.\n\n【63】Babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly if you have rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【64】If you're struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you.\n\n【65】You may also be able to get extra support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family.\n删除6：<u>### Further information\n\n【66】*   Versus Arthritis: pregnancy and arthritis\n*

stop work or reduce work to part-time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.\n\n【75】You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n\n【76】*   if you have a job but cannot work because of your condition, you're entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer for up to 28 weeks\n*   if you do not have a job and cannot work because of your condition, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\n*   if you're aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have difficulty walking, you may be eligible for a Personal Independence Payment\n*   if you're aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance\n*   if you're caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled to Carer's Allowance\n\n【77】You may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or a low household income.\n\n【78】### Paying for your medicines\n\n【79】If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you're likely to need repeat prescriptions of medicine to keep your condition under control.\n\n【80】Rheumatoid arthritis is not listed as a medical condition that entitles a person to free prescriptions in England.\n\n【81】But you may be able to get your medicine for free if your condition falls under the category of \"a continuing physical disability which means the person cannot go out without the help of another person\".\n\n【82】You're also entitled to free prescriptions if you're 60 or over, or if you receive either: \n\n【83】*   Income Support\n*   income-based Jobseeker's Allowance\n*   income-related Employment and Support Allowance.\n\n【84】If you are not entitled to free prescriptions, you may find it cheaper to buy a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC).\n\n【85】This is effectively a prescription \"season ticket\" that covers all your prescriptions over a 3- or 12-month period.\n删除7：<u>Read more about who can get free

If you have pre-eclampsia, you'll be closely monitored until it's possible to deliver the baby.**\n\n【3】Once diagnosed, you'll be referred to a hospital specialist for further assessment and any necessary treatment.\n\n【4】You may be able to return home afterwards and attend regular (possibly daily) follow-up appointments.\n\n【5】You may be admitted to hospital for monitoring and treatment if there are any concerns for you or your baby.\n\n【6】Monitoring in hospital\n----------------------\n\n【7】While you're in hospital, you and your baby will be monitored by:\n\n【8】*   having regular blood pressure checks to identify any abnormal increases\n*   having regular urine samples taken to measure protein levels\n*   having various blood tests – for example, to check your kidney and liver health\n*   having ultrasound scans to check blood flow through the placenta, measure the growth of the baby, and how much amniotic fluid there is\n*   electronically monitoring the baby's heart rate using a process called cardiotocography, which can detect any stress or distress in the baby\n\n【9】Medicine for high blood pressure\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】Medicine is recommended to help lower your blood pressure. These medicines reduce the likelihood of serious complications, such as stroke.\n\n【11】Some of the medicines used regularly in the UK include labetalol, nifedipine or methyldopa.\n\n【12】Of these medicines, only labetalol is specifically licensed for use in pregnant women with high blood pressure.\n\n【13】This means the medicine has undergone clinical trials that have found it to be safe and effective for this purpose.\n\n【14】But while methyldopa and nifedipine are not licensed for use in pregnancy, they can be used \"off-label\" (outside their licence) if it's felt the benefits of treatment are likely to outweigh the risks of harm to you or your baby.\n\n【15】These medicines have been used by doctors in the UK for many years to treat pregnant women with high blood pressure.\n\n【16】They're recommended as possible alternatives to labetalol in guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\n\n【17】Your doctors may recommend one of them if they think it's the most suitable medicine for you.\n\n【18】If your doctors recommend treatment with one of these medicines, you should be made aware that the medicine is unlicensed in pregnancy and any risks should be explained before you agree to treatment, unless immediate treatment is needed in an emergency.\n\n【19】### Other medicines\n\n【20】Anticonvulsant medicine may be prescribed to prevent fits if you have severe pre-eclampsia and your baby is due within 24 hours, or if you have had convulsions (fits).\n\n【21】They can also be used to treat fits if they occur.\n\n【22】Delivering your baby\n--------------------\n\n【23】In most cases of pre-eclampsia, having your baby at about the 37th to 38th week of pregnancy is recommended.\n\n【24】This may mean that labour needs to be started artificially (known as induced labour) or you may need to have a caesarean section.\n\n【25】This is recommended because research suggests there's no benefit in waiting for labour to start by itself after this point.\n\n【26】Delivering the baby early can also reduce the risk of complications from pre-eclampsia.\n\n【27】If your condition becomes more severe before 37 weeks and there are serious concerns about the health of you or your baby, earlier delivery may be necessary.\n\n【28】Deliveries before 37 weeks are known as premature births and babies born before this point may not be fully developed.\n\n【29】You should be given information about the risks of both premature birth and pre-eclampsia so the best decision can be made about your treatment.\n\n【30】### After the delivery\n\n【31】Although pre-eclampsia usually improves soon after your baby is born, complications can sometimes develop a few days later.\n\n【32】You may need to stay in hospital after the birth so you can be monitored.\n\n【33】Your blood pressure will be measured regularly and you may be offered medicine if it gets too high, if you are not taking medicine already.\n\n【34】Your baby may also need to be monitored and stay in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit if they're born prematurely.\n\n【35】These units have facilities that can replicate the functions of the womb and allow your baby to develop fully.\n\n【36】Once it's safe to do so, you'll be able to take your baby home.\n\n【37】You'll usually need to have your blood pressure checked regularly after leaving hospital, and you may need to continue taking medicine to lower your blood pressure for several weeks.\n\n【38】If you are still taking medicine, you should be offered an appointment with a doctor 2 weeks after you transfer from hospital care to community midwives. This is to check whether your treatment needs to be changed or stopped.\n\n【39】You should be offered a postnatal appointment 6 to 8 weeks after your baby is born to check your progress and decide if any treatment needs to continue. This appointment will usually be with your GP. This is separate from your 6-week postnatal check.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:23:09", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:28:24", "cost": 314.493}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:28:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:23:09"}

In this case it'll be closely monitored using scans or treated with radiotherapy.\n\n【5】Read about malignant brain tumour (brain cancer).\n\n【6】Types and grades of non-cancerous brain tumour\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【7】There are many different types of non-cancerous brain tumours, which are related to the type of brain cells affected.\n\n【8】Examples include:\n\n【9】*   **gliomas** – tumours of the glial tissue, which hold and support nerve cells and fibres\n*   **meningiomas** – tumours of the membranes that cover the brain\n*   **acoustic neuromas** – tumours of the acoustic nerve (also known as vestibular schwannomas)\n*   **craniopharyngiomas** – tumours near the base of the brain that are most often diagnosed in children, teenagers and young adults\n*   **haemangioblastomas** – tumours of the brain's blood vessels\n*   **pituitary adenomas** – tumours of the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland on the under surface of the brain\n删除7：<u>The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the different types of brain tumours.</u>\n\n【10】Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to how fast they grow and spread, and how likely they are to grow back after treatment.\n\n【11】Non-cancerous brain tumours are grades 1 or 2 because they tend to be slow growing and unlikely to spread.\n\n【12】They are not cancerous and can often be successfully treated, but they're still serious and can be life threatening.\n\n【13】Symptoms of non-cancerous brain tumours\n---------------------------------------\n\n【14】The symptoms of a non-cancerous brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Some slow-growing tumours may not cause any symptoms at first.\n\n【15】Common symptoms include:\n\n【16】*   new, persistent headaches\n*   seizures (epileptic fits)\n*   feeling sick all the time, being sick, and drowsiness\n*   mental or behavioural changes, such as changes in personality\n*   weakness or paralysis, vision problems, or speech problems\n\n【17】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【18】See a GP if you have symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, these symptoms need to be assessed by a doctor.\n\n【19】The GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also test your nervous system.\n\n【20】If the GP thinks you may have a brain tumour, or they're not sure what's causing your symptoms, they'll refer you to a brain and nerve specialist called a neurologist.\n\n【21】Causes of non-cancerous brain tumours\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】The cause of most non-cancerous brain tumours is unknown, but you're more likely to develop one if:\n\n【23】*   you're over the age of 50\n*   you have a family history of brain tumours\n*   you have a genetic condition that increases your risk of developing a non-cancerous brain tumour – such as neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, tuberous sclerosis, Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome\n*   you've had radiotherapy\n\n【24】Treating non-cancerous brain tumours\n------------------------------------\n\n【25】Treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour depends on the type and location of the tumour.\n\n【26】Surgery is used to remove most non-cancerous brain tumours, and they do not usually come back after being removed. But sometimes tumours do grow back or become cancerous.\n\n【27】If all of the tumour cannot be removed, other treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, may be needed to control the growth of the remaining abnormal cells.\n\n【28】Recovering from treatment for a non-cancerous brain tumour\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】After treatment, you may have persistent problems, such as seizures and difficulties with speech and walking. You may need supportive treatment to help you recover from, or adapt to, these problems.\n\n【30】Many people are eventually able to resume their normal activities, including work and sport, but it can take time.\n\n【31】You may find it useful to speak to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of your diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【32】The Brain Tumour Charity has links to support groups in the UK, and Brain Tumour Research also has details of helplines you can contact.\n删除3：<u>### Video: benign brain tumour - Debbie's story\n\n【33】In this video, Debbie describes her diagnosis and treatment for a benign brain tumour.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 2 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 2 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:33:15", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:34:27", "cost": 71.76}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:34:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:33:14"}

This can put pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, and obstruct the flow of fluid.\n\n【6】This page focuses on Chiari I malformations.\n\n【7】Are Chiari I malformations serious?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【8】The severity of Chiari malformations can vary from person to person, but generally:\n\n【9】*   Chiari I malformations are not considered life-threatening\n*   some people experience painful headaches, movement problems and other unpleasant symptoms but many people will not have any symptoms\n*   there's a chance of developing syringomyelia (where a fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx develops in the spinal cord), which can damage the spinal cord if not treated promptly\n*   surgery can usually stop the symptoms getting worse and can sometimes improve them, although some problems may remain\n\n【10】Talk to your doctor about what the condition means, what the implications may be for your health and what treatment you may need.\n\n【11】Symptoms of Chiari I malformations\n----------------------------------\n\n【12】Many people with a Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. Sometimes they're only found after an MRI scan of the brain is carried out for another reason.\n\n【13】If symptoms do develop, they can include:\n\n【14】*   headaches – these are usually felt at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over\n*   neck pain\n*   dizziness and balance problems\n*   muscle weakness\n*   numbness or tingling in the arms or legs\n*   blurred vision, double vision and sensitivity to light\n*   swallowing problems\n*   hearing loss and tinnitus\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and clinical depression\n\n【15】If you develop syringomyelia, you may also experience problems using your hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control.\n\n【16】If you've been diagnosed with a Chiari malformation, you should contact your doctor for advice if you develop any new symptoms or your symptoms worsen.\n\n【17】Treatments for Chiari I malformations\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】Treatment for Chiari I malformation depends on whether you have any symptoms and how severe they are. You might not need any treatment if you do not have any symptoms.\n\n【19】Painkillers can help relieve any headaches and neck pain.\n\n【20】If your headaches are severe or you have problems caused by the pressure on your spinal cord (such as movement difficulties), surgery may be recommended.\n\n【21】### Surgery\n\n【22】The main operation for Chiari malformation is called decompression surgery.\n\n【23】Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine.\n\n【24】This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally.删除7：<u>Read more about decompression surgery for Chiari malformation:</u>\n\n【25】*   Brain & Spine Foundation: Chiari malformation - information for adults\n*   Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust: cranio-cervical decompression for Chiari malformation - information for children\n\n【26】Other procedures that may be necessary include:\n\n【27】*   **Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)** – a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.\n*   **Ventriculoperitoneal shunting** – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information.\n*   **Untethering** – some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine.\n*   **Spinal fixation** – some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and may require surgery to stabilise their spine.\n\n【28】The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches.\n\n【29】However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke.\n\n【30】Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are.\n\n【31】Causes of Chiari I malformations\n--------------------------------\n\n【32】The exact cause of Chiari I malformations is unknown. It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done.\n\n【33】Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain.\n\n【34】Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus), and some types of brain tumour.\n\n【35】Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development.\n\n【36】But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small.

Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**Trichomoniasis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose because symptoms are similar to those of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).**\n\n【3】If you think you may have trichomoniasis, you should visit a GP or your local sexual health clinic (genitourinary medicine (GUM)) clinic.\n\n【4】Some GP surgeries offer an enhanced sexual health service for diagnosing and treating STIs. It may be better to visit a GUM clinic because these clinics can carry out accurate tests more quickly.\n\n【5】In some cases, the GP may refer you to a GUM clinic for tests and treatment if they think you have trichomoniasis.\n\n【6】Important: Using sexual health clinics during coronavirus (COVID-19)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Call a sexual health clinic if you need help or advice. Only go to a clinic if you've been told to.\n\n【8】Find sexual health clinic contact details\n\n【9】Examination\n-----------\n\n【10】If your doctor or nurse suspects you have trichomoniasis, they'll usually carry out an examination of your genital area.\n\n【11】In women, trichomoniasis may cause abnormal vaginal discharge or red blotches on the walls of the vagina and on the cervix (the neck of the womb).\n\n【12】If you are a man with suspected trichomoniasis, your doctor or nurse will examine your penis for signs of inflammation or discharge.\n\n【13】Laboratory testing\n------------------\n\n【14】After a physical examination, your doctor or nurse may need to take a swab from either the vagina or penis. The swab will be analysed in a laboratory to check for signs of the trichomoniasis infection. It may take several days for the results to come back.\n\n【15】In men, a urine sample can also be tested for trichomoniasis.\n\n【16】If trichomoniasis is suspected, you may be advised to begin a course of treatment before your results come back. This ensures the infection is treated as soon as possible and reduces the risk of it spreading.\n删除8：<u>See treating trichomoniasis for more information.</u>\n\n【17】Notifying sexual partners\n-------------------------\n\n【18】If the test shows you have trichomoniasis, it's very important that your current sexual partner and any other recent partners are also tested and treated. The staff at the clinic or GP surgery can discuss with you which of your sexual partners may need to be tested.\n\n【19】If possible, tell your sexual partner and any ex-partners so they can get tested and treated as well. If you do not want to do this, the clinic can usually do it for you (it's called partner notification and the clinic will not reveal who you are).\n\n【20】If you've had trichomoniasis and have been cured, there's no need to tell any future partners.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 November 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Trichomoniasis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:00:56", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:01:48", "cost": 51.744}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:01:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:00:55"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Pre-eclampsia is thought to be caused by the placenta not developing properly due to a problem with the blood vessels supplying it. The exact cause isn't fully understood.**\n\n【3】Placenta\n--------\n\n【4】The placenta is the organ that links the mother's blood supply to her unborn baby's blood supply.\n\n【5】Food and oxygen pass through the placenta from mother to baby. Waste products can pass from the baby back into the mother.\n\n【6】To support the growing baby, the placenta needs a large and constant supply of blood from the mother.\n\n【7】In pre-eclampsia, the placenta doesn't get enough blood. This could be because the placenta didn't develop properly as it was forming during the first half of the pregnancy.\n\n【8】The problem with the placenta means the blood supply between mother and baby is disrupted.\n\n【9】Signals or substances from the damaged placenta affect the mother's blood vessels, causing high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\n【10】At the same time, problems in the kidneys may cause important proteins that should remain in the mother's blood to leak into her urine, resulting in protein in the urine (proteinuria).\n\n【11】What causes problems with the placenta?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】In the initial stages of pregnancy, the fertilised egg implants itself into the wall of the womb (uterus). The womb is the organ a baby grows inside during pregnancy.\n\n【13】The fertilised egg produces root-like growths called villi, which help to anchor it to the lining of the womb.\n\n【14】The villi are fed nutrients through blood vessels in the womb and eventually grow into the placenta.\n\n【15】During the early stages of pregnancy, these blood vessels change shape and become wider.\n\n【16】If the blood vessels don't fully transform, it's likely that the placenta won't develop properly because it won't get enough nutrients. This may lead to pre-eclampsia.\n\n【17】It's still unclear why the blood vessels don't transform as they should. \n\n【18】It's likely that inherited changes in your genes have some sort of role, as the condition often runs in families. But this only explains some cases.\n\n【19】Who's most at risk?\n-------------------\n\n【20】Some factors have been identified that could increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia.\n\n【21】These include:\n\n【22】*   **having an existing medical problem** – such as diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome\n*   **previously having pre-eclampsia**\n\n【23】Some factors also increase your chances by a small amount.\n\n【24】If you have 2 or more of these together, your chances are higher:\n\n【25】*   **it's your first pregnancy** – pre-eclampsia is more likely to happen during the first pregnancy than during any subsequent pregnancies\n*   **it's been at least 10 years since your last pregnancy**\n*   **you have a family history of the condition** – for example, your mother or sister has had pre-eclampsia\n*   **you're over the age of 40**\n*   **you were obese at the start of your pregnancy** – meaning you had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more\n*   **you're expecting** **twins or more**, such as twins or triplets\n\n【26】If you're considered to be at a high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, you may be advised to take a 75 to 150mg dose of aspirin every day from when you're 12 weeks pregnant until your baby is born.\n\n【27】Evidence suggests this can lower your chances of developing the condition.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:22", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:46:55", "cost": 32.696}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:46:22"}

More than 43,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK.**\n\n【3】There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including:\n\n【4】*   a persistent cough\n*   coughing up blood\n*   persistent breathlessness\n*   unexplained tiredness and weight loss\n*   an ache or pain when breathing or coughing\n\n【5】You should see a GP if you have these symptoms.\n\n【6】Types of lung cancer\n--------------------\n\n【7】Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads to the lungs from another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer.\n\n【8】There are two main forms of primary lung cancer. These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts growing. They are:\n\n【9】*   non-small-cell lung cancer – the most common form, accounting for around 80 to 85 out of 100 cases. It can be one of three types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma.\n*   small-cell lung cancer – a less common form that usually spreads faster than non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n【10】The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.\n\n【11】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【12】Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40. More than 4 out of 10 people diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK are aged 75 and older.\n\n【13】Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the most common cause (accounting for more than 70 out of 100 cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.\n\n【14】Treating lung cancer\n--------------------\n\n【15】Treatment depends on the type of mutation the cancer has, how far it's spread and how good your general health is.\n\n【16】If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung may be recommended.\n\n【17】If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health, radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead.\n\n【18】If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually used.\n\n【19】There are also a number of medicines known as targeted therapies. They target a specific change in or around the cancer cells that is helping them to grow. Targeted therapies cannot cure lung cancer but they can slow its spread.\n\n【20】Outlook\n-------\n\n【21】Lung cancer does not usually cause noticeable symptoms until it's spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body. This means the outlook for the condition is not as good as many other types of cancer.\n\n【22】About 2 in 5 people with the condition live for at least 1 year after they're diagnosed, and about 1 in 10 people live at least 10 years.\n\n【23】However, survival rates vary widely, depending on how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis. Early diagnosis can make a big difference.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 01 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 01 November 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:18:39", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:18:52", "cost": 12.856}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:18:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:18:38"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**The treatment for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what's causing the condition. Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.**\n\n【3】Treating vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, called hydroxocobalamin.\n\n【5】At first, you'll have these injections every other day for 2 weeks or until your symptoms have started improving.\n\n【6】Your GP or nurse will give the injections.\n\n【7】After this initial period, your treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet or whether the deficiency is causing any neurological problems, such as problems with thinking, memory and behaviour.\n\n【8】The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which is not related to your diet.\n\n【9】### Diet-related\n\n【10】If your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be advised to take vitamin B12 tablets every day between meals.\n\n【11】Or you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.\n\n【12】People who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life.\n\n【13】Although it's less common, people with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and their diet has improved.\n\n【14】Good sources of vitamin B12 include:\n\n【15】*   meat\n*   salmon and cod\n*   milk and other dairy products\n*   eggs\n\n【16】If you're a vegetarian or vegan, or are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are foods that are fortified with vitamin B12, such as some yeast extracts, breakfast cereals and soy products.\n\n【17】Check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12 different foods contain.\n\n【18】### Not diet-related\n\n【19】If your vitamin B12 deficiency is not caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you'll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every 2 to 3 months for the rest of your life.\n\n【20】If you have had neurological symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you'll be referred to a haematologist and may need to have injections every 2 months.\n\n【21】Your haematologist will advise on how long you need to keep taking the injections.\n\n【22】For injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer.\n\n【23】Treating folate deficiency anaemia\n----------------------------------\n\n【24】To treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid tablets to build up your folate levels.\n\n【25】They may also give you dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake.\n\n【26】Good sources of folate include:\n\n【27】*   broccoli\n*   brussels sprouts\n*   asparagus\n*   peas\n*   chickpeas\n*   brown rice\n\n【28】Most people need to take folic acid tablets for about 4 months. But if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer, possibly for life.\n\n【29】Before you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they're normal.\n\n【30】This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【31】If a vitamin B12 deficiency is not detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system.\n\n【32】Monitoring your condition\n-------------------------\n\n【33】To ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further blood tests.\n\n【34】A blood test is often carried out around 7 to 10 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working.\n\n【35】This is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood.\n\n【36】Another blood test may also be carried out after approximately 8 weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful.\n\n【37】Most people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency will not need further monitoring unless their symptoms return or their treatment is ineffective.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/04 11:32:55", "endTime": "2024/09/04 11:33:13", "cost": 18.082}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-03 02:17:47", "update_time": "2024-09-03 19:33:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-03 19:32:54"}
