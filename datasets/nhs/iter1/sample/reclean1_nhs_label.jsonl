{"seq_id": "3c7929b9-efe4-4b19-9049-2c7292cf9a00", "title": "Levetiracetam", "text": "【0】Common questions about levetiracetam\n====================================\n\n【1】How does levetiracetam work?\n\n【2】Seizures are bursts of electrical activity in the brain that temporarily affect how it works. Levetiracetam slows these electrical signals down to stop seizures.\n\n【3】Levetiracetam also works differently from most epilepsy medicines. The exact way this works is not fully known.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】It usually takes a few weeks for levetiracetam to work fully. This is because your dose needs to be increased slowly. You may still have seizures during this time.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】Levetiracetam is a relatively new medicine.\n\n【8】At the moment, there's no evidence to show it has lasting harmful effects if you take it for many months or years.\n\n【9】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【10】If you're taking levetiracetam for epilepsy, stopping it suddenly can cause seizures.\n\n【11】Coming off levetiracetam should be done very slowly and might take a few months.\n\n【12】However, if you do get a serious side effect, such as a severe skin condition, your doctor may tell you to stop taking levetiracetam straight away, even if you have epilepsy.\n\n【13】### Important\n\n【14】Do not stop taking levetiracetam without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【15】How does levetiracetam compare with other epilepsy medicines?\n\n【16】There are lots of medicines for treating epilepsy, but they work in different ways.\n\n【17】The choice will depend on the type of seizures you have. Your doctor will discuss the best medicine for you.\n\n【18】Brivaracetam is very similar to levetiracetam. It works in the same way, but can be given at different doses.\n\n【19】If you decide to try brivaracetam instead, your doctor will explain how to switch medicines safely.\n\n【20】Other medicines to treat epilepsy include:\n\n【21】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   sodium valproate\n*   topiramate\n\n【22】It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person, and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【23】Your doctor will advise you on the medicine that's best for you. They'll look at your age, sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【24】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well or you're getting side effects, your doctor will generally try you on a different one.\n\n【25】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more epilepsy medicines at the same time.\n\n【26】Levetiracetam works for quite a few different types of epilepsy.\n\n【27】If it's giving you side effects or you're worried it's not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【28】Can I switch to a different medicine?\n\n【29】If you're switching medicines, it's very important to follow your doctor's advice.\n\n【30】If you want to switch, you'll usually start taking the new medicine at a low dose and slowly build up the dose while you're still taking levetiracetam.\n\n【31】It's not always important to stay on the same brand of levetiracetam, but ask your doctor.\n\n【32】If your epilepsy has been hard to control in the past and the brand of levetiracetam you're now taking is working well for you, your doctor may recommend you stay on the same one.\n\n【33】Talk to your doctor if you have been asked to switch to a different brand of levetiracetam and are worried about that.\n\n【34】What is \"Keppra rage\" and how may this affect my mood?\n\n【35】Keppra is a brand of levetiracetam. Levetiracetam can sometimes cause changes in your mood or behaviour. You may feel angry, agitated or depressed.\n\n【36】This side effect does not affect everyone, but it's important to tell your doctor if you have any changes in your mood, feel depressed or have thoughts of harming yourself.\n\n【37】Do I need to take vitamin B alongside my levetiracetam?\n\n【38】Some people take vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxine) alongside levetiracetam to reduce the chances of mood changes. A few studies have reported that vitamin B6 might be helpful, but we do not have enough information to be sure.\n\n【39】If you want to take any vitamins alongside your prescribed medicines, it's important to speak to your pharmacist or doctor, who can advise what you can take.\n\n【40】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【41】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your epilepsy ones.\n\n【42】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need a medical exemption certificate. The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery.\n\n【43】You'll need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【44】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【45】Levetiracetam does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【46】However, if levetiracetam makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.</u>\n\n【47】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【48】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking levetiracetam or when the dose is increased. If this happens to you, do not drive or ride a bike or operate machinery until you feel more alert.\n\n【49】Levetiracetam can also affect your vision. Do not drive if your vision is affected.\n\n【50】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you have had no seizures for 1 year.\n\n【51】You're also not allowed to drive for 6 months if you change your epilepsy medicine.\n\n【52】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking levetiracetam.

A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n\n【60】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【61】No, you can eat and drink normally while taking levetiracetam.\n删除11：<u>More in Levetiracetam\n---------------------\n\n【62】*   About levetiracetam\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking levetiracetam with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**There are some things you can do yourself to try to reduce the discomfort of post-herpetic neuralgia. Medicine can also be used to help relieve the pain.**\n\n【3】Self-help\n---------\n\n【4】To help reduce the pain and irritation of post-herpetic neuralgia:\n\n【5】*   wear comfortable clothing – cotton or silk clothing usually causes less irritation\n*   try covering the painful area with cling film or a plastic wound dressing to protect it\n*   use cold packs – for some people it helps to wrap an ice pack in a towel to apply on the affected area to cool the skin, but do not apply ice directly to the skin\n\n【6】Medicines for post-herpetic neuralgia\n-------------------------------------\n\n【7】Medicines may not stop the pain completely, but they can help reduce it. You may need to try a number of different types of medicine to find the one, or combination, that works best for you.\n\n【8】Commonly used painkillers do not usually work for post-herpetic neuralgia. But your GP may suggest using paracetamol or a combination of paracetamol and codeine initially to see if it has an effect.\n\n【9】Some medicines used to treat depression also work for nerve pain, so you may be advised to try one of these.\n\n【10】### Antidepressants\n\n【11】Amitriptyline and duloxetine are the two main antidepressants prescribed for post-herpetic neuralgia.\n\n【12】You'll usually be started on a low dose, which may be increased depending on the benefits and side effects. It may take a few weeks to feel the full effects.\n\n【13】Common side effects include a dry mouth, constipation, dizziness and drowsiness. Not everyone gets side effects.\n\n【14】If these medicines still do not help after several weeks, or if they're causing significant side effects, your dose will need to be gradually reduced to prevent withdrawal effects.\n\n【15】### Anticonvulsants\n\n【16】Gabapentin and pregabalin are the two main anticonvulsants prescribed for post-herpetic neuralgia.\n\n【17】Like the antidepressants used for post-herpetic neuralgia, they should be started at a low dose, which is gradually increased over a few days or weeks. They also usually need to be taken for a few weeks before they start to take effect.\n\n【18】Not everyone gets side effects when taking gabapentin and pregabalin. Possible side effects can include dizziness, drowsiness, poor memory, increased appetite and weight gain.\n\n【19】If these medicines still do not help after several weeks, or if they're causing significant side effects, your dose will need to be gradually reduced.\n\n【20】Creams and plasters for post-herpetic neuralgia\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Your GP can prescribe treatments that you apply directly to the painful area.\n\n【22】Your GP may recommend these treatments if your pain is mild or if you cannot take antidepressants or anticonvulsants. Or your GP may prescribe them to use with other medicines if your pain is severe.\n\n【23】### Lidocaine plasters\n\n【24】Lidocaine plasters are sticking plasters that contain a local anaesthetic. They can be useful when pain affects sleeping or daytime activity. They cannot be used for more than 12 hours at a time.\n\n【25】### Capsaicin cream\n\n【26】Your GP can prescribe capsaicin as a low-dose cream for nerve pain. It can stop the nerves sending pain messages to the brain.\n\n【27】You apply it to the affected area a few times a day, but only when the rash has healed. It works by changing the way the nerve endings function.\n\n【28】High-strength capsaicin patches can also be used to treat post-herpetic neuralgia. They're available at specialist pain clinics and are applied as a single treatment in the clinic or at hospital. If effective, the treatment can be repeated, usually every few months depending on how your symptoms have improved.\n\n【29】Other treatments\n----------------\n\n【30】If your pain gets worse despite treatment, you may be referred to a specialist pain clinic to treat post-herpetic neuralgia. While waiting for your appointment, you might be offered a medication called tramadol.\n\n【31】Tramadol can be addictive if taken for long periods, so it should be prescribed for the shortest time possible and stopped if it does not help.\n\n【32】If other medicines have not helped, stronger painkillers, such as morphine-based medicines, may be recommended. These can be started by a GP but may need to be reviewed by a pain specialist. If these medicines do not help, they should be stopped.\n\n【33】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): questions to ask about drug treatments for neuropathic pain\n\n【34】Living with post-herpetic neuralgia\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】Living with post-herpetic neuralgia can be very difficult because it can affect your ability to carry out simple daily activities, such as dressing and bathing. It can also lead to further problems, including extreme tiredness, sleeping difficulties and depression.\n删除7：<u>Read more about getting help for your pain and ways to manage chronic pain.</u>\n\n【36】The British Pain Society, Pain Concern and Pain UK can also provide further help and support.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 January 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 January 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Post-herpetic neuralgia</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Some adults also can also have them.**\n\n【2】Check it's a night terror or nightmare\n--------------------------------------\n\n【3】Night terrors and nightmares are different and happen at different stages of sleep.\n\n【4】During a night terror you may talk and move about but are asleep. It's rare to remember having a night terror.\n\n【5】Nightmares are bad dreams you wake up from and can remember.\n\n【6】Night terrors are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8, while nightmares can affect both children and adults.\n\n【7】Differences between night terrors and nightmares.\n\n| Night terrors | Nightmares |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mainly affect children | Affect both children and adults |\n| Scream, shout, thrash about, jump out of bed, eyes open but not awake, will not remember it | Strong feelings of fear, child may wake up and be able to remember the dream |\n| Happen in the early part of the night, sometimes more than once, lasting up to 15 minutes | Happen later in the night |\n\n【9】Information:\n\n【10】If you cannot move or speak as you wake up or fall asleep, you may have sleep paralysis. This is not the same as having a night terror.\n\n【11】Causes of night terrors and nightmares\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Common causes of night terrors and nightmares include:\n\n【13】*   being very tired or unwell\n*   sudden noises at night or needing to pee during the night (which can affect your deep sleep)\n*   something that's frightened you (such as watching a scary film) or made you stressed, anxious or worried\n\n【14】They can also be caused by:\n\n【15】*   taking certain medicines, such as antidepressants\n*   conditions that affect sleep, such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnoea\n*   mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n*   conditions that affect the brain, such as dementia\n\n【16】Night terrors are more common in people with family members who have had night terrors or who sleepwalk.\n\n【17】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】*   your child has night terrors several times a night or has them most nights\n*   your child has lots of nightmares about the same thing\n*   you're having regular nightmares that are affecting your sleep and everyday life\n\n【19】How to help a child who has night terrors or nightmares\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】For most people, night terrors and nightmares get better on their own.\n\n【21】If your child is having night terrors or nightmares, there are things you can try to help.\n\n【22】### Do\n\n【23】*   try having a relaxing bedtime routine\n\n【24】*   keep a sleep diary (including things you did during the day and evening, how you were feeling and how you slept) to help identify any causes\n\n【25】*   try to deal with things that might be causing stress or anxiety\n\n【26】### How to help someone having night terrors\n\n【27】During a night terror, you should:\n\n【28】*   stay calm and wait for the person to calm down\n*   do not talk to them or try to stop them moving about, unless there's a risk they could hurt themselves or someone else\n*   do not try to wake them – they may not recognise you and may get more upset if you try to comfort them\n\n【29】If they're having a night terror at the same time every night, try waking them up 15 minutes before the night terror every night for a week. This can sometimes stop the night terrors happening.\n\n【30】Treatments for night terrors and nightmares\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Treatment for nightmares in adults depends on what may be causing them.\n\n【32】If you're having nightmares caused by a traumatic event, a GP may recommend psychological treatment such as counselling.\n\n【33】If you have a condition that affects your sleep, treatment will usually involve trying to manage the condition better.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 21 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 21 April 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n8.  Cautions with other medicines\n9.  Common questions about valproic acid\n\n【3】1\\. About valproic acid\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Valproic acid is usually used to treat bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】Some brands are used to treat epilepsy. It can also be used to prevent migraine.\n\n【6】This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules or tablets.\n\n【7】If taken during pregnancy, valproic acid can cause problems for a baby's development, including birth defects and long term learning difficulties. For this reason, valproic acid is not recommended if there's a chance that you could become pregnant.\n\n【8】For women and girls of childbearing age, if you do need to take valproic acid then your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【9】### Important: Valproate pregnancy prevention programme\n\n【10】The valproate pregnancy prevention programme is very important.\n\n【11】You should be reviewed every year by your doctor or nurse. They will assess whether you need to continue taking valproic acid or whether it is possible to change your medicine.\n\n【12】If you do need to continue taking valproic acid then you must be using reliable contraception, even if you are not currently sexually active. Your doctor or nurse can advise you about reliable contraception. You will be asked to sign a form to say that you are using contraception and understand the risks of becoming pregnant while taking valproic acid.\n\n【13】It's important to get advice as soon as possible if you think you are pregnant or might become pregnant while taking valproic acid. However, do not stop taking your medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【14】Updated: 18 October 2022\n\n【15】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【16】*   You'll usually take valproic acid 2 or 3 times a day. You can take it with or without food.\n*   You'll usually start on a low dose. Your dose will gradually increase over a few days or weeks.\n*   Sodium valproate and semisodium valproate are similar to valproic acid and work in the same way. However, these medicines are used to treat different conditions and doses will vary.\n*   There are also brands such as Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere and Dyzantil which contain mostly sodium valproate, with some valproic acid.\n*   If you're pregnant, or there's a chance you could become pregnant, valproic acid is not recommended for treating migraine. For epilepsy and bipolar disorder, your doctor will only prescribe valproic acid for you if there are no other suitable treatments.\n\n【17】3\\. Who can and cannot take valproic acid\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【18】Adults and children can take valproic acid to treat bipolar disorder or epilepsy.\n\n【19】Adults, aged 18 and above, can take it to prevent migraine.\n\n【20】Valproic acid is not suitable for girls or women who could become pregnant. However, in some cases it may be the only treatment option available, for example, for epilepsy where other treatments have not worked. Girls and women who need to take valproic acid must be on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【21】To make sure valproic acid is safe for you, tell your doctor if you:\n\n【22】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to valproic acid or any other medicine\n*   have liver problems\n*   have a rare metabolic or genetic condition such as porphyria, urea cycle disorder or mitochondrial disorder\n\n【23】4\\. How and when to take valproic acid\n--------------------------------------\n\n【24】Valproic acid is a prescription medicine. It's important to take it as your doctor tells you.\n\n【25】### Dosage\n\n【26】The usual dose for treating bipolar disorder for:\n\n【27】*   adults – 750mg to 2,000mg a day, split into 2 or 3 doses\n*   children – the doctor will work out the right dose for your child\n\n【28】The usual dose for preventing migraine for:\n\n【29】*   adults – 500mg to 1,000mg a day, split into 2 or 3 doses\n\n【30】The usual dose for treating epilepsy for:\n\n【31】*   adults and older children (aged 12 years and over) – 600mg to 2,000mg a day, split into 2 to 4 doses\n*   younger children (weighing more than 20kg) – the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose for them\n\n【32】If you need to take your medicine more than once a day, you'll take equal doses that add up to your daily total. Ask your doctor or a pharmacist if you're unsure how much to take each time.\n\n【33】If you're taking valproic acid and have kidney problems, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose.\n\n【34】### How and when take it\n\n【35】Valproic acid comes as gastro resistant tablets and capsules. These release the valproic acid into your body as soon as they pass through your stomach.\n\n【36】Swallow the tablets or capsules whole with a drink of water or juice. Do not chew them.\n\n【37】You can take valproic acid with or without food, but it's best to do the same each time.\n\n【38】If you're taking valproic acid twice a day, try to leave a gap of 10 to 12 hours between doses. For example you could take your first dose in the morning (between 7am and 8am) and your second dose in the evening (between 7pm and 8pm).\n\n【39】If you take it 3 to 4 times a day, try to space your doses evenly throughout the day. If you need to take 3 doses, for example, you could take a dose first thing in the morning, early afternoon and bedtime.\n\n【40】### Will my dose go up or down?\n\n【41】To reduce the chance of side effects, your doctor will start you off on a low dose of valproic acid. They will increase it gradually over a few days or weeks.\n\n【42】Once you find a dose that suits you, it will usually stay the same, unless your condition changes, or your doctor starts you on a new medicine that may interfere with valproic acid.\n\n【43】### What if I forget to take it?\n\n【44】If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's less than 2 hours to your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next one at the usual time.\n\n【45】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【46】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses can trigger a seizure.\n\n【47】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【48】### What if I take too much?\n\n【49】Taking too much valproic acid can lead to symptoms such as:\n\n【50】*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   headaches, or feeling dizzy\n*   muscle weakness\n*   breathing problems\n*   feeling confused, or changes to your normal behaviour\n*   passing out\n\n【51】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【52】*   you take too much valproic acid and feel unwell\n\n【53】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【54】If you need to go to A&E, take the valproic acid packet or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【55】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【56】Like all medicines, valproic acid can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them.\n\n【57】### Common side effects\n\n【58】These common side effects may happen in more than 1 in 100 people. They're usually mild and go away by themselves.\n\n【59】Keep taking the medicine but talk to your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【60】*   stomach pain, feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums\n*   shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements\n*   feeling tired or sleepy\n*   headache\n*   weight gain\n*   thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair\n*   irregular or delayed periods\n\n【61】### Serious side effects\n\n【62】It's unusual to have serious side effects after taking valproic acid. Tell a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【63】*   thoughts of harming or killing yourself – a small number of people taking valproic acid have had suicidal thoughts\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes or your skin, although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin, and dark pee – these may be signs of liver problems\n*   long-lasting and severe nausea, vomiting or stomach pain – these may be signs of acute pancreatitis (an inflamed pancreas)\n*   unusual bruises or bleeding – these may be signs of a blood disorder\n\n【64】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【65】In rare cases, valproic acid may cause a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\n【66】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【67】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【68】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【69】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【70】These are not all the side effects of valproic acid. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【71】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【72】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【73】6\\. How to cope with side effects of valproic acid\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【74】**What to do about:**\n\n【75】*   **stomach pain, feeling or being sick** – take valproic acid with or after a meal or snack. It may also help if you avoid rich or spicy food. Take small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration.\n*   **diarrhoea** – drink plenty of fluids such as water or squash to avoid dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n*   **dry or sore mouth, or swollen gums** – for a dry mouth try sugar-free gum or sweets, or sipping cold drinks. If this does not help, or you have mouth ulcers, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. If you're bothered by swollen gums or this symptom does not go away, talk to your doctor or dentist.\n*   **shakes (tremors) in a part of your body, or unusual eye movements** – talk to your doctor if this is bothering you. These symptoms can be a sign that your dose is too high. Talk to your doctor as they may want to change your dose or suggest you take it at a different time.\n*   **feeling tired or sleepy** – as your body gets used to valproic acid, these side effects should wear off. If these symptoms do not get better within a week or two, your doctor may either reduce your dose or increase it more slowly. If that does not work, talk to your doctor as they may want to switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **headaches** – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n*   **weight gain** – if you find you're putting on weight after taking valproic acid, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine. Speak to them if you have any concerns.\n*   **thinning hair, or changes to the colour or texture of your hair** – if these symptoms bother you, ask your doctor whether it's possible to lower your dose. Your hair may regrow after either reducing your dose or switching to a different medicine.\n*   **irregular or delayed periods** – if you usually have regular periods, take a pregnancy test if your period is late, and speak to your doctor if the result is positive. As well as being a side effect of valproic acid, a late period is a sign that you could be pregnant, and valproic acid can be harmful for an unborn baby. Changes to your periods can also be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a rare side effect of valproic acid. Your doctor will be able to do some tests to check whether you have PCOS.\n\n【76】7\\. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【77】### Valproid acid and pregnancy\n\n【78】Valproic acid is not recommended in pregnancy, as it can cause birth defects and problems with your baby's learning and behaviour.\n\n【79】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【80】If you think you might already be pregnant, contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\n\n【81】If you're taking valproic acid for epilepsy or bipolar disorder and you become pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first. This is because your symptoms may get worse.\n\n【82】Your doctor may continue to prescribe valproic acid, but only if there's no other suitable treatment for your epilepsy or bipolar disorder.\n\n【83】For pregnant women with recurrent migraine your doctor should offer you an alternative treatment to valproic acid.\n\n【84】Information:\n\n【85】You must have a review of your treatment every year. Contact your doctor or specialist now if you have not had one.\n\n【86】### Valproic acid and breastfeeding\n\n【87】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy you can take valproic acid while breastfeeding.\n\n【88】Valproic acid passes into breast milk in small amounts but it's unlikely to harm your baby so you can continue breastfeeding if your doctor says you need to take it.\n\n【89】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking this medicine, your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. Your doctor may still recommend valproic acid if it is the only medicine that works for you.\n\n【90】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first as your symptoms may get worse. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【91】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【92】*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   your baby is bruising more easily than usual\n*   the whites of your baby's eyes turn yellow or your baby's skin turns yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin), or your baby has dark pee or pale poo – these can be signs of jaundice\n*   you have any other concerns about your baby\n\n【93】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【94】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【95】### More information\n\n【96】*   Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website – information about how valproic acid can affect you and your baby during pregnancy\n*   NHS England letter to all women and girls aged 12 to 55 taking sodium valproate (includes valproic acid), available in different languages\n*   Valproate pregnancy prevention programme patient guide: what women and girls need to know about valproate (PDF, 341kb)\n\n【97】8\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【98】There are some medicines that may affect how valproic acid works. Valproic acid can also affect the way other medicines work.\n\n【99】Tell your doctor if you're taking any of these medicines:\n\n【100】*   any other medicines for epilepsy such as carbamazepine\n*   medicines for preventing blood clots such as warfarin\n*   aspirin for pain relief or low-dose aspirin\n*   cimetidine, a medicine for stomach ulcers\n*   medicines to treat HIV and AIDS such as ritonavir\n*   antibiotics such as erythromycin\n*   medicines for depression or other mental health problems such as venlafaxine, quetiapine or diazepam\n*   cholesterol-lowering medicines such as cholestyramine\n*   medicines to prevent malaria such as mefloquine or chloroquine\n\n【101】### Mixing valproic acid with herbal remedies or supplements\n\n【102】It's not possible to say whether complementary medicines and herbal supplements are safe to take with valproic acid.\n\n【103】They're not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【104】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【105】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【106】9\\. Common questions about valproic acid\n----------------------------------------\n\n【107】How does valproic acid work?\n\n【108】Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine.\n\n【109】It's not fully understood how this medicine works for treating bipolar disorder. However valproic acid is thought to reduce or prevent manic episodes by increasing the amount of a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA blocks transmission across nerves in the brain and has a calming effect.\n\n【110】It's not clear how valproic acid prevents migraine. It may limit how your nerves transmit pain signals in the brain.\n\n【111】For treating epilepsy, valproic acid prevents epileptic seizures by reducing excessive electrical activity in your brain.\n\n【112】When will I feel better?\n\n【113】It takes a few weeks for valproic acid to work properly. You may still have symptoms during this time.\n\n【114】How long will I take it for?\n\n【115】Once your condition is under control, you'll usually need to keep taking valproic acid for many years.\n\n【116】Can I get addicted to valproic acid?\n\n【117】Valproic acid is not known to be addictive.\n\n【118】Is it safe to take it for a long time?\n\n【119】Many people can take valproic acid safely for many months or years.\n\n【120】However there are potential side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with valproic acid can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【121】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【122】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【123】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your epilepsy ones).\n\n【124】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【125】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【126】Are there similar medicines to valproic acid?\n\n【127】Sodium valproate and semisodium valproate are very similar to valproic acid. They work in the same way but these medicines are sometimes given at different doses for different conditions.\n\n【128】If you decide to try sodium valproate or semisodium valproate instead, your doctor will explain how to come off valproic acid safely.\n\n【129】How does valproic acid compare with other medicines for treating bipolar disorder?\n\n【130】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent mood swings and treat mania. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【131】Lithium is commonly used for bipolar disorder, as well as anti-epileptic medicines like valproic acid and antipsychotic medicines like olanzapine. You can take valproic acid instead of lithium, or together with lithium, depending on what your doctor recommends.\n\n【132】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you. It depends on your mood swings, how often they happen, how severe they are and how well you cope with a medicine.\n\n【133】How does it compare with other medicines for migraine?\n\n【134】For many people topiramate, propranolol and amitriptyline work better than valproic acid at preventing migraines. These medicines are likely to cause fewer side effects, so your doctor or specialist will usually prescribe one of these first.\n\n【135】Valproic acid is not used as often for preventing migraine. However your doctor may recommend it if these other medicines are causing side effects or are not working for you.\n\n【136】Your doctor may also prescribe valproic acid if you have a health problem that means you cannot take other migraine medicines.\n\n【137】How does it compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【138】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy. It's not possible to say that one works better than the others. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【139】Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor will also take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【140】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will try you on a different one.\n\n【141】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more anti-epileptic medicines at the same time.\n\n【142】If valproic acid is giving you side effects, or you're worried it's not suitable for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【143】Other anti-epileptic medicines include:\n\n【144】*   carbamazepine\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   topiramate\n\n【145】What will happen when I come off it?\n\n【146】Do not stop taking valproic acid suddenly, unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【147】You're unlikely to get any extra symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. However if you're taking it for bipolar disorder or to prevent migraine, your condition could get worse for a short time after you stop taking the medicine.\n\n【148】If you're taking valproic acid for epilepsy, it's possible that you'll get seizures again once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing your dose of valproic acid gradually.\n\n【149】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【150】Valproic acid can affect recreational drugs like cannabis and heroin.\n\n【151】If you use recreational drugs alongside valproic acid, you may be more likely to have side effects like panic attacks, anxiety and memory loss.\n\n【152】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【153】Drinking alcohol while taking valproic acid may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【154】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【155】Valproic acid can reduce fertility in both men and women. Once you stop taking this medicine, your fertility will return.\n\n【156】In men valproic acid has been reported to cause infertility. However, this is rare.\n\n【157】In women it can change your menstrual cycle, causing delayed or missed periods. Valproic acid has also been reported to cause polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though this happens rarely.\n\n【158】Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about how valproic acid may affect your fertility.\n\n【159】Valproic acid is not recommended if there's a chance you could become pregnant. If you're taking valproic acid and want to start a family, it's important to talk to your doctor as soon as possible. This is because taking valproic acid while pregnant can harm your baby.\n\n【160】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【161】Valproic acid does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【162】If there's a chance you could become pregnant while taking sodium valproate you must use contraception. Your doctor will put you on Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme.\n\n【163】Speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you have any questions about this programme.\n\n【164】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【165】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking valproic acid. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel more alert.\n\n【166】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year (or only have seizures while you're asleep).\n\n【167】If you change your epilepsy medicine, your doctor will tell you whether you need to stop driving and for how long.\n\n【168】Information:\n\n【169】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【170】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【171】*   Bipolar disorder\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Migraine\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【172】*   NHS England letter to all women and girls taking sodium valproate (includes valproic acid).

How it's performed\n3.  Who can have one</u>\n\n【2】**A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a painless procedure that lasts 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the size of the area being scanned and the number of images being taken.**\n\n【3】Before the scan\n---------------\n\n【4】On the day of your MRI scan, you should be able to eat, drink and take any medication as usual, unless you're advised otherwise.\n\n【5】In some cases, you may be asked not to eat or drink anything for up to 4 hours before the scan, and sometimes you may be asked to drink a fairly large amount of water beforehand. This depends on the area being scanned.\n\n【6】When you arrive at the hospital, you'll usually be asked to fill in a questionnaire about your health and medical history. This helps the medical staff ensure you have the scan safely.\n删除7：<u>Read more about who can and can't have an MRI scan.</u>\n\n【7】Once you have completed the questionnaire, you'll usually be asked to give your signed consent for the scan to go ahead.\n\n【8】As the MRI scanner produces strong magnetic fields, it's important to remove any metal objects from your body.\n\n【9】These include:\n\n【10】*   watches\n*   jewellery, such as rings and necklaces\n*   piercings, such as ear, nipple and nose rings\n*   dentures (false teeth)\n*   hearing aids\n*   wigs (some wigs contain traces of metal)\n\n【11】It's best not to bring any valuables with you to your scan, but if you do they can usually be stored in a secure locker.\n\n【12】Depending on which part of your body is being scanned, you may need to wear a hospital gown during the procedure.\n\n【13】If you don't need to wear a gown, you should wear clothes without metal zips, fasteners, buttons, underwire (bras), belts or buckles.\n\n【14】### Contrast agent\n\n【15】Some MRI scans involve having an injection of contrast agent (dye). This makes certain tissues and blood vessels show up more clearly and in greater detail.\n\n【16】Sometimes the contrast agent can cause side effects, such as:\n\n【17】*   feeling or being sick\n*   a skin rash\n*   a headache\n*   dizziness\n\n【18】These side effects are usually mild and don't last very long.\n\n【19】It's also possible for contrast agent to cause tissue and organ damage in people with severe kidney disease.\n\n【20】If you have a history of kidney disease, you may be given a blood test to determine how well your kidneys are functioning and whether it's safe to proceed with the scan.\n\n【21】You should let the staff know if you have a history of allergic reactions or any blood clotting problems before having the injection.\n\n【22】### Anaesthesia and sedatives\n\n【23】An MRI scan is a painless procedure, so anaesthesia (painkilling medication) isn't usually needed.\n\n【24】If you're claustrophobic, you can ask for a sedative to help you relax. You should ask your consultant well in advance of having the scan.\n\n【25】If you decide to have a sedative during the scan, you'll need to arrange for a friend or family member to drive you home afterwards, as you won't be able to drive for 24 hours.\n\n【26】Babies and young children may be given a general anaesthetic before having an MRI scan.\n\n【27】This is because it's very important to stay still during the scan, which babies and young children are often unable to do when they're awake.\n\n【28】During the scan\n---------------\n\n【29】An MRI scanner is a short cylinder that's open at both ends. You'll lie on a motorised bed that's moved inside the scanner.\n\n【30】You'll enter the scanner either head first or feet first, depending on the part of your body being scanned.\n\n【31】In some cases, a frame may be placed over the body part being scanned, such as the head or chest.\n\n【32】This frame contains receivers that pick up the signals sent out by your body during the scan and it can help to create a better-quality image.\n\n【33】A computer is used to operate the MRI scanner, which is located in a different room to keep it away from the magnetic field generated by the scanner.\n\n【34】The radiographer operates the computer, so they'll also be in a separate room to you.\n\n【35】But you'll be able to talk to them, usually through an intercom, and they'll be able to see you at all times on a television monitor and through the viewing window throughout the scan.\n\n【36】A friend or family member may be allowed to stay with you while you're having your scan. Children can usually have a parent with them.\n\n【37】Anyone who stays with you will be asked if they have a pacemaker or any other metal objects in their body.\n\n【38】They'll also have to follow the same guidelines regarding clothing and the removal of metallic objects.\n\n【39】To avoid the images being blurred, it's very important to keep your whole body still throughout the scan until the radiographer tells you to relax.\n\n【40】A single scan may take from a few seconds to 3 or 4 minutes. You may be asked to hold your breath during short scans.\n\n【41】Depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken, the whole procedure will take 15 to 90 minutes.\n\n【42】The MRI scanner will make loud tapping noises at certain times during the procedure. This is the electric current in the scanner coils being turned on and off. You'll be given earplugs or headphones to wear.\n\n【43】You're usually able to listen to music through headphones during the scan if you want to, and in some cases you can bring your own CD.\n\n【44】You'll be moved out of the scanner when your scan is over.\n\n【45】After the scan\n--------------\n\n【46】An MRI scan is usually carried out as an outpatient procedure. This means you won't need to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【47】After the scan, you can resume normal activities immediately. But if you have had a sedative, a friend or relative will need to take you home and stay with you for the first 24 hours.\n\n【48】It's not safe to drive, operate heavy machinery or drink alcohol for 24 hours after having a sedative.\n\n【49】Your MRI scan needs to be studied by a radiologist (a doctor trained in interpreting scans and X-rays) and possibly discussed with other specialists. \n\n【50】This means it's unlikely you'll get the results of your scan immediately.\n\n【51】The radiologist will send a report to the doctor who arranged the scan, who will discuss the results with you.\n\n【52】It usually takes a week or two for the results of an MRI scan to come through, unless they're needed urgently.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 July 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 July 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : MRI scan</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Who can have one</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer.**\n\n【3】Your recommended treatment plan will depend on:\n\n【4】*   the type of testicular cancer you have – whether it's a seminoma or a non-seminoma\n*   the stage of your testicular cancer\n\n【5】The first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy).\n\n【6】For stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed a single dose of chemotherapy may be given to help prevent the cancer returning.\n\n【7】A short course of radiotherapy is also sometimes recommended.\n\n【8】But in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you're very carefully monitored over the next few years.\n\n【9】Further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.\n\n【10】For stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.\n\n【11】For stage 2 and 3 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications.\n\n【12】Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.\n\n【13】Some people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of chemotherapy.\n\n【14】In non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.\n\n【15】Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\n\n【16】Before discussing your treatment options with your specialist, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them.\n\n【17】For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\n\n【18】Orchidectomy\n------------\n\n【19】An orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle.\n\n【20】If you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading.\n\n【21】By removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved. Your sex life and ability to father children will not be affected.\n\n【22】About 1 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle.\n\n【23】In such circumstances, it's sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. You should ask your surgeon about this if you're in this position.\n\n【24】If testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require.\n\n【25】An orchidectomy is not carried out through the scrotum. It's done by making a cut in your groin that the testicle is removed through, along with all the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the tummy. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.\n\n【26】You can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so the appearance of your testicles is not greatly affected.\n\n【27】The artificial testicle is usually made of silicone, a soft type of plastic. It probably will not be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. It may be slightly different in size or texture.\n\n【28】After an orchidectomy, it's often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. If only 1 testicle is removed, there should not be any lasting side effects.\n\n【29】If both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you'll be infertile.\n\n【30】But removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date.\n\n【31】You may be able to bank your sperm before having a bilateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.\n\n【32】### Sperm banking\n\n【33】Most people are still fertile after having 1 testicle removed. But some treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility.\n\n【34】Some people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops.\n\n【35】For some treatments, such as chemotherapy, infertility may occur, but standard chemotherapies have a less than 50% chance of causing infertility if the remaining testicle is normal.\n\n【36】In people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), the ability to ejaculate may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm.\n\n【37】Before your treatment begins, you may want to consider sperm banking.\n\n【38】This is where a sample of your sperm is frozen so it can be used at a later date to impregnate your partner during artificial insemination.\n\n【39】Before sperm banking, you may be asked to have tests for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.\n\n【40】If you're having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 and 3 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. Ask if you're concerned about your fertility.\n\n【41】Not all men are suitable for sperm banking. For the technique to work, the sperm has to be of a reasonably high quality.\n\n【42】There may also be situations where it's considered too dangerous to delay treatment for sperm banking to take place.\n\n【43】Most NHS cancer treatment centres offer a free sperm banking service. But it's up to each area of the country to decide whether they store sperm for free or whether you have to pay.\n删除7：<u>Cancer Research UK has more information about sperm banking, including the cost of sperm storage.</u>\n\n【44】### Testosterone replacement therapy\n\n【45】If you still have a remaining healthy testicle, it should make enough testosterone so you will not notice any difference.\n\n【46】If there are any problems with your remaining testicle, you may experience symptoms caused by a lack of testosterone.\n\n【47】These symptoms can be caused for other reasons, but can include:\n\n【48】*   tiredness\n*   weight gain\n*   loss of libido (sex drive)\n*   reduced beard growth\n*   reduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\n\n【49】Having both testicles removed will definitely stop you producing testosterone and you'll develop the above symptoms.\n\n【50】Testosterone replacement therapy is where you're given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin.\n\n【51】If you have injections, you'll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months.\n\n【52】After having testosterone replacement therapy, you'll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve.\n\n【53】Side effects associated with this type of treatment are uncommon, and any side effects that you do experience will usually be mild.\n\n【54】They may include:\n\n【55】*   oily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset of acne\n*   breast enlargement and swelling\n*   a change in normal peeing patterns, such as needing to pee more frequently or having problems peeing caused by an enlarged prostate gland that puts pressure on your bladder\n\n【56】If you use testosterone gel, wash your hands after using it and cover the area with clothing. It's important to avoid getting it on other people because it can cause them to have side effects if they come into contact with it regularly.\n\n【57】Lymph node and lung surgery\n---------------------------\n\n【58】More advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of your body's immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection.\n\n【59】Lymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The lymph nodes in your tummy are the nodes most likely to need removing.\n\n【60】In some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.\n\n【61】If you have retrograde ejaculation, you'll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you will not be able to father a child.\n\n【62】There are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder.\n\n【63】Men who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or IVF.\n\n【64】Some people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs, and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they have not disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size.\n\n【65】This type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and does not usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.\n\n【66】### Nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection\n\n【67】A newer type of lymph node surgery called nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility.\n\n【68】In nerve-sparing RPLND, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. This means there's less chance of nerve damage occurring.\n\n【69】The disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding.\n\n【70】Nerve-sparing RPLND is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training.\n\n【71】### Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection\n\n【72】Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND) is a type of keyhole surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes.\n\n【73】During LRPLND, the surgeon will make a number of small cuts in your tummy.\n\n【74】An instrument called an endoscope is inserted into 1 of the cuts. An endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at 1 end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor.\n\n【75】Small surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes.\n\n【76】The advantage of LRPLND is that there's less postoperative pain and a quicker recovery time.\n\n【77】Also, as with nerve-sparing RPLND, in LRPLND there's a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to retrograde ejaculation.\n\n【78】But as LRPLND is a new technique, there's little available evidence regarding the procedure's long-term safety and effectiveness.\n\n【79】If you're considering LRPLND, you should understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.\n\n【80】Radiotherapy\n------------\n\n【81】Radiotherapy uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells.\n\n【82】Sometimes seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\n\n【83】It may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies usually used to treat stage 2 and 3 testicular cancer.\n\n【84】If testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy.\n\n【85】Side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n\n【86】*   reddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to sunburn\n*   feeling sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   fatigue\n\n【87】These side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.\n\n【88】Chemotherapy\n------------\n\n【89】Chemotherapy uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.\n\n【90】You may require chemotherapy if you have advanced testicular cancer or it's spread within your body. It's also used to help prevent the cancer returning.\n\n【91】Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours.\n\n【92】Chemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein.\n\n【93】In some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so you do not have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein.\n\n【94】Sometimes chemotherapy medicines can attack your body's normal, healthy cells. This is why it can have many different side effects.\n\n【95】The most common include:\n\n【96】*   being sick\n*   feeling sick\n*   hair loss\n*   sore mouth and mouth ulcers\n*   loss of appetite\n*   fatigue\n*   breathlessness and lung damage\n*   infertility\n*   ringing in your ears (tinnitus)\n*   skin that bleeds or bruises easily\n*   low blood count\n*   increased vulnerability to infection\n*   numbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet\n*   kidney damage\n\n【97】These side effects are usually only temporary and should improve after you have completed your treatment.\n\n【98】Side effects, such as infections that occur when you have a low blood count, can be life threatening, and it's essential that you always call your cancer care team if you're worried between chemotherapy treatments.\n\n【99】### Bleomycin\n\n【100】One of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage.\n\n【101】You should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle.\n\n【102】But the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure.\n\n【103】### Having children\n\n【104】You should not father children while having chemotherapy and for a year after your treatment has finished.\n\n【105】This is because chemotherapy medications can temporarily damage your sperm, increasing your risk of fathering a baby with serious birth defects.\n\n【106】You'll need to use a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, during this time.\n\n【107】Condoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy.\n\n【108】This is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the side effects of chemotherapy</u>\n\n【109】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【110】Even if your cancer has been completely cured, there's a risk it'll return. \n\n【111】The risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at when you were diagnosed and what treatment you have had since.\n\n【112】Most recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy.\n\n【113】In seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. Recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people.\n\n【114】Because of the risk of recurrence, you'll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned.\n\n【115】These include:\n\n【116】*   a physical examination\n*   blood tests to check for tumour markers\n*   a chest X-ray\n*   a CT scan\n\n【117】Follow-up and testing is usually recommended depending on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered.\n\n【118】This is usually more frequent in the first year or 2, but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years.\n\n【119】In certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer.\n\n【120】If the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer and it's diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy.\n\n【121】Some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%.\n\n【122】Recurrences that happen after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you'll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you.\n删除7：<u>Cancer Research UK has more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 June 2019  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 June 2022</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It may involve patients, healthy people, or both.**\n\n【2】How do I take part in a clinical trial?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【3】You can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any clinical trials that you may be eligible to join.\n\n【4】You can also search for information on a number of websites and register your interest in taking part in research.\n\n【5】### Be Part of Research website\n\n【6】The Be Part of Research website has information about clinical trials and other research from several different UK registers.\n\n【7】You can also search the Be Part of Research site to find trials relevant to you, and you can contact researchers yourself.\n\n【8】### World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials\n\n【9】The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) website provides access to clinical trials in countries all around the world.\n\n【10】### Charities\n\n【11】For some health conditions, you can find out about clinical trials from the websites of charities.\n\n【12】Examples are:\n\n【13】*   Versus Arthritis: Our current research\n*   Cancer Research UK: Find a clinical trial\n*   Multiple Sclerosis Society: Be in a study\n*   Target Ovarian Cancer: Clinical trials\n*   Parkinson's UK: Take part in research\n*   Blood Cancer UK: Clinical trials information hub\n*   Alzheimer's Research UK: Getting involved in research\n\n【14】Why join a clinical trial?\n--------------------------\n\n【15】Clinical trials help doctors understand how to treat a particular illness. It may benefit you, or others like you, in the future.\n\n【16】If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be one of the first people to benefit from a new treatment.\n\n【17】But there's also a chance that the new treatment turns out to be no better, or worse, than the standard treatment.\n\n【18】To hear other people's experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit the healthtalk.org website\n\n【19】Will I get paid?\n----------------\n\n【20】Some clinical trials offer payment, which can vary depending on what's involved and expected from you.\n\n【21】Some trials do not offer payment and just cover your travel expenses.\n\n【22】It's important to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before you sign up, and to carefully weigh up whether it's worth it.\n\n【23】Bear in mind:\n\n【24】*   it can be time consuming – you may be expected to attend a number of screening and follow-up sessions, and some trials require you to stay overnight\n*   there may be restrictions on what you can and cannot do – for example, you may be asked to not eat, or not drink alcohol, for a period of time\n*   you may experience unknown side effects from the treatment\n\n【25】What happens in a clinical trial?\n---------------------------------\n\n【26】### Testing a new medicine\n\n【27】All clinical trials of new medicines go through a series of phases to test whether they're safe and whether they work.\n\n【28】The medicines will usually be tested against another treatment called a control.\n\n【29】This will either be a dummy treatment (a placebo) or a standard treatment already in use.\n\n【30】#### Phase 1 trials:\n\n【31】*   A small number of people, who may be healthy volunteers, are given the medicine.\n*   The drug is being trialled in human volunteers for the first time.\n*   Researchers test for side effects and calculate what the right dose might be to use in treatment.\n*   Researchers start with small doses and only increase the dose if the volunteers do not experience any side effects, or if they only experience minor side effects.\n\n【32】#### Phase 2 trials:\n\n【33】*   The new medicine is tested on a larger group of people who are ill. This is to get a better idea of its effects in the short term.\n\n【34】#### Phase 3 trials:\n\n【35】*   Carried out on medicines that have passed phases 1 and 2.\n*   The medicine is tested in larger groups of people who are ill, and compared against an existing treatment or a placebo to see if it's better in practice and if it has important side effects.\n*   Trials often last a year or more and involve several thousand patients.\n\n【36】#### Phase 4 trials:\n\n【37】*   The safety, side effects and effectiveness of the medicine continue to be studied while it's being used in practice.\n*   Not required for every medicine.\n*   Only carried out on medicines that have passed all the previous stages and have been given marketing licences – a licence means the medicine is available on prescription.\n\n【38】### Control groups, randomisation and blinding\n\n【39】If you take part in a clinical trial, you'll usually be randomly assigned to either the:\n\n【40】*   treatment group – where you'll be given the treatment being assessed, or\n*   control group – where you'll be given an existing standard treatment, or a placebo if no proven standard treatment exists\n\n【41】While the treatments are different in the 2 groups, researchers try to keep as many of the other conditions the same as possible.\n\n【42】For example, both groups should have people of a similar age, with a similar proportion of men and women, who are in similar overall health.\n\n【43】In most trials, a computer will be used to randomly decide which group each patient will be allocated to.\n\n【44】Many trials are set up so nobody knows who's been allocated to receive which treatment.\n\n【45】This is known as blinding, and it helps reduce the effects of bias when comparing the outcomes of the treatments.\n\n【46】What should I know before I sign up?\n------------------------------------\n\n【47】When you express interest in a trial, a doctor or nurse is likely to tell you something about it in person.\n\n【48】You'll also be given some printed information to take away.\n\n【49】You may come back with some questions you feel have not been answered.\n\n【50】### General questions\n\n【51】*   What's the aim of the trial and how will it help people?\n*   Who's funding the trial?\n*   What treatment will I get if I do not take part in the trial?\n*   How long is the trial expected to last, and how long will I have to take part?\n*   How long will it be before the results of the trial are known?\n*   What will happen if I stop the trial treatment or leave the trial before it ends?\n*   What would happen if something went wrong? It's rare for patients to be harmed by trial treatments, but you may want to ask about compensation if this were to happen.\n\n【52】### Practical questions\n\n【53】*   How much of my time will be needed?\n*   Will I need to take time off work?\n*   Will I be paid?\n*   Will the costs of my travel to take part in the trial be covered?\n*   If the trial is testing a new drug, will I have to collect it from the hospital, will it be sent to me by post, or will I get it through my doctor?\n*   Will I have to complete questionnaires or keep a diary?\n*   What are the possible side effects of my treatment?\n*   How could the treatments affect me physically and emotionally?\n*   Who can I contact if I have a problem?\n*   Will someone be available 24 hours a day?\n*   How do I find out the results of the trial?\n\n【54】### Things to weigh up\n\n【55】As with any treatment, you cannot be sure of the outcome.\n\n【56】You may be given a new treatment that turns out not to be as effective as the standard treatment.\n\n【57】Also, it's possible you'll experience unexpected side effects.\n\n【58】And bear in mind that you may have to visit your place of treatment more often, or have more tests, treatments or monitoring, than you would if you were receiving the standard treatment in usual care.\n\n【59】### Leaving a trial\n\n【60】You may decide to stop taking part in a trial if your condition is getting worse or you feel the treatment is not helping you.\n\n【61】You can also choose to leave at any point without giving a reason and without it affecting the care you receive.\n\n【62】### Results\n\n【63】At the end of the trial, the researchers should publish the results and make them available to anyone who took part and wanted to know the results.\n\n【64】If the researchers do not offer you the results and you want to know, ask for them.\n\n【65】Some research funders, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have websites where they publish the results of the research they have supported.\n\n【66】Visit the NIHR website to find out more\n\n【67】How are trials regulated and judged ethical?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) needs to review and authorise it.\n\n【69】The MHRA also inspects sites where trials take place to make sure they're conducted in line with good clinical practice.\n\n【70】Visit the GOV.UK website to read about the MHRA\n\n【71】The Health Research Authority (HRA) works to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research. \n\n【72】It's responsible for research ethics committees up and down the country.\n\n【73】All medical research involving people in the UK, whether in the NHS or the private sector, first has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee.\n\n【74】The committee protects the rights and interests of the people who will be in the trial.\n\n【75】Find out more on the HRA website\n\n【76】How are trial results used to improve treatment?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【77】Clinical trials can help:\n\n【78】*   prevent illnesses by testing a vaccine\n*   detect or diagnose illnesses by testing a scan or blood test\n*   treat illnesses by testing new or existing medicines\n*   find out how people can control their symptoms or improve their quality of life – for example, by testing how a particular diet affects an illness\n\n【79】Many clinical trials are designed to show whether new medicines work as expected.\n\n【80】These results are sent to the MHRA, which decides whether to allow the company making the medicine to market it for a particular use.\n\n【81】### Licensing a treatment\n\n【82】If research has identified a new medicine, the MHRA must license it before it can be marketed.\n\n【83】Licensing shows a treatment has met certain standards of safety and effectiveness.\n\n【84】Safety must be monitored carefully over the first few years of a newly licensed treatment.\n\n【85】This is because rare side effects that were not obvious in clinical trials may show up for the first time.\n\n【86】In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the NHS should provide treatments.\n\n【87】Find out more on the NICE website\n\n【88】Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【89】The results of clinical trials are usually published in specialist medical journals and online libraries of evidence.\n\n【90】Some of the most well-known examples are:\n\n【91】*   The Lancet medical journal\n*   British Medical Journal (BMJ)\n*   The New England Journal of Medicine\n*   Cochrane Library – a collection of high-quality evidence\n\n【92】You can use a search engine such as Google to look for articles and read summaries (abstracts).\n\n【93】But you cannot usually see the full articles without a subscription to the journal.\n\n【94】Also, research papers are not written in plain English and often use many medical, scientific and statistical terms. They can be very difficult to understand.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 December 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 December 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**It's not known what causes spina bifida but a number of things can increase the risk of a baby developing the condition.**\n\n【3】Lack of folic acid\n------------------\n\n【4】Not having enough folic acid during pregnancy is one of the most important factors that can increase your chances of having a child with spina bifida.\n\n【5】Folic acid (also known as vitamin B9) occurs naturally in some foods, such as broccoli, peas and brown rice. It's also added to foods, such as some breakfast cereals. Folic acid tablets are available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you. \n\n【6】It's estimated that taking folic acid supplements before you conceive and while you're pregnant may prevent up to 7 out of 10 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.\n\n【7】It's not clear how folic acid helps prevent spina bifida. It's likely that folic acid is needed for important biochemical reactions in the body.\n删除7：<u>Read more about why you need folic acid in pregnancy.</u>\n\n【8】Family history\n--------------\n\n【9】Having a family member with a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida, increases your chances of having a baby with spina bifida.\n\n【10】If you've previously had a child with spina bifida, your chance of having other children with the condition is increased.\n\n【11】If you have a family history of spina bifida, it's very important that you take high-dose folic acid, prescribed by a GP before you become pregnant, and for at least the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【12】Medicine\n--------\n\n【13】Taking certain medicines during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of having a baby with spina bifida or other birth defects.\n\n【14】Valproate and carbamazepine are medicines linked to spina bifida. They're often used to treat epilepsy, and some mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder.\n\n【15】Doctors will try to avoid prescribing these medicines if there's a chance you could get pregnant while taking them, but they may be needed if the alternatives are not effective.\n\n【16】It's advisable to use a reliable form of contraception if you need to take one of these medicines and are not trying to get pregnant.\n\n【17】Tell your doctor if you're thinking about trying for a baby and you need to take one of these medicines. They may be able to lower the dose and prescribe folic acid supplements at a higher than normal dose, to reduce the risk of problems.\n\n【18】If you're not sure whether a medicine could affect your pregnancy, check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before taking it. Never stop taking a prescribed medicine unless a GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care advises you to.\n\n【19】Genetic conditions\n------------------\n\n【20】Very rarely a baby can have spina bifida alongside a genetic condition such as Patau's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Down's syndrome.\n\n【21】If your baby is found to have spina bifida and it's thought they may also have one of these syndromes, you'll be offered a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These tests can confirm if your baby has one of these genetic conditions. \n\n【22】Other risk factors\n------------------\n\n【23】Other risk factors for spina bifida include:\n\n【24】*   obesity – women who are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or more) are more likely to have a child with spina bifida than those of average weight\n*   diabetes – women with diabetes may have an increased risk of having a child with spina bifida\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The affected tendon may then suddenly break free, releasing your finger like the release of a trigger.\n\n【6】Who's most at risk?\n-------------------\n\n【7】The exact cause of trigger finger is not fully understood. However, you're more at risk of developing trigger finger if:\n\n【8】*   **you're female** (trigger finger is more common in women than men)\n*   **you're in your 40s or 50s** (trigger finger is more common in this age group)\n*   **you've had a previous hand injury** – trigger finger may be more likely to develop after injuring the base of your finger or palm\n\n【9】### Other health conditions\n\n【10】You may also be more likely to develop trigger finger if you have any of the following conditions:\n\n【11】*   **diabetes** – a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high\n*   **rheumatoid arthritis** – a long-term condition caused by a problem with your immune system (the body's natural defence system), resulting in pain and stiffness in your joints\n*   **gout** – a type of arthritis where crystals of sodium urate form inside and around joints causing them to become inflamed (swollen)\n*   **amyloidosis** – a condition where an abnormal protein called amyloid builds up in organs, such as your liver\n*   **underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)** – where your thyroid gland does not produce enough of certain hormones\n*   **carpal tunnel syndrome** – a condition that affects the nerves in your wrist, causing pain and tingling\n*   **Dupuytren's contracture** – a condition that causes 1 or more fingers to bend into the palm of your hand\n*   **De Quervain's disease** – a condition that affects the tendons in your thumb, causing pain in your wrist\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 March 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Trigger finger</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

SNRIs are thought to work by increasing the amount of mood-enhancing chemicals, serotonin and noradrenaline, in your brain.\n\n【2】It's used to treat depression and anxiety.\n\n【3】It's also used to treat nerve pain, such as fibromyalgia, and can be used to treat stress urinary incontinence in women.\n\n【4】Duloxetine comes as capsules. It is only available on prescription.\n\n【5】Key facts\n---------\n\n【6】*   Duloxetine usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to work. It may take longer if you're taking it for nerve pain.\n*   Common side effects include feeling sick, a dry mouth, headache, constipation and feeling sleepy. These side effects are usually mild and go away after a couple of weeks.\n*   If you and your doctor decide to take you off duloxetine, your doctor may recommend reducing your dose gradually to help prevent withdrawal symptoms.\n*   You may find you cannot concentrate properly while taking duloxetine.

It's not usually life threatening, but it's a warning sign that you could be at risk of a heart attack or stroke.**\n\n【3】With treatment and healthy lifestyle changes, it's possible to control angina and reduce the risk of these more serious problems.\n\n【4】Symptoms of angina\n------------------\n\n【5】The main symptom of angina is chest pain.\n\n【6】Chest pain caused by angina usually:\n\n【7】*   feels tight, dull or heavy – it may spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back\n*   is triggered by physical exertion or stress\n*   stops within a few minutes of resting\n\n【8】Sometimes there might be other symptoms, like feeling sick or breathless.\n\n【9】When to get medical help\n------------------------\n\n【10】If you have not been diagnosed with angina, get an urgent GP appointment if you have an attack of chest pain that stops within a few minutes of resting.\n\n【11】They can check if it might be a heart problem and refer you to a hospital for tests.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how angina is diagnosed</u>\n\n【12】Call 999 for an ambulance if you have chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes. This could be a heart attack.\n\n【13】Types\n-----\n\n【14】There are 2 main types of angina you can be diagnosed with:\n\n【15】*   stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting\n*   unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting\n\n【16】Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.\n\n【17】Treatment for angina\n--------------------\n\n【18】You'll probably need to take several different medicines for the rest of your life.\n\n【19】You may be given medicine to:\n\n【20】*   treat attacks when they happen (only taken when needed)\n*   prevent further attacks\n*   reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes\n\n【21】If medicines are not suitable or do not help, an operation to improve blood flow to your heart muscles may be recommended.\n\n【22】Living with angina\n------------------\n\n【23】If it's well controlled, there's no reason why you cannot have a largely normal life with angina.\n\n【24】You can usually continue to do most of your normal activities.\n\n【25】You'll probably need to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as:\n\n【26】*   having a balanced diet\n*   cutting down on alcohol\n*   stopping smoking if you smoke\n*   losing weight if you're overweight\n*   exercising regularly – gentle exercises are usually safe\n\n【27】This can help reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【28】Causes of angina\n----------------\n\n【29】Angina is usually caused by the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscles becoming narrowed by a build-up of fatty substances.\n\n【30】This is called atherosclerosis.\n\n【31】Things that can increase your risk of atherosclerosis include:\n\n【32】*   an unhealthy diet\n*   a lack of exercise\n*   smoking\n*   increasing age\n*   a family history of atherosclerosis or heart problems\n\n【33】Angina can also be caused by other conditions affecting the heart and arteries.\n删除3：<u>Video: Angina\n-------------\n\n【34】In this video an expert describes the symptoms, stages and treatment of angina.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Squeeze out between 5cm and 15cm (2 inches to 6 inches) of cream or gel. Do not use any more than this at any one time.\n2.  Gently massage into the affected area. If the skin you're treating is broken, sore or tender, massage the cream or gel into the skin around it. Do not use it on or near your mouth, eyes, bottom or genital areas.\n3.

How it is performed\n3.  Recovery</u>\n\n【2】**There are many ways of getting a tissue sample, depending on the type of tissue being collected and where in the body it's being taken from.**\n\n【3】Imaging techniques, such as X-ray, ultrasound, CT scanning or MRI scanning, are often used to guide many types of biopsy.\n\n【4】Punch biopsy\n------------\n\n【5】A punch biopsy can be used to investigate a variety of skin conditions.\n\n【6】During a punch biopsy, a special surgical instrument is used to make a small hole in the skin and remove samples of the top layers of tissue.\n\n【7】If you have a punch biopsy, you'll usually be given local anaesthetic to numb the area.\n\n【8】Alternatively, a scalpel (a sharp medical knife) may be used to remove a small amount of surface skin. The wound will be closed using stitches.\n\n【9】Needle biopsy\n-------------\n\n【10】A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is often used to take cell samples from organs or from lumps that are below the surface of the skin.\n\n【11】If a larger sample is needed, a core needle biopsy (CNB) will be used instead.\n\n【12】For core biopsies, after local anaesthetic has been given, a hollow needle is inserted through the skin and into the area being examined.\n\n【13】X-ray, ultrasound, CT or MRI scanning will often be used to help guide the needle to exactly the right place.\n\n【14】When the needle is in position, it'll cut out a small sample of tissue. For core biopsies, local anaesthetic is usually used to numb the area, so you won't experience any pain or discomfort.\n\n【15】### Breast lumps\n\n【16】In many cases, a needle biopsy can be used to get more information about a breast lump. The needle is inserted into the lump and a sample of tissue will be taken for testing.\n\n【17】A core needle biopsy (CNB) is often used to obtain a larger tissue sample.\n\n【18】In some cases, when a cyst (a benign fluid-filled swelling) is suspected, a fine needle will be used to drain the fluid and the cells are sent for examination (cytology).\n\n【19】### Organs\n\n【20】A thicker hollow needle is used for taking organ biopsies, such as of the liver or kidneys. \n\n【21】These are often carried out with imaging guidance (ultrasound or CT), and you may be asked to hold your breath for a few seconds while the needle is inserted into your tummy.\n\n【22】### Bone marrow\n\n【23】A thick needle is used to take samples of bone marrow, the soft jelly-like tissue found in the hollow centre of large bones.\n\n【24】Bone marrow biopsies can be carried out for a number of different reasons, including to find out why you have a low or high number of:\n\n【25】*   red blood cells\n*   white blood cells\n*   platelets (blood-clotting cells)\n\n【26】A large number of different health conditions may be responsible for these types of blood abnormalities.\n\n【27】Where a diagnosis has already been made, samples of marrow may be taken to check how well treatment is working – for example, in leukaemia.\n\n【28】Samples of bone marrow are also sometimes taken to check how well treatment for leukaemia is working, or to determine how far certain types of cancer have progressed (what stage it's at).\n\n【29】Bone marrow biopsies are usually taken from the top of the pelvic bone, just below your waist.\n\n【30】You'll usually have a local anaesthetic to numb the area, and you may also be given a sedative to help you relax and cope with any discomfort or anxiety.\n\n【31】Endoscopic biopsy\n-----------------\n\n【32】An endoscope is a medical instrument used to look inside your body. It's a thin, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end.\n\n【33】Small cutting tools can also be attached to the end of an endoscope to allow the endoscopist (surgeon, doctor or nurse specialist) to take a tissue sample.\n\n【34】An endoscope can be inserted down your throat (upper gastrointestinal) or from below through the anus (lower gastrointestinal), depending on the area being examined.\n\n【35】The type of anaesthetic used will also depend on the area of the body being investigated and the entry point of the endoscope.\n\n【36】Excisional biopsy\n-----------------\n\n【37】An excisional biopsy is used to remove a larger area of tissue, such as a lump, for closer examination.\n\n【38】The type of anaesthetic used will depend on where the tissue is.\n\n【39】Perioperative biopsy\n--------------------\n\n【40】A biopsy is sometimes carried out during an operation for a related or unrelated reason.\n\n【41】A tissue sample is taken during surgery and can be checked immediately (known as a frozen section) so the surgeon can get the results while the operation is in progress. This can help them decide how to manage the treatment.\n\n【42】A lump found during surgery may be removed completely if the person is still under anaesthetic, provided previous consent has been given.\n\n【43】Testing the tissue sample\n-------------------------\n\n【44】After a tissue sample has been taken, it will be sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.\n\n【45】Closely examining the cells in the tissue sample enables histologists (doctors who specialise in studying the structure of tissues) to determine whether they're normal or abnormal.\n\n【46】For instance, cancerous cells look and behave differently from normal cells.\n\n【47】As well as looking at the tissue sample, chemical or genetic tests may also be carried out, if needed.\n\n【48】In cystic fibrosis, for example, a chemical test can be used to help diagnose the condition.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 August 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 August 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Biopsy</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "91595ccd-f7af-4246-8762-ec2cb9dfe7ad", "title": "Hernia", "text": "【0】Hernia\n======\n\n【1】**A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.**\n\n【2】A hernia usually develops between your chest and hips. In many cases, it causes no or very few symptoms, although you may notice a swelling or lump in your tummy (abdomen) or groin.\n\n【3】The lump can often be pushed back in or disappears when you lie down. Coughing or straining may make the lump appear.\n\n【4】Types of hernia\n---------------\n\n【5】### Inguinal hernias\n\n【6】Inguinal hernias occur when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\n\n【7】This is the most common type of hernia and it mainly affects men. It's often associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【8】### Femoral hernias\n\n【9】Femoral hernias also happen when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\n\n【10】They're much less common than inguinal hernias and tend to affect more women than men.\n\n【11】Like inguinal hernias, femoral hernias are also associated with ageing and repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【12】### Umbilical hernias\n\n【13】Umbilical hernias occur when fatty tissue or part of your bowel pokes through your tummy near your belly button.\n\n【14】This type of hernia can occur in babies if the opening in the tummy that the umbilical cord passes through does not seal properly after birth.\n\n【15】Adults can also be affected, possibly as a result of repeated strain on the tummy.\n\n【16】### Hiatus hernias\n\n【17】Hiatus hernias occur when part of the stomach pushes up into your chest by squeezing through an opening in the diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle that separates the chest from the tummy.\n\n【18】This type of hernia may not have any noticeable symptoms, although it can cause heartburn in some people.\n\n【19】It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernias, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age or pressure on the tummy.\n\n【20】### Other types of hernia\n\n【21】Other types of hernia that can affect the tummy include:\n\n【22】*   incisional hernias – where tissue pokes through a surgical wound in your tummy that has not fully healed\n*   epigastric hernias – where fatty tissue pokes through your tummy, between your belly button and the lower part of your breastbone\n*   spigelian hernias – where part of your bowel pokes through your tummy at the side of your abdominal muscle, usually below your belly button\n*   diaphragmatic hernias – where organs in your tummy move into your chest through an opening in the diaphragm; this can also affect babies if their diaphragm does not develop properly in the womb\n*   muscle hernias – where part of the muscle pokes through the tissue; they commonly occur in leg muscles as a result of a sports injury\n\n【23】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【24】See a GP if you think you have a hernia. They may refer you to hospital for surgical treatment, if necessary.\n\n【25】You should go to your nearest A&E straight away if you have a hernia and you develop any of the following symptoms:\n\n【26】*   sudden, severe pain\n*   being sick\n*   difficulty pooing or passing wind\n*   the hernia becomes firm or tender, or cannot be pushed back in\n\n【27】These symptoms could mean that either: \n\n【28】*   the blood supply to a section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation)\n*   a piece of bowel has entered the hernia and become blocked (obstruction)\n\n【29】A strangulated hernia and obstructed bowel are medical emergencies and need to be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【30】Assessing a hernia\n------------------\n\n【31】A GP will usually be able to identify a hernia by examining the affected area.\n\n【32】In some cases, they may refer you to a nearby hospital for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis or assess the extent of the problem.\n\n【33】This is a painless scan where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body.\n\n【34】Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, a GP or hospital doctor will determine whether surgery to repair the hernia is necessary.\n\n【35】A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether surgery is appropriate, including:\n\n【36】*   the type of hernia – some types of hernia are more likely to become strangulated or cause a bowel obstruction than others\n*   the content of your hernia – if the hernia contains a part of your bowel, muscle or other tissue, there may be a risk of strangulation or obstruction\n*   your symptoms and the impact on your daily life – surgery may be recommended if your symptoms are severe or getting worse, or if the hernia is affecting your ability to carry out your normal activities\n*   your general health – surgery may be too much of a risk if your general health is poor\n\n【37】Although most hernias will not get better without surgery, they will not necessarily get worse.\n\n【38】In some cases, the risks of surgery outweigh the potential benefits.\n\n【39】Surgery for a hernia\n--------------------\n\n【40】There are 2 main ways surgery for hernias can be carried out:\n\n【41】*   open surgery – where a cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the tummy\n*   laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) – this is a less invasive, but more difficult, technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia\n\n【42】Most people are able to go home the same day or the day after surgery and make a full recovery within a few weeks.\n\n【43】If your doctor recommends having surgery, it's important to be aware of the potential risks, as well as the possibility of the hernia coming back.\n\n【44】Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of the procedure with your surgeon in detail before having the operation.\n\n【45】### More information\n\n【46】To find out more about some common types of hernia surgery, see:\n\n【47】*   how inguinal hernias are repaired\n*   how femoral hernias are repaired\n*   how umbilical hernias are repaired\n*   how hiatus hernias are treated\n删除3：<u>Video: what is a hernia?\n------------------------\n\n【48】Watch this animation to see how a hernia occurs and the procedures used to treat it.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 1 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 1 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 October 2025</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through.\n\n【16】If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose).\n\n【17】Certain things can increase your chances of developing varicose veins, such as:\n\n【18】*   being female\n*   having a close family member with varicose veins\n*   being older\n*   being overweight\n*   having a job that involves long periods of standing\n*   being pregnant\n*   other conditions\n\n【19】Read about the causes of varicose veins.\n\n【20】Treating varicose veins\n-----------------------\n\n【21】If treatment is necessary, your doctor may first recommend using compression stockings, taking regular exercise and elevating the affected area when resting.\n\n【22】If your varicose veins are still causing you pain or discomfort, or they cause complications, they can be treated in several ways.\n\n【23】The most common treatment options include:\n\n【24】*   **endothermal ablation** – where heat is used to seal affected veins\n*   **sclerotherapy** – this uses special foam to close the veins\n*   **ligation and stripping** – the affected veins are surgically removed\n\n【25】It's unlikely you'll receive treatment on the NHS for cosmetic reasons – you'll have to pay for cosmetic treatment privately.\n\n【26】If you do feel you require treatment, it might help if you print out treatment options for varicose veins to discuss with the GP.\n\n【27】Read about:\n\n【28】Treating varicose veins \n\n【29】Complications of varicose veins\n\n【30】Preventing varicose veins\n-------------------------\n\n【31】There's little evidence to suggest you can stop varicose veins getting worse or completely stop new ones developing.\n\n【32】But there are ways to ease symptoms of existing varicose veins, such as:\n\n【33】*   avoiding standing or sitting still for long periods and trying to move around every 30 minutes\n*   taking regular breaks throughout the day, raising the legs on pillows while resting to ease discomfort\n*   exercising regularly – this can improve circulation and help maintain a healthy weight\n\n【34】Types of varicose veins\n-----------------------\n\n【35】There are several types of varicose veins, such as:\n\n【36】*   **trunk varicose veins** – these are near to the surface of the skin and are thick and knobbly; they're often long and can look unpleasant\n*   **reticular varicose veins** – these are red and sometimes grouped close together in a network\n*   **telangiectasia varicose veins** – also known as thread veins or spider veins, these are small clusters of blue or red veins that sometimes appear on your face or legs; they're harmless and, unlike trunk varicose veins, do not bulge underneath the surface of the skin\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 May 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 May 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Recovery\n7.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**Effective treatment of stroke can prevent long-term disability and save lives.**\n\n【3】The specific treatments recommended depend on whether a stroke is caused by:\n\n【4】*   a blood clot blocking the flow of blood to the brain (ischaemic stroke)\n*   bleeding in or around the brain (haemorrhagic stroke)\n\n【5】Treatment usually involves taking 1 or more different medicines, although some people may also need surgery.\n\n【6】Treating ischaemic strokes\n--------------------------\n\n【7】If you have had an ischaemic stroke, a combination of medicines to treat the condition and prevent it happening again is usually recommended.\n\n【8】Some of these medicines need to be taken immediately and only for a short time, while others may only be started once the stroke has been treated and may need to be taken long term.\n\n【9】### Thrombolysis – \"clot buster\" medicine\n\n【10】Ischaemic strokes can often be treated using injections of a medicine called alteplase, which dissolves blood clots and restores blood flow to the brain.\n\n【11】This use of \"clot-busting\" medicine is known as thrombolysis.\n\n【12】Alteplase is most effective if started as soon as possible after the stroke occurs – and certainly within 4.5 hours.\n\n【13】It's not generally recommended if more than 4.5 hours have passed, as it's not clear how beneficial it is when used after this time.\n\n【14】Before alteplase can be used, it's very important that a brain scan is done to confirm a diagnosis of an ischaemic stroke.\n\n【15】This is because the medicine can make the bleeding that occurs in haemorrhagic strokes worse.\n\n【16】### Thrombectomy\n\n【17】A small number of severe ischaemic strokes can be treated by an emergency procedure called a thrombectomy.\n\n【18】This removes blood clots and helps restore blood flow to the brain.\n\n【19】Thrombectomy is only effective at treating ischaemic strokes caused by a blood clot in a large artery in the brain. \n\n【20】It's most effective when started as soon as possible after a stroke.\n\n【21】The procedure involves inserting a catheter into an artery, often in the groin. A small device is passed through the catheter into the artery in the brain.\n\n【22】The blood clot can then be removed using the device, or through suction. The procedure can be done under local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.\n\n【23】### Aspirin and other antiplatelets\n\n【24】Most people will be given aspirin straight after having an ischaemic stroke. As well as being a painkiller, aspirin is an antiplatelet, which reduces the chances of another clot forming.\n\n【25】Other antiplatelet medicines may be used later, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole.\n\n【26】### Anticoagulants\n\n【27】Some people may be offered an anticoagulant to help reduce their risk of developing new blood clots in the future.\n\n【28】Anticoagulants prevent blood clots by changing the chemical composition of the blood in a way that prevents clots from forming.\n\n【29】Warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are examples of anticoagulants for long-term use.\n\n【30】There are also a number of anticoagulants called heparins, which can only be given by injection and are used short term.\n\n【31】Anticoagulants may be offered if you:\n\n【32】*   have a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, which can cause blood clots\n*   have a history of blood clots\n*   develop a blood clot in your leg veins (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) because a stroke has left you unable to move one of your legs\n\n【33】### Blood pressure medicines\n\n【34】If your blood pressure is too high, you may be offered medicines to lower it.\n\n【35】Medicines that are commonly used include:\n\n【36】*   thiazide diuretics\n*   angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n*   calcium channel blockers\n*   beta blockers\n*   alpha-blockers\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treating high blood pressure</u>\n\n【37】### Statins\n\n【38】You'll usually be advised to take a medicine known as a statin.\n\n【39】Statins reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood by blocking a chemical (enzyme) in the liver that produces cholesterol.\n\n【40】You may be offered a statin even if your cholesterol level is not particularly high, as it may help reduce your risk of stroke whatever your cholesterol level is.\n\n【41】### Carotid endarterectomy\n\n【42】Some ischaemic strokes are caused by narrowing of an artery in the neck called the carotid artery, which carries blood to the brain.\n\n【43】The narrowing, known as carotid stenosis, is caused by a build-up of fatty plaques.\n\n【44】If the carotid stenosis is very severe, surgery may be used to unblock the artery. This is called a carotid endarterectomy.\n\n【45】It involves the surgeon making a cut (incision) in your neck to open up the carotid artery and remove the fatty deposits.\n\n【46】Treating haemorrhagic strokes\n-----------------------------\n\n【47】As with ischaemic strokes, some people who have had a haemorrhagic stroke will also be offered medicine to lower their blood pressure and prevent further strokes.\n\n【48】If you were taking anticoagulants before you had your stroke, you may also need treatment to reverse the effects of the medicine and reduce your risk of further bleeding.\n\n【49】### Surgery\n\n【50】Occasionally, emergency surgery may be needed to remove any blood from the brain and repair any burst blood vessels. This is usually done using a surgical procedure known as a craniotomy.\n\n【51】During a craniotomy, a section of the skull is removed to allow the surgeon access to the source of the bleeding.\n\n【52】The surgeon will repair any damaged blood vessels and ensure there are no blood clots present that may restrict the blood flow to the brain.\n\n【53】After the bleeding has been stopped, the piece of bone removed from the skull is replaced, often by an artificial metal plate.\n\n【54】### Surgery for hydrocephalus\n\n【55】Surgery can also be done to treat a complication of haemorrhagic strokes called hydrocephalus.\n\n【56】This is where damage resulting from a stroke causes cerebrospinal fluid to build up in the cavities (ventricles) of the brain, causing symptoms such as headaches, sickness, drowsiness, vomiting and loss of balance.\n\n【57】Hydrocephalus can be treated by putting a tube called a shunt into the brain to allow the fluid to drain.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treating hydrocephalus</u>\n\n【58】Supportive treatments\n---------------------\n\n【59】You may need further short-term treatment to help manage some of the problems that can affect people who have had a stroke.\n\n【60】For example, you may require:\n\n【61】*   a feeding tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube) to provide nutrition if you have difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\n*   nutritional supplements if you're malnourished\n*   fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously) if you're at risk of dehydration\n*   oxygen through a nasal tube or face mask if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood\n*   compression stockings to prevent blood clots in the legs (DVT)\n删除7：<u>Find out more about recovering from a stroke</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This is particularly important because dihydrocodeine can be addictive.\n\n【2】Dosage and strength\n-------------------\n\n【3】You'll usually start on a low dose of standard dihydrocodeine. Your doctor may increase this gradually until your pain is well controlled.\n\n【4】### Standard tablets\n\n【5】Dihydrocodeine standard tablets come in different strengths. They contain 30mg or 40mg of dihydrocodeine.\n\n【6】The usual dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is:\n\n【7】*   30mg tablet – take 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours. The maximum dose in 24 hours is 6 tablets (180mg)\n*   40mg tablet – take 1 or 2 tablets up to 3 times in 24 hours. The maximum dose in 24 hours is 6 tablets (240mg)\n\n【8】### Slow-release tablets\n\n【9】Dihydrocodeine slow-release tablets contain 60mg, 90mg or 120mg of dihydrocodeine.\n\n【10】The usual dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is:\n\n【11】*   60mg, 90mg or 120mg tablets – take 1 tablet taken every 12 hours\n\n【12】### Liquid\n\n【13】The usual dose of dihydrocodeine liquid is one to three, 5ml spoonfuls taken every 4 to 6 hours. One 5ml spoonful or syringe measure has 10mg of dihydrocodeine in it.\n\n【14】### Dose for children under 12\n\n【15】For children aged between 1 and 11 years, their dose is based on weight.\n\n【16】The usual dose is between 0.5mg and 1mg per kg of body weight. They can be given a maximum dose of up to 30mg every 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【17】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【18】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. It's best to take them with or soon after a meal or snack.\n\n【19】If you're taking dihydrocodeine as a liquid, it will come with a plastic medicine spoon or syringe to help you measure the correct amount. Ask a pharmacist for one if you do not have it.\n\n【20】Do not measure the liquid with a kitchen teaspoon because it will not give the right amount.\n\n【21】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【22】This will depend on why you're taking dihydrocodeine.\n\n【23】If you're taking it for pain after an operation you may only need to take if for a short time.\n\n【24】You may need to take it for longer if you have a long-term pain or illness such as cancer.\n\n【25】Always check with a doctor if you want to stop taking dihydrocodeine.\n\n【26】It's possible that you could become dependent on dihydrocodeine and have withdrawal symptoms if you stop suddenly. These can include:\n\n【27】*   yawning\n*   sneezing\n*   muscle twitching\n*   sweating\n*   feeling worried or anxious\n*   poor sleep\n*   pain, including stomach pain\n*   feeling or being sick\n*   feeling restless\n\n【28】If these happen to you, speak to a doctor. It may be possible to reduce your dose slowly to stop these from happening.\n\n【29】### Important\n\n【30】If you have been taking dihydrocodeine for more than a few weeks do not stop taking it without speaking to your doctor first.\n\n【31】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【32】If you forget to take a dose, check the information leaflet inside the packet or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice on what to do.\n\n【33】Never take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【34】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask a pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.\n\n【35】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【36】If you take too much dihydrocodeine you may:\n\n【37】*   feel very sleepy, sick or dizzy\n*   find it difficult to breathe\n*   become unconscious\n\n【38】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【39】*   you take too much dihydrocodeine\n\n【40】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111. If you need advice for a child under the age of 5 years, call 111.\n\n【41】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if you or your child:\n\n【42】*   find it difficult to breath\n*   become unconscious\n\n【43】If you go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【44】Take the dihydrocodeine box or leaflet inside the packet plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【45】How to store dihydrocodeine\n---------------------------\n\n【46】If you have been prescribed dihydrocodeine, it's really important that you:\n\n【47】*   store it properly and safely at home\n*   keep it out of the sight and reach of children\n*   do not give your medicine to anyone else\n*   return any unused dihydrocodeine to a pharmacy so they can throw it away in the right way\n删除11：<u>More in Dihydrocodeine\n----------------------\n\n【48】*   About dihydrocodeine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 November 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It works by preventing the virus from multiplying and keeping virus levels low in your body. This helps your body's immune system control the infection and reduces the risk of severe symptoms.\n\n【4】Ritonavir does not work on the virus itself. It helps keep nirmatrelvir from being broken down in your body long enough for it to do its job.\n\n【5】How long does it take to work?\n\n【6】Paxlovid starts to work soon after you take it. It works best when taken as soon as possible after getting a positive COVID-19 test and within 5 days of your symptoms starting.\n\n【7】Everyone has a different experience of COVID-19, especially if you have risk factors for getting severely ill.\n\n【8】Most people who take Paxlovid will recover quickly after taking this medicine, with a reduced risk of severe illness.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】It's not known if there are any long-term side effects from taking Paxlovid.\n\n【11】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【12】Do not stop taking Paxlovid before the end of your 5 day course without talking to your doctor first.\n\n【13】If you stop taking Paxlovid before the end of the course, it may no longer protect you from becoming severely ill from COVID-19.\n\n【14】How does Paxlovid compare with other medicines to treat COVID-19?\n\n【15】There are other antiviral medicines that are also effective in preventing severe illness from COVID-19:\n\n【16】*   molnupiravir (Lagevrio) tablets\n*   remdesivir (Veklury) - given as a drip into your arm (infusion)\n\n【17】If antiviral medicines are not suitable for you, sotrovimab may be offered instead. Sotrovimab is a biological medicine. It’s also known as a neutralising monoclonal antibody (nMAb).\n\n【18】COVID-19 treatments do not replace vaccinations. Vaccines are given to help your immune system fight a future COVID-19 infection.\n\n【19】How effective is Paxlovid?\n\n【20】If you have COVID-19, Paxlovid reduces your risk of severe symptoms and needing hospital treatment.\n\n【21】It's important to take Paxlovid within 5 days of your COVID-19 symptoms starting, to give it the best chance of working.\n\n【22】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【23】If you have COVID-19, it's important that you do not have contact with other people. This is to avoid passing the infection on.\n\n【24】Paxlovid can stop combined oral contraceptive pills (\"the pill\") from working properly.\n\n【25】If you are taking Paxlovid it's important to use effective contraception (a condom, female condom, diaphragm or cap) for the full 5 days of treatment and until you've had one full menstrual cycle.\n\n【26】If you take contraception and Paxlovid makes you vomit or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.

Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Kyphosis is curvature of the spine that causes the top of the back to appear more rounded than normal.**\n\n【3】Everyone has some degree of curvature in their spine. However, a curve of more than 45 degrees is considered excessive.\n\n【4】Sometimes kyphosis doesn't cause any symptoms other than the back appearing abnormally curved or hunched. However, in some cases the condition causes:\n\n【5】*   back pain and stiffness\n*   tenderness of the spine\n*   tiredness\n\n【6】Back pain can be particularly problematic in adults with kyphosis because the body has to compensate for the spinal abnormality.\n\n【7】If you have severe kyphosis, your symptoms may get worse over time. You may also have difficulty breathing and eating.\n\n【8】What causes kyphosis?\n---------------------\n\n【9】In kyphosis, the normal curve in the middle section of vertebral column (the thoracic vertebrae) is more curved than normal. There are a number of reasons why this might happen, including:\n\n【10】*   poor posture (postural kyphosis) – slouching, leaning back in chairs and carrying heavy bags can stretch supporting muscles and ligaments, which can increase spinal curvature\n*   abnormally shaped vertebrae (Scheuermann's kyphosis) – if the vertebrae don't develop properly, they can end up being out of position\n*   abnormal development of the spine in the womb (congenital kyphosis) – if something disrupts the spine's normal development, two or more vertebrae sometimes fuse together\n*   age – as people get older, their spinal curvature can increase\n\n【11】Kyphosis can also develop as a result of a spinal injury.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the causes of kyphosis.</u>\n\n【12】Treating kyphosis\n-----------------\n\n【13】If you have kyphosis, your treatment depends on how curved your spine is, whether you have any additional symptoms such as back pain, and the underlying causes.\n\n【14】Children with kyphosis may be able to be treated using non-surgical methods, such as bracing, to limit the progression of kyphosis as they grow. Treatment for mild kyphosis may not be necessary.\n\n【15】Kyphosis rarely requires surgical treatment. It's only needed in some severe cases to correct the curvature of the spine.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treatment for kyphosis.</u>\n\n【16】Emotional issues\n----------------\n\n【17】Older children with kyphosis may become concerned or embarrassed about the effect the condition has on their appearance, or having to wear a back brace.\n\n【18】These concerns can affect different children in different ways. Some children can become socially withdrawn and may be reluctant to take part in activities, such as PE, where their condition may be exposed.\n\n【19】There are no easy answers to these problems, but it can sometimes help to reassure your child that their feelings will improve with time.\n\n【20】Complications\n-------------\n\n【21】Complications of kyphosis usually only occur in more severe cases. They include:\n\n【22】*   persistent pain\n*   breathing difficulties caused by the spine compressing the lungs and airways\n\n【23】Occasionally, people with kyphosis can have difficulties when the nerves running through the spine become compressed or pinched. This can disrupt nerve signals and cause symptoms such as:\n\n【24】*   numbness or weakness in the arms and legs\n*   problems with sense of balance\n*   loss of normal bladder or bowel control\n\n【25】These serious complications require urgent medical attention and surgery would usually be recommended.\n\n【26】Can kyphosis be prevented?\n--------------------------\n\n【27】Postural kyphosis can be prevented by being aware of your posture and by taking care of your back. You should encourage your child to:\n\n【28】*   avoid slouching\n*   sit correctly – sit upright, ensuring that all of the back is supported\n*   avoid carrying heavy schoolbags and if using backpacks ensure they are well designed and used properly\n*   take regular exercise to help strengthen the back and keep it flexible; activities such as swimming, running, walking and yoga are ideal for helping to prevent back problems\n删除6：<u>**Further information:**\n\n【29】*   Physical activity guidelines for children under 5 years of age\n*   Physical activity guidelines for children and young people\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 12 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 12 May 2025</u>\n</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Alcohol can cause side effects such as feeling and being sick, stomach pain, hot flushes, difficulty breathing, a pounding heartbeat (palpitations) and headaches.\n*   For most infections, you'll start to feel better in a few days, but for some it may take longer. When treating rosacea, you may only notice a difference after several weeks.\n*   It's important to take metronidazole as your doctor tells you, and finish your full course of treatment.\n删除11：<u>More in Metronidazole\n---------------------\n\n【8】*   About metronidazole\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking metronidazole with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 November 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "0afbdd16-5619-45b6-b3bf-5d3dddc35a46", "title": "Homeopathy", "text": "【0】Homeopathy\n==========\n\n【1】**Homeopathy is a \"treatment\" based on the use of highly diluted substances, which practitioners claim can cause the body to heal itself.**\n\n【2】A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos (dummy treatments).\n\n【3】In 2017 NHS England said it would no longer fund homeopathy on the NHS as the lack of any evidence for its effectiveness did not justify the cost. This was backed by a High Court judgement in 2018.\n\n【4】What is homeopathy?\n-------------------\n\n【5】Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine. This means that homeopathy is different from treatments that are part of conventional Western medicine in important ways.\n\n【6】It's based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann.\n\n【7】A central principle of the \"treatment\" is that \"like cures like\" – that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those symptoms.\n\n【8】A second central principle is based around a process of dilution and shaking called succussion.\n\n【9】Practitioners believe that the more a substance is diluted in this way, the greater its power to treat symptoms.\n\n【10】Many homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have been diluted many times in water until there's none, or almost none, of the original substance left.\n\n【11】Homeopathy is used to \"treat\" an extremely wide range of conditions, including physical conditions such as asthma and psychological conditions such as depression.\n\n【12】Does homeopathy work?\n---------------------\n\n【13】There's been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy. There's no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition.\n\n【14】Is homeopathy available on the NHS?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】Homeopathy isn't widely available on the NHS. In 2017, NHS England recommended that GPs and other prescribers should stop providing it.\n\n【16】This is because they found \"no clear or robust evidence to support the use of homeopathy on the NHS (PDF, 607kb)\".\n\n【17】In 2018 a High Court ruling backed NHS England's recommendation after the British Homeopathic Association (BHA) challenged the decision.\n\n【18】Homeopathy is usually practised privately, and homeopathic remedies are available from pharmacies.\n\n【19】The price for a consultation with a homeopath can vary from around £30 to £125. Homeopathic tablets or other products usually cost around £4 to £10.\n\n【20】What should I expect if I try it?\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】When you first see a homeopath, they'll usually ask you about any specific health conditions and your general wellbeing, emotional state, lifestyle, and diet.\n\n【22】Based on this, the homeopath will decide on the course of treatment, which often takes the form of homeopathic remedies given as a pill, capsule or tincture (solution).\n\n【23】Your homeopath may recommend that you attend one or more follow-up appointments so the remedy's effects on your health can be assessed.\n\n【24】When is it used?\n----------------\n\n【25】Homeopathy is used for an extremely wide range of health conditions. Many practitioners believe it can help with any condition.\n\n【26】Among the most common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for are:\n\n【27】*   asthma\n*   ear infections\n*   hay fever\n*   mental health conditions, such as depression, stress and anxiety\n*   allergies, such as food allergies\n*   dermatitis (an allergic skin condition)\n*   arthritis\n*   high blood pressure\n\n【28】There's no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions.\n\n【29】Some practitioners also claim homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases. There's no evidence to support this, and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases.\n\n【30】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises the NHS on the use of treatments, doesn't recommend using homeopathy in the treatment of any health condition.\n\n【31】What are the regulation issues?\n-------------------------------\n\n【32】There's no legal regulation of homeopathic practitioners in the UK. This means that anyone can practise as a homeopath, even if they have no qualifications or experience.\n\n【33】Voluntary regulation aims to protect patient safety, but it doesn't mean there's scientific evidence that a treatment is effective.\n\n【34】Is homeopathy safe?\n-------------------\n\n【35】Homeopathic remedies are generally safe, and the risk of a serious adverse side effect arising from taking these remedies is thought to be small.\n\n【36】Some homeopathic remedies may contain substances that aren't safe or interfere with the action of other medicines.\n\n【37】You should talk to your GP before stopping any treatment prescribed by a doctor, or avoiding procedures such as vaccination, in favour of homeopathy.\n\n【38】The evidence on the effects of homeopathy\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【39】There have been several reviews of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of homeopathy.\n\n【40】In 2010 the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee said there's no evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition.\n\n【41】There's no evidence behind the idea that substances that cause certain symptoms can also help treat them.\n\n【42】Nor is there any evidence behind the idea that diluting and shaking substances in water can turn those substances into medicines.\n\n【43】The ideas that underpin homeopathy aren't accepted by mainstream science, and aren't consistent with long-accepted principles on the way the physical world works.\n\n【44】The Committee's 2010 report on homeopathy said the \"like cures like\" principle is \"theoretically weak\", and that this is the \"settled view of medical science\".\n\n【45】For example, many homeopathic remedies are diluted to such an extent that it's unlikely there's a single molecule of the original substance remaining in the final remedy. In cases like these, homeopathic remedies consist of nothing but water.\n\n【46】Some homeopaths believe that, as a result of the succussion process, the original substance leaves an \"imprint\" of itself on the water. But there's no known mechanism by which this can occur.\n\n【47】The 2010 report said: \"We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions can maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in them to be scientifically implausible.\"\n\n【48】Some people who use homeopathy may see an improvement in their health condition as the result of a phenomenon known as the placebo effect.\n\n【49】If you choose health treatments that provide only a placebo effect, you may miss out on other treatments that have been proven to be more effective.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 April 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Some of these will not necessarily apply to the specific statin you're taking.\n\n【6】For details of the side effects of a particular statin, check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\n\n【7】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【8】Side effects can vary between different statins, but common side effects include:\n\n【9】*   headache\n*   dizziness\n*   feeling sick\n*   feeling unusually tired or physically weak\n*   digestive system problems, such as constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion or farting\n*   muscle pain\n*   sleep problems\n*   low blood platelet count\n\n【10】Uncommon side effects\n---------------------\n\n【11】Uncommon side effects of statins include:\n\n【12】*   being sick\n*   memory problems\n*   hair loss\n*   pins and needles\n*   inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can cause flu-like symptoms\n*   inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can cause stomach pain\n*   skin problems, such as acne or an itchy red rash\n*   sexual problems, such as loss of libido (reduced sex drive) or erectile dysfunction\n\n【13】Rare side effects\n-----------------\n\n【14】Rare side effects of statins include:\n\n【15】*   muscle weakness (myopathy)\n*   loss of sensation or tingling in the nerve endings of the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n*   tendon problems (tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones)\n\n【16】Muscle effects\n--------------\n\n【17】Statins can rarely cause muscle inflammation (swelling) and damage. Speak to your doctor if you have muscle pain, tenderness or weakness that cannot be explained – for example, pain that is not caused by physical work.\n\n【18】Your doctor may carry out a blood test to measure a substance in your blood called creatine kinase (CK), which is released into the blood when your muscles are inflamed or damaged.\n\n【19】If the CK in your blood is raised, your doctor may advise you to stop taking the statin. Regular exercise can sometimes lead to a rise in CK, so tell your doctor if you've been exercising a lot.\n\n【20】Once your CK level has returned to normal, your doctor may suggest you start taking the statin again, but at a lower dose.\n\n【21】Reporting side effects\n----------------------\n\n【22】The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you're taking.\n\n【23】It's run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n删除8：<u>See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Considerations</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "75771869-c854-42bd-94d1-0d9e93e05d22", "title": "Glimepiride", "text": "【0】Common questions about glimepiride\n==================================\n\n【1】How does glimepiride work?\n\n【2】Glimepiride is a type of medicine known as a sulfonylurea.\n\n【3】Sulfonylureas increase the amount of insulin that your pancreas makes. Insulin is the hormone that controls the level of sugar in your blood.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】You may not feel any different when taking glimepiride as you may not have any symptoms with type 2 diabetes. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【6】Glimepiride reduces blood sugar levels in 2 to 3 hours.\n\n【7】It helps keep your blood sugar level stable and will reduce your chance of getting health problems due to diabetes in the future.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Glimepiride is safe to take for a long time. There's no evidence that it harms your general health or your pancreas.\n\n【10】However, glimepiride may stop working properly after a while. Your doctor may want to try you on a different medicine, or start prescribing another diabetes medicine along with glimepiride.\n\n【11】Are there other medicines that treat type 2 diabetes?\n\n【12】Glimepiride belongs to a group of medicines called sulfonylureas. These include gliclazide, glibenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide.\n\n【13】There are several other types of medicines that also treat type 2 diabetes including:\n\n【14】*   metformin\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors, like saxagliptin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, like exenatide (given by injection)\n*   insulin (given by injection)\n\n【15】Metformin is usually the first choice of medicine used for treating type 2 diabetes.\n\n【16】Glimepiride can be prescribed on its own or together with other diabetes medicines.\n\n【17】It's usually prescribed if you cannot take metformin, or if metformin on its own is not keeping your blood sugar under control.\n\n【18】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【19】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【20】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate (FP92A). You can get an application form at your GP surgery. Once you've filled in the form, ask your doctor to sign it.\n\n【21】Can I take glimepiride before surgery?\n\n【22】If you're going to have an operation, tell your doctor beforehand that you're taking glimepiride.\n\n【23】They may switch you to insulin for a few days before and after your surgery.\n\n【24】This is because glimepiride increases your risk of low blood sugar during the operation. Low blood sugar can be difficult to detect when you're put to sleep with general anaesthetic.\n\n【25】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【26】Glimepiride does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【27】But talk to your doctor before starting to take contraceptive pills if you're already taking glimepiride. They may change your dose of glimepiride. This is because contraceptive pills change how your body handles sugar.\n\n【28】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【29】If your blood sugar levels are stable, taking glimepiride should not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machinery or tools.\n\n【30】However, if your blood sugar levels become too low, this can reduce your concentration. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle, or use machines or tools until you feel better.\n\n【31】If your eyesight if affected by changes in your blood sugar, do not drive or use machinery until you can see clearly again. See your doctor or optician if your vision does not get better.\n\n【32】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking glimepiride. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【33】Can I drink alcohol while taking glimepiride?\n\n【34】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking glimepiride. But it's best to drink no more than 2 units a day. Drinking more than this can increase your risk of low blood sugar.\n\n【35】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【36】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar, such as:\n\n【37】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【38】However, it's important to always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners will not help.\n\n【39】You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.\n\n【40】Be careful when eating food and drink that contains karela (also called bitter gourd). This is because it can lower your blood sugar levels which means your diabetes is not controlled as well as it should be. Karela is used to flavour foods such as curries. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.\n\n【41】Will I put on weight or lose weight?\n\n【42】Glimepiride can make you feel more hungry and some people find they put on weight.\n\n【43】Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes. Regular exercise will also help you to keep your weight stable.\n\n【44】If you are already overweight, talk to your doctor about the best way to avoid putting on any more weight.\n\n【45】Glimepiride will not help you lose weight.\n\n【46】Can lifestyle changes help to control diabetes?\n\n【47】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These include:\n\n【48】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing any excess weight\n*   not smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week. A standard glass of wine (175ml) is 2 units. A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol\n*   exercising – 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal\n\n【49】Glimepiride is usually prescribed when diet and exercise alone have not been enough to control your blood sugar levels.\n删除11：<u>More in Glimepiride\n-------------------\n\n【50】*   About glimepiride\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking glimepiride with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

You inherit 1 set from your mother and 1 set from your father.\n\n【6】To be born with the main type of thalassaemia, beta thalassaemia, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty beta thalassaemia gene from both of their parents.\n\n【7】This usually happens when both parents are \"carriers\" of the faulty gene, also known as having the \"thalassaemia trait\".\n\n【8】Thalassaemia carriers do not have thalassaemia themselves, but there's a chance they could have a child with thalassaemia if their partner is also a carrier.\n\n【9】If both parents have the beta thalassaemia trait, there's a:\n\n【10】*   1 in 4 chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and will not have thalassaemia or be able to pass it on\n*   1 in 2 chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from 1 parent and be a carrier\n*   1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will be born with thalassaemia\n\n【11】Another type of thalassaemia, alpha thalassaemia, has a more complex inheritance pattern because it involves 4 potentially faulty genes, rather than just 2.\n\n【12】Children of parents who are carriers of the alpha thalassaemia trait will be born with the condition if they inherit 3 or 4 copies of the faulty gene.\n\n【13】Children who inherit 1 or 2 copies will be carriers.\n\n【14】Who's most at risk of thalassaemia\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】Thalassaemia mainly affects people who are from, or who have family members originally from:\n\n【16】*   around the Mediterranean, including Italy, Greece and Cyprus\n*   India, Pakistan and Bangladesh\n*   the Middle East\n*   China and southeast Asia\n\n【17】A simple blood test will show whether you're a carrier.

It's widely used to treat indigestion and heartburn, and acid reflux. It's also taken to prevent and treat stomach ulcers.\n\n【2】Omeprazole is a type of medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Proton pumps are enzymes in the lining of your stomach that help it make acid to digest food. Omeprazole prevents proton pumps working properly which reduces the amount of acid the stomach makes.\n\n【3】Sometimes, omeprazole is taken for a rare condition caused by a tumour in the pancreas or gut called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\n\n【4】Omeprazole comes as capsules, tablets and as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【5】All types of omeprazole are available on prescription. You can buy 20mg tablets from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【6】Key facts\n---------\n\n【7】*   Omeprazole starts to work within 2 to 3 days, but it may take up to 4 weeks for it to work fully.\n*   You’ll usually take omeprazole once a day, in the morning. For Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, you can take it twice a day – in the morning and in the evening.\n*   Common side effects include headaches, diarrhoea and stomach pain. These tend to be mild and go away when you stop taking the medicine.\n*   If you buy omeprazole from a pharmacy or supermarket to treat yourself, do not take it for longer than 2 weeks without checking with a doctor.\n*   Alcohol can make your stomach produce more acid than normal. This irritates the stomach lining and can make your symptoms worse.

Check the seal is not broken before you first use the cream or ointment. There is a small spike in the top of the cap – push this spike through the seal on the tube.\n2.  Always wash your hands before using fusidic acid cream or ointment. Unless you're using the cream or ointment to treat your hands, always wash your hands afterwards, too.\n3.  Put a thin layer of cream or ointment onto the infected area and gently rub it in.\n4.  Be careful to avoid your eyes if you use it on your face.\n\n【7】If you accidentally get any medicine in your eye, wash it out with cold water straight away, then bathe your eye with eyewash if possible. Your eye may sting.\n\n【8】If you start to have any problems with your sight or your eye is sore, contact your doctor immediately.\n\n【9】If you have been told to cover the infected skin with any dressings or bandages, you may not need to use the medicine so often. Follow your doctor's advice.\n\n【10】#### Important: Fire warning\n\n【11】Fusidic acid cream or ointment applied to the skin can dry onto your clothes and bedding. This makes them more likely to catch fire. Wash your clothes and bedding regularly to reduce build-up of fusidic acid, although this will not totally remove it. Avoid smoking or going near naked flames.\n\n【12】### How long to use fusidic acid cream or ointment for\n\n【13】Your skin should start to improve after a few days. But it's very important to use the cream or ointment for as long as your doctor has prescribed it.\n\n【14】Treatment with fusidic cream or ointment is usually for 1 or 2 weeks, although sometimes it can be for longer.\n\n【15】#### Important: Finishing your course of fusidic acid cream or ointment\n\n【16】Carry on using this medicine until you have finished the course, even if you feel better.\n\n【17】If you stop your treatment early, the infection could come back.\n\n【18】### If you forget to use fusidic acid cream or ointment\n\n【19】If you forget to use fusidic acid cream or ointment, put it on as soon as you remember. Then continue to use it at the usual time.\n\n【20】### If you use too much fusidic acid cream or ointment\n\n【21】If you put on too much cream or ointment, or if you get some in your mouth, it's unlikely to harm you.\n\n【22】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried, or if you or your child swallow a lot of the medicine.\n\n【23】Eye drops\n---------\n\n【24】Fusidic acid eye drops come as a gel in a tube. As the gel touches your eye it becomes runnier.\n\n【25】### Dosage for fusidic acid eye drops\n\n【26】You'll usually put 1 drop into your eye twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.\n\n【27】### How to use fusidic acid eye drops\n\n【28】1.  Take the cap off the tube when you're ready to use the medicine. It's important that the tip of the tube does not touch your eye. If the tip of the tube touches your eye, squeeze out 2 or 3 drops straight away onto some tissue and rinse the tip of the tube with salt water.\n2.  Tilt your head back. Pull your lower eyelid down gently. Hold the tube over your eye and look up. Squeeze 1 drop into your lower eyelid.\n3.  Close your eye for a minute or two and press gently on the side of your nose where the corner of your eye meets your nose. This helps to stop the drop draining away and keeps it in your eye.\n\n【29】You might get some blurred vision straight after putting the drop into your eye, but this should clear after a few minutes.\n\n【30】If the eye drops are for a child, it might be easier to put the drops in while they're asleep or lying down.\n\n【31】If you normally wear contact lenses, wear your glasses instead until your symptoms have completely gone. Wait for 24 hours after the last dose of eye drops before using your contact lenses again. The eye drops can damage some contact lenses.\n\n【32】### How long to use eye drops for\n\n【33】Your eye should start to feel better within a few days.\n\n【34】But it's very important to use the medicine for as long as your doctor has prescribed it. Even when your eye looks normal again, there may still be some bacteria in it.\n\n【35】As a general rule, use fusidic acid eye drops for at least 48 hours after you feel better and your eye looks normal. This will help make sure that all the bacteria have been killed.\n\n【36】#### Important: Finishing your course of fusidic acid eye drops\n\n【37】Carry on using this medicine until you have finished the course, even if your eye feels better.\n\n【38】If you stop your treatment early, the infection could come back.\n\n【39】### If you forget to use fusidic acid eye drops\n\n【40】If you forget to put the drops in, do it as soon as you remember. Then continue to use the drops at the usual time.\n\n【41】### If you use too many fusidic acid eye drops\n\n【42】If you accidentally put too many fusidic acid eye drops in your eye, or if you swallow the eye drops, it's unlikely to harm you.\n\n【43】Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you're worried.\n删除11：<u>More in Fusidic acid\n--------------------\n\n【44】*   About fusidic acid\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using fusidic acid with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 30 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 30 November 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Their vagina will also be shorter than normal, which may make some sexual acts difficult.\n\n【12】Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS)\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The development of children with PAIS can vary.\n\n【14】In many cases, the genitalia at birth is the first sign and affected babies may have:\n\n【15】*   an enlarged clitoris (the sexual organ that allows women to have an orgasm)\n*   partially undescended testicles\n*   hypospadias – where the hole through which urine passes out of the body is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the end\n\n【16】Children with PAIS are often raised as boys, although they will continue to have a small penis and may develop some breast tissue at puberty.\n\n【17】Some children with PAIS are raised as girls.\n\n【18】Like those with CAIS, people with PAIS do not have a womb or ovaries and will be infertile.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Androgen insensitivity syndrome</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Causes\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Treatment for a brain abscess usually involves a combination of medicines and surgery, depending on the size and number of brain abscesses.**\n\n【3】A brain abscess is a medical emergency, so you'll need treatment in hospital until your condition is stable.\n\n【4】Treatment with medicines often begins before a diagnosis is confirmed to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【5】Medicines\n---------\n\n【6】In some cases, it may be possible to treat an abscess with medicine alone, or surgery may be too risky.\n\n【7】Medicines are recommended over surgery if you have:\n\n【8】*   several abscesses\n*   a small abscess (less than 2.5cm)\n*   an abscess deep inside the brain\n*   meningitis (an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain) as well as an abscess\n*   hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain)\n\n【9】You'll normally be given antibiotics or antifungal medicine through a drip, directly into a vein. Doctors will aim to treat the abscess and the original infection that caused it.\n\n【10】Surgery\n-------\n\n【11】If the abscess is larger than 2.5cm, it's usually necessary to drain the pus out of the abscess. However, you'll still need a course of antibiotics after surgery.\n\n【12】There are 2 surgical techniques for treating a brain abscess:\n\n【13】*   simple aspiration\n*   craniotomy\n\n【14】Simple aspiration involves using a CT scan to locate the abscess and then drilling a small hole known as a \"burr hole\" into the skull. The pus is drained and the hole sealed.\n\n【15】A simple aspiration takes around an hour to complete.\n\n【16】Open aspiration and excisions are usually carried out using a surgical procedure known as a craniotomy.\n\n【17】### Craniotomy\n\n【18】A craniotomy may be recommended if an abscess does not respond to aspiration or reoccurs at a later date.\n\n【19】During a craniotomy, the surgeon shaves a small section of your hair and removes a small piece of your skull bone (a bone flap) to gain access to your brain.\n\n【20】The abscess is then drained of pus or totally removed. CT guidance may be used during the operation, to allow the surgeon to more accurately locate the exact position of the abscess.\n\n【21】Once the abscess has been treated, the bone is replaced. The operation usually takes around 3 hours, which includes recovery from general anaesthetic, where you're put to sleep.\n\n【22】#### Complications of a craniotomy\n\n【23】As with all surgery, a craniotomy carries risks, but serious complications are uncommon.\n\n【24】Possible complications of a craniotomy may include: \n\n【25】*   swelling and bruising around your face – which is common after a craniotomy and should lessen after the operation\n*   headaches – these are common after a craniotomy and may last several months, but should eventually settle down\n*   a blood clot in the brain – further surgery may be required to remove it\n*   stiff jaw – the surgeon may need to make a small cut to a muscle that helps with chewing, which will heal but can become stiff for a few months; exercising the muscle by regularly chewing sugar-free gum should help relieve the stiffness\n*   movement of the bone flap – the bone flap in your skull may feel like it moves and you may experience a clicking sensation; this can feel strange, but it is not dangerous and will stop as the skull heals\n\n【26】The site of the cut (incision) in your skull can become infected, although this is uncommon. You're usually given antibiotics around the time of your operation to prevent infection.\n\n【27】Recovering from surgery\n-----------------------\n\n【28】Once your brain abscess has been treated, you'll probably stay in hospital for several weeks so your body can be supported while you recover.\n\n【29】You'll also receive a number of CT scans, to make sure the brain abscess has been completely removed.\n\n【30】Most people need a further 6 to 12 weeks rest at home before they're fit enough to return to work or full-time education.\n\n【31】After treatment for a brain abscess, avoid any contact sport where there's a risk of injury to the skull, such as boxing, rugby or football.\n\n【32】### Advice for drivers\n\n【33】If you've had brain surgery and you hold a driving licence, you're legally required to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\n【34】It's likely that the DVLA will suspend your driving licence due to your increased risk of having a seizure. Your licence will only be returned once your GP or surgeon confirms it's safe for you to drive.\n\n【35】For most people, this is likely to be 12 months after surgery without having any seizures during this time.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This can be done at a sexual health clinic (SHC) or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. This is important, as some STIs do not cause any symptoms.\n\n【4】Hepatitis A\n-----------\n\n【5】Hepatitis A is a liver infection that's spread by a virus in poo.\n\n【6】Hepatitis A is uncommon in the UK but you can get it through sex, including oral-anal sex (\"rimming\") and giving oral sex after anal sex. MSM with multiple partners are particularly at risk. You can also get it through contaminated food and drink.\n\n【7】Symptoms of hepatitis A can appear up to 8 weeks after sex and include tiredness and feeling sick (nausea).\n\n【8】Hepatitis A is not usually life-threatening and most people make a full recovery within a couple of months.\n\n【9】MSM can avoid getting hepatitis A by:\n\n【10】*   washing hands after sex (bottom, groin and penis too by taking a shower, if possible)\n*   changing condoms between anal and oral sex\n*   using a barrier (such as a condom cut into a square) for rimming\n*   using latex or non-latex gloves for fingering or fisting\n*   not sharing sex toys\n*   asking about the hepatitis A vaccine at a sexual health clinic or GUM clinic\n\n【11】If you think you might have hepatitis A, or have any questions, visit a sexual health clinic or GUM clinic. The hepatitis A vaccine is available for people at higher risk, including MSM with multiple partners.\n\n【12】Hepatitis B\n-----------\n\n【13】Hepatitis B is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. It does not usually cause obvious symptoms and may pass in a few months without treatment. However in some cases the infection can persist and cause serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\n【14】Hepatitis B is spread through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. MSM are at risk of hepatitis B but they can be protected by the hepatitis B vaccination.\n\n【15】Vaccination for MSM is available from sexual health clinics, GUM clinics, or from GPs.\n删除7：<u>Read more about hepatitis B.</u>\n\n【16】Hepatitis C\n-----------\n\n【17】Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. It often does not cause any obvious symptoms at first, but it can lead to serious liver disease if left untreated.\n\n【18】It is spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. Men who are concerned they are at risk should consult their doctor, sexual health clinic or GUM clinic.\n\n【19】Hepatitis C can be treated and is curable in many cases. Find your local hepatitis C information and support service.\n删除7：<u>Read more about hepatitis C.</u>\n\n【20】Gonorrhoea\n----------\n\n【21】This bacterial infection causes stinging when you pee, or the feeling that you want to pee but are unable to. It's passed on through anal, oral or vaginal sex with an infected person.\n\n【22】Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics.\n删除7：<u>Read more about gonorrhoea.</u>\n\n【23】Non-specific urethritis (NSU)\n-----------------------------\n\n【24】This is inflammation of the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body) caused by bacteria. It is also called non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) when the condition is not caused by gonorrhoea.\n\n【25】NSU is passed on in the same way as gonorrhoea and often has similar symptoms. It can also be caused by having lots of sex or masturbating a lot, which can make the urethra inflamed.\n\n【26】It can be treated with antibiotics.\n\n【27】Chlamydia\n---------\n\n【28】This is a bacterial infection of the urethra, testicles or bottom (rectum). It can also affect the throat and eyes, but this is less common. Chlamydia may cause a discharge, pain when you pee, or pain in the testicles. However, not everyone has symptoms.\n\n【29】It can be passed on during sex with an infected person in the same way as gonorrhoea. It's treated with antibiotics.\n删除7：<u>Read more about chlamydia.</u>\n\n【30】Shigella\n--------\n\n【31】This is a bacterial infection of the intestine that causes severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It is often mistaken for food poisoning.\n\n【32】It can be passed on during sex, including anal-oral sex (\"rimming\") and giving oral sex after anal sex. It is spread very easily – all it takes is a tiny amount of infected poo getting into your mouth.\n\n【33】A person with shigella can be infectious for up to a month. It can be treated with antibiotics. Men who suspect they have shigella should visit a sexual health clinic or their GP to get tested.\n\n【34】Men can avoid getting shigella by washing their hands after sex (bottom, groin and penis too by taking a shower, if possible), and changing condoms between anal and oral sex.\n\n【35】Using latex or non-latex gloves for fingering or fisting offers protection. And do not share sex toys or douching equipment.\n\n【36】You'll find more information about shigella on the Gov.UK website.\n\n【37】Genital herpes\n--------------\n\n【38】Genital herpes is a viral infection. Symptoms can include painful blisters and ulcers on or around the penis or bottom (anus), although some men have no symptoms.\n\n【39】The virus stays in the body and can cause outbreaks of blisters.\n\n【40】Genital herpes can be passed on through oral sex with someone who has a cold sore around or in their mouth, or by skin-to-skin genital contact with someone who has genital herpes.  \n\n【41】Antiviral tablets and creams from a GP or sexual health clinic, can help the symptoms. \n删除7：<u>Read more about genital herpes.</u>\n\n【42】Syphilis\n--------\n\n【43】Syphilis is a bacterial infection that causes a painless ulcer, usually in the genital area. The ulcer will disappear on its own but other symptoms may appear, such as a rash on the body and swollen glands.\n\n【44】In its early stages, syphilis is very infectious and can be passed on by close skin contact during sex. If you do not treat it, the infection can eventually spread to the brain or other parts of the body and cause serious, long-term problems.\n\n【45】Treatment is with antibiotic injections or tablets.\n删除7：<u>Read more about syphilis.</u>\n\n【46】Genital warts\n-------------\n\n【47】This is a common viral infection caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It appears a few weeks or months after sex with an infected person. It can cause pinhead-size growths, mostly on or around the head of the penis but also in and around the bottom (anus).\n\n【48】The sooner warts are treated, the easier they are to manage. You cannot treat genital warts with the same type of cream you use for warts on other parts of your body. A doctor will freeze them or prescribe a cream to remove them.\n\n【49】You can reduce your risk of getting genital warts by getting the HPV vaccine.\n\n【50】MSM up to and including the age of 45 become eligible for free HPV vaccination on the NHS when they visit a specialist sexual health clinic or HIV clinic in England.\n\n【51】Ask the doctor or nurse at the clinic for more details.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about who should have the HPV vaccine.</u>\n删除7：<u>Read more about genital warts.</u>\n\n【52】Pubic lice\n----------\n\n【53】Pubic lice (also known as \"crabs\") are small, parasitic insects that live in body hair.\n\n【54】They are very small (only 2mm), so they can be difficult to see, although their tiny dark eggs can be seen stuck to hair.\n\n【55】Pubic lice prefer the pubic hair around your testicles and bottom but may also be found in body hair. They are not found on your scalp.\n\n【56】The lice are spread through close bodily contact with an infected person. They can also be spread by sharing clothes, towels or bedding, but this is rare. Symptoms include itching or a rash.\n\n【57】Treatment can be done at home with lotions or creams bought from a pharmacy (no prescription is needed).\n删除7：<u>Read more about pubic lice.</u>\n\n【58】Scabies\n-------\n\n【59】This is an infection caused by tiny mites that burrow under the skin. It causes intense itching for most people (though some hardly notice it).\n\n【60】Itching usually starts 2 or more weeks after sex with an infected person. You can also get scabies from sharing beds and towels, but this is less common.\n\n【61】Treatment is similar to treating pubic lice, although you may continue to itch for a few weeks after the mites have been removed.\n删除7：<u>Read more about scabies.</u>\n\n【62】Get tested\n----------\n\n【63】If you have any of the symptoms above or are worried you may have an STI, speak to your GP, visit a sexual health clinic or GUM clinic.\n\n【64】Getting tested regularly is a good way to ensure you have a healthy sex life. NHS services are free.\n\n【65】Protection against HIV\n----------------------\n\n【66】If you’re regularly having condomless sex, speak to a health professional at a sexual health clinic or GUM clinic, about PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). PrEP is a medicine you can take daily or on demand (before and after sex) that can protect you from HIV.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about PrEP</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Sexual health\n---------------------\n\n【67】*   Where can I get sexual health advice, now?\n*   If I use a sexual health service will they tell my parents?\n*   Visiting a sexual health clinic\n*   Sexual health for gay and bisexual men\n*   Sexual health for lesbian and bisexual women\n*   Sex activities and risk\n*   Help after rape and sexual assault\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's important to take it as advised by your specialist.\n\n【4】For adults, dosages and how often you take it depends on your condition:\n\n【5】*   **plaque psoriasis** – the usual starting dose is 80mg, then 40mg after a week and then 40mg, taken every 2 weeks\n*   **rheumatoid arthritis** – the usual dose is 40mg, taken every 2 weeks. You can take it weekly, or 80mg every 2 weeks, if you're not taking any other medicine for rheumatoid arthritis\n*   **psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis** – the usual dose is 40mg, taken every 2 weeks\n*   **Crohn's disease** – the usual starting dose is 80mg and then 40mg, taken every 2 weeks. It can be taken weekly if needed or 80mg every 2 weeks. If you need a higher dose, you can start with 160mg, then 80mg after 2 weeks and then 40mg every 2 weeks\n*   **ulcerative colitis** – the usual starting dose is 160mg, then 80mg after 2 weeks and then 40mg, taken every 2 weeks. It can be taken weekly if needed or 80mg every 2 weeks\n*   **hidradenitis suppurativa** – the usual starting dose is 160mg, then 80mg after 2 weeks and then after another 2 weeks you can take 40mg every week or 80mg every 2 weeks\n*   **non-infectious uveitis** – the usual starting dose is 80mg, then 40mg after a week and then 40mg, taken every 2 weeks\n\n【6】For children, dosages are usually based on their weight. How often they take it depends on their condition:\n\n【7】*   **plaque psoriasis** – after the first dose, doses are given after 1 week, and then every 2 weeks\n*   **juvenile idiopathic arthritis** – after the first dose, doses are usually given every 2 weeks\n*   **enthesitis-related arthritis** – doses are given every 2 weeks\n*   **Crohn's disease** – after the first dose, doses are given every 2 weeks. It can be given weekly if needed\n*   **non-infectious uveitis** – after the first dose, doses are given after 1 week, and then every 2 weeks. It can be given every 2 weeks from the first dose\n*   **adolescent hidradenitis suppurativa (from 12 years)** – the usual starting dose is 80mg, then 40mg after one week and then 40mg every 2 weeks. It can be given weekly if needed or 80mg every 2 weeks\n*   **ulcerative colitis** – after the first dose, doses are given every 2 weeks\n\n【8】### Important: Patient alert card\n\n【9】When you start taking adalimumab you'll be given a patient alert card. Carry this with you all the time.\n\n【10】It tells healthcare professionals that you're taking adalimumab.

This means your injection is almost done.\n\n【28】If you forget your dose\n-----------------------\n\n【29】If you forget to give yourself an injection, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose on the original scheduled day.\n\n【30】If you do not remember until close to the day of your next dose, speak to your specialist. They'll let you know whether to skip the missed dose.\n\n【31】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【32】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【33】*   you have taken more than your prescribed dose of adalimumab\n\n【34】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【35】Have the medicine packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【36】If you need to go to A&E, do not drive yourself.

some vaccines cannot be given to people with certain medical conditions\n*   working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster\n*   working in a medical setting – a doctor, nurse or another healthcare worker may require additional vaccinations\n*   contact with animals – you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies\n\n【41】If you're only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you're unlikely to need any vaccinations.\n\n【42】But it's important to check that you're up-to-date with routine vaccinations available on the NHS.\n\n【43】Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n---------------------------\n\n【44】Speak to a GP before having any vaccinations if:\n\n【45】*   you're pregnant\n*   you think you might be pregnant\n*   you're breastfeeding\n\n【46】In many cases, it's unlikely a vaccine given while you're pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby.\n\n【47】But the GP will be able to give you further advice about this.\n\n【48】People with immune deficiencies\n-------------------------------\n\n【49】For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised.\n\n【50】This may be the case if:\n\n【51】*   you have a condition that affects your body's immune system, such as HIV or AIDS\n*   you're receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy\n*   you have recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant\n\n【52】A GP can give you further advice about this.\n\n【53】Non-travel vaccines\n-------------------\n\n【54】As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it's also a good opportunity to make sure your other UK vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster vaccines if necessary.\n\n【55】If you have any records of your vaccinations, let the GP know what you have had previously.\n\n【56】People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines.\n\n【57】These include vaccinations against diseases such as:\n\n【58】*   hepatitis B\n*   tuberculosis (TB)\n*   flu\n*   chickenpox\n删除7：<u>Read more information on NHS vaccines for adults and children to find out whether you should have any.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Available vaccines</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Change your eating habits, for example, eat smaller, more frequent meals and do other things to help with the symptoms of GORD.\n2.  If you smoke, try to give up, as it can irritate your digestive system and make your symptoms worse.\n3.  Buy medicines from the pharmacy (ask the pharmacist what you should take to help with the symptoms of GORD).\n4.  If medicines from the pharmacy and changing your eating habits do not help, see a GP, who can prescribe stronger medicines.\n5.  If stronger medicines do not work, a GP can send you for further tests to find out if your symptoms are caused by a hiatus hernia. They might also prescribe medicines for long-term GORD.\n6.  A GP might refer you to a specialist to check if you need surgery. This usually only happens if other treatments have not worked and you keep having very bad symptoms.\n\n【20】### Surgery for a hiatus hernia\n\n【21】Keyhole surgery (also called a Laparoscopy) is usually used for a hiatus hernia. This involves making small cuts in your tummy (abdomen).\n\n【22】It's done under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation.\n\n【23】After surgery, it usually takes:\n\n【24】*   2 to 3 days to go home\n*   3 to 6 weeks to go back to work\n*   6 weeks before you can eat what you want\n*   a few months to recover from side effects like bloating, burping, farting and difficulty swallowing\n\n【25】There's a small risk (about 1 in 100) that your side effects will not go away and you'll need more surgery.\n\n【26】What causes a hiatus hernia\n---------------------------\n\n【27】It's not clear what causes a hiatus hernia.

It's free for pregnant women.\n\n【2】Why are pregnant women advised to have the flu vaccine?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】A flu jab will help protect both you and your baby.\n\n【4】There is good evidence that pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.\n\n【5】Pregnancy changes how the body responds to infections such as flu. Having flu increases the chances of pregnant women and their babies needing intensive care.\n\n【6】One of the most common complications of flu is bronchitis, a chest infection that can become serious and develop into pneumonia.\n\n【7】If you have flu while you're pregnant, it could cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birthweight, and may even lead to stillbirth or death.\n\n【8】Is the flu vaccine safe in pregnancy?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【9】Yes. Studies have shown that it's safe to have a flu vaccine during any stage of pregnancy, from the first few weeks up to your expected due date.\n\n【10】Women who have had a flu vaccine while pregnant also pass some protection on to their babies, which lasts for the first few months of their lives.\n\n【11】It's safe for women who are breastfeeding to have a flu vaccine if they're eligible (for example, because of a long-term health condition).\n\n【12】When should I have the flu jab?\n-------------------------------\n\n【13】The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, before flu starts circulating.\n\n【14】If you've missed this time, you can be vaccinated later in the winter although it's better to get it earlier.\n\n【15】Do not worry if you find that you're pregnant later in the flu season – you can have the vaccine then if you have not already had it.\n\n【16】How do I get the flu vaccine?\n-----------------------------\n\n【17】To get a flu vaccine you can:\n\n【18】*   contact your GP surgery to book an appointment\n*   find a pharmacy that offers NHS flu vaccination (if you're aged 18 or over)\n*   contact your midwife – in some areas you may be able to get a flu vaccine through a maternity service\n\n【19】If I had the flu jab last year, do I need to have it again now?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Yes, because the viruses that cause flu change every year. This means the flu strains the vaccines are designed to prevent this year may be different from last year. The protection from a flu vaccine also goes down with time.\n\n【21】If you had the flu vaccine during the last flu season because you were pregnant (same pregnancy or a previous pregnancy), or because you're in a vulnerable group, you need to have it again this year.\n\n【22】Will the flu jab give me flu?\n-----------------------------\n\n【23】No. Injected flu vaccines do not contain any live viruses, and cannot cause flu. Some people get a slightly raised temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards, and you may feel sore at the injection site.\n\n【24】Can I have the flu jab at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Yes, you can have a flu vaccine at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine, but do not delay your flu jab so you can have both at the same time.\n\n【26】Pregnant women are at risk of severe illness from flu at any stage of pregnancy, so you need to have a flu vaccine as soon as possible.\n\n【27】The best time to get vaccinated against whooping cough is from 16 weeks up to 32 weeks of pregnancy. \n\n【28】If you miss having the vaccine for any reason, you can still have it up until you go into labour.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy.</u>\n\n【29】I'm pregnant and think I have flu. What should I do?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Talk to a GP as soon as possible.

It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.**\n\n【3】It develops when the lymphatic system does not work properly. The lymphatic system is a network of channels and glands throughout the body that helps fight infection and remove excess fluid.\n\n【4】It's important that lymphoedema is identified and treated as soon as possible. If it is not treated, it can get worse.\n\n【5】Symptoms of lymphoedema\n-----------------------\n\n【6】The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body. It can be difficult to fit into clothes, and jewellery and watches can feel tight.\n\n【7】At first, the swelling may be soft and easy to push in, leaving a dent, and may come and go. It may get worse during the day and go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.\n\n【8】Other symptoms in an affected body part can include:\n\n【9】*   an aching, heavy feeling\n*   difficulty with movement\n*   repeated skin infections\n*   developing hard, tight or thickened skin\n*   folds developing in the skin\n*   wart-like growths developing on the skin\n*   fluid leaking through the skin\n\n【10】Signs of lymphoedema in the head and neck may include swelling or heaviness in the face, mouth or throat, and problems with swallowing and speech.\n\n【11】What causes lymphoedema?\n------------------------\n\n【12】Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The main functions of the lymphatic system are helping fight infection and draining excess fluid from tissues.\n\n【13】There are 2 main types of lymphoedema:\n\n【14】*   primary lymphoedema – caused by faulty genes that affect the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually starts during infancy, adolescence, or early adulthood\n*   secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system; it can be the result of a cancer treatment, an infection, injury, inflammation of the limb, or a lack of limb movement\n删除7：<u>Read more about the causes of lymphoedema</u>\n\n【15】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【16】Lymphoedema is thought to affect more than 200,000 people in the UK. Primary lymphoedema is rare and secondary lymphoedema is much more common.\n\n【17】Secondary lymphoedema often affects people with cancers that involve the lymph system or who've had treatment to the lymph nodes, such as breast cancer, vulval cancer, penile cancer, and head and neck cancer.\n\n【18】People who have treatment for skin cancer (melanoma) in the lymph nodes in the groin can also get lymphoedema.\n\n【19】Your treatment team will let you know if you're at risk of getting lymphoedema from your cancer or cancer treatment. Any planned treatment you have will try to avoid causing damage to your lymph nodes.\n删除7：<u>Cancer Research UK has more information about lymphoedema and cancer.</u>\n\n【20】Diagnosing lymphoedema\n----------------------\n\n【21】See a GP if you experience the typical symptoms of lymphoedema, such as swelling in your arms and legs. They may refer you to a specialist lymphoedema treatment centre for further assessment.\n\n【22】In many cases, lymphoedema can be diagnosed from your symptoms and medical history, and by examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged.\n\n【23】Occasionally, further tests may be necessary to assess and monitor your condition.\n\n【24】If you're being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you'll be monitored for it afterwards.\n删除7：<u>Read more about diagnosing lymphoedema</u>\n\n【25】Treating lymphoedema\n--------------------\n\n【26】There's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.\n\n【27】These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema.</u>\n\n【28】Complications\n-------------\n\n【29】Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema. It can also have a significant psychological impact. It can be serious if it's not treated quickly.\n\n【30】### Cellulitis\n\n【31】If you have lymphoedema, the build-up of fluid in your tissues makes you more vulnerable to infection.\n\n【32】Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) that often affects people with lymphoedema. Cellulitis can also sometimes cause lymphoedema.\n\n【33】Symptoms of cellulitis can include:\n\n【34】*   redness and a feeling of heat in the skin – this may be harder to see on brown and black skin\n*   pain and increased swelling in the affected area\n*   a high temperature\n*   chills\n\n【35】Antibiotics taken by mouth (orally) can usually be used to treat cellulitis, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).\n\n【36】### Psychological impact\n\n【37】Living with a long-term condition that affects your appearance can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression.\n\n【38】You may be depressed if you've been feeling down for the past few months and no longer find pleasure in things you usually enjoy.\n\n【39】If this is the case, talk to a GP or a member of your lymphoedema treatment team. Effective treatments are available for depression.\n\n【40】Talking to other people with lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety.\n\n【41】Visit the Lymphoedema Support Network website for information and advice. They can also put you in touch with a support group in your area.\n\n【42】If you continue with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.\n删除3：<u>Video: lymphoedema - Philippa's story\n-------------------------------------\n\n【43】In this video, Philippa describes how she lives with primary lymphoedema.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 2 December 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 2 December 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 29 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 29 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Tiny amounts of lithium are found naturally in rocks, and in our food and bodies.\n\n【3】We do not really know how lithium works to treat mental health conditions, but it's thought that it may protect and help create more neurons (the cells that pass messages in your brain).\n\n【4】How long does it take to work?\n\n【5】Lithium may take several weeks or months to work.\n\n【6】How will it make me feel?\n\n【7】If you have the right amount of lithium in your blood, you probably will not have any problems with your medicine.\n\n【8】However, some people find it slows down their thinking or makes them feel a bit “numb”. Sometimes it's hard to know if this is because the lithium is helping to control your mood, or if you have mania.\n\n【9】Talk to your doctor if you're worried that lithium is slowing down your thinking or numbing your emotions. You may need to have your lithium levels checked again.\n\n【10】What will happen if I stop taking lithium?\n\n【11】If you or your doctor decide to stop your lithium, it must be reduced gradually over a number of weeks or months. If you stop taking it suddenly the symptoms of your condition are likely to come back.\n\n【12】Do not stop taking lithium suddenly even if you feel better, or because you think the dose is too little or too much.\n\n【13】Your doctor will help you to reduce your medicine and stop completely, if you need to.\n\n【14】However, if you think you have lithium toxicity (the side effects of having taken more than your prescribed dose) it's important to stop taking lithium straight away and get medical help.\n\n【15】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:\n\n【16】you have any of these symptoms:\n\n【17】*   stomach ache, feeling sick (nausea) and having diarrhoea\n*   problems with your eyesight (blurred vision)\n*   feeling very thirsty, needing to pee more than normal, and lack of control over pee or poo\n*   feeling lightheaded or drowsy\n*   confusion and blackouts\n*   shaking, muscle weakness, muscle twitches, jerks or spasms affecting the face, tongue, eyes or neck\n*   difficulty speaking\n\n【18】These are signs of lithium toxicity, which is an emergency. Stop taking lithium straight away.\n\n【19】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【20】Lithium is generally safe to take for a long time. Most people take it for years with no problems.\n\n【21】If you've been taking lithium for some time, it can cause weight gain.\n\n【22】If you find you're putting on weight after taking lithium for a while, try to have a healthy balanced diet. Regular exercise will also help you keep your weight stable. Your doctor will usually monitor your weight while you're taking this medicine.\n\n【23】It can also cause problems with your kidneys or thyroid gland.\n\n【24】Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed. Signs of kidney problems include swollen hands or ankles, feeling tired and short of breath, changes in your pee and feeling sick.\n\n【25】Tell your doctor if you get any these symptoms. Your doctor will arrange a blood test to check your thyroid and kidneys for any changes.\n\n【26】Your doctor may discuss topping up levels of the hormone that the thyroid gland normally produces (thyroxine) with a tablet.\n\n【27】Is lithium an antipsychotic?\n\n【28】Lithium is used to stabilise your mood and is not an antipsychotic medicine. However, your doctor might prescribe an antipsychotic medicine with lithium.\n\n【29】How well does lithium treat depression?\n\n【30】Usually, if you have depression, you'll be prescribed an antidepressant medicine first as they're considered more effective for depression than lithium.\n\n【31】However, if antidepressants have not worked, your doctor might prescribe lithium as well. This may be more effective and help your symptoms get better.\n\n【32】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【33】Lithium does not affect contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【34】However, if you're sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your combined pill may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【35】Find out what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.\n\n【36】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【37】If you have just started taking lithium, or your dose has recently been changed, it may make you feel tired, dizzy, sleepy and make your hands shake.\n\n【38】If this happens, stop driving a car, riding a bike or using tools or heavy machinery for the first few days, until you know how lithium affects you and until you feel more alert.\n\n【39】If you've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\n\n【40】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking lithium. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving</u>\n\n【41】Can I drink alcohol while taking lithium?\n\n【42】Lithium can make you drowsy so it's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of taking lithium, or if your dose is increased.\n\n【43】If you feel OK after this, you can drink alcohol but it's best not to drink too much as it's likely to make you dehydrated. This can increase the chance of high levels of lithium in your blood. It's important to remember this, especially in hot weather when you will sweat more, and your body loses water.\n\n【44】Are there any foods and drink I need to avoid?\n\n【45】You can eat and drink normally while taking lithium.\n\n【46】However, it's best to avoid a low-sodium (low-salt) diet as this can increase the levels of lithium in your blood and increase the chance of getting side effects.\n\n【47】The amount of fluid you drink is very important as it can affect the levels of lithium in your blood. Getting dehydrated will affect the levels, so it's good to drink plenty of fluids.\n\n【48】Some people may put on weight when taking lithium. Try to eat well without increasing your portion sizes. Regular exercise can also help to keep your weight stable.\n\n【49】Can I take lithium with recreational drugs?\n\n【50】Using recreational drugs can affect the level of lithium in the body.\n\n【51】Taking ecstasy while you're on lithium can make you dehydrated, which can lead to lithium toxicity.\n\n【52】Tell your doctor if you think you may take recreational drugs while you're on lithium.\n\n【53】Find out more the side effects of some recreational drugs on the Frank website.\n删除11：<u>More in Lithium\n---------------\n\n【54】*   About lithium\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

They also stop your body releasing too much sugar (glucose) into your blood.\n\n【5】Both of these things help keep your blood sugar levels stable.\n\n【6】How long does it take to work?\n\n【7】Alogliptin starts to work within a few hours.\n\n【8】You need to take it every day to make sure your blood sugar stays as stable as possible.\n\n【9】Does alogliptin cause hypoglycaemia (\"hypos\")?\n\n【10】Alogliptin does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or \"hypos\") when taken on its own.\n\n【11】If you're taking other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose of your other medicines when you start alogliptin. This will reduce the risk of hypos.\n\n【12】Are there any long term-side effects?\n\n【13】Alogliptin is safe to take for a long time. There do not seem to be any lasting harmful effects from taking it for many months or even years.\n\n【14】Are there similar medicines to alogliptin?\n\n【15】Alogliptin is a dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4 inhibitor).\n\n【16】Similar medicines include:\n\n【17】*   linagliptin\n*   saxagliptin\n*   sitagliptin\n*   vildagliptin\n\n【18】There are other diabetes medicines that you also swallow, such as:\n\n【19】*   metformin\n*   gliclazide\n*   glimepiride\n*   pioglitazone\n*   canagliflozin\n*   dapagliflozin\n*   empagliflozin\n\n【20】Are there different types of diabetes medicines?\n\n【21】There are several medicines that can lower blood sugar:\n\n【22】*   metformin\n*   sulfonylureas, like gliclazide\n*   pioglitazone\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors, like sitagliptin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, like exenatide (given by injection)\n*   insulin (given by injection)\n\n【23】Your doctor might recommend taking more than one type of diabetes medicine at the same time.\n\n【24】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【25】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【26】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate (FP92A).\n\n【27】You can get an application form at your GP surgery.\n\n【28】Can I take alogliptin before surgery?\n\n【29】Yes, you can take alogliptin before surgery.\n\n【30】Tell your surgeon that you're taking alogliptin and any other medicines.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Alogliptin does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】However, if alogliptin gives you severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.

But it's best to drink no more than 2 units per day. Drinking more than this can increase your risk of low blood sugar.\n\n【40】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【41】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar.\n\n【42】Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar, such as:\n\n【43】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【44】Can lifestyle changes help to control diabetes?\n\n【45】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\n\n【46】These include:\n\n【47】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing any excess weight\n*   not smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week.

This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\n\n【20】Your care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and talk to you about your options.\n\n【21】In some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\n\n【22】Second cancers\n--------------\n\n【23】Having treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. This is known as a second cancer.\n\n【24】The risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells.\n\n【25】This damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.\n\n【26】You can help reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle through not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\n\n【27】You should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you're invited to.\n\n【28】Other health problems\n---------------------\n\n【29】Treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain conditions at a younger age than normal, such as:\n\n【30】*   heart disease\n*   lung disease\n\n【31】Having a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk of depression.\n\n【32】You should report unexpected symptoms, such as increasing shortness of breath, to your GP.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 June 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 June 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Some people get them during pregnancy.\n\n【12】Less often, they can be caused by a condition such as iron deficiency anaemia, an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or a heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia).\n\n【13】Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n-------------------------------\n\n【14】You have heart palpitations and:\n\n【15】*   they keep coming back or they're getting worse\n*   they last longer than a few minutes\n*   you have a heart condition\n*   you have a history of heart problems in your family\n\n【16】Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】You currently have heart palpitations with any of these symptoms:\n\n【18】*   chest pain\n*   shortness of breath\n*   feeling faint or fainting\n\n【19】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【20】Information:\n\n【21】If you've had these symptoms but they've now stopped, ask your GP surgery for an urgent appointment, call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【22】Treatment for heart palpitations\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】Treatment for heart palpitations depends on the cause. They often do not need to be treated.\n\n【24】Avoiding things that can trigger palpitations, such as stress, smoking, caffeine and alcohol, can help.\n\n【25】You may have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to help find out what the cause might be. This is a test where small pads are stuck to your skin to check the electrical signals coming from your heart.\n\n【26】If your palpitations are caused by a heart problem, you may need medicines or a procedure to help correct your heartbeat.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 07 June 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 07 June 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a7c9b3a3-4374-4b96-bb1e-1b04d44dd4be", "title": "Codeine", "text": "【0】Common questions about codeine\n==============================\n\n【1】How does codeine work?\n\n【2】Codeine is from a group of medicines called opiates, or narcotics. It works in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body. It also reduces the anxiety and stress caused by pain.\n\n【3】When codeine blocks the pain, there are other unwanted effects, such as slow or shallow breathing. It also slows down digestion, which is why codeine can cause constipation.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】This depends on the type of codeine you take. A codeine injection into a vein gives the quickest pain relief – it works almost straight away. But you can only get this at a hospital.\n\n【6】Codeine tablets, liquid and cough syrup all work in about 30 to 60 minutes, but stop working after a few hours.\n\n【7】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【8】Some people with conditions that need long-term pain relief may need to take codeine for a long time.\n\n【9】If you need to take it for a long time your body can become used to it (known as tolerance). That means you may need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【10】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【11】It's possible to become addicted to codeine. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only having the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【12】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop codeine.\n\n【13】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe long-term pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【14】How will I know if I'm addicted to codeine?\n\n【15】If you're addicted to codeine, you may find it difficult to stop taking it or feel you need to take it more often than necessary.\n\n【16】If you stop taking codeine suddenly you may get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【17】These can include:\n\n【18】*   feeling agitated or anxious\n*   panic attacks\n*   feeling your heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   shaking\n*   sweating\n*   body aches\n*   feeling restless\n\n【19】Talk to your doctor if you:\n\n【20】*   are worried about addiction\n*   need help with addiction\n*   want to stop taking codeine\n\n【21】How does codeine compare with other painkillers?\n\n【22】The type of painkiller that's best depends on what type of pain you have. If codeine does not get rid of your pain or becomes less effective, talk to your doctor.\n\n【23】Can children take codeine?\n\n【24】Do not give codeine to babies and children under 12.\n\n【25】Children aged 12 to 18 years can take codeine for pain or diarrhoea, but only if other medicines have not worked. Use the lowest dose that works for no more than 3 days. If they still have symptoms after 3 days, see a doctor.\n\n【26】Codeine should not be given to children aged 12 to 18 years if they have breathing problems or if they have had their tonsils or adenoids removed to treat obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n【27】Is codeine a controlled medicine?\n\n【28】Codeine is a controlled medicine. This means there are extra rules on how it's prescribed and dispensed to make sure it's not given to the wrong person or misused. However, this does not affect you as a patient. The rules only apply to the pharmacy that dispenses it.\n\n【29】Will it make me so sleepy I cannot function?\n\n【30】When you first take codeine, you'll probably feel sleepy for a few days. But the sleepiness will wear off as your body gets used to the medicine.\n\n【31】You might notice you're less alert. In this case, you might choose to take a lower dose and have less than perfect pain relief as a trade-off.\n\n【32】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【33】Codeine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【34】But if you are taking codeine because you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【35】Find out what to do if you are on the pill and have diarrhoea\n\n【36】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【37】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if codeine makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions. This may be more likely when you first start taking codeine but could happen at any time, for example when starting another medicine.\n\n【38】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking codeine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【39】Can I drink alcohol while taking codeine?\n\n【40】Drinking alcohol while you're on codeine may make you feel more sleepy, and can increase the risk of serious side effects.\n\n【41】It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of treatment until you see how codeine affects you.\n\n【42】If you feel sleepy with codeine, stop drinking alcohol while you're taking it.\n\n【43】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【44】Apart from alcohol, which you may need to reduce or stop, you can eat and drink normally while taking codeine.\n\n【45】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【46】If you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine or heroin, while you're taking codeine, you're more likely to get the serious side effects of codeine including breathing difficulties, heart problems or having a fit or seizure. On rare occasions, this may even result in a coma.\n\n【47】Some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, will also increase codeine side effects such as sleepiness and dizziness.\n\n【48】Taking heroin while you're on prescribed codeine is especially dangerous. You're more likely to get all the side effects of codeine, including addiction.\n\n【49】Tell your doctor if you think you may take recreational drugs while you're on codeine.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the side effects of recreational drugs on the Frank website.</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Codeine\n---------------\n\n【50】*   About codeine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking codeine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 January 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But it's often not clear why NPH happens.\n\n【20】It may be that NPH is linked to other underlying health conditions that affect the normal flow of blood – for example, diabetes, heart disease, or having a high level of cholesterol in the blood.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

All screening tests offered by the NHS are free.\n\n【5】</u>\nWhat are screening tests?\n-------------------------\n\n【6】Screening tests are used to find people at higher chance of a health problem.\n\n【7】This means they can get earlier, potentially more effective, treatment or make informed decisions about their health.\n\n【8】Screening tests are not perfect. Some people will be told that they or their baby have a higher chance of having a health condition when in fact they do not have the condition.\n\n【9】Also, a few people will be told that they or their baby have a lower chance of having a health condition when in fact they do have the condition.\n\n【10】What do screening tests involve?\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】The screening tests offered during pregnancy in England are either ultrasound scans or blood tests, or a combination of both.\n\n【12】Ultrasound scans may detect conditions such as spina bifida.\n\n【13】Blood tests can show whether you have a higher chance of inherited conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and whether you have infections like HIV, hepatitis B or syphilis.\n\n【14】Blood tests combined with scans can help find out how likely it is that the baby has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.\n\n【15】What are the risks of screening tests?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【16】Screening tests cannot harm you or the baby but it is important to consider carefully whether or not to have these tests.\n\n【17】Some screening tests in pregnancy can lead to difficult decisions for you.\n\n【18】For example, screening tests for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome can lead to difficult decisions about whether to have a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis, that carries a chance of miscarriage.\n\n【19】A diagnostic test tells you for certain whether you or your baby has the condition.\n\n【20】If diagnostic tests show your baby has a condition, this can lead to a decision about whether you want to continue or end the pregnancy.\n\n【21】Having a further test or ending the pregnancy will always be your decision, and healthcare professionals will support you whatever you decide.\n\n【22】It's up to you whether or not you choose to have screening tests in pregnancy.\n\n【23】When will I be offered screening?\n---------------------------------\n\n【24】Different screening tests are offered at different times during pregnancy.\n\n【25】The screening test for sickle cell and thalassaemia should be offered as early as possible before 10 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【26】It's recommended that screening blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis should happen as early as possible in pregnancy.\n\n【27】This is so you can be offered specialist care and treatment to protect your health and reduce the chance of your baby getting infected.\n\n【28】These blood tests should not be delayed until the first scan appointment.\n\n【29】You'll be offered screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome around the time of your dating scan, which happens when you're around 11 to 14 weeks pregnant.\n\n【30】You'll be offered screening to check your baby's development at a 20-week scan when you're around 18 to 21 weeks pregnant.\n\n【31】Will screening tests give me a definite answer?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【32】This depends what the screening tests are looking for.\n\n【33】### Yes\n\n【34】Screening tests for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis are very accurate, and will tell for certain whether you have these infections.\n\n【35】If the test is positive, you'll be offered further tests and examinations by specialist doctors to find out the treatment you need.\n\n【36】### No\n\n【37】Screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome cannot say for certain whether your baby has the condition. It tells you if your baby has a lower or higher chance of having the condition.\n\n【38】If your baby has a higher chance of a condition, you'll be offered a diagnostic test that gives a more definite \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\n\n【39】Screening tests for sickle cell and thalassaemia will tell you for certain whether you're a carrier or have these conditions. They will not tell you whether or not your baby has the condition.\n\n【40】If you or the baby's father is a carrier or has the condition, you'll be offered diagnostic tests to find out if your baby is affected.\n\n【41】Do I have to have screening?\n----------------------------\n\n【42】No – it's up to you whether you have a screening test.

Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them.\n\n【57】Sometimes information is used for audit research purposes to improve screening outcomes and services.

It's identical to the oestrogen your ovaries produce before the menopause.\n\n【4】As you go through the menopause your levels of oestrogen fall, causing symptoms such as hot flushes, low mood and vaginal dryness or irritation.\n\n【5】Taking oestrogen as HRT increases your levels so that they are similar to before the menopause. This reduces your symptoms and also helps makes your bones stronger.\n\n【6】When will I feel better?\n\n【7】It can take up to 3 months for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to work fully in improving your symptoms.\n\n【8】There are different types of HRT, and it can take time to find the type and dose that works for you.\n\n【9】If you do not feel better after 3 months, speak to your doctor. They may suggest changing your dose, or switching to a different type of HRT.\n\n【10】If you're taking oestrogen for osteoporosis you're unlikely to notice any difference in how you feel, but the oestrogen will be helping make your bones stronger.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】It's best to only take HRT at the lowest dose that works for you, and only for as long as you need it to control your menopause symptoms.\n\n【13】This is because HRT can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and blood clots. The risk is small, but it increases the longer you take it.\n\n【14】Usually, the risk is outweighed by the benefits of HRT, such as improving menopause symptoms, quality of life and preventing osteoporosis. But this depends on your age, symptoms and health. Speak to your doctor, who can help you decide.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the benefits and risks of HRT</u>\n\n【15】How does it compare with other types of HRT?\n\n【16】There are several different types of HRT. They all work equally well to replace the hormones that fall during and after the menopause.\n\n【17】There is not 1 type of HRT that is suitable for everyone. You may need to try different types to find what works best for you.\n\n【18】Most oestrogen medicines contain a type of oestrogen called estradiol that comes from plants and is identical to the oestrogen that your body produces. Other types include conjugated oestrogen (called by the brand name Premarin), but this is now less commonly used.\n\n【19】If you still have your womb, you'll need to take oestrogen tablets, patches, gel or spray with a separate progestogen medicine such as Utrogestan (micronised progesterone).\n\n【20】There are other types of HRT that combine oestrogen and progestogen in one medicine. These are available as patches, tablets or capsules:\n\n【21】*   sequential combined HRT, for if you're still having periods\n*   continuous combined HRT, for if you're no longer having periods\n\n【22】You can also get your progestogen by using the intrauterine system (IUS), also known as the Mirena coil or hormonal coil. This can be useful if you have side effects from other forms of progestogen, if you have heavy periods, or if you also need contraception.\n\n【23】There are also several types of vaginal oestrogen. These are effective for symptoms such as vaginal dryness, and you can use them alongside other types of HRT. However, they do not treat other menopause symptoms such as hot flushes.\n\n【24】Your doctor can help you decide on the type of HRT that's best for you.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about types of HRT</u>\n\n【25】How does it compare with alternatives to HRT?\n\n【26】Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) such as oestrogen tablets, patches, gel and spray is usually the most effective treatment for menopause symptoms.\n\n【27】If you cannot take HRT, or prefer not to take it, your doctor may be able to recommend other medicines or lifestyle changes to help with your symptoms.\n\n【28】Medicines such as pregabalin, clonidine and some antidepressants (such as fluoxetine or sertraline) are sometimes used as an alternative to HRT to help with symptoms such as mood swings.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about alternatives to HRT</u>\n\n【29】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【30】If you stop taking oestrogen your menopause symptoms might come back.\n\n【31】If you're taking it for osteoporosis there is a chance that your bones will get weaker and you may be more likely to have fractures in the future.\n\n【32】Talk to your doctor if you're thinking of stopping. They will help you decide what's best for you. They may suggest that you reduce your dose gradually, to help stop symptoms coming back.\n\n【33】If you're having problems with side effects, your doctor might suggest changing your dose, or switching to another type of HRT.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about when to take HRT and stopping taking it</u>\n\n【34】Can I switch to another brand or type of HRT?\n\n【35】Some brands of oestrogen are very similar and it's possible to switch between them without any problems.\n\n【36】Speak to a doctor or pharmacist if the brand or type of HRT you've been using is not available because of supply shortages, or is not helping your symptoms, or if you have problems with side effects. They can advise about switching to a different type.\n\n【37】Can I get HRT for free?\n\n【38】You'll need to pay for your hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions unless you're eligible for free prescriptions.\n\n【39】However, you can reduce the cost by getting an HRT pre-payment certificate (PPC). This means you can pay a small fee that will cover all your HRT prescriptions for a year.\n\n【40】Find out how to save money with a prescription prepayment certificate.\n\n【41】Will I gain or lose weight?\n\n【42】There is no good evidence that taking oestrogen makes you put on weight.\n\n【43】However, it's common to gain weight around the time of the menopause. Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly will help you keep to a healthy weight.\n\n【44】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【45】Oestrogen is not a contraceptive.\n\n【46】It's still possible to get pregnant while taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), so you'll need to use contraception until 2 years after your last period if you're under 50 years old, or for 1 year if you're over 50 years old.\n\n【47】You'll usually need to use a non-hormonal method of contraception, such as condoms or a diaphragm, or other options which you can speak to your doctor about.\n\n【48】If you need to take progestogen with your oestrogen, it's possible to use the intrauterine system (IUS), also known as the hormonal coil or Mirena coil. This works as a contraceptive as well as giving you the progestogen that you need to protect your womb.\n\n【49】Talk to your doctor or a pharmacist if you have any questions about contraception and HRT.\n\n【50】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【51】Yes, taking oestrogen does not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【52】Can I drink alcohol while taking oestrogen tablets, patches, gel or spray?\n\n【53】You can drink alcohol while taking oestrogen but it may be helpful to cut down on alcohol during the menopause to reduce symptoms of flushing, and improve your sleep.\n\n【54】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【55】You can eat and drink normally while taking oestrogen.\n\n【56】Try to have a healthy, balanced diet, as this can help with menopause symptoms and keep you well.\n\n【57】Cutting down on alcohol and caffeine may help reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep.\n\n【58】Can lifestyle changes help menopause symptoms?\n\n【59】The following lifestyle changes can sometimes help with menopause symptoms:\n\n【60】*   Regular exercise. This helps with bone health and can reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep. It may also help improve your general mood, reduce stress and help you keep to a healthy weight.\n*   Cut down on caffeine and alcohol. This may help reduce hot flushes and improve your sleep.\n*   Quit smoking. This can help reduce hot flushes and reduce your risk of developing other health problems such as cancer, heart disease and stroke.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about lifestyle changes for menopause symptoms</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Oestrogen tablets, patches, gel and spray\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】*   About oestrogen tablets, patches, gel and spray\n*   Who can and cannot take or use it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking or using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 5 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 5 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It takes a few days for it to start working and can take several weeks for it to reach its full effect.\n\n【8】If you bought the spray from a pharmacy or shop, check the leaflet that comes with it. This will tell you when to speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you feel no better after using the spray. This is usually after 7 to 14 days.\n\n【9】If you use the spray for hay fever, it's best to start using it at least a couple of weeks before the hay fever season starts. Many people notice they get symptoms around the same time each year.\n\n【10】If you use the spray for nasal polyps, it can take 1 to 2 months for your symptoms to improve.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Budesonide nasal spray is unlikely to have any lasting harmful effects if you follow the instructions that come with it, or use it as your doctor recommends.\n\n【13】However, children and teenagers need to have their height and weight monitored carefully if they're using budesonide nasal spray for a long time. This is to make sure the steroid is not affecting their growth.\n\n【14】The nasal spray delivers a small amount of steroid medicine exactly where you need it. This limits the amount of steroid reaching the rest of your body. It also keeps the risk of side effects as low as possible.\n\n【15】Do I need a steroid card?\n\n【16】You may need a steroid card if you're regularly using budesonide nasal spray with other steroids, such as a steroid inhaler. This can cause your adrenal glands to make less of the hormones your body needs, such as cortisol (known as the stress hormone). This is known as adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【17】Your doctor or pharmacist will assess your risk of adrenal insufficiency based on the type and dose of steroids you're taking and may recommend that you carry a steroid emergency card (red card). This card is the size of a credit card and fits in your wallet or purse.\n\n【18】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【19】Budesonide does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【20】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【21】For most people, using budesonide nasal spray will not affect their ability to drive a car or cycle.\n\n【22】Can I drink alcohol while using budesonide nasal spray?\n\n【23】Yes, you can drink alcohol if you're using budesonide nasal spray.\n删除11：<u>More in Budesonide nasal spray\n------------------------------\n\n【24】*   About budesonide nasal spray\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Hydronephrosis is a condition where one or both kidneys become stretched and swollen as the result of a build-up of urine inside them.**\n\n【3】It can affect people of any age and is sometimes spotted in unborn babies during routine pregnancy ultrasound scans. This is known as antenatal hydronephrosis.\n\n【4】Hydronephrosis does not generally cause any long-term problems if it's diagnosed and treated promptly.\n\n【5】Babies with the condition may not require any treatment at all.\n\n【6】The condition can increase your chances of getting urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\n【7】In severe cases that are left untreated, the kidneys may become scarred, which could lead to loss of kidney function (kidney failure).\n\n【8】Antenatal hydronephrosis in babies\n----------------------------------\n\n【9】Antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) is increasingly being found in unborn babies during routine ultrasound scans.\n\n【10】It's estimated to show up on at least 1 in every 100 pregnancies.\n\n【11】As a parent, it can be worrying to learn your baby has a problem with their kidneys. But most cases of hydronephrosis in babies are not serious and should not affect the outcome of your pregnancy. Sometimes, babies born with ANH may need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent kidney infections, but most babies born with ANH will have no lasting problems.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about diagnosing antenatal hydronephrosis and treating antenatal hydronephrosis.</u>\n\n【12】Signs and symptoms\n------------------\n\n【13】Antenatal hydronephrosis does not usually cause any symptoms.

It's thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of urine your baby produces in the later stages of pregnancy.\n\n【23】In more severe cases, it may be caused by a blockage in the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, or a blockage in the flow of urine out of the bladder.\n\n【24】### Adult hydronephrosis\n\n【25】In adults, hydronephrosis is commonly caused by:\n\n【26】*   kidney stones\n*   pregnancy (maternal hydronephrosis)\n*   an enlarged prostate gland in men\n*   narrowing of the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder) caused by injury, infection or surgery\n*   some types of cancer, including kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer or ovarian cancer\n\n【27】Find out about the causes of hydronephrosis.\n\n【28】Treating hydronephrosis\n-----------------------\n\n【29】If you have hydronephrosis, your treatment will depend on what's causing the condition and how severe it is. \n\n【30】Pregnant women and babies with the condition may not require any treatment.\n\n【31】In adults, the first stage of treatment is often to drain the urine out of your kidneys by inserting a tube called a catheter into your bladder or kidneys.\n\n【32】This will help relieve the pressure on your kidneys.\n\n【33】Once the pressure has been relieved, the cause of the build-up of urine may need to be treated.\n\n【34】The treatments used will depend on why the condition developed.\n\n【35】For example:\n\n【36】*   kidney stones may be removed during an operation or broken up using sound waves\n*   an enlarged prostate can be treated with medication or surgery to remove some of the prostate\n*   blockages in the ureters can be treated using surgery to insert a small tube called a stent\n*   cancer may be treated using a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous tissue\n\n【37】Find out about how hydronephrosis is treated.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 December 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

How to cope with side effects of co-codaprin\n8.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n9.  Cautions with other medicines\n10.  Common questions about co-codaprin\n\n【3】1\\. About co-codaprin\n---------------------\n\n【4】Co-codaprin is a mixture of 2 different painkillers: aspirin and codeine.\n\n【5】It's used to treat aches and pains, including headaches, muscular pain, migraine and toothache. It can also be used to treat the symptoms of colds and flu.\n\n【6】Aspirin belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n【7】Codeine belongs to a group of medicines called opiates. It affects pain receptors in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body.\n\n【8】It's usually taken when everyday painkillers, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin alone, have not worked.\n\n【9】This medicine comes as tablets. It's available on prescription. Co-codaprin is available without a prescription, but only from a pharmacy.\n\n【10】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【11】*   Co-codaprin is another name for aspirin and codeine.\n*   If you buy co-codaprin from a pharmacy and your pain is not better after 3 days, it's important to ask your doctor for advice about ongoing pain relief.\n*   It's possible to become addicted to the codeine in this medicine if you take it for too long. Only take it when you need it for pain relief.\n*   It's best to take co-codaprin with or just after eating food. You'll be less likely to get mild indigestion or stomach pain. These are common side effects of co-codaprin.\n*   Never give co-codaprin to children under 16 years old, unless their doctor prescribes it. This is because it contains aspirin, which can cause serious side effects in children.\n\n【12】3\\. Who can and cannot take co-codaprin\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】### Who can take co-codaprin\n\n【14】Most people aged 16 years old and over can safely take co-codaprin. But co-codaprin is not suitable for some people. \n\n【15】There's a possible link between the aspirin in co-codaprin and Reye's syndrome in children. Reye's syndrome is a very rare condition that can cause serious liver and brain damage.\n\n【16】Do not give co-codaprin to anyone aged 18 years or under who has had their tonsils or adenoids taken out to treat obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n【17】#### Important: Children under 16 years\n\n【18】Never give co-codaprin to children younger than 16 years old, unless their doctor prescribes it.\n\n【19】### Who may not be able to take co-codaprin\n\n【20】To make sure co-codaprin is safe for you, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:\n\n【21】*   have ever had an allergy to aspirin or codeine (or similar painkillers such as ibuprofen and morphine)\n*   have surgery planned – you'll need to stop taking aspirin several days before you have surgery (including dental surgery)\n*   have ever had a blood clotting problem\n*   have ever had a stomach ulcer\n*   have indigestion\n*   have recently had a stroke, although it depends on the kind of stroke you have had (your doctor may recommend that you take low-dose aspirin to prevent another one)\n*   have low blood pressure (hypotension) or high blood pressure (hypertension)\n*   have asthma or lung disease\n*   have liver or kidney problems\n*   have gout – it can get worse for some people who take aspirin\n*   get heavy periods – they can get heavier with aspirin\n*   have a head injury or a condition that causes seizures or fits\n*   have adrenal gland problems or an underactive thyroid gland\n*   have an addiction to alcohol or drugs\n*   have gallstones\n*   have an enlarged prostate\n*   have myasthenia gravis (a rare condition that causes muscle weakness)\n*   have symptoms of ulcerative colitis (a bowel condition)\n*   have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\n*   are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or want to breastfeed\n\n【22】4\\. How and when to take co-codaprin\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】Follow the instructions that come with your medicine. This is particularly important because the codeine in co-codaprin can be addictive.\n\n【24】### Dosage and strength\n\n【25】The strength of co-codaprin appears as 2 numbers on the packet, for example, as 8/400. This means it contains 8mg of codeine and 400mg of aspirin.\n\n【26】The usual dose for adults (over the age of 18) is 1 or 2 co-codaprin tablets, up to 4 times in 24 hours.\n\n【27】Always leave at least 4 hours between doses.\n\n【28】The maximum dose is 8 tablets in 24 hours.\n\n【29】The usual dose for teenagers aged 16 to 18 years old is the same. They should not have co-codaprin, however, if they have had their tonsils or adenoids taken out to treat obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n【30】#### Important\n\n【31】Do not take more than 8 co-codaprin tablets in 24 hours.\n\n【32】### How to take it\n\n【33】Swallow co-codaprin tablets whole with a drink of water. It's best to take them with or just after food.\n\n【34】### How long to take it for\n\n【35】If you have bought co-codaprin from a pharmacy, do not use it for more than 3 days. If you still have pain, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. It's important to ask them for advice about ongoing pain relief.\n\n【36】If your doctor has prescribed co-codaprin for you, follow their advice carefully.\n\n【37】### If you take too much\n\n【38】If you take 1 or 2 extra tablets of co-codaprin on a single occasion, it's unlikely to be harmful.\n\n【39】If this happens, wait at least 24 hours before you take any more. Taking more than this can be dangerous.\n\n【40】If you have taken too much co-codaprin by mistake, you may feel very sleepy, sick or dizzy. You may also find it difficult to breathe.\n\n【41】In serious cases, you can become unconscious and may need emergency treatment in hospital.\n\n【42】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【43】*   you take more than your usual dose of co-codaprin and feel sleepy, sick or dizzy\n\n【44】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【45】If you need to go to A&E do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\n【46】Take the co-codaprin packet, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine with you.\n\n【47】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:\n\n【48】*   you take too much co-codaprin and have difficulty breathing\n\n【49】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【50】5\\. Taking co-codaprin with other painkillers\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【51】It's safe to take co-codaprin with paracetamol.\n\n【52】Do not take co-codaprin with any other medicines that contain codeine.\n\n【53】Also do not take it with any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen. If you take NSAIDs together, it may increase the chance of you getting side effects like stomach ache or bleeding.\n\n【54】These painkillers are often included in medicines you can buy from pharmacies. For example, Nurofen or Nurofen Plus, or cough and cold remedies such as Nurofen Cold & Flu or Beechams Powders.\n\n【55】### Important\n\n【56】Before taking any other medicines, check the label to see if they contain codeine, aspirin, ibuprofen or other NSAIDs.\n\n【57】6\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【58】Like all medicines, co-codaprin can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Many people have no side effects or only minor ones.\n\n【59】### Common side effects\n\n【60】These side effects happen in more than 1 in 100 people. Tell your doctor if these side effects bother you or do not go away:\n\n【61】*   mild indigestion\n*   feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n*   constipation\n*   feeling sleepy\n*   bleeding more easily than normal – because aspirin thins your blood, it can sometimes make you bleed more easily (for example, you may get nosebleeds, bruise more easily and, if you cut yourself, the bleeding may take longer than normal to stop)\n*   dizziness and vertigo (a sensation of spinning)\n*   headaches\n\n【62】### Serious side effects\n\n【63】Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【64】Contact a doctor straight away if you have:\n\n【65】*   a change in your normal heart rate (slower or faster) and you feel dizzy or very tired – these can be signs of a heart problem\n*   a fit or seizure\n*   difficulty breathing or short, shallow breathing\n*   stiffness in your muscles\n*   feeling faint when you stand up or sit quickly – this can be a sign of low blood pressure\n*   coughing up blood or blood in your pee, poo or vomit\n*   dark pee or the whites of your eyes turn yellow – this can be a sign of liver problems\n*   painful joints in your hands and feet – this can be a sign of high levels of uric acid in the blood\n*   swollen hands or feet – this can be a sign of a build-up of fluid in your body\n\n【66】#### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【67】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to co-codaprin.\n\n【68】##### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【69】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【70】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【71】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【72】Long-term side effects\n----------------------\n\n【73】If you've bought co-codaprin from a pharmacy, do not use it for more than 3 days. If your pain has not gone away, talk to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【74】If you need to take co-codaprin for a long time, your body can become tolerant to the codeine in it. That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【75】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【76】It's possible to become addicted to the codeine in co-codaprin. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only taking the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【77】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop taking co-codaprin.\n\n【78】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【79】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【80】These are not all the side effects of co-codaprin. For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicine packet.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n\n【81】You can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\n【82】Visit Yellow Card for further information.</u>\n\n【83】7\\. How to cope with side effects of co-codaprin\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【84】**What to do about:**\n\n【85】*   **mild indigestion** – take your co-codaprin with food or just after a meal. If the indigestion still does not go away, it could be a sign that the co-codaprin has caused a stomach ulcer. Talk to your doctor, as they may prescribe something to protect your stomach or switch you to a different medicine.\n*   **feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)** – take co-codaprin with or just after a meal or snack. Feelings of sickness should normally wear off after a few days. Talk to your doctor about taking an anti-sickness medicine if it carries on for longer.\n*   **constipation** – get more fibre into your diet, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals.

Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【97】Some medicines can affect the way co-codaprin works. And co-codaprin can affect the way some medicines work.\n\n【98】Tell your doctor if you're taking any other medicines, especially:\n\n【99】*   medicines that help to prevent blood clots such as warfarin and clopidogrel\n*   medicines for pain and swelling (inflammation), such as ibuprofen and naproxen\n*   sleeping pills, antidepressants or lithium (a medicine for mental health problems)\n*   medicines to stop you feeling or being sick, such as domperidone or metoclopramide\n*   medicines to treat infection, particularly rifampicin and ciprofloxacin\n*   epilepsy medicines\n*   medicines to prevent organ rejection after transplant, such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus\n*   steroids, such as prednisolone\n*   medicines to treat high blood pressure, such as ramipril\n*   diuretics (medicines to make you pee more), such as bendroflumethiazide and furosemide\n*   digoxin, a medicine for heart problems\n*   acetazolamide, for an eye problem called glaucoma\n*   methotrexate, a medicine used to calm your immune system and treat some types of cancer\n*   diabetes medicines, such as gliclazide\n*   antihistamines that make you feel drowsy, like chlorphenamine\n\n【100】### Mixing co-codaprin with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【101】It's not possible to say that herbal remedies or supplements are safe to take with co-codaprin.\n\n【102】They are not tested in the same way as pharmacy and prescription medicines. They're generally not tested for the effect they have on other medicines.\n\n【103】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【104】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【105】10\\. Common questions about co-codaprin\n---------------------------------------\n\n【106】How does co-codaprin work?\n\n【107】Co-codaprin contains aspirin and codeine. These 2 painkillers work in different ways to relieve pain.\n\n【108】Aspirin belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n【109】If you have been hurt or have an infection, your body makes hormones called prostaglandins. The prostaglandins cause swelling and sometimes a high temperature, and they send pain signals to the brain.\n\n【110】This is all part of your body's natural response to injury. The swelling and high temperature can help your body heal.\n\n【111】Aspirin stops your body making prostaglandins, and this reduces the pain, swelling and high temperature.\n\n【112】Codeine belongs to a group of medicines called opiates. It affects pain receptors in the central nervous system and the brain to block pain signals to the rest of the body.\n\n【113】When codeine blocks the pain receptors, there are other unwanted effects (for example, slow and shallow breathing). It can also slow down digestion, which is why codeine can cause constipation.\n\n【114】When will I feel better?\n\n【115】Co-codaprin takes up to 1 hour to work. It keeps on working for about 4 hours.\n\n【116】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【117】If you've bought co-codaprin from a pharmacy, do not use it for more than 3 days. If your pain has not gone away, talk to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【118】If you need to take co-codaprin for a long time, your body can become tolerant to the codeine in it. That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【119】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【120】It's possible to become addicted to the codeine in co-codaprin. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only taking the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【121】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop taking co-codaprin.\n\n【122】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【123】Can I become addicted to co-codaprin?\n\n【124】If you take co-codaprin regularly for a long time, you can become addicted to the codeine in it.\n\n【125】You're unlikely to become addicted if you follow your doctor's advice carefully about how long to take it for.\n\n【126】If you've bought co-codaprin at a pharmacy, follow the instructions that come with the medicine and only take it for up to 3 days at a time. If your pain is not better after 3 days, it's important to ask your doctor for advice about further pain relief.\n\n【127】How will I know if I'm addicted?\n\n【128】If you're addicted to the codeine in co-codaprin, you may find it difficult to stop taking it or feel you need to take it more often than necessary.\n\n【129】If you stop taking codeine suddenly, you may get withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【130】These can include:\n\n【131】*   feeling agitated or anxious\n*   panic attacks\n*   feeling your heartbeat (palpitations)\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   shaking\n*   sweating\n*   body aches\n*   feeling restless\n\n【132】Talk to your doctor if you:\n\n【133】*   are worried about addiction\n*   need help with addiction\n*   want to stop taking codeine\n\n【134】Can I take co-codaprin for a long time?\n\n【135】It's not usually recommended to take co-codaprin that you have bought from a pharmacy for longer than 3 days.\n\n【136】It's best to take the lowest dose that works for you for the shortest possible time.\n\n【137】That way there's less chance that you'll get unwanted side effects like stomach ache.\n\n【138】If you need to take co-codaprin for longer than 3 days, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【139】Is co-codaprin better than paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief?\n\n【140】Not necessarily. Paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin and codeine are all effective painkillers.\n\n【141】Some painkillers work better than others for certain pains. For example, the best painkiller to ease your headache may not be the best one for your backache.\n\n【142】Try taking one of these painkillers before trying co-codaprin to see if it helps your pain:\n\n【143】*   Paracetamol can relieve most types of pain. It's typically used for mild or moderate pain. It may be better than aspirin for headaches, toothache, sprains, stomach ache, and nerve pain like sciatica.\n*   Ibuprofen works in a similar way to aspirin. It can be used for back pain, strains and sprains, as well as pain from arthritis. It's also good for toothache and period pain.\n*   Aspirin may be better than paracetamol for some pains, such as period pain or migraines. But if you have heavy periods, aspirin can make them heavier. Some people find aspirin better than paracetamol for back pain.\n*   Codeine should only be used if aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol alone have not been effective. This is because it's used to treat moderate to severe pain – for example, after an operation or injury.\n\n【144】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【145】Do not drive a car or ride a bike if co-codaprin makes you sleepy during the daytime, gives you blurred vision or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【146】This may be more likely when you first start taking co-codaprin, but could happen at any time – for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【147】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n\n【148】Even if your ability to drive is not affected, the police have the right to request a saliva sample to check how much co-codaprin is in your body.\n删除7：<u>GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【149】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking co-codaprin.\n\n【150】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【151】Drinking alcohol while you're taking co-codaprin can irritate your stomach and make you feel more sleepy.\n\n【152】It's best to stop drinking alcohol during the first few days of treatment until you see how the co-codaprin affects you.\n\n【153】If you feel sleepy with co-codaprin, stop drinking alcohol while you're taking it.\n\n【154】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【155】Apart from limiting alcohol, you can eat and drink normally while taking co-codaprin.\n\n【156】Can co-codaprin make you put on weight?\n\n【157】There's no evidence that taking co-codaprin will make you put on weight or lose it.\n\n【158】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【159】Co-codaprin does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【160】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【161】If you're taking co-codaprin for a short time and at normal doses, there's no clear evidence that it can reduce fertility.\n\n【162】But if you have been taking it for a long time and you're concerned about your fertility, or you're trying to get pregnant, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor.\n\n【163】Will recreational drugs affect it?\n\n【164】If you take recreational drugs, such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, while you're taking co-codaprin, you're more likely to get the serious side effects of the codeine in co-codaprin.\n\n【165】These include breathing difficulties, heart problems, fits or seizures, and even going into a coma.\n\n【166】Some recreational drugs, such as cannabis, make you more likely to have side effects from the codeine. These include sleepiness and dizziness.\n\n【167】Taking heroin while you're on prescribed co-codaprin is especially dangerous. You're more likely to get all the side effects of the codeine in co-codaprin, including addiction.\n\n【168】Speak to your doctor if you think you might take recreational drugs while taking co-codaprin.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【169】*   Common cold\n*   Flu\n*   Headaches\n*   Migraine\n*   Toothache\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【170】*   HealthUnlocked: co-codaprin forum\n*   Opioid medicines and the risk of addiction: information for patients on GOV.UK\n*   Healthtalk: videos of real stories about pain\n*   Which painkiller?\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 November 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 November 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Cyclizine works by blocking these signals and reducing feelings of sickness.\n\n【3】How long does it take to work?\n\n【4】Cyclizine starts to work after 30 minutes. You should feel better after 1 to 2 hours.\n\n【5】It should work for about 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】Cyclizine tablets are unlikely to do you any harm if you take them for a long time. However, there have been a few reports of people having problems stopping cyclizine injections after long-term use. Because of this, it's best to only take cyclizine for as long as you need it to control your symptoms.\n\n【8】How does cyclizine compare to other anti-sickness medicines?\n\n【9】Cyclizine is a type of drowsy (sedating) antihistamine, as it can make you feel sleepy.\n\n【10】There are other drowsy antihistamines that can help with feeling or being sick, such as promethazine and cinnarizine. Both cyclizine and cinnarizine are less likely to make you feel sleepy than promethazine.\n\n【11】There's not enough information available to say whether one is better than another for helping with sickness.\n\n【12】There are also other medicines that can help with sickness, such as metoclopramide, ondansetron and domperidone.\n\n【13】You may need to try a few different medicines to find out what works best for you. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you're unsure.\n\n【14】Is cyclizine addictive?\n\n【15】It's unlikely that you'll get addicted to cyclizine tablets prescribed to help relieve sickness or feeling dizzy. However, to be on the safe side it's best to only take cyclizine for as long as you need to.\n\n【16】Are there other ways to treat morning sickness?\n\n【17】Most cases of feeling and being sick in pregnancy pass after 16 to 20 weeks.\n\n【18】If your morning sickness is not too bad, there are some lifestyle changes you can make to help.\n\n【19】Although cyclizine has not been officially approved for treating morning sickness, it's considered to be a useful and safe medicine to use in pregnancy.\n\n【20】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【21】Cyclizine does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【22】But if cyclizine is not working for you and you're being sick, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【23】Check the pill packet to find out what to do or find out what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.\n\n【24】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【25】Do not drive a car, ride a bike or use heavy machinery or tools if cyclizine makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\n【26】This may be more likely when you first start taking cyclizine, but could happen at any time, for example, when starting another medicine.\n\n【27】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected.

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**If you have early symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), your GP will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a physical examination.**\n\n【3】They may want to know:\n\n【4】*   when your symptoms started\n*   how severe your symptoms are\n*   if anyone in your family has CMT\n\n【5】During a physical examination, your GP will look for evidence of the condition, such as muscle weakness, poor or absent reflexes, and foot deformities, such as high arches or flat feet.\n\n【6】Further tests\n-------------\n\n【7】If CMT is suspected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the nervous system (a neurologist) for further testing.\n\n【8】Here are some tests you may have.\n\n【9】### Nerve conduction test\n\n【10】A nerve conduction test measures the strength and speed of signals transmitted through your peripheral nerves, the network of nerves that run from the brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of the body, such as the limbs and organs.\n\n【11】Small metal discs called electrodes are placed on your skin, which release a small electric shock that stimulates the nerves.\n\n【12】The speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured. An unusually slow or weak signal could indicate CMT.\n\n【13】### Electromyography (EMG)\n\n【14】Electromyography (EMG) uses a small needle-shaped electrode placed in your skin to measure the electrical activity of your muscles.\n\n【15】Some types of CMT cause a distinctive change in the pattern of electrical activity that can be detected by an EMG.\n\n【16】### Genetic testing\n\n【17】Genetic testing involves taking a blood sample and testing it for defective genes known to cause CMT.\n\n【18】So far, many of these genes have been found, but there may be more not yet identified.\n\n【19】Most people with CMT should be able to have their diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing and find out exactly which type of CMT they have.\n\n【20】For others, genetic testing may prove inconclusive because an unidentified gene may be involved.\n\n【21】### Nerve biopsy\n\n【22】In a small number of cases where other tests have been inconclusive, a test called a nerve biopsy may be carried out.\n\n【23】This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of a peripheral nerve is removed from your leg for testing.\n\n【24】CMT can cause physical changes to the shape of the nerve, which can be seen under a microscope.\n\n【25】The biopsy is carried out under a local anaesthetic, so you'll be awake but will not feel any pain.\n\n【26】Being diagnosed with CMT\n------------------------\n\n【27】Everyone reacts differently when told they have CMT.\n\n【28】You may experience feelings of shock, denial, confusion or fear. Some people are relieved that there's finally an explanation for their symptoms.\n\n【29】If you have recently been diagnosed with CMT, you may find it useful to:\n\n【30】*   take all the time you need – do not rush into making important decisions about your health\n*   find the support you need – talk to your family and friends when you feel ready; you may also find it helpful to contact other people with CMT through the charity Charcot-Marie-Tooth UK\n*   find out what you can about CMT – both from your healthcare team and reliable online resources, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth UK\n*   get involved in your care – work closely with your healthcare team to come up with a treatment plan that best suits you\n\n【31】Tests before and during pregnancy\n---------------------------------\n\n【32】Couples with a family history of CMT who are thinking of having a baby can be referred to a genetics specialist for advice.\n\n【33】A genetic counsellor can help you work through the decision-making process and explain possible tests that can be carried out and any alternatives you may want to consider, such as adoption.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about genetic testing and counselling</u>\n\n【34】The main tests that can be carried out during pregnancy to check if a baby will develop certain types of CMT are:\n\n【35】*   chorionic villus sampling (CVS) – where a small sample of placenta is removed from the womb and tested for known CMT genes, usually during weeks 11 to 14 of pregnancy\n*   amniocentesis – where a sample of amniotic fluid is taken for testing, usually during weeks 15 to 20 of pregnancy\n\n【36】If these tests show that your child is likely to have CMT, you can discuss with your genetic counsellor whether you want to continue the pregnancy or have a termination (abortion).\n\n【37】It's important to be aware that the results of these tests will not indicate how serious your child's CMT will be.\n\n【38】This is because the symptoms and progression of the condition can vary widely, even among family members with the same type of CMT.\n\n【39】It's also important to bear in mind that both tests can slightly increase your chances of having a miscarriage.\n\n【40】### Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis\n\n【41】For some couples at risk of having a child with CMT, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) may be an option.\n\n【42】PGD involves using in vitro fertilisation (IVF), where eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries before being fertilised with sperm in a laboratory.\n\n【43】After a few days, the resulting embryos can be tested for certain types of CMT and a maximum of 2 unaffected embryos transferred into the womb.\n\n【44】Funding for PGD is decided on an individual basis.\n\n【45】For example, you may be considered ineligible for PGD on the NHS if you already have unaffected children or if the chances of having a successful pregnancy are thought to be low.\n\n【46】In these cases, you can choose to fund PGD yourself, although each attempt is likely to cost at least £8,000 (including medication costs).\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

What happens\n3.  Recovery\n4.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**There are 2 types of cystoscopy: a flexible cystoscopy and a rigid cystoscopy.**\n\n【3】Both involve passing a thin viewing tube called a cystoscope along the urethra (the tube that carries pee out of the body) and into the bladder, but they're done in slightly different ways.\n\n【4】Anyone can have either type of cystoscopy. Ask your doctor or nurse which type you're going to have if you're not sure.\n\n【5】Flexible cystoscopy\n-------------------\n\n【6】A flexible cystoscopy is where a thin (about the width of a pencil) and bendy cystoscope is used. You stay awake while it's carried out.\n\n【7】### Preparation\n\n【8】You'll be sent instructions to follow before your appointment. This will include advice about eating, drinking, and what to do about any medicines you're taking.\n\n【9】You can usually eat and drink as normal before a flexible cystoscopy.\n\n【10】Before the procedure starts, you'll be asked to undress from the waist down and put on a hospital gown.\n\n【11】You may be asked to pee into a container so it can be checked for an infection. The procedure may be delayed if a urine infection is found.\n\n【12】### The procedure\n\n【13】For a flexible cystoscopy:\n\n【14】*   you lie down flat on a special couch\n*   your genitals are cleaned with an antiseptic and a sheet is placed over the surrounding area\n*   local anaesthetic gel is applied to your urethra to numb it and help the cystoscope move along it more easily\n*   the cystoscope is inserted into your urethra and gently moved down towards your bladder\n*   water may be pumped into your bladder so your doctor or nurse can see inside it more clearly – you may be able to see images sent to a monitor by a camera in the cystoscope\n\n【15】The cystoscope is usually removed after a few minutes. A nurse will stay with you throughout to explain what's happening.\n\n【16】### Does it hurt?\n\n【17】People often worry that a cystoscopy will be painful, but it does not usually hurt. Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel any pain during it.\n\n【18】It can be a bit uncomfortable and you may feel like you need to pee during the procedure, but this will only last a few minutes.\n\n【19】### Afterwards\n\n【20】After the cystoscope is removed, you may need to go straight to the toilet to empty your bladder before changing back into your clothes.\n\n【21】Your doctor or nurse may be able discuss the results of the cystoscopy shortly afterwards. But if a small tissue sample was removed for testing (biopsy), you may not get the results for 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n【22】You can usually go home shortly after a flexible cystoscopy.\n\n【23】Read about recovering from a cystoscopy for more information.\n\n【24】Rigid cystoscopy\n----------------\n\n【25】A rigid cystoscopy is where a cystoscope that does not bend is used. You're either put to sleep for the procedure or the lower half of your body is numbed while it's carried out.\n\n【26】### Preparation\n\n【27】You'll be sent instructions to follow before your appointment. This will include advice about eating, drinking, and what to do about any medicines you're taking.\n\n【28】You'll usually need to stop eating and drinking for a few hours before a rigid cystoscopy. You'll also need to arrange for someone to give you a lift home, as you will not be able to drive for 24 hours.\n\n【29】You'll be asked to change into a hospital gown for the procedure.\n\n【30】You may be asked to pee into a container so it can be checked for an infection. The procedure may be delayed if a urine infection is found.\n\n【31】### The procedure\n\n【32】For a rigid cystoscopy:\n\n【33】*   you're given an injection of general anaesthetic (which makes you fall asleep) into your hand, or a spinal anaesthetic (which numbs the lower half of your body) into your lower back\n*   you will be lying on a special couch with your legs in supports\n*   your genitals are cleaned with an antiseptic and a sheet is placed over the surrounding area\n*   the cystoscope is inserted into your urethra and gently moved along towards your bladder\n*   water may be pumped into your bladder so your doctor or nurse can see inside it more clearly\n\n【34】The procedure can last up to 30 minutes.\n\n【35】### Does it hurt?\n\n【36】You may have a short, sharp pain as the injection of anaesthetic is given, but you will not have any pain or discomfort during the procedure because you'll be asleep or your lower half will be numbed.\n\n【37】### Afterwards\n\n【38】When the procedure is finished, you'll be taken to a room or ward to recover from the anaesthetic.\n\n【39】Sometimes you may have a thin tube called a catheter placed into your bladder to help you pee. This will be taken out before you go home.\n\n【40】Your doctor or nurse may be able to discuss the results of the cystoscopy shortly afterwards. But if a small tissue sample was removed for testing (biopsy), you may not get the results for 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n【41】You can usually go home once the anaesthetic has worn off, the catheter has been removed (if you have one) and you're able to empty your bladder.\n\n【42】Read about recovering from a cystoscopy for more information.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Cystoscopy</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

In atrial fibrillation, the heart rate can often be considerably higher than 100 beats per minute, and each individual beat is erratic.\n删除7：<u>Heart rhythm charity Arrythmia Alliance has more information about knowing your pulse and how to check it.</u>\n\n【7】Checking and assessing your pulse can give you a good indication of whether you have atrial fibrillation, but a full medical investigation will be needed before a diagnosis can be made.\n\n【8】If atrial fibrillation is suspected, a GP may give you an electrocardiogram (ECG) and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) for further tests.\n\n【9】An electrophysiologist is a cardiologist who specialises in electrical disturbances of the heart.\n\n【10】They can carry out a procedure called catheter ablation to treat your atrial fibrillation.\n\n【11】Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n-----------------------\n\n【12】An ECG is a test that records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. It's usually carried out in a hospital or GP surgery, takes about 5 minutes, and is painless. \n\n【13】During an ECG, small stickers called electrodes are attached to your arms, legs and chest, and connected by wires to an ECG machine.\n\n【14】Every time your heart beats, it produces tiny electrical signals. An ECG machine traces these signals onto paper. \n\n【15】During an episode of atrial fibrillation, your heart rate will be irregular and over 100 beats per minute.\n\n【16】If you have an episode of atrial fibrillation during an ECG, your abnormal heart rate will be recorded. This will confirm the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and rule out other conditions.\n\n【17】But often it can be difficult to capture an episode of atrial fibrillation, so you may be asked to wear a small portable ECG recorder.\n\n【18】The recorder will either trace your heart rate continuously over 24 hours or when you switch it on at the start of an episode.\n删除7：<u>Read more about an electrocardiogram (ECG)</u>\n\n【19】Other tests\n-----------\n\n【20】If you have atrial fibrillation, a number of other tests may be carried out, including:\n\n【21】*   **an** **echocardiogram** – an ultrasound scan of the heart, which can help identify any other heart-related problems; it's used to assess the structure and function of the heart and valves\n*   **a chest** **X-ray** – which can help identify any lung problems that may be causing atrial fibrillation\n*   **blood tests** – which can highlight anaemia, problems with kidney function, or an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 May 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 May 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This is called a pulmonary embolism.\n\n【14】A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs treatment straight away.\n\n【15】Who is more likely to get DVT (deep vein thrombosis)\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】A DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is more likely to happen if you:\n\n【17】*   are over 60\n*   are overweight\n*   smoke\n*   have had DVT before\n*   take the contraceptive pill or HRT\n*   have cancer or heart failure\n*   have varicose veins\n\n【18】There are also some times when you have a higher chance of getting DVT.\n\n【19】These include if you:\n\n【20】*   are staying in or recently left hospital – especially if you cannot move around much (like after an operation)\n*   are confined to bed\n*   go on a long journey (more than 3 hours) by plane, car or train\n*   are pregnant or if you've had a baby in the previous 6 weeks\n*   are dehydrated\n\n【21】Sometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason.\n\n【22】How DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is diagnosed\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】If a doctor thinks you have DVT (deep vein thrombosis), you should be referred to hospital within 24 hours for an ultrasound scan. The scan shows whether blood is flowing normally through the vein.\n\n【24】You may also have an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you'll be injected with a dye to show where the blood clot is.\n\n【25】Treatment of DVT (deep vein thrombosis)\n---------------------------------------\n\n【26】You may have an injection of a blood-thinning medicine called heparin while you're waiting for an ultrasound scan to see if you have a DVT (deep vein thrombosis).\n\n【27】The main treatments include:\n\n【28】*   blood-thinning medicines, such as warfarin or rivaroxaban – you'll probably need to take these for at least 3 months\n*   surgery to remove blood clots or stop them forming\n\n【29】If you get a DVT when you're pregnant, you'll have injections for the rest of the pregnancy and until your baby is 6 weeks old.\n\n【30】Recovery from DVT (deep vein thrombosis)\n----------------------------------------\n\n【31】There are things you can do to help you recover from DVT (deep vein thrombosis).\n\n【32】After you leave hospital, you'll be encouraged to:\n\n【33】*   walk regularly\n*   keep your affected leg raised when you're sitting\n*   delay any flights or long journeys until at least 2 weeks after you start taking blood-thinning medicine\n\n【34】How to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【35】There are things you can do to lower your chance of getting DVT (deep vein thrombosis).\n\n【36】### Do\n\n【37】*   stay a healthy weight\n\n【38】*   stay active – taking regular walks can help\n\n【39】*   drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration – DVT is more likely if you're dehydrated\n\n【40】### Don’t\n\n【41】*   do not sit still for long periods of time – get up and move around every hour or so\n\n【42】*   do not cross your legs while you're sitting\n\n【43】*   do not smoke\n\n【44】*   do not drink lots of alcohol\n\n【45】### Going on a long journey\n\n【46】If you're travelling for 3 hours or more by plane, train or car, there are things you can do during the journey to lower your chances of getting DVT.\n\n【47】These include:\n\n【48】*   wearing loose clothing\n*   drinking plenty of water\n*   avoiding alcohol\n*   walking around when possible\n\n【49】### Going into hospital\n\n【50】If you go into hospital, your healthcare team should check if there's a higher chance you'll get DVT.\n\n【51】If they think you're more likely to get DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it, such as medicine or compression stockings (knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation), while you're in hospital.\n\n【52】You may continue treatment after you leave hospital because a blood clot can happen weeks later.\n\n【53】You can also help protect yourself against DVT while you're in hospital by:\n\n【54】*   staying active and walking around if you can\n*   moving your toes (up and down) and ankles (in circles) if you have to stay in bed – your healthcare team may give you some exercises to do\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 March 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Each tablet contains 600mg or 800mg of gabapentin.\n\n【4】If you're taking gabapentin as a liquid, 2ml is usually the same as taking a 100mg tablet or capsule. Always check the label.\n\n【5】### Dosage for epilepsy\n\n【6】The usual dose for:\n\n【7】*   adults and older children (aged 12 and over) is 900mg to 3,600mg a day, split into 3 doses\n*   younger children (aged 6 to 12) – varies depending on their weight\n\n【8】### Dosage for nerve pain\n\n【9】The usual dose to treat nerve pain in adults is 900mg to 3,600mg a day, split into 3 doses.\n\n【10】### Changes to your dose\n\n【11】To prevent side effects, your doctor will prescribe a low dose to start with and then increase it over a few days.

Do not chew them.\n\n【14】You can take gabapentin with or without food, but it's best to do the same each day.\n\n【15】Try to space your doses evenly through the day. For example, you could take it first thing in the morning, early afternoon and at bedtime.\n\n【16】If you or your child are taking a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to measure your dose. If you do not have a syringe or spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen spoon, as it will not measure the right amount.\n\n【17】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【18】If you have epilepsy, it's likely that once your condition is under control you'll still need to take gabapentin for many years.\n\n【19】If you have nerve pain, once your pain has gone you'll continue to take gabapentin for several months or longer to stop it coming back.\n\n【20】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【21】If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it's within 2 hours of the next dose, it's better to leave out the missed dose and take your next dose as normal.\n\n【22】Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【23】If you have epilepsy, it's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses may trigger a seizure.\n\n【24】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【25】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【26】Taking too much gabapentin can cause unpleasant side effects.\n\n【27】### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice or go to A&E now if:\n\n【28】you take more than your prescribed dose of gabapentin and:\n\n【29】*   you feel dizzy or sleepy\n*   you have double vision\n*   you start slurring your words\n*   you have diarrhoea\n*   you pass out (faint)\n\n【30】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【31】If you need to go to A&E, take the gabapentin packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\n\n【32】Stopping gabapentin\n-------------------\n\n【33】It's important not to stop taking gabapentin suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping gabapentin suddenly can cause serious problems.\n\n【34】If you have epilepsy, stopping gabapentin suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop.\n\n【35】If you're taking it for any reason and stop suddenly, you may have a severe withdrawal syndrome. This can have unpleasant symptoms, including:\n\n【36】*   anxiety\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   feeling sick\n*   pain\n*   sweating\n\n【37】It's possible to prevent withdrawal seizures and other symptoms by gradually reducing the dose of gabapentin.\n\n【38】Do not stop taking gabapentin without talking to your doctor – you'll need to reduce your dose gradually.\n删除11：<u>More in Gabapentin\n------------------\n\n【39】*   About gabapentin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking gabapentin with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 January 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This means that you take oestrogen every day, but you only take it with progestogen for 10 to 14 days of your cycle. You then repeat the cycle without a break.\n\n【5】You'll usually have withdrawal bleeding at the end of each course of progestogen.\n\n【6】The tablets and patches come in different strengths. Your doctor will prescribe the right dose for you, depending on your symptoms, your age and any other health conditions you have.\n\n【7】### Changes to your dose\n\n【8】You'll usually start on a low dose, and it may be increased later, depending on how well it works and whether you get any side effects.\n\n【9】If you're having side effects from taking HRT and think you may need to change your dose, speak to your doctor.\n\n【10】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【11】### How to take sequential combined HRT tablets\n\n【12】You take sequential combined HRT tablets every day without a break.\n\n【13】Try to take them at around the same time each day.\n\n【14】You can take them with or without food.\n\n【15】Each pack contains 2 or 3 different types of tablets, in different colours. It's important to follow the instructions on the pack and in the leaflet to make sure you take them on the correct days.\n\n【16】### How to use sequential combined HRT patches\n\n【17】You put sequential combined HRT patches on your skin, and change them once or twice a week, depending on which type of patch you have.\n\n【18】Each pack contains 2 different types of patch, containing either oestrogen only, or oestrogen and progestogen. It's important to follow the instructions on the pack and in the leaflet to make sure you use the patches on the correct days.\n\n【19】Put the patch on skin below your waist, such as your buttocks, hips or thighs. Do not put them near your breasts.\n\n【20】Put them on skin that is clean, dry and healthy.\n\n【21】Each time you change your patch, put the new one in a different place below your waist.\n\n【22】You can leave the patch on while you have a bath or shower. If it falls off, wait until your skin has cooled down, then put on another patch. If a patch falls off early for any other reason, put a new patch on straight away. Then continue to change the patches on the usual day.\n\n【23】How long to take or use it for\n------------------------------\n\n【24】It's common to take or use HRT for between 2 and 5 years to treat menopause symptoms, but sometimes you may need to take it for longer. How long you take it for depends on the benefits and risks to you. Ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【25】If you have premature menopause (where your periods stop before the age of 40) or early menopause (where your periods stop before the age of 45), you'll usually be advised to take HRT at least until you're 51 years old. This is the average age of menopause.\n\n【26】If you have a hysterectomy to remove your womb, you'll need to stop taking combined HRT. You may be able to take oestrogen-only HRT instead.\n\n【27】If you forget to take or use it\n-------------------------------\n\n【28】If you forget to take your sequential combined HRT tablet, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's less than 12 hours until your next dose. In this case, skip the forgotten dose and take the next dose at the usual time. You may have some vaginal bleeding or spotting.\n\n【29】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【30】If you're using patches and forget to change it, change it as soon as you remember and then change it again on the usual day. If it's almost time for the next patch, skip the missed one, and then change the patch on the usual day. You may have some vaginal bleeding or spotting.\n\n【31】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【32】Taking an extra dose of HRT is unlikely to harm you.\n\n【33】If you take too many tablets, you may feel sick or be sick.\n\n【34】If you're worried, or have any unusual symptoms after taking too much HRT, talk to a doctor or pharmacist for advice.\n\n【35】Stopping sequential combined HRT\n--------------------------------\n\n【36】Talk to your doctor if you're thinking of stopping taking sequential combined HRT. They may suggest you reduce your dose gradually, to help prevent your menopause symptoms coming back.\n\n【37】If you're having problems with side effects, your doctor might suggest changing your dose, or switching to another type of HRT.\n删除5：<u>Information:\n删除7：<u>Find out more about when to take HRT and stopping taking it</u></u>\n删除11：<u>More in Sequential combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablets and patches\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】*   About sequential combined HRT\n*   Who can and cannot take or use it\n*   How and when to take or use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking sequential combined HRT with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Steroid medicine is the main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).**\n\n【3】A type of steroid called prednisolone is usually prescribed.\n\n【4】Prednisolone\n------------\n\n【5】Prednisolone works by blocking the effects of certain chemicals that cause inflammation inside your body. It does not cure polymyalgia rheumatica, but it can help relieve the symptoms.\n\n【6】When used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisolone is taken as a tablet. Most people will be prescribed several tablets to take once a day.\n\n【7】To start with, you may be prescribed a moderate dose of prednisolone. The dose will usually be reduced gradually every 1 to 2 months if you are responding well to treatment and your symptoms are well controlled.\n\n【8】Although your symptoms should improve within a few days of starting treatment, you'll probably need to continue taking a low dose of prednisolone for about 2 years.\n\n【9】Polymyalgia rheumatica often improves on its own after this time. However, there's a chance it will return after treatment stops. This is known as a relapse.\n\n【10】Do not suddenly stop taking steroid medicine unless your doctor tells you it's safe to stop. Suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you very unwell.\n\n【11】### Side effects of prednisolone\n\n【12】About 1 in 20 people experience changes in their mental state when they take prednisolone.\n\n【13】You may feel depressed and suicidal, or have mood changes such as becoming aggressive, anxious, confused or irritable with people. Some people also have hallucinations, (seeing or hearing things that are not there).\n\n【14】Contact a GP as soon as possible if you experience changes to your mental state.\n\n【15】Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\n【16】⦁ you have thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life\n\n【17】Other side effects of prednisolone include:\n\n【18】*   increased appetite, which often leads to weight gain\n*   high blood pressure\n*   weakening of the bones (osteoporosis)\n*   stomach ulcers\n*   increased risk of infection, particularly with the varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles\n\n【19】Get immediate medical advice if you think you've been exposed to the varicella-zoster virus or if a member of your household develops chickenpox or shingles.\n\n【20】The risk of these side effects should improve as your dose of prednisolone is reduced.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the side effects of prednisolone tablets.</u>\n\n【21】Other medicines\n---------------\n\n【22】Sometimes other medicines may be combined with corticosteroids to help prevent relapses or allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced.\n\n【23】Some people are prescribed immunosuppressant medicine, such as methotrexate. It's used to suppress the immune system, the body's defence against infection and illness.\n\n【24】It may help people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or do not respond to normal steroid treatment.\n\n【25】Your doctor may recommend painkillers, such as paracetamol to help relieve your pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced.\n\n【26】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【27】You'll have regular follow-up appointments to check:\n\n【28】*   how well you're responding to treatment\n*   if your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted\n*   how well you're coping with any side effects\n\n【29】During these appointments, you may have blood tests to check the levels of inflammation inside your body.\n\n【30】Follow-up appointments are usually recommended every few weeks for the first 3 months, and then at least every 3 months during the first year.\n\n【31】Contact a GP if your symptoms return during any part of your treatment. Your dosage may need to be adjusted.\n\n【32】Steroid card\n------------\n\n【33】If you need to take steroids for longer than 3 weeks or you've been prescribed a high dose, your GP or pharmacist should arrange for you to be given a steroid card.\n\n【34】The card explains that you're regularly taking steroids and your dose should not be stopped suddenly.

You can:\n\n【5】*   talk through what might happen with family, friends or a health professional\n*   read through any information the hospital or doctor has given you – you might need someone to help you with this\n*   have a hospital passport ready – this will help you tell the hospital staff what reasonable adjustments you need\n*   make sure the hospital know what reasonable adjustments you will need before you go there\n删除6：<u>Information:\n\n【6】**Find out more:**\n\n【7】*   health guides: hospital passports on the Mencap.org.uk website\n*   watch a video about reasonable adjustments and how they can help you on YouTube\n\n【8】</u>\nLearning disability nurses\n--------------------------\n\n【9】If you're being referred to hospital by your doctor (GP), you can ask them to check whether the hospital has a learning disability nurse.\n\n【10】This is a specialist nurse who supports you if you have a learning disability while you are in hospital. They make sure you get good care.\n\n【11】You might be able to choose a different hospital if the one you are going to does not have a learning disability nurse.\n\n【12】It is important that the nurse meets you and your carer as soon as possible after you arrive at hospital or before you go into hospital.\n\n【13】This is so the nurse can find out as much as possible about you and understand the help you may need while in hospital.\n\n【14】Hospital passports\n------------------\n\n【15】A hospital passport is a document about you and your health needs.\n\n【16】It also has other useful information, such as your interests, likes, dislikes, how you communicate and any reasonable adjustments that you might need.\n\n【17】### Making reasonable adjustments for you\n\n【18】The NHS has to make it as easy for disabled people to use health services as it is for people who are not disabled. This is called making reasonable adjustments.\n\n【19】Reasonable adjustments tell people who will look after you in hospital the support you need. We are all different, so it is important you talk about this.\n\n【20】Some examples of reasonable adjustments are having:\n\n【21】*   a carer stay in hospital overnight with you\n*   information in easy read or plain English\n*   a longer appointment\n*   time to meet your learning disability nurse before you go into hospital\n*   more time and support to make sure you understand what you need to at the hospital\n\n【22】You or your carer can include in your hospital passport any help you need with eating or drinking, or how to tell if you are in pain.\n\n【23】Questions about your treatment\n------------------------------\n\n【24】You or your carer might want to ask some questions. You should be given time and support to understand what you are being told.\n\n【25】These questions may include:\n\n【26】*   what will happen when I get the treatment?\n*   how will the treatment improve my health?\n*   how good are the chances of success?\n*   are there any other treatments I could have and why should I have this one?\n*   what are the risks, if any, and how serious could they be?\n*   what happens if I decide not to have treatment?\n\n【27】You or your carer may have other questions you might want to ask. You can ask the doctor or nurse to explain something again if you need them to.\n\n【28】Deciding to have treatment or not (consent)\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【29】While you are in hospital, the doctors will ask you if are ok (give your consent) with having some treatments. This includes things like operations.\n\n【30】If you are over 16 years old, you can usually say you are ok to have treatment yourself. If you are under 16, or over 16 but not able to do this, your parent or carer can do this for you.\n\n【31】The doctor must explain what's involved in the treatment, why you need it, how it will help and if there might be any risks with having a treatment. This is so you have all the information and understand what you need to know about the treatment before you make a decision.\n\n【32】The doctor should explain everything in a way you find easy to understand, and you can ask as many questions as you like. You can also ask a carer or friend to help you.\n\n【33】### If you are not able to agree to a treatment yourself\n\n【34】If you are not able to understand what you are saying OK to, you can ask someone else to make decisions for you.\n\n【35】This is called having a lack of capacity to make decisions. You will still be able to make decisions about your life at other times.\n\n【36】Some people will have something called a deputy. Other people will have someone who has a Lasting Power of Attorney. If someone is a deputy or has a Lasting Power of Attorney, they can make important decisions for you if you are not able to.\n\n【37】### A deputy\n\n【38】A deputy is given this role by the Court of Protection. A deputy can be a family member, friend, carer or member of staff.\n\n【39】A deputy can make decisions on health and welfare, as well as making decisions about money. They can only make decisions when the court tells them they can. This usually happens when lots of decisions need making, not just one.\n\n【40】Deputies are not allowed to say you cannot have treatment that will keep you alive.\n\n【41】### Lasting Power of Attorney\n\n【42】Someone who has a Lasting Power of Attorney is someone who knows the person well. They will be able to make decisions for a person whenever they are needed. They do not need the court to tell them they can.\n\n【43】If you have a Lasting Power of Attorney you need to be able to agree to this.

A person is obese when they have a body mass index (BMI) of over 30. You can check your BMI using the healthy weight calculator. If you're pregnant, your midwife or doctor may be able to tell you your BMI.\n\n【7】The best way to protect your health and your baby's wellbeing is to lose weight before you become pregnant. By reaching a healthy weight, you cut your risk of all the problems associated with obesity in pregnancy. Contact your GP for advice about how to lose weight. They may be able to refer you to a specialist weight loss clinic.\n\n【8】As yet, there's no evidence to suggest losing weight during pregnancy lowers your risk of miscarriage, but eating healthily, and activities such as walking and swimming, are good to do during pregnancy.\n\n【9】If you were not active before becoming pregnant, you should consult your midwife or doctor before starting a new exercise regimen while you're pregnant.\n删除7：<u>Read more about obesity and pregnancy and exercise in pregnancy.</u>\n\n【10】Treating an identified cause\n----------------------------\n\n【11】Sometimes the cause of a miscarriage can be identified. In these cases, it may be possible to have treatment to prevent this causing any more miscarriages.\n\n【12】### Antiphospholipid syndrome\n\n【13】Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as Hughes syndrome, is a condition that causes blood clots.

Your doctor may start you off on a lower dose of 5mg.\n\n【4】If you're taking a combination tablet (dapagliflozin with metformin or dapagliflozin with saxagliptin), the doses may vary.\n\n【5】### Dosage for heart failure\n\n【6】For heart failure, the usual dose for adults is 10mg, taken once a day.\n\n【7】### Dosage for chronic kidney disease\n\n【8】For chronic kidney disease, the usual dose for adults is 10mg, taken once a day.\n\n【9】### Taking dapagliflozin with metformin (Xigduo)\n\n【10】There are 2 strengths of Xigduo. Each tablet contains 5mg of dapagliflozin but they contain different amounts of metformin. One contains 850mg of metformin and the other contains 1g.\n\n【11】Your doctor will prescribe the strength with the right amount of metformin for you.\n\n【12】The usual dose is 1 tablet, taken twice a day.\n\n【13】### Taking dapagliflozin with saxagliptin (Qtern)\n\n【14】There's only 1 strength of Qtern. Each tablet contains 10mg of dapagliflozin and 5mg of saxagliptin.\n\n【15】The usual dose is 1 tablet, taken once a day.\n\n【16】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【17】You can take dapagliflozin any time of day, just try to take it at the same time every day.\n\n【18】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not chew them. You can take them with or without food.\n\n【19】But if you're taking dapagliflozin with metformin, it's a good idea to take it with food or just after. This is because metformin is more likely to affect your stomach.\n\n【20】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【21】Treatment for diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease is usually for life.\n\n【22】Do not stop taking your dapagliflozin tablets without talking to your doctor first. If you stop taking it suddenly, your condition may get worse.\n\n【23】If this medicine is not working for you or you're bothered by side effects, speak to your doctor. They may be able to recommend another medicine to treat your diabetes.\n\n【24】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【25】If you miss a dose of dapagliflozin or Qtern and it's 12 hours or more until your next dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【26】If it's less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【27】If you miss a dose of Xigduo, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\n【28】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten dose.\n\n【29】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【30】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【31】If you take more than your prescribed dose of dapagliflozin tablets, contact your doctor straight away. Taking too much can cause low blood sugar.\n\n【32】If you think you have low blood sugar, have some food or drink that quickly gets sugar into your bloodstream (like sugar cubes or fruit juice).\n\n【33】This type of sugar will not stay in your blood for long.

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Children with a cleft lip or palate will need several treatments and assessments as they grow up.**\n\n【3】A cleft is usually treated with surgery. Other treatments, such as speech therapy and dental care, may also be needed.\n\n【4】Your child will be cared for by a specialist cleft team at an NHS cleft centre.\n\n【5】Your child's care plan\n----------------------\n\n【6】Children with clefts will have a care plan tailored to meet their individual needs. A typical care plan timetable for cleft lip and palate is:\n\n【7】*   birth to 6 weeks – feeding assistance, support for parents, hearing tests and paediatric assessment\n*   3 to 6 months – surgery to repair a cleft lip\n*   6 to 12 months – surgery to repair a cleft palate\n*   18 months – speech assessment\n*   3 years – speech assessment\n*   5 years – speech assessment\n*   8 to 12 years – bone graft to repair a cleft in the gum area\n*   12 to 15 years – orthodontic treatment and monitoring jaw growth\n\n【8】Your child will also need to attend regular outpatient appointments at a cleft centre so their condition can be monitored closely and any problems can be dealt with.\n\n【9】These will usually be recommended until they're around 21 years of age, when they're likely to have stopped growing.\n\n【10】Surgery\n-------\n\n【11】### Lip repair surgery\n\n【12】Lip repair surgery is usually done when your baby is around 3 months old.\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【13】Maos / Thinkstock https://www.istockphoto.com/gb/photo/baby-with-cleft-before-and-after-surgery-gm520421636-90969427</u>\n\n【14】Your baby will be given a general anaesthetic (where they're unconscious) and the cleft lip will be repaired and closed with stitches.\n\n【15】The operation usually takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\n【16】Most babies are in hospital for 1 to 2 days. Arrangements may be made for you to stay with them during this time.\n\n【17】The stitches will be removed after a few days, or may dissolve on their own.\n\n【18】Your child will have a slight scar, but the surgeon will try to line up the scar with the natural lines of the lip, to make it less noticeable. It should fade and become less obvious over time.\n\n【19】### Palate repair surgery\n\n【20】Palate repair surgery is usually done when your baby is 6 to 12 months old.\n\n【21】The gap in the roof of the mouth is closed and the muscles and the lining of the palate are rearranged. The wound is closed with dissolvable stitches.\n\n【22】The operation usually takes about 2 hours and is done using a general anaesthetic. Most children are in hospital for 1 to 3 days, and again arrangements may be made for you to stay with them.\n\n【23】The scar from palate repair will be inside the mouth.\n\n【24】### Additional surgery\n\n【25】In some cases, additional surgery may be needed at a later stage to:\n\n【26】*   repair a cleft in the gum using a piece of bone (a bone graft) – usually done at around 8 to 12 years of age\n*   improve the appearance and function of the lips and palate – this may be necessary if the original surgery did not heal well or there are ongoing speech problems\n*   improve the shape of the nose (rhinoplasty)\n*   improve the appearance of the jaw – some children born with a cleft lip or palate may have a small or \"set-back\" lower jaw\n\n【27】Feeding help and advice\n-----------------------\n\n【28】Many babies with a cleft palate have problems breastfeeding because of the gap in the roof of their mouth.\n\n【29】They may struggle to form a seal with their mouth – so they may take in a lot of air and milk may come out of their nose. They may also struggle to put on weight during their first few months.\n\n【30】A specialist cleft nurse can advise on positioning, alternative feeding methods and weaning if necessary.\n\n【31】If breastfeeding is not possible, they may suggest expressing your breast milk into a flexible bottle that is designed for babies with a cleft palate.\n\n【32】Very occasionally, it may be necessary for your baby to be fed through a tube placed into their nose until surgery is carried out.\n\n【33】Treating hearing problems\n-------------------------\n\n【34】Children with a cleft palate are more likely to develop a condition called glue ear, where fluid builds up in the ear and may reduce hearing.\n\n【35】Your child will have regular hearing tests to check for any issues.\n\n【36】Hearing problems may improve after cleft palate repair and, if necessary, can be treated by inserting tiny plastic tubes called grommets into the eardrums. These allow the fluid to drain from the ear.\n\n【37】Sometimes, hearing aids may be recommended.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating glue ear</u>\n\n【38】Dental care\n-----------\n\n【39】If a cleft involves the gum area, it's common for teeth on either side of the cleft to be tilted or out of position. Often a tooth may be missing, or there may be an extra tooth.\n\n【40】A paediatric dentist will monitor the health of your child's teeth and recommend treatment when necessary. It's also important that you register your child with a family dentist.\n\n【41】Orthodontic treatment, which helps improve the alignment and appearance of teeth, may also be required. This can include braces or other dental appliances to help straighten the teeth.\n\n【42】Brace treatment usually starts after all the baby teeth have been lost, but may be necessary before a bone graft to repair the cleft in the gum.\n\n【43】Children with a cleft are more vulnerable to tooth decay, so it's important to encourage them to practise good oral hygiene and to visit their dentist regularly.\n\n【44】Speech and language therapy\n---------------------------\n\n【45】Repairing a cleft palate will significantly reduce the chance of speech problems, but in some cases, children with a repaired cleft palate still need speech therapy.\n\n【46】A speech and language therapist (SLT) will assess your child's speech several times as they get older.\n\n【47】If there are any problems, they may recommend further assessment of how the palate is working and/or work with you to help your child develop clear speech. They may refer you to community SLT services near your home.\n\n【48】The SLT will continue to monitor your child's speech until they are fully grown and they will work with your child for as long as they need assistance.\n\n【49】Further corrective surgery may sometimes be required for a small number of children who have increased airflow through their nose when they're speaking, resulting in nasal-sounding speech.\n\n【50】Specialist UK cleft lip and palate centres\n------------------------------------------\n\n【51】### England\n\n【52】*   Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne\n*   Leeds General Infirmary\n*   Royal Manchester Children's Hospital\n*   Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool\n*   Nottingham City Hospital\n*   Birmingham Children's Hospital\n*   Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge\n*   Great Ormond Street Hospital, London\n*   Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford\n*   John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford\n*   Salisbury District Hospital\n*   Bristol Dental Hospital\n*   Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London\n\n【53】### Wales\n\n【54】*   Morriston Hospital, Swansea\n\n【55】### Scotland\n\n【56】*   Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow\n\n【57】### Northern Ireland\n\n【58】*   Children's Hospital, Belfast\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Cleft lip and palate</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

A few studies have suggested that escitalopram might occasionally affect the development of a baby's heart. However, if there is any risk, it is small, and the majority of babies born to women taking escitalopram will have a normal heart.\n\n【3】When escitalopram is taken in the weeks before delivery it can sometimes cause short-term withdrawal symptoms and, very rarely, breathing problems in babies. Your baby will be checked after they're born and given extra care if they need it.\n\n【4】Taking escitalopram in the last month of pregnancy may slightly increase your risk of bleeding after delivery. However, this side effect is rare and treatable so it's not a reason to stop taking escitalopram.\n\n【5】It's important that depression and anxiety are well treated during pregnancy as these can affect both you and your baby's wellbeing. Depression and anxiety can sometimes get worse during pregnancy, and after your baby is born.\n\n【6】Speak to your doctor if you become pregnant. They will help you weigh up the risks and benefits so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby.\n\n【7】Escitalopram and breastfeeding\n------------------------------\n\n【8】If your doctor or health visitor says your baby is healthy, you can take escitalopram while breastfeeding.\n\n【9】Escitalopram passes into breast milk in small amounts. It does not usually cause any problems but it has been linked with side effects including being unusually irritable or restless and being sick in a few breastfed babies.\n\n【10】Talk to your health visitor, midwife, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible if:\n\n【11】*   your baby is unusually irritable or restless\n*   your baby is unusually sleepy\n*   your baby is not feeding as well as usual\n*   you have any other concerns about your baby\n\n【12】It's important to continue taking escitalopram to keep you well. Breastfeeding will also benefit both you and your baby.\n\n【13】Although other medicines might be preferred while you are breastfeeding, it's important you take the medicine that works for you. If you are breastfeeding, or planning to breastfeed, talk to your doctor or pharmacist to help you decide what is best for you.\n\n【14】Escitalopram and fertility\n--------------------------\n\n【15】Escitalopram may possibly reduce sperm quality, but it's not known whether this reduces fertility or not.

This helps protect them from stomach acid.\n\n【4】It also has weak antacid properties that may help reduce too much stomach acid. This will ease feelings of pain and discomfort.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】Pepto-Bismol should work within 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n【7】You can have another dose after 30 to 60 minutes, if you need to.\n\n【8】You can take up to 8 doses in 24 hours.\n\n【9】Are there other indigestion medicines?\n\n【10】There are a number of different medicines for indigestion and heartburn.\n\n【11】Antacids contain ingredients like calcium carbonate (Tums), magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia), aluminium hydroxide or sodium alginate. Some contain combinations of these ingredients (for example Maalox, Rennies and Gaviscon).\n\n【12】Antacids relieve indigestion and heartburn by counteracting (neutralising) the reducing the damage of acid in your stomach. They work quickly and make you feel better for a few hours. They're ideal if you occasionally get stomach acid problems. You can get antacids from pharmacies and supermarkets.\n\n【13】Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. Most PPIs are available on prescription only. They include omeprazole, esomeprazole and lansoprazole. You can buy the lowest-strength omeprazole and esomeprazole from pharmacies.\n\n【14】H2 blockers (histamine antagonists) reduce the amount of acid made in your stomach, but they do this in a different way to PPIs. For example, your doctor might prescribe cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid) or nizatidine (Axid). You can also buy famotidine from pharmacies.\n\n【15】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【16】Pepto-Bismol does not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【17】However, if you're on the pill and have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\n【18】Find out what to do if you're on the pill and have diarrhoea.\n\n【19】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【20】Taking Pepto-Bismol will not usually affect your ability to drive a car or ride a bike.\n\n【21】However, taking too much Pepto-Bismol can make you feel confused, tired or dizzy. It can also affect your hearing or cause ringing or buzzing in your ears. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel OK again.\n\n【22】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking Pepto-Bismol. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【23】Can I drink alcohol while taking Pepto-Bismol?\n\n【24】Alcohol does not affect the way Pepto-Bismol works. However, drinking alcohol makes your stomach produce more acid than normal. This can irritate your stomach lining and make your symptoms worse.\n\n【25】If you have diarrhoea, drinking alcohol may make you more dehydrated.

{"seq_id": "24d7f5f2-5225-4b37-b833-1a2f2958f42a", "title": "Enalapril", "text": "【0】Common questions about enalapril\n================================\n\n【1】How does enalapril work?\n\n【2】Enalapril is a type of medicine called an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor.\n\n【3】Like other ACE inhibitors, it relaxes and widens your blood vessels. This lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body.\n\n【4】How long does enalapril take to work?\n\n【5】Enalapril starts to reduce your high blood pressure within a few hours, but it may take a few weeks to fully take effect.\n\n【6】If you're taking enalapril for heart failure, it may take weeks, even months, before you feel better.\n\n【7】If you're taking enalapril for high blood pressure, you may not have any symptoms. In this case, you may not feel any different when you take enalapril. This does not mean that the medicine is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Enalapril is generally safe to take for a long time. In fact, it works best when you take it for a long time.\n\n【10】Taking enalapril for a long time can sometimes cause your kidneys to not work as well as they should. Your doctor will check how well your kidneys are working with regular blood tests.\n\n【11】Can I stop taking enalapril now my blood pressure is lower?\n\n【12】Even if enalapril brings down your blood pressure successfully, it's best to carry on taking it. If you stop taking it, your blood pressure could go back up again.\n\n【13】If you need medicines to lower your blood pressure, you'll probably need them for the rest of your life.\n\n【14】Remember, by keeping your blood pressure low, you're protecting yourself against having a heart attack or stroke in the future.\n\n【15】How does enalapril compare to other medicines to lower blood pressure?\n\n【16】There are several other ACE inhibitor medicines which work in the same way as enalapril. They include ramipril, lisinopril and perindopril.\n\n【17】Enalapril works as well as other ACE inhibitors when you take it to lower blood pressure and for heart failure. The side effects are also similar to those of other ACE inhibitors.\n\n【18】There are a few differences between enalapril and other ACE inhibitors:\n\n【19】*   some ACE inhibitors are officially approved to be used after a heart attack to prevent further ones, but enalapril is not\n*   some ACE inhibitors are officially approved to be used in diabetic kidney disease, but enalapril is not\n\n【20】There are also lots of other types of blood pressure-lowering medicines:\n\n【21】*   calcium channel blockers like amlodipine\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers like candesartan\n*   beta blockers like bisoprolol\n*   tablets which make you pee more (diuretics) like bendroflumethiazide\n\n【22】If you cannot take enalapril or other ACE inhibitor medicines because of side effects such as a dry cough, you may be able to switch to another blood pressure-lowering medicine. This will usually be a medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker such as candesartan, irbesartan, losartan or valsartan.\n\n【23】Can I take enalapril before surgery?\n\n【24】Tell your doctor that you're taking enalapril if you're going to be put to sleep with a general anaesthetic for an operation or are going to have a major operation, such as a caesarean section, without a general anaesthetic.\n\n【25】Enalapril can reduce your blood pressure when it's used with an anaesthetic.\n\n【26】Your doctor may advise you to stop taking enalapril 24 hours before surgery.\n\n【27】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【28】Enalapril will not affect any type of contraception.\n\n【29】However, some types of hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch, are not usually recommended if you have high blood pressure.\n\n【30】Talk to your doctor if you're taking or using a combined hormonal contraceptive.\n\n【31】If you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours while taking enalapril, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【32】If this happens, follow the instructions in the leaflet that comes with your contraceptive pills.\n\n【33】Find out what to do if you're on the pill and you have diarrhoea.\n\n【34】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【35】Enalapril can cause blurred vision and can make some people feel dizzy or weak.\n\n【36】Feeling dizzy is more likely to happen when you first start taking enalapril or after increasing your dose. It's best to stop driving, cycling and using tools or machinery during these times.\n\n【37】If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery.\n\n【38】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving</u>\n\n【39】Can I drink alcohol while taking enalapril?\n\n【40】Enalapril lowers your blood pressure and drinking alcohol can increase its effects. This can make you feel dizzy or light-headed.\n\n【41】During the first few days of taking enalapril or after a dose increase, it's best to stop drinking alcohol until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【42】If you find enalapril makes you feel dizzy, it's best to stop drinking alcohol.\n\n【43】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【44】Do not use salt substitutes such as Lo-Salt. This is because they are high in potassium. When mixed with enalapril they may make the level of potassium in your blood too high.\n\n【45】There is nothing else you need to avoid while taking enalapril. Eating well can help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【46】Can lifestyle changes help the health of my heart?\n\n【47】You can boost the health of your heart by making some key lifestyle changes. These will also help if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.\n\n【48】*   Quit smoking – smoking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Quitting smoking brings down your blood pressure and relieves heart failure symptoms. Try to avoid secondhand smoke too.\n*   Cut down on alcohol – drinking too much alcohol raises blood pressure over time and also makes heart failure worse.\n*   Exercise – regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition. It does not need to be too energetic, walking every day is enough.\n*   Eat well – aim to eat a diet that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products and lean proteins. It's a good idea to follow these tips for a lower salt diet too. Eating too much salt is the biggest cause of high blood pressure. The more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Aim for no more than 6g of salt a day.\n*   Deal with stress – when you're anxious or upset, your heart beats faster, you breathe more heavily and your blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse too. Find ways to reduce stress in your life. To give your heart a rest, try napping or putting your feet up when possible. Spend time with friends and family to be social and help avoid stress.\n*   Vaccinations – if you have heart failure, it's recommended that you have the flu vaccine every year and the pneumococcal vaccine as recommended by your GP. Ask your doctor about these vaccinations. You can have them free on the NHS. Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination is recommended for most people. Make sure you've had all the doses that you are eligible for. Talk to your doctor if you think you might be in one of the at risk groups.\n删除11：<u>More in Enalapril\n-----------------\n\n【49】*   About enalapril\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking enalapril with other medicines\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 January 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 January 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Some are caught from food.\n\n【32】You can get infected by:\n\n【33】*   touching objects or surfaces with worm eggs on them – if someone with worms does not wash their hands\n*   touching soil or swallowing water or food with worm eggs in it – mainly a risk in parts of the world without modern toilets or sewage systems\n*   walking barefoot on soil containing worms – only a risk in parts of the world without modern toilets or sewage systems\n*   eating raw or undercooked beef, pork or freshwater fish (like salmon or trout) containing baby worms – more common in parts of the world with poor food hygiene standards\n\n【34】You can catch some worms from pets, but this is rare.\n\n【35】How to prevent worm infections\n------------------------------\n\n【36】There are some things you can do to help prevent worm infections.\n\n【37】### Do\n\n【38】*   wash your hands before eating or preparing food, and after touching soil or using the toilet\n\n【39】*   only drink bottled or boiled water in high-risk areas (places without modern toilets or sewage systems)\n\n【40】*   thoroughly wash garden-grown fruit and vegetables\n\n【41】*   deworm pet dogs and cats regularly\n\n【42】*   dispose of dog and cat poo in a bin as soon as possible\n\n【43】### Don’t\n\n【44】*   do not let children play in areas where there's dog or cat poo\n\n【45】*   do not eat raw fruit and vegetables in high-risk areas\n\n【46】*   do not walk barefoot in high-risk areas\n\n【47】*   do not eat raw or undercooked pork, beef or freshwater fish\n\n【48】删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 November 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 November 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Vascular dementia is a common type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. It's estimated to affect around 180,000 people in the UK.**\n\n【3】Dementia is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. It's rare in people under 65.\n\n【4】Vascular dementia tends to get worse over time, although it's sometimes possible to slow it down.\n\n【5】Symptoms of vascular dementia\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】Vascular dementia can start suddenly or begin slowly over time.\n\n【7】Symptoms include:\n\n【8】*   slowness of thought\n*   difficulty with planning and understanding\n*   problems with concentration\n*   changes to your mood, personality or behaviour\n*   feeling disoriented and confused\n*   difficulty walking and keeping balance\n*   symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, such as problems with memory and language (many people with vascular dementia also have Alzheimer's disease)\n\n【9】These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult and someone with the condition may eventually be unable to look after themselves.\n\n【10】Getting medical advice\n----------------------\n\n【11】See a GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia, especially if you're over 65 years of age.\n\n【12】If it's found at an early stage, treatment may be able to stop vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow it down.\n\n【13】If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with a GP and perhaps suggest that you go with them.\n\n【14】Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms. They can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how to get a dementia diagnosis.</u>\n\n【15】Tests for vascular dementia\n---------------------------\n\n【16】There's no single test for vascular dementia.\n\n【17】The tests that are needed to make a diagnosis include:\n\n【18】*   an assessment of symptoms – for example, whether these are typical symptoms of vascular dementia\n*   a full medical history, including asking about a history of conditions related to vascular dementia, such as strokes or high blood pressure\n*   an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve several tasks and questions\n*   a brain scan, such as an MRI scan or CT scan, to look for any changes that have happened in your brain\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the tests used to diagnose dementia.</u>\n\n【19】Treatments for vascular dementia\n--------------------------------\n\n【20】There's currently no cure for vascular dementia and there's no way to reverse any loss of brain cells that happened before the condition was diagnosed.\n\n【21】But treatment can sometimes help slow down vascular dementia.\n\n【22】Treatment aims to tackle the underlying cause, which may reduce the speed at which brain cells are lost.\n\n【23】This will often involve:\n\n【24】*   eating a healthy, balanced diet\n*   losing weight if you're overweight\n*   stopping smoking\n*   getting fit\n*   cutting down on alcohol\n*   taking medicines, such as those used to treat high blood pressure, lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots\n\n【25】Other treatments, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dementia activities (such as memory cafes) and psychological therapies, can help reduce the impact of any existing problems.\n\n【26】Outlook for vascular dementia\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】Vascular dementia will usually get worse over time. This can happen in sudden steps, with periods in between where the symptoms do not change much, but it's difficult to predict when this will happen.\n\n【28】Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home.\n\n【29】Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy.\n\n【30】But this is highly variable, and many people live for several years with the condition, or die from some other cause.\n\n【31】If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you're not alone. The NHS and social services, as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family.\n\n【32】Causes of vascular dementia\n---------------------------\n\n【33】Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. \n\n【34】This can happen as a result of:\n\n【35】*   narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels inside the brain\n*   a single stroke, where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off\n*   lots of \"mini strokes\" (also called transient ischaemic attacks, or TIAs) that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain\n\n【36】In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight.\n\n【37】Tackling these might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, although it's not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced.\n\n【38】More information\n----------------\n\n【39】### Living with dementia\n\n【40】*   Living well with dementia \n*   Staying independent with dementia \n*   Dementia activities \n*   Looking after someone with dementia \n*   Dementia and your relationships \n*   Communicating with someone with dementia \n*   Coping with dementia behaviour changes \n\n【41】### Care and support\n\n【42】*   Sources of help and support \n*   Dementia UK: nurse helpline\n*   Dementia and care homes \n*   Dementia, social services and the NHS \n*   Dementia and managing money \n*   Managing legal affairs for someone with dementia \n*   End of life planning \n\n【43】### How you can help\n\n【44】*   Dementia Friends\n*   Alzheimer's Society: Dementia forum\n\n【45】Information:\n\n【46】### Social care and support guide\n\n【47】If you:\n\n【48】*   need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n*   care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled, including family members\n\n【49】Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Most people do not have any side effects when they use them for less than 4 weeks.\n\n【4】Some people get a burning or stinging feeling for a few minutes when they put the hydrocortisone on their skin. This stops happening after you've been using it for a few days.\n\n【5】If you get lighter or darker patches on your skin 通用删除1(英):<u>(this may be more difficult to see on brown or black skin)</u>, these are a sign of changes to the pigment in your skin. Speak to your doctor if this happens.\n\n【6】Speak to a doctor if your condition gets worse while you're using hydrocortisone, or comes back within 2 weeks of stopping treatment. Do not start using hydrocortisone again without speaking to a doctor.\n\n【7】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【8】Serious side effects are rare. You're more likely to have a serious side effect if you use a strong hydrocortisone skin treatment (such as hydrocortisone butyrate) or if you use hydrocortisone on a large area of skin for a long time.\n\n【9】Using hydrocortisone for many months at a time can make your skin thinner or cause stretch marks. Stretch marks are likely to be permanent, but they usually fade over time.\n\n【10】Stop using hydrocortisone and tell a doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【11】*   your skin becomes swollen, yellow fluid is weeping from your skin or your skin becomes redder (redness may be less obvious on brown or black skin) – these are signs of a new skin infection or an existing one getting worse\n*   you have a very upset stomach or you're being sick (vomiting), you feel very tired or very dizzy or start to faint, get muscle weakness, mood changes, loss of appetite and weight loss – these can be signs of adrenal gland problems\n*   you're using hydrocortisone for psoriasis and you get raised bumps filled with pus under your skin\n*   you have any new problems with your eyesight after starting to use hydrocortisone\n\n【12】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【13】It happens rarely, but it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to hydrocortisone.\n\n【14】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【15】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【16】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【17】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【18】Long-term side effects\n----------------------\n\n【19】Using hydrocortisone for a long time without stopping can mean some of the medicine gets into your blood.\n\n【20】If this happens, there's a very small chance it can cause serious side effects, such as adrenal gland problems, high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia), or problems with your eyesight.\n\n【21】If you've been using hydrocortisone for a long time, your doctor may tell you to gradually reduce the amount you use before stopping completely.\n\n【22】If you've been using hydrocortisone cream for a long time, you may have a skin reaction within a few days or weeks after stopping treatment (topical steroid withdrawal reaction). You might have a burning feeling and redness, although this may be more difficult to see on brown or black skin. If this happens, ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【23】### Long-term side effects in children and teenagers\n\n【24】In very rare cases, using hydrocortisone for a long time can slow down the normal growth of children and teenagers.\n\n【25】Your child's doctor will monitor their height and weight carefully if they need to use hydrocortisone for a long time. This will help them spot any slowing down of your child's growth and change their treatment if needed.\n\n【26】Even if your child's growth slows down, it does not seem to have much effect on their eventual adult height.\n\n【27】Talk to your doctor if you're worried. They'll be able to explain the benefits and risks of your child using hydrocortisone.\n\n【28】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【29】These are not all the side effects of hydrocortisone.

What happens if your unborn baby dies\n4.  Preventing stillbirth</u>\n\n【2】**A large proportion of stillbirths happen in otherwise healthy babies, and the reason often can't be explained. But there are some causes we do know about.**\n\n【3】Complications with the placenta\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】Many stillbirths are linked to complications with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's and nourishes the baby in the womb.\n\n【5】If there have been problems with the placenta, stillborn babies are usually born perfectly formed, although often small.\n\n【6】With more research, it's hoped that placental causes may be better understood, leading to improved detection and better care for these babies.\n\n【7】Other causes of stillbirth\n--------------------------\n\n【8】Other conditions that can cause or may be associated with stillbirth include:\n\n【9】*   bleeding (haemorrhage) before or during labour\n*   placental abruption – where the placenta separates from the womb before the baby is born (there may be bleeding or abdominal pain)\n*   pre-eclampsia – a condition that causes high blood pressure in the mother\n*   a problem with the umbilical cord, which attaches the placenta to the baby's tummy button – the cord can slip down through the entrance of the womb before the baby is born (cord prolapse) or can be wrapped around the baby and become knotted \n*   intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) or obstetric cholestasis – a liver disorder associated with severe itching during pregnancy\n*   a genetic physical defect in the baby\n*   pre-existing diabetes\n*   an infection in the mother that also affects the baby\n\n【10】Infections\n----------\n\n【11】Usually this will be a bacterial infection that travels from the vagina into the womb (uterus). These bacteria include group B streptococcus, E. coli, klebsiella, enterococcus, Haemophilus influenza, chlamydia, and mycoplasma or ureaplasma.\n\n【12】Some bacterial infections, such as chlamydia and mycoplasma or ureaplasma, which are sexually transmitted infections, can be prevented by using condoms during sex.\n\n【13】Other infections that can cause stillbirths include:  \n\n【14】*   rubella – commonly known as German measles\n*   flu – it's recommended that all pregnant women have the seasonal flu vaccine, regardless of stage of pregnancy\n*   parvovirus B19 – this causes slapped cheek syndrome, a common childhood infection that's dangerous for pregnant women\n*   coxsackie virus – this can cause hand, foot and mouth disease in humans\n*   cytomegalovirus – a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva or urine, which often causes few symptoms in the mother\n*   herpes simplex – the virus that causes genital herpes and cold sores\n*   listeriosis – an infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by listeria bacteria 通用删除1(英):<u>(see foods to avoid in pregnancy)</u>\n*   leptospirosis – a bacterial infection spread by animals such as mice and rats\n*   Lyme disease – a bacterial infection spread by infected ticks\n*   Q fever – a bacterial infection caught from animals such as sheep, goats and cows\n*   toxoplasmosis – an infection caused by a parasite found in soil and cat faeces\n*   malaria – a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes\n\n【15】Increased risk\n--------------\n\n【16】There are also a number of things that may increase your risk of having a stillborn baby, including:\n\n【17】*   having twins or a multiple pregnancy\n*   having a baby who doesn't grow as they should in the womb\n*   being over 35 years of age\n*   smoking, drinking alcohol or misusing drugs while pregnant\n*   being obese – having a body mass index above 30\n*   having a pre-existing physical health condition, such as epilepsy\n\n【18】Your baby's growth\n------------------\n\n【19】Your midwife will check the growth and wellbeing of your baby at each antenatal appointment and plot the baby's growth on a chart.\n\n【20】Every baby is different and should grow to the size that's normal for them. Some babies are naturally small, but all babies should continue to grow steadily throughout pregnancy.\n\n【21】If a baby is smaller than expected or their growth pattern tails off as the pregnancy continues, it may be because the placenta isn't working properly. This increases the risk of stillbirth.\n\n【22】Problems with a baby's growth should be picked up during antenatal appointments.\n\n【23】Your baby's movements\n---------------------\n\n【24】It's important to be aware of your baby's movements and know what's normal for your baby.\n\n【25】Tell your midwife immediately if you notice the baby's movements slowing down or stopping. Don't wait until the next day.\n删除8：<u>See preventing stillbirth for more information.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 March 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Stillbirth</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : What happens if your unborn baby dies</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**A Bartholin's cyst, also called a Bartholin's duct cyst, is a small fluid-filled sac just inside the opening of the vagina.**\n\n【3】Symptoms of a Bartholin's cyst\n------------------------------\n\n【4】You may feel a soft, painless lump. This does not usually cause any problems.\n\n【5】But if the cyst grows very large, it can become noticeable and uncomfortable. You may feel pain in the skin surrounding the vagina (vulva) when you walk, sit down or have sex.\n\n【6】The cyst can sometimes affect the outer pair of lips surrounding the vagina (labia majora). One side may look swollen or bigger than usual.\n\n【7】If the cyst becomes infected, it can cause a painful collection of pus (abscess) to develop in one of the Bartholin's glands.\n\n【8】Signs of an abscess include the affected area becoming red, swollen, tender and hot. It can also cause a high temperature.\n\n【9】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【10】Small Bartholin's cysts are sometimes only found during a routine cervical screening test or an examination carried out for another reason.\n\n【11】Always see a GP if you develop a lump in the area around your vagina so they can confirm a diagnosis and rule out more serious conditions.\n\n【12】If they think the cyst or one of your Bartholin's glands may be infected, they may use a swab to remove a sample of discharge for analysis to identify the bacteria responsible.\n\n【13】Sometimes, a GP may recommend you have a biopsy. A small sample of cyst tissue will be removed and examined under a microscope to check for signs of a rare type of vulval cancer called Bartholin's gland cancer.\n\n【14】What causes Bartholin's cysts?\n------------------------------\n\n【15】The Bartholin's glands are a pair of pea-sized glands found just behind and either side of the lips that surround the entrance to the vagina.\n\n【16】The glands are not usually noticeable because they're rarely larger than 1cm (0.4 inches) across.\n\n【17】The Bartholin's glands secrete fluid that acts as a lubricant during sex. The fluid travels down tiny tubes called ducts into the vagina.\n\n【18】If the ducts become blocked, they can fill with fluid and expand to form a cyst.\n\n【19】It's often not known why the ducts become blocked, but sometimes it's linked to sexually transmitted bacterial infections (STIs), such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia, or other bacterial infections, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli).\n\n【20】How Bartholin's cysts are treated\n---------------------------------\n\n【21】If you do not have any noticeable symptoms, it's unlikely you'll need treatment.\n\n【22】If the cyst is painful, a GP may recommend some simple self-care measures, such as soaking the cyst in warm water several times a day for 3 or 4 days and taking painkillers you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket.\n\n【23】If these do not work, several treatments are available to treat the pain and any infection. If necessary, the cyst can be drained. Most of these treatments involve a minor surgical procedure.\n\n【24】A Bartholin's cyst can sometimes return after treatment.\n\n【25】Who's affected\n--------------\n\n【26】A Bartholin's cyst usually affects sexually active women aged 20 to 30.\n\n【27】Bartholin's cysts do not usually affect children because the Bartholin's glands do not start functioning until puberty. \n\n【28】The cysts are also uncommon after the menopause as this usually causes the Bartholin's glands to shrink.\n\n【29】Preventing Bartholin's cysts\n----------------------------\n\n【30】It's not clear exactly why Bartholin's cysts develop, so it's not usually possible to prevent them.\n\n【31】But as some are thought to be linked to STIs, practising safe sex (using a condom every time you have sex) can help reduce your chances of developing Bartholin's cysts .\n\n【32】Get more advice about STIs\n删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【33】Can you answer some questions about your visit today?\n\n【34】Take our survey\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 October 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This makes you feel sleepy and relaxed while remaining awake and being aware enough to respond to instructions, such as being asked to take a deep breath and hold it at certain points during the procedure.\n\n【15】General anaesthetic is sometimes used when young children need to have the procedure. This is because they may find it too difficult to stay still while it's being carried out.\n\n【16】Monitoring your heart\n---------------------\n\n【17】You'll be attached to an electrocardiogram (ECG) machine throughout the procedure. An ECG records your heart's rhythms and electrical activity.\n\n【18】A number of electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on your arms, legs and chest. The electrodes are connected to a machine that records the electrical signals of each heartbeat.\n\n【19】The procedure\n-------------\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【20】GABRIELLE VOINOT/LOOK AT SCIENCES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/395506/view</u>\n\n【21】If you do not need any further procedures, such as balloon angioplasty, cardiac catheterisation and coronary angiography should take about 30 minutes.\n\n【22】Here's a step-by-step guide to what you can expect during the procedure.\n\n【23】The healthcare professionals who are with you will explain what's happening.\n\n【24】*   After entering the catheterisation laboratory, you'll be asked to lie on a special table. If the catheter is being inserted into your groin, your groin may be shaved and cleansed with antiseptic fluid.\n*   You'll be covered with a sterile sheet and given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the skin of your groin or arm, so the procedure should not be painful.\n*   A small cut (incision) will be made in your groin or arm and a fine tube called a sheath is inserted to hold the blood vessel open.\n*   The catheter will be moved through your blood vessels and into your heart using X-ray guidance.\n*   A small amount of dye called contrast medium is injected through the catheter and the pressure in your heart will be measured.\n*   As the dye is injected, you may feel a hot flushing sensation that passes quickly. You may also experience a warm sensation in your groin that feels as if you have wet yourself, or you may have a metallic taste in your mouth. This is nothing to worry about and you'll be warned when to expect it.\n*   You will not feel the catheter being guided through your blood vessels. But you may be aware of the odd missed or extra heartbeat.\n*   A series of X-ray images are taken of your heart and the blood vessels around it. These are called angiograms and will be stored on a computer.\n*   In certain circumstances (for example, if your arteries are blocked) your cardiologist may decide to carry out a balloon angioplasty (a procedure to widen blocked arteries). This will be carried out immediately and adds about an extra hour to the procedure. This should have been discussed with you beforehand, unless it's needed as an emergency procedure.\n*   The catheter and sheath will be removed once the procedure is complete.\n*   If the catheter was inserted into your groin, the nurse or cardiologist may apply pressure to the entry site for about 10 minutes to stop any bleeding.\n*   Alternatively, a number of different plugs, stitches or clips may be used to seal or close up the wound.\n*   If the catheter was inserted through your arm, a tight dressing or cuff may be applied for around 2 to 3 hours.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Why they're used</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Recovery</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) involves taking a sample of cells from the tissue of the placenta (the chorionic villi).**\n\n【3】Preparing for CVS\n-----------------\n\n【4】You will not usually need to do anything special to prepare for CVS. You can eat and drink as normal beforehand.\n\n【5】In some cases, you may be asked to avoid going to the toilet for a few hours before having CVS because it's sometimes easier to do the test when your bladder is full.\n\n【6】Your doctor or midwife will tell you about this before you attend your appointment.\n\n【7】You can bring a partner, friend or family member for support when you have the test.\n\n【8】How CVS is performed\n--------------------\n\n【9】CVS is carried out under the continuous guidance of an ultrasound scan.\n\n【10】This is to make sure nothing enters the amniotic sac (the protective sac that cushions the baby) or touches the baby.\n\n【11】The test can be carried out using 2 different methods: transabdominal CVS and transcervical CVS.\n\n【12】### Transabdominal CVS\n\n【13】Your tummy is cleaned with antiseptic before a local anaesthetic injection is used to numb it.\n\n【14】A needle is inserted through your skin into the womb and guided to the placenta using the image on the ultrasound scan.\n\n【15】A syringe is attached to the needle, which is used to take a small sample of cells from the chorionic villi.\n\n【16】After the sample is removed, the needle is removed.\n\n【17】### Transcervical CVS\n\n【18】A sample of cells from the chorionic villi is collected through the neck of your womb (the cervix).\n\n【19】A thin tube attached to a syringe, or small forceps, are inserted through your vagina and cervix and guided towards the placenta using the ultrasound scan.\n\n【20】Which method will be used?\n--------------------------\n\n【21】The transabdominal method is preferred in most cases because it's often easier to carry out.\n\n【22】Transcervical CVS is also more likely to cause vaginal bleeding immediately after the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in 10 women who have this procedure.\n\n【23】But there's no difference in the rate of miscarriages between the 2 methods.\n\n【24】Transcervical CVS may be preferred to transabdominal CVS if it's easier to reach your placenta this way.\n\n【25】Is CVS painful?\n---------------\n\n【26】CVS is usually described as being uncomfortable, rather than painful.\n\n【27】In most cases, an injection of local anaesthetic will be given before transabdominal CVS to numb the area where the needle is inserted, but you may have a sore tummy afterwards.\n\n【28】Transcervical CVS feels similar to a cervical screening test.\n\n【29】How long does it take?\n----------------------\n\n【30】CVS usually takes around 10 minutes, although the whole consultation may take about 30 minutes.\n\n【31】Afterwards, you'll be monitored for up to an hour in case you have any side effects, such as heavy bleeding.\n\n【32】You can then go home to rest.\n\n【33】It's a good idea to arrange for someone to drive you home as you might not feel up to it yourself.\n\n【34】Recovering after CVS\n--------------------\n\n【35】After having CVS, it's normal to have cramps similar to period pain and light vaginal bleeding called spotting for a few hours.\n\n【36】You can take painkillers you can buy in a pharmacy or shop, such as paracetamol (but not ibuprofen or aspirin) if you experience any discomfort.\n\n【37】You may wish to avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of the day.\n\n【38】Contact your midwife or the hospital where the procedure was carried out for advice as soon as possible if you develop any of the following symptoms afterwards:\n\n【39】*   persistent or severe pain\n*   a high temperature or feeling hot or shivery\n*   heavy vaginal bleeding\n*   discharge of clear fluid from your vagina\n*   contractions\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Why it's offered</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Results</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Starting gentle exercise, such as walking, can be helpful when you feel up to it, but don't try to do too much too quickly.\n\n【25】Your doctor or surgeon can give you specific advice about when you can return to your normal activities, but generally speaking:\n\n【26】*   you can be a passenger in a car straight away\n*   you should not drive for 6 weeks – wait until you can comfortably do an emergency stop, and tell your insurer that you have had heart surgery\n*   you can have sex after 6 weeks – make sure you feel strong enough first and are able to do light work such as 15 minutes of brisk walking\n*   when you can return to work depends on the type of work you do – this could be as soon as 6 to 8 weeks if your job mainly involves light work, but may not be for 3 months if it involves manual labour\n*   you should avoid strenuous exercise, sudden strains and heavy lifting for 3 months\n\n【27】### Possible side effects\n\n【28】While at home, you may experience some temporary side effects that should start to improve as you recover.\n\n【29】These can include:\n\n【30】*   pain and discomfort – you can take painkillers to relieve this, although it should improve as your wound heals\n*   swelling and redness around your wound that should gradually fade\n*   loss of appetite\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n*   constipation – drinking plenty of fluids and eating fruit and vegetables can help with this; your doctor may also suggest taking a laxative\n*   mood swings, irritability, anxiety and depression – these are completely normal after major surgery; talking to your friends and family can help, and your cardiac nurse can also offer support\n*   loss of interest in sex – this is common in people with serious illnesses; in men, the associated emotional stress can also result in erectile dysfunction\n\n【31】Speak to your GP or cardiac nurse for advice if you're struggling to cope with the after effects of your operation or they don't seem to be improving.\n\n【32】### When to get medical advice\n\n【33】Contact your GP if you experience:\n\n【34】*   increasing redness, swelling or tenderness around the wound\n*   pus or fluid oozing from the wound\n*   pain that's getting worse\n*   a high temperature\n*   increasing shortness of breath\n*   a return of the symptoms you had before the operation\n\n【35】These symptoms could be a sign of a problem such as an infection.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the risks of an aortic valve replacement.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 23 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 23 December 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : What happens</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Risks</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But there's very little evidence these work.\n\n【16】There are some treatments that may help make stretch marks look better, but they will not get rid of them.\n\n【17】They include:\n\n【18】*   retinoid (often called tretinoin) creams or hyaluronic acid – these may help if used on new stretch marks, but you should not use retinoid creams if you're pregnant as they may harm your baby\n*   light or laser treatments\n*   microdermabrasion, which removes a thin layer of skin\n\n【19】You would need to pay for these treatments as they're not available on the NHS.\n\n【20】Information:\n\n【21】It's not always possible to prevent stretch marks.

Urinary incontinence is a common problem and it's likely the GP has seen many people with the same problem.\n\n【4】A GP will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including:\n\n【5】*   whether the urinary incontinence happens when you cough or laugh\n*   whether you need the toilet frequently during the day or night\n*   whether you have any difficulty passing urine when you go to the toilet\n*   whether you're currently taking any medicine\n*   how much fluid, alcohol or caffeine you drink\n\n【6】Bladder diary\n-------------\n\n【7】The GP may suggest that you keep a diary of your bladder habits for at least 3 days so you can give them as much information as possible about your condition.\n\n【8】This should include:\n\n【9】*   how much fluid you drink\n*   the types of fluid you drink\n*   how often you need to pass urine\n*   the amount of urine you pass\n*   how many episodes of incontinence you have\n*   how many times you experience an urgent need to go to the toilet\n\n【10】Tests and examinations\n----------------------\n\n【11】You may also need to have some tests and examinations so the GP can confirm or rule out things that may be causing incontinence.\n\n【12】### Physical examination\n\n【13】A GP may examine you to assess the health of your urinary system. If you have a vagina, the GP will do a pelvic examination, which usually involves undressing from the waist down. You may be asked to cough to see if any urine leaks.\n\n【14】The GP may also examine your vagina to check for causes of incontinence, such as prolapse where part of the bladder bulges into the vagina.\n\n【15】The GP may place their finger inside your vagina and ask you to squeeze your pelvic floor muscles.\n\n【16】These are the muscles that surround your bladder and urethra (the tube that urine passes through to leave your body). Damage to your pelvic floor muscles can lead to urinary incontinence.\n\n【17】If you have a penis, the GP may check the health of your prostate gland, which is located between the penis and bladder and surrounds the urethra.\n\n【18】You may need a digital rectal examination. This will involve the GP inserting their finger into your bottom so they can feel your prostate gland.\n\n【19】If you have an enlarged prostate gland, it can cause symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as a frequent need to urinate.\n\n【20】### Dipstick test\n\n【21】If the GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), a sample of your urine may be tested for bacteria.\n\n【22】A small chemically treated stick is dipped into your urine sample. It will change colour if bacteria are present. The dipstick test can also check for blood and protein in your urine.\n\n【23】### Residual urine test\n\n【24】If the GP thinks you have overflow incontinence, they may suggest a test called a residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you pee.\n\n【25】This usually involves an ultrasound scan of your bladder, although occasionally the amount of urine left in your bladder may be measured after your bladder is drained using a catheter.\n\n【26】A catheter is a thin, flexible tube that's inserted into your urethra and passed through to your bladder.\n\n【27】Further tests\n-------------\n\n【28】Further tests may be necessary if the cause of your urinary incontinence is not clear. The GP will usually start treating you first and may suggest further tests if treatment is not effective.\n\n【29】### Cystoscopy\n\n【30】A cystoscopy involves using a thin tube with a camera attached to it (endoscope) to look inside your bladder and urinary tract. A cystoscopy can identify abnormalities that may be causing incontinence.\n\n【31】### Urodynamic tests\n\n【32】These are a group of tests used to check the function of your bladder and urethra. You may be asked to keep a bladder diary for a few days then have several tests at a hospital or clinic.\n\n【33】Tests can include:\n\n【34】*   measuring the pressure in your bladder by inserting a catheter into your urethra\n*   measuring the pressure in your tummy (abdomen) by inserting a catheter into your bottom\n*   asking you to urinate into a special machine that measures the amount and flow of urine\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 June 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 June 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Non-surgical treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**If you have a lump in the opening of your vagina, get it checked by a GP.**\n\n【3】If it turns out to be a Bartholin's cyst and it does not bother you, it's often better to leave it alone.\n\n【4】If the cyst is painful, a GP may recommend:\n\n【5】*   soaking the cyst for 10 to 15 minutes in a few inches of warm water (it's easier in the bath) – it's best to do this several times a day for 3 or 4 days if possible\n*   holding a warm compress (a flannel or cotton wool warmed with hot water) against the area\n*   taking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen\n\n【6】Always read the manufacturer's instructions when using medicine you buy from a pharmacy or supermarket.\n\n【7】Treating an abscess\n-------------------\n\n【8】If the cyst becomes infected and an abscess (a painful collection of pus) develops, you may be prescribed antibiotics to clear the infection.\n\n【9】Once the infection has been treated, a GP may still recommend having the cyst drained, particularly if the abscess is large.\n\n【10】Draining cysts and abscesses\n----------------------------\n\n【11】A number of techniques can be used to drain a Bartholin's cyst or abscess and reduce the likelihood of it returning.\n\n【12】### Balloon catheter insertion\n\n【13】Balloon catheter insertion, sometimes known as catheter placement or fistulisation, is a procedure used to drain the fluid from the abscess or cyst.\n\n【14】A permanent passage is created to drain away any fluid that builds up in the future. This is an outpatient procedure, which means you will not need to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【15】It's usually carried out under local anaesthetic, where you remain conscious, but the area is numbed so you cannot feel anything. It can also be carried out under general anaesthetic, where you're unconscious and unable to feel anything.\n\n【16】A cut is made in the abscess or cyst and the fluid is drained. A balloon catheter is then inserted into the empty abscess or cyst. A balloon catheter is a thin, plastic tube with a small, inflatable balloon on one end.\n\n【17】Once inside the abscess or cyst, the balloon is filled with a small amount of salt water. This increases the size of the balloon so it fills the abscess or cyst. Stitches may be used to partially close the opening and hold the balloon catheter in place.\n\n【18】The catheter will stay in place while new cells grow around it (epithelialisation). This means the surface of the wound heals, but a drainage passage is left in place. \n\n【19】Epithelialisation usually takes around 4 weeks, although it can take longer. After epithelialisation, the balloon will be drained and the catheter removed.\n\n【20】A few small studies have reported more than 8 out of 10 of women healed well and their cysts or abscesses did not return after balloon catheter insertion.\n\n【21】Possible complications of balloon catheter insertion include:\n\n【22】*   pain while the catheter is in place\n*   pain or discomfort during sex\n*   swelling of the lips (labia) around the opening of the vagina\n*   infection\n*   bleeding\n*   scarring\n\n【23】### Marsupialisation\n\n【24】If a cyst or abscess keeps coming back, a surgical procedure known as marsupialisation may be used.\n\n【25】The cyst is first opened with a cut and the fluid is drained out. The edges of the skin are then stitched to create a small \"kangaroo pouch\", which allows any further fluid to drain out.\n\n【26】When the procedure is complete, the treated area may be loosely packed with gauze to soak up fluid from the wound and stop any bleeding. This will usually be removed before you go home.\n\n【27】Marsupialisation takes about 10 to 15 minutes and is usually performed as a day case procedure, so you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. It's usually carried out under general anaesthetic, although local anaesthetic can be used instead.\n\n【28】Although complications after marsupialisation are rare, they can include:\n\n【29】*   infection\n*   the abscess returning\n*   bleeding\n*   pain – you may be given painkillers for the first 24 hours after the procedure\n\n【30】After marsupialisation, you'll be advised to take things easy for a few days. You should avoid having sex until the wound has completely healed, which usually takes about 2 weeks.\n\n【31】Removing the Bartholin's gland\n------------------------------\n\n【32】Surgery to remove the affected Bartholin's gland may be recommended if other treatments have not been effective and Bartholin's cysts or abscesses keep coming back.\n\n【33】This operation is usually carried out under general anaesthetic and takes about an hour to complete. You may need to stay in hospital for 2 or 3 days afterwards.\n\n【34】Risks of this type of surgery include bleeding, bruising and infection of the wound. If the wound does become infected, this can usually be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a GP.\n\n【35】Alternative procedures\n----------------------\n\n【36】There are a number of alternative ways of treating a Bartholin's cyst, but they're less commonly used or are not widely available.\n\n【37】### Silver nitrate gland ablation\n\n【38】Silver nitrate is a mixture of chemicals sometimes used to burn (cauterise) blood vessels to stop bleeding. A small, solid stick of silver nitrate is used in silver nitrate gland ablation.\n\n【39】A cut is made in the skin surrounding the vagina and the wall of the cyst or abscess. The cyst or abscess is then drained and the stick of silver nitrate is inserted into the empty space left after draining the fluid.\n\n【40】The silver nitrate causes the cyst cavity to form into a small, solid lump. After 2 or 3 days the silver nitrate and cyst remains are removed or may fall out on their own.\n\n【41】It's possible for the silver nitrate to burn some of the skin of the vulva when it's first used. One small study reported this occurs in about 1 in 5 of those who receive this treatment.\n\n【42】### Carbon dioxide laser\n\n【43】A carbon dioxide laser can be used to create an opening in the skin of the vulva so the cyst can be drained.\n\n【44】The cyst can then be removed, destroyed using the laser, or left in place with a small hole to allow fluid to drain from it.\n\n【45】### Needle aspiration\n\n【46】During needle aspiration, a needle and syringe are used to drain the cyst. It is sometimes combined with a procedure called alcohol sclerotherapy, where the cavity is filled with a 70% alcohol liquid after being drained. This is left in the cyst cavity for 5 minutes and then drained out.\n\n【47】Advice after surgery\n--------------------\n\n【48】To help the wound heal and reduce the risk of infection after surgery, you may be advised to avoid:\n\n【49】*   having sex and using tampons for up to 4 weeks\n*   using perfumed bath products for up to 4 weeks\n*   driving or performing tasks that need careful attention for 24 to 48 hours after having a general anaesthetic\n删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【50】Can you answer some questions about your visit today?\n\n【51】Take our survey\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 October 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Bartholin's cyst</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's important to get treatment because it can sometimes affect your sight.**\n\n【2】Check if it's a herpes simplex eye infection\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】Herpes simplex eye infections usually affect only one eye.\n\n【4】The symptoms can be similar to some other eye conditions, and can include:\n\n【5】*   eye pain\n*   a red eye\n*   watering of your eye\n*   sensitivity to light\n*   blurred vision or other changes to your eyesight\n*   a swollen eyelid\n*   blisters or a rash on your eyelid or the skin around your eye\n\n【6】It's more likely to be a herpes simplex eye infection if you've had one before, or if you've had cold sores.\n\n【7】If you keep getting herpes simplex eye infections they may become less painful.\n\n【8】### If you're not sure it's a herpes simplex eye infection\n\n【9】Find out about other conditions that can cause:\n\n【10】*   a red eye\n*   eyelid problems\n*   watering eyes\n\n【11】Non-urgent advice: See a GP or go to an opticians if:\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】*   you have a red eye with no pain for more than a few days\n\n【13】You can get treatment on the NHS for some eye conditions at some opticians – check before you make an appointment.\n\n【14】If it's not clear what's causing your red eye, you may be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for tests.\n\n【15】Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】*   you have eye pain\n*   you have a red eye that's getting worse\n*   you have any changes to your eyesight, such as blurred vision\n*   you have a swollen, irritated eyelid that has not got better\n\n【17】It might not be anything serious, but it's best to get help as it may need to be treated quickly.\n\n【18】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【19】Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】You have a red eye and:\n\n【21】*   it hurts to look at light\n*   your eye is very dark red\n*   one pupil is bigger than the other\n\n【22】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【23】Treatment for herpes simplex eye infections\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【24】If a GP thinks you have a herpes simplex eye infection they'll refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly.\n\n【25】You'll usually be prescribed either:\n\n【26】*   an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir, taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets\n*   antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling\n\n【27】Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight.\n\n【28】It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections.\n\n【29】If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant.\n\n【30】Information:\n\n【31】If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone.\n\n【32】How you get herpes simplex eye infections\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Most herpes simplex eye infections are caused by the same herpes simplex virus that causes cold sores.\n\n【34】You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections.\n\n【35】This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury.\n\n【36】You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 25 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 25 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**The symptoms of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are often mild and cause no serious health problems. But some people will have severe symptoms.**\n\n【3】The symptoms of NF1 can affect many different areas of the body, but it's unlikely someone will develop all of them.\n\n【4】The skin\n--------\n\n【5】### Coffee-coloured patches\n\n【6】The most common symptom of NF1 is the appearance of painless, coffee-coloured patches on the skin, called café au lait spots. However, not everyone with café au lait spots has NF1.\n\n【7】The spots can be present at birth or develop by the time a child is 3 years old.\n\n【8】During childhood, most children with NF1 will have at least 6 café au lait spots around 5mm across. These grow to about 15mm during adulthood.\n\n【9】The number of spots someone has is not related to the severity of the condition. For example, a person with 10 spots has the same chance of developing further problems as someone with 100 spots.\n\n【10】### Freckles\n\n【11】Another common symptom of NF1 is clusters of freckles in unusual places, such as the armpits, groin and under the breast.\n\n【12】### Tumours on or under the skin\n\n【13】As a child gets older, usually during teenage years or early adulthood, they develop tumours on or under their skin (neurofibromas).\n\n【14】These are caused by non-cancerous tumours that develop on the coverings of nerves. They may vary in size, from pea-sized to slightly bigger tumours. Some neurofibromas are purple.\n\n【15】The number of neurofibromas can vary. Some people only have a few, while others have them on large sections of their body.\n\n【16】Most neurofibromas are not particularly painful, but they may be visible, catch on clothes and occasionally cause irritation and stinging.\n\n【17】However, if neurofibromas develop where multiple branches of nerves come together (plexiform neurofibromas), they can cause large swellings.\n\n【18】Plexiform neurofibromas sometimes occur on the skin but may also develop on larger nerves deeper in the body. They may sometimes cause symptoms including pain, weakness, numbness, bleeding, or problems with the bladder or bowels, such as urinary tract infections or constipation.\n\n【19】Learning and behaviour\n----------------------\n\n【20】Some children with NF1 develop learning and behavioural problems. It's unclear why this happens.\n\n【21】Children with NF1 who have a learning difficulty may have normal or slightly lower-than-average intelligence, but they can usually be taught at a mainstream school.\n\n【22】Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects around half of all children with NF1 and causes problems with attention span, concentration and controlling impulses.\n\n【23】NF1 has also been linked with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and some children may have difficulty in social communication.\n\n【24】The eyes\n--------\n\n【25】Around 15% of children with NF1 develop a tumour on their optic pathway.\n\n【26】The optic pathway is located at the back of each eye and sends information from the eyes to the brain. This type of tumour is known as an optic pathway glioma (OPG).\n\n【27】Children under 7 years of age are known to have the highest risk of developing this type of tumour. These tumours are often small, grow slowly and do not cause any noticeable symptoms.\n\n【28】Children with faster-growing OPGs may have problems with their vision, including:\n\n【29】*   objects becoming blurry\n*   changes in how they see colours\n*   a reduced field of vision\n*   squinting\n*   one eye looking more prominent than the other\n\n【30】Younger children may be unable to explain that they have vision problems. You should be aware of any signs that your child has difficulty seeing, such as problems picking up small objects or bumping into things.\n\n【31】The best way of detecting these tumours is to have eye tests a minimum of once a year until your child is at least 7 years old.\n\n【32】Another common feature of NF1 is the appearance of tiny, raised brown spots in the coloured central part of the eye (iris). These are known as Lisch nodules and do not usually cause any noticeable symptoms or vision problems.\n\n【33】High blood pressure\n-------------------\n\n【34】Some children with NF1 develop high blood pressure.\n\n【35】High blood pressure may be caused by narrowing of the artery to the kidney (renal artery stenosis). This requires specialist treatment if it's found to be causing your child's high blood pressure.\n\n【36】High blood pressure may also be caused by a phaeochromocytoma. This is a tumour of the adrenal glands that is usually benign. It's more common in adults than children.\n\n【37】High blood pressure may be associated with potentially serious complications, such as a stroke or a heart attack, if it's not treated.\n\n【38】Children and adults with NF1 should have regular blood pressure checks, usually at least once a year.\n\n【39】Physical development\n--------------------\n\n【40】Many children with NF1 have one or more problems affecting their physical development, including:\n\n【41】*   a curved spine (scoliosis) – thought to affect around 10% of children with NF1\n*   a larger-than-average head – this occurs in around half of all children\n*   smaller size and lower weight than normal – this is common in many people with NF1\n\n【42】Around 2% of children with NF1 develop pseudarthrosis. This is when abnormal bone development causes curving (bowing) of the limb, usually in the tibia bone of the lower leg. The bone may fracture after a minor injury. The fracture does not heal completely, which affects the normal movement of the leg.\n\n【43】The brain and nervous system\n----------------------------\n\n【44】Symptoms affecting the brain and nervous system are relatively common in NF1.\n\n【45】Many people with NF1 get migraines.\n\n【46】Some people develop brain tumours, although this is rare. The tumours may cause no noticeable symptoms. However, tumours in certain parts of the brain occasionally cause symptoms, such as:\n\n【47】*   personality changes\n*   weakness on one side of the body\n*   difficulties with balance and co-ordination\n\n【48】Some children with NF1 develop epilepsy, where a person has repeated seizures or fits. This tends to be a mild form of epilepsy that's usually controlled easily with medicine.\n\n【49】Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour\n----------------------------------------\n\n【50】One of the most serious problems that can affect a person with NF1 is a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST).\n\n【51】MPNSTs are a type of cancer. It's estimated that people with NF1 have around a 10% chance over their lifetime of developing a MPNST.\n\n【52】Most cases first develop when people are in their late 20s or early 30s, but they can occur at any age.\n\n【53】Symptoms of an MPNST include:\n\n【54】*   the texture of an existing neurofibroma changing from soft to hard\n*   an existing neurofibroma suddenly growing much larger\n*   persistent pain lasting for more than a month or waking you up at night\n*   suddenly having problems with your nervous system that you did not have before, such as weakness, numbness or tingling in your arms and legs\n*   loss of bladder or bowel control\n*   difficulty breathing or swallowing\n\n【55】If you have any of these symptoms, contact the doctor in charge of your care as soon as possible.\n\n【56】Gastrointestinal tumour\n-----------------------\n\n【57】Some people with NF1 can develop a gastrointestinal tumour (GIST), which may cause symptoms such as:\n\n【58】*   abdominal pain\n*   changes in bowel habits – such as diarrhoea or constipation\n*   bleeding from the bottom\n\n【59】Gastrointestinal tumours require management at a specialist centre.\n\n【60】Specialist centres\n------------------\n\n【61】If you need specialist management, you should be referred to a specialist centre with experience in diagnosing and treating MPNST.\n\n【62】There are currently 2 centres, one in Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London and the other in the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 August 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 August 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Neurofibromatosis type 1</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It does this by helping your cells become more sensitive to the insulin your body makes.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】You will not necessarily feel any different when taking pioglitazone, as you may not have had any symptoms of diabetes. This does not mean that pioglitazone is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【6】Pioglitazone takes a few weeks to lower your blood sugar levels.\n\n【7】It will help keep your blood sugar stable and reduce your chances of getting problems related to diabetes in the future.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Pioglitazone is usually safe to take for a long time. Your doctor will give you regular tests to check whether it's OK for you to continue taking it.\n\n【10】People aged over 65 are slightly more likely to get some of the less common side effects of pioglitazone, such as heart failure.\n\n【11】Your doctor will make sure you have regular checks if they think there's a higher risk of side effects.\n\n【12】Does pioglitazone cause hypoglycaemia (\"hypos\")?\n\n【13】Pioglitazone does not usually cause low blood sugar (known as hypoglycaemia, or \"hypos\") when taken on its own.\n\n【14】If you're taking other medicines for diabetes, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose of these other medicines when you start pioglitazone. This will reduce the risk of hypos.\n\n【15】Can pioglitazone cause heart failure?\n\n【16】Taking pioglitazone together with insulin increases your risk of heart failure. The risk is higher if you're over 65 years old.\n\n【17】If you already have heart failure, there's a small chance that taking pioglitazone could make it worse.\n\n【18】If you're unusually short of breath, put on weight quickly or have swollen legs, feet or ankles (oedema), see your doctor straight away.\n\n【19】Are there other medicines that treat type 2 diabetes?\n\n【20】Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (also known as a glitazone). It's the only one in this group of medicines available in the UK.\n\n【21】There are other medicines that can also treat type 2 diabetes including:\n\n【22】*   metformin\n*   sulfonylureas, like gliclazide and glimepiride\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors, like saxagliptin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, like exenatide (given by injection)\n*   insulin (given by injection)\n\n【23】Metformin is usually the first choice of medicine used for treating type 2 diabetes.\n\n【24】Pioglitazone can be prescribed on its own or together with other diabetes medicines such as metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n【25】Your doctor will advise you on the best way to treat your type 2 diabetes. They will look at your medical history and how your blood sugar levels respond to a medicine or combination of medicines.\n\n【26】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【27】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【28】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate (FP92A). You can get an application form at your GP surgery. Once you've filled in the form, ask your doctor to sign it.\n\n【29】Can I take pioglitazone before surgery?\n\n【30】You can usually take pioglitazone before surgery and on the day of surgery too, even if you're not eating (fasting).\n\n【31】If you're going to have an operation, tell your doctor that you're taking pioglitazone. Also tell them about any other medicines you may be taking, including other diabetes medicines.\n\n【32】This is because medicines for type 2 diabetes can increase your risk of low blood sugar during the operation. Low blood sugar can be difficult to detect when you're having a general anaesthetic to put you to sleep.\n\n【33】Your doctor may change you to insulin for a few days before your operation.\n\n【34】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【35】Pioglitazone does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【36】But talk to your doctor before starting to take contraceptive pills if you're already taking pioglitazone. They may change your dose of pioglitazone. This is because contraceptive pills change how your body handles sugar.\n\n【37】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【38】If your blood sugar levels are stable, then taking pioglitazone should not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machinery and tools.\n\n【39】However, if you take pioglitazone with other medicines for type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can become too low. This can reduce your concentration. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle, or use machines or tools, until you feel better.\n\n【40】If your eyesight is affected by changes in your blood sugar, do not drive or use machinery until you can see clearly again. See your doctor or optician if your vision does not get better.\n\n【41】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking pioglitazone. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【42】Can I drink alcohol while taking pioglitazone?\n\n【43】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking pioglitazone. But it's best to drink no more than 2 units a day. Drinking more than this can increase your risk of low blood sugar.\n\n【44】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【45】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar, such as:\n\n【46】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【47】However, it's important to always carry a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, like sugar cubes, fruit juice or some sweets, in case your blood sugar level gets low. Artificial sweeteners will not help.\n\n【48】You may also need to eat a starchy carbohydrate, like a sandwich or a biscuit, to maintain your blood sugar for longer.\n\n【49】Be careful eating food and drink containing karela (also called bitter gourd) because it can lower your blood sugar levels and mean your diabetes is not controlled as well as it should be. Karela is used to flavour foods such as curries. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.\n\n【50】Will I put on weight or lose weight?\n\n【51】Some people find they gain body fat when taking pioglitazone. This can make them put on weight.\n\n【52】Try to eat a healthy balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes, so you do not gain too much weight. Regular exercise will also help to keep your weight stable.\n\n【53】Pioglitazone can also make you retain water. If you put on weight, have swollen ankles, feet or legs (oedema), and have problems breathing, make an urgent appointment to see you doctor. These can be signs of heart failure.\n\n【54】Can lifestyle changes help to control diabetes?\n\n【55】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of diabetes. These include:\n\n【56】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing excess weight\n*   not smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week.\n*   exercising – 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal\n\n【57】Pioglitazone is usually prescribed when diet and exercise alone have not been enough to control your blood sugar levels.\n删除11：<u>More in Pioglitazone\n--------------------\n\n【58】*   About pioglitazone\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking pioglitazone with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "ac9a82b3-1c05-41c3-9d9a-f29276764317", "title": "Lactulose", "text": "【0】Common questions about lactulose\n================================\n\n【1】How does lactulose work?\n\n【2】Lactulose is a type of laxative called an osmotic laxative.\n\n【3】It is broken down in your bowel into substances that pull water out from your body and into your bowel to soften poo and make it easier to pass.\n\n【4】People with liver disease can sometimes get problems in their brain (hepatic encephalopathy). This happens because the liver is not clearing toxins properly. Lactulose clears the bowels and helps the body remove the toxins that build up when the liver is failing.\n\n【5】When will I feel better?\n\n【6】It takes a couple of days for lactulose to work.\n\n【7】Talk to your doctor if you are still constipated after 3 days.\n\n【8】If you take it for liver disease you may not feel better but it will help prevent you developing some of the symptoms of liver problems.\n\n【9】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【10】Ideally, you'll only take lactulose occasionally and for a few days at a time. Using laxatives like lactulose for longer can lead to diarrhoea that lasts a long time, and can cause an electrolyte imbalance. This is where levels of substances like sodium, potassium and magnesium in your body get too high or too low.\n\n【11】A severe electrolyte imbalance can cause serious health problems, such as:\n\n【12】*   muscle spasms\n*   twitching\n*   a seizure or fit\n\n【13】But there are some situations where you may need to take lactulose for many months, for instance, if you keep getting constipation or if you have a health problem called hepatic encephalopathy. Your doctor will advise you exactly how long you need to take lactulose for and how much to take.\n\n【14】How does lactulose compare with other laxatives?\n\n【15】There are other types of laxatives. They work in a different way to lactulose but are equally good at treating constipation. Some work more quickly than lactulose.\n\n【16】Bulk-forming laxatives, for example Fybogel and methylcellulose, increase the \"bulk\" or weight of poo which in turn stimulates bowel movement. They take 2 or 3 days to work. They are normally tried first before trying a laxative like lactulose.\n\n【17】Stimulant laxatives, for example senna and bisacodyl, speed up your bowels by stimulating the nerves that control the muscles lining your gut. They work more quickly than other laxatives. If you take them at bedtime, they work overnight. They are normally tried after a laxative like lactulose has not worked.\n\n【18】Surface-wetting laxatives, for example arachis oil and docusate, let water get into poo to soften it and make it easier to pass.\n\n【19】Can people with irritable bowel syndrome take it?\n\n【20】It's not a good idea for people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to take lactulose.\n\n【21】Lactulose increases gas and bloating in the stomach, which can make IBS worse. Other types of laxative may be more suitable if you have IBS.\n\n【22】Can people with diabetes take it?\n\n【23】Yes, usually they can. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether lactulose is suitable you.\n\n【24】If you have diabetes and are taking normal doses of lactulose for constipation, the medicine will have little, if any, effect on your blood sugar levels.\n\n【25】But if you have diabetes and need to take high doses of lactulose for many months, the medicine may affect your blood sugar levels. In this case, monitor your blood sugar levels carefully and share the results with your doctor. Your diabetes treatment or diet may need to be adjusted.\n\n【26】Some people think that lactulose is the same as lactose, a sugar that can dangerously raise blood sugar levels. But lactulose is very different. It's a synthetic sugar that is broken down in the bowel so very little gets into your bloodstream.\n\n【27】Can I use lactulose after surgery?\n\n【28】It's quite common to have constipation after surgery. Using a laxative may help relieve the discomfort.\n\n【29】If you have constipation after an operation, it's fine to use lactulose syrup. It's gentler on the stomach muscles than some other types of laxative, like senna.\n\n【30】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【31】Lactulose does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【32】But if lactulose makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【33】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【34】Taking lactulose should not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【35】Can I drink alcohol while taking lactulose?\n\n【36】Yes, you can drink alcohol with lactulose.\n\n【37】But try not to drink too much, as it could make you more likely to get diarrhoea.\n\n【38】Is there any food and drink I need to avoid?\n\n【39】You can eat and drink normally while taking lactulose.\n\n【40】It might help to cut down on foods such as pastries, puddings, sweets, cheese and cake for a while, as these foods can make constipation worse.\n\n【41】To help with constipation, eat more fibre, such as fresh fruit, vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water.\n\n【42】Can lifestyle changes help constipation?\n\n【43】It's often possible to improve constipation without having to use laxatives.\n\n【44】Before trying lactulose, or to stop constipation coming back, it may help to:\n\n【45】*   get more fibre into your diet – aim for about 30g of fibre a day. High-fibre foods include fruit, vegetables and cereals. If you're not used to a high-fibre diet, increase the amount of fibre you eat gradually\n*   add bulking agents, such as wheat bran, oats or linseed, to your diet. These will help make your poo softer and easier to pass (although bran and fibre can sometimes make bloating worse)\n*   drink plenty of water – to keep poo soft\n*   exercise regularly – keeping your body active will help to keep your gut moving\n删除11：<u>More in Lactulose\n-----------------\n\n【46】*   About lactulose\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking lactulose with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

There is support available.\n\n【8】Pregnancy and contraception\n---------------------------\n\n【9】Women with thalassaemia major or other severe types can have a healthy pregnancy, but it's a good idea to speak to your care team for advice first because:\n\n【10】*   it may be useful to find out if your partner is a carrier of thalassaemia and discuss the effects of this with a genetic counsellor\n*   some people with thalassaemia need fertility treatment to help them get pregnant\n*   during pregnancy there's an increased risk of problems, such as heart problems in the mother and growth problems in the baby\n*   you may need extra monitoring and changes to your treatment during pregnancy\n\n【11】If you're not planning a pregnancy, use a reliable form of contraception.\n\n【12】Precautions before you have surgery\n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】It's important to let your healthcare team know if you need to have an operation under general anaesthetic at any point.\n\n【14】You should also tell your surgeon that you have thalassaemia.\n\n【15】This is because general anaesthetic can cause problems such as an increased risk of blood clots for people with thalassaemia.\n\n【16】You may need close monitoring during surgery and a blood transfusion before or afterwards to reduce the risk of complications.\n\n【17】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【18】It's important to make sure you know when to get medical advice and where to go, as thalassaemia can cause a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Thalassaemia carriers</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**If you have coeliac disease, it's crucial you do not eat any gluten. If you have untreated or undiagnosed coeliac disease and you're still eating gluten, several complications can occur.**\n\n【3】It's a common misconception that eating a little gluten will not harm you. Eating even tiny amounts can trigger symptoms of coeliac disease and increase your risk of developing complications.\n\n【4】Malabsorption\n-------------\n\n【5】Malabsorption (where your body does not fully absorb nutrients) can lead to a deficiency of vitamins and minerals. This can cause conditions such as:\n\n【6】*   iron deficiency anaemia\n*   vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\n*   osteoporosis – a condition where your bones become brittle and weak\n\n【7】Malnutrition\n------------\n\n【8】As coeliac disease causes your digestive system to work less effectively, severe cases can sometimes lead to a critical lack of nutrients in your body. This is known as malnutrition, and can result in your body being unable to function normally or recover from wounds and infections.\n\n【9】If you have severe malnutrition, you may become fatigued, dizzy and confused. In children, malnutrition can cause stunted growth and delayed development.\n\n【10】Treatment for malnutrition can involve increasing the number of calories in your diet and taking supplements.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about treating malnutrition.</u>\n\n【11】Lactose intolerance\n-------------------\n\n【12】If you have untreated coeliac disease, you're more likely to also develop lactose intolerance, where your body lacks the enzyme needed to digest the natural sugar (lactose) found in dairy products. Lactose intolerance causes symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort.\n\n【13】Unlike gluten in coeliac disease, lactose does not damage your body. But you may get some gut-related symptoms when you eat foods containing lactose because you can't digest it properly.\n\n【14】Lactose intolerance usually gets better once you change to a gluten-free diet and your gut has recovered. Until it gets better, it can be effectively treated by not eating or drinking dairy products that contain lactose. You may also need to take calcium supplements – dairy products are an important source of calcium, so you'll need to compensate for not eating them.\n\n【15】Cancer\n------\n\n【16】Cancer is a very rare but serious complication of coeliac disease.\n\n【17】Someone with coeliac disease has a slightly increased risk of developing certain cancers. Recent research shows that this increased risk is less than previously thought.\n\n【18】Cancers associated with coeliac disease include small bowel cancer, small bowel lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. However, most people with coeliac disease will not develop any of these.\n\n【19】Once you've been following a gluten-free diet for some time, your risk of developing these types of cancer is the same as that of the general population.\n\n【20】Coeliac disease in pregnancy\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Poorly controlled coeliac disease in pregnancy can increase the risk of developing pregnancy-related complications, such as giving birth to a baby with a low birth weight.\n删除7：<u>Coeliac UK has more information and advice about coeliac disease and pregnancy.</u>\n\n【22】You can also read more about a healthy diet in pregnancy.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 31 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 31 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

You may need to try several types to find one that works for you.\n\n【12】Non-drowsy antihistamines are generally the best option, as they're less likely to make you feel sleepy. But types that make you feel sleepy may be better if your symptoms stop you sleeping.\n\n【13】Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're unsure which medicine to try as not all antihistamines are suitable for everyone.\n\n【14】How to take antihistamines\n--------------------------\n\n【15】Take your medicine as advised by the pharmacist or doctor, or as described in the leaflet that comes with it.\n\n【16】Before taking an antihistamine, you should know:\n\n【17】*   how to take it – including whether it needs to be taken with water or food, or how to use it correctly (if eyedrops or a nasal spray)\n*   how much to take (the dose) – this can vary depending on things such as your age and weight\n*   when to take it – including how many times a day you can take it and when to take it (some types should be taken before bedtime)\n*   how long to take it for – some types can be used for a long time, but some are only recommended for a few days\n*   what to do if you miss a dose or take too much (overdose)\n\n【18】The advice varies depending on the exact medicine you're taking. If you're not sure how to take your medicine, ask a pharmacist.\n\n【19】Side effects of antihistamines\n------------------------------\n\n【20】Like all medicines, antihistamines can cause side effects.\n\n【21】Side effects of antihistamines that make you drowsy can include:\n\n【22】*   sleepiness (drowsiness) and reduced co-ordination, reaction speed and judgement – do not drive or use machinery after taking these antihistamines\n*   dry mouth\n*   blurred vision\n*   difficulty peeing\n\n【23】Side effects of non-drowsy antihistamines can include:\n\n【24】*   headache\n*   dry mouth\n*   feeling sick\n*   drowsiness – although this is less common than with older types of antihistamines\n\n【25】Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects and advice about when to get medical help.\n\n【26】If you think your medicine has caused an unwanted side effect, you can report it through the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\n【27】Taking antihistamines with other medicines, food or alcohol\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Speak to a pharmacist or GP before taking antihistamines if you're already taking other medicines.\n\n【29】There may be a risk the medicines do not mix, which could stop either from working properly or increase the risk of side effects.\n\n【30】Examples of medicines that could cause problems if taken with antihistamines include some types of:\n\n【31】*   antidepressants\n*   stomach ulcer or indigestion medicines\n*   cough and cold remedies that also contain an antihistamine\n\n【32】Try not to drink alcohol while taking an antihistamine, particularly if it's a type that makes you drowsy, as it can increase the chances of it making you feel sleepy.\n\n【33】Food and other drinks do not affect most antihistamines, but check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to make sure.\n\n【34】Who can take antihistamines\n---------------------------\n\n【35】Most people can safely take antihistamines.\n\n【36】But speak to a pharmacist or GP for advice if you:\n\n【37】*   are pregnant or breastfeeding\n*   are looking for a medicine for a young child\n*   are an older person\n*   are taking other medicines \n*   have an underlying health condition, such as heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease or epilepsy\n\n【38】Some antihistamines may not be suitable in these cases. A pharmacist or doctor can recommend one that's best for you.\n\n【39】Loratadine is usually recommended if you need to take an antihistamine in pregnancy. Loratadine or cetirizine are usually OK to take while breastfeeding.\n\n【40】Always check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it's safe for you before taking it or giving it to your child.\n\n【41】How antihistamines work\n-----------------------\n\n【42】Antihistamines block the effects of a substance called histamine in your body.\n\n【43】Histamine is normally released when your body detects something harmful, such as an infection. It causes blood vessels to expand and the skin to swell, which helps protect the body.\n\n【44】But in people with allergies, the body mistakes something harmless – such as pollen, animal hair or house dust – for a threat and produces histamine. The histamine causes an allergic reaction with unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watering eyes, a running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.\n\n【45】Antihistamines help stop this happening if you take them before you come into contact with the substance you're allergic to. Or they can reduce the severity of symptoms if you take them afterwards.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about your medicine</u>\n---------------------------------\n\n【46】The leaflet that comes in the packet with your medicine will have detailed information about it, including how to take it and what side effects you might get.\n\n【47】If you no longer have the leaflet that came with your medicine, you can search for an online version of it using our medicines A to Z.\n\n【48】You may also find information on individual antihistamines on these websites:\n\n【49】*   Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA): patient information leaflets\n*   Electronic Medicines Compendium\n\n【50】<a>Community content from HealthUnlocked</a>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 May 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 May 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Many people do not realise they have it.\n\n【6】The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit your normal activities, although treatment can help keep the condition under control.\n\n【7】Symptoms of COPD\n----------------\n\n【8】The main symptoms of COPD are:\n\n【9】*   shortness of breath, particularly when you're active\n*   a persistent chesty cough with phlegm – some people may dismiss this as just a \"smoker's cough\"\n*   frequent chest infections\n*   persistent wheezing\n\n【10】Without treatment, the symptoms usually get progressively worse. There may also be periods when they get suddenly worse, known as a flare-up or exacerbation.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the symptoms of COPD.</u>\n\n【11】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【12】See a GP if you have persistent symptoms of COPD, particularly if you're over 35 and smoke or used to smoke.\n\n【13】Do not ignore the symptoms. If they're caused by COPD, it's best to start treatment as soon as possible, before your lungs become significantly damaged.\n\n【14】The GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you smoke or have smoked in the past. They can organise a breathing test to help diagnose COPD and rule out other lung conditions, such as asthma.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how COPD is diagnosed.</u>\n\n【15】Causes of COPD\n--------------\n\n【16】COPD happens when the lungs become inflamed, damaged and narrowed. The main cause is smoking, although the condition can sometimes affect people who have never smoked.\n\n【17】The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've smoked.\n\n【18】Some cases of COPD are caused by long-term exposure to harmful fumes or dust. Others are the result of a rare genetic problem that makes the lungs more vulnerable to damage.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the causes of COPD.</u>\n\n【19】Treatments for COPD\n-------------------\n\n【20】The damage to the lungs caused by COPD is permanent, but treatment can help slow down the progression of the condition.\n\n【21】Treatments include:\n\n【22】*   stopping smoking – if you have COPD and you smoke, this is the most important thing you can do\n*   inhalers and medicines – to help make breathing easier\n*   pulmonary rehabilitation – a specialised programme of exercise and education\n*   surgery or a lung transplant – although this is only an option for a very small number of people\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how COPD is treated and living with COPD.</u>\n\n【23】Outlook for COPD\n----------------\n\n【24】The outlook for COPD varies from person to person. The condition cannot be cured or reversed, but for many people, treatment can help keep it under control so it does not severely limit their daily activities.\n\n【25】But in some people, COPD may continue to get worse despite treatment, eventually having a significant impact on their quality of life and leading to life-threatening problems.\n\n【26】Information:\n\n【27】### Social care and support guide\n\n【28】If you:\n\n【29】*   need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\n*   care for someone regularly because they're ill, elderly or disabled – including family members\n\n【30】The social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support.\n\n【31】Preventing COPD\n---------------\n\n【32】COPD is largely a preventable condition. You can significantly reduce your chances of developing it if you avoid smoking.\n\n【33】If you already smoke, stopping can help prevent further damage to your lungs before it starts to cause troublesome symptoms.\n\n【34】If you think you need help to stop smoking, visit Quit smoking for free advice and support.\n\n【35】You may also want to talk to a GP about the stop smoking treatments available.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about stopping smoking and where to find a stop smoking service near you.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 11 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 11 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

They will also want to know about the progression of your symptoms. They might carry out a simple assessment of your balance, walking and co-ordination.\n\n【5】Your GP may also ask how much alcohol you drink and whether you're taking any form of medication. This is because excessive drinking and certain medications can cause ataxia-like symptoms in some people.\n\n【6】You may be referred for a series of tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as an infection. The tests will probably include blood and urine tests.\n\n【7】Further testing\n---------------\n\n【8】If your symptoms suggest you may have acquired ataxia because of a serious underlying condition, it's likely you'll be admitted immediately to your nearest hospital.\n\n【9】Otherwise, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in brain and nervous system conditions) for further testing or, in the case of children, a paediatrician. Some of the tests you may have are described in the following sections.\n\n【10】### Genetic testing\n\n【11】Genetic testing involves taking a sample of blood and testing the DNA in it for any genetic mutation known to cause ataxia.\n\n【12】Currently, tests can detect the mutations responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia and most of the spinocerebellar ataxias.\n\n【13】### Brain scans\n\n【14】Brain scans can be used to check for physical abnormalities in the brain that could be caused by certain types of hereditary ataxia. They can also be used to check for other problems that may affect your brain, such as a brain tumour.\n\n【15】The two most widely used brain imaging scans are:\n\n【16】*   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan – this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed scans of the soft tissue of the brain\n*   computerised tomography (CT) scan – where a series of X-rays are taken and assembled by a computer into a detailed 3-dimensional image of your brain\n\n【17】### Other tests\n\n【18】Some of the other tests you may have to help diagnose ataxia and determine how severe it is can include:\n\n【19】*   a lumbar puncture – where a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is taken from the base of the spine to check it for infection and any other abnormalities\n*   nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) – tests used to assess the electrical activity in nerves and muscles\n*   videofluoroscopy – a continuous moving X-ray taken while you swallow different types of food and drink\n*   an electrocardiogram (ECG) – an assessment of the electrical activity of the heart\n*   an echocardiogram – an ultrasound scan of the heart\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

People with HIV can pass the virus on more easily in the weeks following infection.\n\n【4】HIV treatment significantly reduces the risk of someone with HIV passing it on.\n\n【5】Sexual contact\n--------------\n\n【6】Most people diagnosed with HIV in the UK acquire the virus through unprotected vaginal or anal sex.\n\n【7】It may also be possible to catch HIV through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is much lower.\n\n【8】The risk is higher if:\n\n【9】*   the person giving oral sex has mouth ulcers, sores or bleeding gums\n*   the person receiving oral sex has recently been infected with HIV and has a lot of the virus in their body, or another sexually transmitted infection\n\n【10】Who's most at risk?\n-------------------\n\n【11】People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include:\n\n【12】*   people with a current or previous partner with HIV\n*   people with a current or previous partner who is from an area with high HIV rates\n*   people who are from an area with high HIV rates\n*   people who engage in chemsex (using drugs to help or enhance sex)\n*   men who have unprotected sex with men\n*   women who have unprotected sex with men who have sex with men\n*   people who inject drugs and share equipment\n*   people who have unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs and shared equipment\n*   people who share sex toys with someone infected with HIV\n*   people with a history of sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n*   people who have had multiple sexual partners\n*   people who have been raped\n*   people who have received a blood transfusion, transplant or other risk-prone procedures in countries that do not have strong screening for HIV\n*   healthcare workers who could accidentally prick themselves with an infected needle – but this risk is extremely low\n*   babies born from a parent with untreated HIV\n\n【13】How HIV is transmitted\n----------------------\n\n【14】HIV is not passed on easily from one person to another. The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses.\n\n【15】HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. To get HIV, 1 of these fluids from someone with HIV has to get into your blood.\n\n【16】The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are:\n\n【17】*   semen\n*   vaginal fluids, including menstrual blood\n*   breast milk\n*   blood\n*   lining inside the anus\n\n【18】Other body fluids, like saliva, sweat or urine, do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person.\n\n【19】The main ways the virus enters the bloodstream are: \n\n【20】*   by injecting into the bloodstream with needles or injecting equipment that's been shared with other people\n*   through the thin lining on or inside the anus, vagina and genitals\n*   through the thin lining of the mouth and eyes\n*   through cuts and sores in the skin\n\n【21】HIV is not passed on through:\n\n【22】*   spitting\n*   kissing\n*   being bitten\n*   contact with unbroken, healthy skin\n*   being sneezed on\n*   sharing baths, towels or cutlery\n*   using the same toilets or swimming pools\n*   mouth-to-mouth resuscitation\n*   contact with animals or insects like mosquitoes\n\n【23】How HIV infects the body\n------------------------\n\n【24】HIV infects the immune system, causing progressive damage and eventually making it unable to fight off infections.\n\n【25】The virus attaches itself to immune system cells called CD4 lymphocyte cells, which protect the body against various bacteria, viruses and other germs.\n\n【26】Once attached, it enters the CD4 cells and uses it to make thousands of copies of itself. These copies then leave the CD4 cells, killing them in the process.\n\n【27】This process continues until eventually the number of CD4 cells, also called your CD4 count, drops so low that your immune system stops working.\n\n【28】This process may take up to 10 years, during which time you'll feel and appear well. \n\n【29】Read about the symptoms of HIV\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 April 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Glutamate sends messages between nerve cells in the brain.\n\n【3】Nerve cells damaged by Alzheimer's disease make too much glutamate which can cause more damage. Memantine protects nerve cells by blocking the effects of too much glutamate.\n\n【4】How long does it take to work?\n\n【5】Memantine can take up to 3 months to begin working, but this will vary from person to person. You will get a follow-up appointment so your doctor can check how well the medicine is working.\n\n【6】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【7】There is no evidence that memantine will harm you if you take it for a long time.\n\n【8】How does memantine compare to other medicines for Alzheimer's disease?\n\n【9】There is another group of medicines for Alzheimer's disease called acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE inhibitors).\n\n【10】AChE inhibitors work in a different way to memantine. AChE inhibitors, such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, increase levels of acetylcholine, a substance in the brain that helps nerve cells communicate with each other.\n\n【11】AChE inhibitors are used for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer's disease and may also be continued in the later, severe, stages of the disease. Memantine is not thought to be very effective in mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【12】If someone is already taking an AChE inhibitor, taking it with memantine may be a more effective treatment. This may be because they work in different ways. The 2 medicines are safe to take together.\n\n【13】Memantine is prescribed for moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease if you cannot take an AChE inhibitor.\n\n【14】How well does memantine work for dementia?\n\n【15】Memantine does not work for everyone. It is not a cure for dementia and your symptoms may gradually get worse, even when you are taking it.\n\n【16】How each person responds to memantine will be different. Some people find it helps with their symptoms a lot. For others, it might seem like it's not working, but it could be preventing symptoms from getting worse.\n\n【17】It's not thought to help symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【18】In some people with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, it can help improve a range of symptoms affecting memory and coping with daily life like:\n\n【19】*   forgetting recent conversations and where you put things\n*   forgetting how to do things, like making a cup of tea\n*   thinking slowly, for example taking longer to reply to what someone says\n*   finding it more difficult to understand complicated things, like managing money\n*   delusions or feeling anxious or on edge\n*   being aggressive, for example lashing out at people or being nasty for no reason\n*   feeling like you do not want to do things\n\n【20】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【21】Some people feel sleepy or dizzy when taking memantine. If this happens to you, do not drive or ride a bike until you feel OK again.\n\n【22】If you've been diagnosed with dementia, you are legally required to inform the DVLA and your car insurance company promptly.\n\n【23】This does not necessarily mean you have to stop driving immediately. Some people with dementia prefer to give up driving because they find it stressful, but others continue driving for some time as long as it's safe for them to do so.\n\n【24】The DVLA will ask for medical reports and possibly a special driving assessment to decide whether you can continue driving.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about driving and dementia from the Alzheimer's Society.</u>\n\n【25】Can I drink alcohol while taking memantine?\n\n【26】It's usually best to avoid alcohol, or to cut back on your drinking, when taking memantine.\n\n【27】Drinking alcohol can make the symptoms of dementia worse. It can make you more forgetful or confused.\n\n【28】Is there any food or drink that I need to avoid?\n\n【29】You can eat and drink normally while taking memantine.\n\n【30】However, it's very important to tell your doctor if you have recently changed or intend to change your diet, such as switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet. This can affect the way your kidneys work and cause higher levels of memantine in your blood.\n\n【31】If you do change your diet, your dose may need to be changed.\n删除11：<u>More in Memantine\n-----------------\n\n【32】*   About memantine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking memantine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 August 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 August 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But you might start at a lower dose and increase to a maximum dose of 40mg a day.\n\n【4】If you are taking citalopram to prevent panic attacks, your starting dose will usually be 10mg once a day. If you're over 65 years old, or have liver problems, the maximum recommended dose is 20mg a day.\n\n【5】The usual dose of citalopram for children is 10mg a day, but this may be increased to 40mg a day.\n\n【6】With liquid drops of citalopram, taking 4 drops is the same as a 10mg tablet.\n\n【7】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【8】You’ll usually take citalopram once a day.

You take them using an inhaler or nebuliser.\n\n【14】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【15】Carbocisteine does not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【16】However, if taking carbocisteine makes you vomit or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.

Living with\n4.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**A colostomy is an operation to divert 1 end of the colon (part of the bowel) through an opening in the tummy.**\n\n【3】The opening is called a stoma. A pouch can be placed over the stoma to collect your poo (stools).\n\n【4】A colostomy can be permanent or temporary.\n\n【5】When a colostomy is needed\n--------------------------\n\n【6】A colostomy may be needed if you cannot pass stools through your anus. This could be the result of an illness, injury or problem with your digestive system.\n\n【7】You may have a colostomy to treat:\n\n【8】*   bowel cancer\n*   Crohn's disease\n*   diverticulitis\n*   anal cancer\n*   vaginal cancer or cervical cancer\n*   bowel incontinence\n*   Hirschsprung's disease\n\n【9】A colostomy is often used after a section of the colon has been removed and the bowel cannot be joined back together.\n\n【10】This may be temporary and followed by another operation to reverse the colostomy at a later date, or it may be permanent.\n删除7：<u>Read more about reversing a colostomy</u>\n\n【11】How a colostomy is carried out \n-------------------------------\n\n【12】A colostomy is carried out while you're asleep under general anaesthetic, using either:\n\n【13】*   **open surgery (laparotomy)** – where a long cut (incision) is made in the tummy to access the colon, or\n*   **laparoscopic (keyhole surgery)** – where the surgeon makes several smaller incisions and uses a tiny camera and surgical instruments to access the colon\n\n【14】Generally, keyhole surgery is the preferred option because recovery is quicker and the risk of complications is lower.\n\n【15】There are 2 main types of colostomy: a loop colostomy and an end colostomy. The specific technique used will depend on your circumstances. \n\n【16】A loop colostomy is often used if the colostomy is temporary as it's easier to reverse.\n\n【17】### Loop colostomy\n\n【18】In a loop colostomy, a loop of colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy. The loop is opened up and stitched to your skin to form an opening called a stoma.\n\n【19】The stoma has 2 openings that are close together. One is connected to the functioning part of your bowel, where waste leaves your body after the operation.\n\n【20】The other opening is connected to the inactive part of your bowel, leading to your anus.\n\n【21】In some cases, a support device (a rod or bridge) may be used to hold the loop of colon in place while it heals. It's usually removed after a few days.\n\n【22】### End colostomy\n\n【23】With an end colostomy, 1 end of the colon is pulled out through a cut in your tummy and stitched to the skin to create a stoma.\n\n【24】An end colostomy is often permanent. Temporary end colostomies are sometimes used in emergencies.\n\n【25】### The stoma\n\n【26】The position of the stoma will depend on the section of your colon that's diverted, but it's usually on the left-hand side of your tummy, below your waist.\n\n【27】If the operation is planned in advance, you'll meet a specialist stoma nurse to discuss the positioning of the stoma.\n\n【28】The stoma will be red and moist and may bleed slightly, particularly in the beginning – this is normal. It should not be painful as it does not have a nerve supply.\n\n【29】Recovering from a colostomy\n---------------------------\n\n【30】After having a colostomy, you'll need to recover in hospital for a few days.\n\n【31】You may have:\n\n【32】*   a drip in your vein to provide fluids\n*   a catheter to drain urine from your bladder\n*   an oxygen mask to help you breathe\n\n【33】A clear colostomy bag will be placed over the stoma so it can be easily monitored and drained. The first bag is often quite large – it'll usually be replaced with a smaller bag before you go home.\n\n【34】### Stoma nurse\n\n【35】While you recover in hospital, a stoma nurse will show you how to care for your stoma, including how to empty and change the bag.\n\n【36】The nurse will teach you how to keep your stoma and surrounding skin clean and free from irritation, and give you advice about preventing infection.\n\n【37】They'll also explain the different types of equipment available and how to get new supplies.\n\n【38】When you leave hospital, a local stoma nurse will visit you at home, or you may be asked to go to a stoma care clinic.\n\n【39】### Going home\n\n【40】Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3 to 10 days after having a colostomy.\n\n【41】Once home, avoid strenuous activities that could place a strain on your abdomen, such as lifting heavy objects.\n\n【42】Your stoma nurse will give you advice about how soon you can go back to normal activities.\n\n【43】At first you will pass wind through your stoma and then, usually within 2 or 3 days, you poo through it.\n\n【44】This should start to improve as your bowel recovers from the effects of the operation.\n\n【45】Living with a colostomy\n-----------------------\n\n【46】Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people get used to it in time.\n\n【47】Colostomy equipment is discreet and secure, and you should be able to do most of the activities you enjoyed before.\n\n【48】Your specialist stoma nurse will be able to give you further support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy.\n删除7：<u>Read more about living with a colostomy and complications of a colostomy.</u>\n\n【49】### Colostomy UK\n\n【50】Colostomy UK provides support, reassurance and practical advice to anyone who's had, or is about to have, stoma surgery.\n\n【51】Their website has information about products you may find useful, and also provides details of stoma support groups in your area.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 September 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 September 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Reversal</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【5】Constipation\n\n【6】Dihydrocodeine slows down your digestion and this can cause constipation. If you become constipated, try to include more high-fibre foods in your diet such as fruits, vegetables and cereals. Try to drink several glasses of water each day. If you can, it may also help to do some gentle exercise.\n\n【7】Ask your doctor about medicine to help prevent or treat constipation caused by dihydrocodeine.\n\n【8】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【9】Take dihydrocodeine with or just after a meal or snack to ease feelings of sickness. If you're being sick, try small frequent sips of water.\n\n【10】This side effect should wear off after a few days. Talk to a doctor about taking an anti-sickness medicine if it carries on for longer.\n\n【11】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the contraceptive pill packet for advice.\n\n【12】Feeling sleepy\n\n【13】This side effect should wear off within a week or two as your body gets used to dihydrocodeine. Talk to a doctor if it carries on for longer.\n\n【14】Confusion, feeling dizzy and vertigo (a sensation of spinning)\n\n【15】If dihydrocodeine makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so that you do not faint or fall, then sit until you feel better.\n\n【16】This side effect should wear off within a few days as your body gets used to dihydrocodeine. Talk to a doctor if it carries on for longer.\n\n【17】Dry mouth\n\n【18】Try chewing sugar-free gum or sucking sugar-free sweets. You can also buy or a doctor may prescribe an artificial saliva substitute to keep your mouth moist. This comes as a spray, gel or lozenge and can be bought from a pharmacy.\n\n【19】Headaches\n\n【20】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. It may be best not to drink alcohol while taking dihydrocodeine as this can make headaches worse. It's safe to take a painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【21】Talk to a doctor if headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【22】Speak to a doctor or pharmacist if the advice on how to cope does not help and a side effect is still bothering you or does not go away.\n\n【23】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【24】Serious side effects happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【25】Call a doctor or call 111 now if you:\n\n【26】*   get muscle stiffness\n*   feel dizzy, tired and have low energy – this could be a sign of low blood pressure (hypotension)\n\n【27】### Immediate action required: Call 999 if:\n\n【28】*   you have had a seizure or fit\n*   you have difficulty breathing or short shallow breathing\n\n【29】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【30】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to dihydrocodeine.\n\n【31】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【32】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【33】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【34】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【35】Long-term side effects\n----------------------\n\n【36】Some people with conditions that need long-term pain relief may need to take dihydrocodeine for a long time.\n\n【37】If you need to take it for a long time your body can become used to it (known as tolerance). That means you need higher doses to control your pain over time.\n\n【38】Some people can become more sensitive to pain (hyperalgesia). If this happens, your doctor will reduce your dose gradually to help these symptoms.\n\n【39】It's possible to become addicted to dihydrocodeine. For this reason, your dose will be reviewed to make sure you're only having the amount you need to control your pain.\n\n【40】Your treatment plan may include details of how and when you'll stop dihydrocodeine.\n\n【41】If you're having treatment for cancer pain or other severe pain, your pain control will be carefully monitored. Speak to your doctor if you're worried about tolerance, hyperalgesia or becoming addicted.\n\n【42】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【43】These are not all the side effects of dihydrocodeine.

These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.**\n\n【3】Weakened immune system\n----------------------\n\n【4】Having a weakened immune system is a common complication of AML.\n\n【5】Even if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medicines that are used to treat AML can temporarily weaken your immune system.\n\n【6】This means you're more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual.\n\n【7】Complications arising from infection are very common in people with AML. But if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.\n\n【8】You may be advised to:\n\n【9】*   take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections\n*   maintain good personal and dental hygiene\n*   avoid contact with anyone who's known to have an infection – even if it's a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles\n*   check with your GP to make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date – you will not be able to have any vaccine that contains \"live\" viruses or bacteria, such as the shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\n\n【10】Report any possible symptoms of an infection to your treatment unit immediately as prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.\n\n【11】Symptoms of an infection can include:\n\n【12】*   a sore throat\n*   a high temperature, and feeling hot or shivery (fever)\n*   flu-like symptoms, such as headaches, aching muscles and tiredness\n*   breathlessness or a cough\n*   pain when peeing\n\n【13】Bleeding\n--------\n\n【14】If you have AML, you might bleed and bruise more easily because of the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive.\n\n【15】People with advanced AML are more vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body.\n\n【16】Serious bleeding can occur:\n\n【17】*   inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as a severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion\n*   inside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, breathing difficulties and a bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\n*   inside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) – causing symptoms such as vomiting blood and passing poos that are very dark or tar-like in colour\n\n【18】All these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies.\n\n【19】Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.\n\n【20】Infertility\n-----------\n\n【21】Most treatments used to treat AML can cause infertility. This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.\n\n【22】People particularly at risk of permanent infertility are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n\n【23】Your treatment team can talk to you about the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and discuss any fertility options before you begin your treatment.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 04 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 04 October 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Although paracetamol is safe to take at any time in pregnancy, taking dihydrocodeine towards the end of pregnancy may cause your baby to have withdrawal symptoms, such as drowsiness, after they're born. Your baby may need extra time in hospital for observation.\n\n【4】It's important to treat pain in pregnancy. Co-dydramol might sometimes be the best option for pain during pregnancy, but speak to your doctor. They can help you decide what's right for you and your baby.\n\n【5】Co-dydramol and breastfeeding\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】If your doctor or midwife says your baby is healthy, it's usually OK to take co-dydramol while breastfeeding. However, only take it if your doctor advises you to. Try to take it in low doses and only use it for a short time.\n\n【7】It's usually better to take paracetamol on its own while breastfeeding.\n\n【8】Co-dydramol contains paracetamol and dihydrocodeine. Paracetamol gets into breast milk in small amounts. It's not known how much dihydrocodeine gets into breast milk, but it's also thought to be a small amount. It's unlikely that co-dydramol will cause any side effects in your baby.\n\n【9】Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, midwife, or health visitor if you have any concerns about your baby while you are breastfeeding. This includes if your baby:\n\n【10】*   is not feeding as well as usual\n*   has constipation\n\n【11】### Urgent advice: Call 111 for advice or go to A&E now if:\n\n【12】*   your baby is unusually sleepy\n*   your baby has breathing problems\n\n【13】However, these effects are very rare, and unlikely to happen, especially with low strength co-dydramol taken for a short time.\n\n【14】Co-dydramol and fertility\n-------------------------\n\n【15】Taking co-dydramol that contains higher levels of dihydrocodeine, for a long time, can make it more difficult for you to get pregnant or to make someone pregnant. This is because dihydrocodeine can cause hypogonadism (where the body stops making enough sex hormones).\n\n【16】When you stop taking co-dydramol, your sex hormones should go back to normal.\n\n【17】If you're worried about co-dydramol and your fertility, talk to your doctor.\n\n【18】Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【19】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n删除5：<u>Information:\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how pain relief such as co-dydramol can affect you and your baby on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPS) website</u></u>\n删除11：<u>More in Co-dydramol\n-------------------\n\n【20】*   About co-dydramol\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 August 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Risks</u>\n\n【2】**A heart transplant is a major operation and there's a risk of several complications.**\n\n【3】Some complications can occur soon after the procedure, while others may develop months or even years later.\n\n【4】The main risks associated with a heart transplant are described below.\n\n【5】Rejection\n---------\n\n【6】One of the most common complications of a heart transplant is rejection of the donor heart.\n\n【7】This is where the immune system recognises the transplanted heart as foreign and attacks it.\n\n【8】Rejection usually occurs in the days, weeks or months after the transplant, although it can sometimes happen years later.\n\n【9】Immunosuppressant medication can reduce the risk of this happening, but cannot always prevent it completely.\n\n【10】Symptoms of rejection can include:\n\n【11】*   chills and aches\n*   tiredness\n*   shortness of breath\n*   puffy, swollen ankles\n*   noticeable fast or irregular heartbeats (heart palpitations)\n*   a slightly raised temperature\n*   tummy (abdominal) pain\n\n【12】Contact your GP or transplant team as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\n\n【13】Rejection can usually be treated by increasing your dose of immunosuppressant medication.\n\n【14】Primary graft dysfunction\n-------------------------\n\n【15】One of the most serious complications that can occur soon after a heart transplant is that the donated heart fails and does not work properly.\n\n【16】One of the reasons this might happen is primary graft dysfunction.\n\n【17】You'll be closely monitored after your transplant to check for signs of primary graft dysfunction so treatment can be started as soon as possible.\n\n【18】Treatments for primary graft dysfunction may include using:\n\n【19】*   medication to support the new heart\n*   mechanical circulatory support – a machine that helps pump your blood for you and supports the new heart\n\n【20】Immunosuppressant side effects\n------------------------------\n\n【21】The immunosuppressant medication you need to take to prevent rejection can have a number of significant side effects.\n\n【22】These can include:\n\n【23】*   increased vulnerability to infections\n*   weight gain\n*   kidney problems\n*   high blood pressure\n*   diabetes\n*   weakened bones (osteoporosis)\n*   an increased risk of certain types of cancer, particularly skin cancer\n\n【24】Speak to your transplant team if you experience any troublesome side effects. Do not stop taking your medication without getting medical advice first.\n\n【25】Infections\n----------\n\n【26】Immunosuppressant medication will weaken your immune system and make you more vulnerable to infection.\n\n【27】While taking the medication, it's a good idea to:\n\n【28】*   report any possible symptoms of an infection to a GP or your transplant team immediately – things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles, diarrhoea or headaches\n*   ensure your vaccinations are up-to-date – speak to a GP or transplant team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some are not safe if you have a weak immune system\n*   avoid close contact with anyone who has an infection – even if it's an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox\n\n【29】To help prevent infection, you may be given antibiotics, antifungal medicine or antiviral medication to take for at least the first few weeks or months after your transplant.\n\n【30】Narrowed arteries\n-----------------\n\n【31】Narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels connected to the donor heart is a common long-term complication of a heart transplant.\n\n【32】The medical term for this complication is cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). It tends to occur within the first 10 years after the transplant operation.\n\n【33】CAV is potentially serious as it can restrict the supply of blood to the heart, which can sometimes trigger a heart attack or lead to a recurrence of heart failure.\n\n【34】To check for CAV, you may have a coronary angiography, a type of X-ray used to look at the blood vessels of the heart in more detail.\n\n【35】Medication can help keep CAV under control if it does develop, or some people may need to have another heart transplant.\n\n【36】More information\n----------------\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the risks of a heart transplant on the NHS Blood and Transplant website</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 April 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Living with</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The excess fluid puts pressure on the brain, which can damage it.**\n\n【3】If left untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal.\n\n【4】Symptoms of hydrocephalus\n-------------------------\n\n【5】The damage to the brain from hydrocephalus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:\n\n【6】*   headache\n*   being sick\n*   blurred vision\n*   difficulty walking\n\n【7】Different types of hydrocephalus can cause specific symptoms.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of hydrocephalus.</u>\n\n【8】Types of hydrocephalus\n----------------------\n\n【9】There are 3 main types of hydrocephalus:\n\n【10】*   **congenital hydrocephalus** – hydrocephalus that's present at birth\n*   **acquired hydrocephalus** – hydrocephalus that develops after birth\n*   **normal pressure hydrocephalus** – usually only develops in older people\n\n【11】### Hydrocephalus present from birth\n\n【12】Congenital hydrocephalus is when a baby is born with excess fluid in their brain.\n\n【13】It can be caused by a condition such as spina bifida, or an infection the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella (German measles).\n\n【14】Many babies born with hydrocephalus (congenital hydrocephalus) have permanent brain damage.\n\n【15】This can cause several long-term complications, such as:\n\n【16】*   learning disabilities\n*   speech problems\n*   memory problems\n*   short attention span\n*   problems with organisational skills\n*   vision problems, such as a squint and vision loss\n*   problems with physical coordination\n*   epilepsy\n\n【17】If your child has learning disabilities, they'll need extra support from their nursery or school to ensure their needs are being met.\n\n【18】### Hydrocephalus that develops in children or adults\n\n【19】Acquired hydrocephalus can affect children or adults. It usually develops after an illness or injury.\n\n【20】For example, it may happen after a serious head injury or as a complication of a medical condition, such as a brain tumour.\n\n【21】### Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)\n\n【22】Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is an uncommon and poorly understood condition that most often affects people over the age of 60.\n\n【23】It can sometimes develop after an injury or a stroke, but in most cases the cause is unknown.\n\n【24】Mobility problems, dementia and urinary incontinence are the main symptoms of NPH. But because these symptoms happen gradually and are similar to those of other, more common conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, NPH can be difficult to diagnose.\n\n【25】Diagnosing hydrocephalus\n------------------------\n\n【26】Brain scans, such as CT scans and MRI scans, can be used to diagnose congenital and acquired hydrocephalus.\n\n【27】A checklist is used to help diagnose NPH. For example, how you walk, your mental ability and symptoms that affect your bladder control will be assessed.\n\n【28】It's important to diagnose NPH correctly because, unlike Alzheimer’s disease, the symptoms can be relieved with treatment.\n删除7：<u>Read more about diagnosing hydrocephalus.</u>\n\n【29】Treating hydrocephalus\n----------------------\n\n【30】Hydrocephalus can usually be treated using a thin tube (shunt) that's surgically implanted in the brain and drains away the excess fluid.\n\n【31】An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) can sometimes be used as an alternative to shunt surgery.\n\n【32】During this procedure, a hole is made in the floor of the brain to allow the trapped fluid to escape to the surface, where it can be absorbed.\n删除7：<u>Read more about how hydrocephalus is treated.</u>\n\n【33】Complications after surgery\n---------------------------\n\n【34】The surgery used to treat hydrocephalus can sometimes cause complications. For example, a shunt can become blocked or infected.\n\n【35】Before having surgery, your surgeon should discuss the possible complications with you.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the complications of surgery for hydrocephalus.</u>\n\n【36】What causes hydrocephalus?\n--------------------------\n\n【37】In the past, hydrocephalus was referred to as \"water on the brain\". However, the brain is not surrounded by water but by a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n【38】CSF has 3 important functions:\n\n【39】*   it protects the brain from damage\n*   it removes waste products from the brain\n*   it provides the brain with the nutrients it needs to function properly\n\n【40】The brain constantly produces new CSF (about a pint a day), while old fluid is released from the brain and absorbed into the blood vessels.\n\n【41】But if this process is interrupted, the amount of CSF can quickly build up, cause pressure in the brain.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the causes of hydrocephalus.</u>\n\n【42】Help and support\n----------------\n\n【43】If you have a child with hydrocephalus, or if you've been diagnosed with the condition yourself, you may find it helpful to speak to other people affected by hydrocephalus.\n\n【44】Shine, the spina bifida and hydrocephalus charity, can provide you with the details of local support groups and organisations.\n\n【45】You can find and contact your regional Shine team or read about support for carers on the Shine website.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 February 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's used to treat the vaginal dryness and irritation that can happen during the menopause.\n\n【2】Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. It affects anyone who has periods.\n\n【3】The fall in the amount of oestrogen your body produces can cause symptoms. Using vaginal oestrogen can help dryness and irritation but it will not treat other symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes, mood swings or problems sleeping (insomnia).\n\n【4】Vaginal oestrogen comes as a tablet, pessary, cream, gel or ring that you insert into your vagina. Using oestrogen inside the vagina only is called local HRT.\n\n【5】Usually, if you take or use oestrogen you must also use a progestogen alongside it, to protect your womb. But with vaginal oestrogen, little of the medicine gets into the rest of your body, so you do not need to take progestogen.\n\n【6】If vaginal oestrogen is not enough to treat your symptoms, you can also use a higher dose of HRT.\n\n【7】Vaginal oestrogen is only available on prescription, except the brand Gina (vaginal tablets) which you can buy from a pharmacy.\n\n【8】Other brands of vaginal oestrogen include Vagifem and Vagirux vaginal tablets, Estring vaginal ring, Imvaggis pessaries, Blissel vaginal gel and Ovestin vaginal cream.\n\n【9】### Important: HRT shortages\n\n【10】Currently there are shortages of some types of HRT. If the medicine you've been prescribed is not available, a pharmacist or doctor will be able to advise you about using a different brand or type of HRT that is suitable for you.\n\n【11】Key facts\n---------\n\n【12】*   Vaginal oestrogen is a local HRT. This means it's only used to treat menopause symptoms such as vaginal dryness and irritation.\n*   Common early side effects include headache, abdominal or vaginal pain and bleeding but these normally improve in the first few months of treatment.\n*   It can take up to 3 months to work fully.\n*   Vaginal oestrogen does not have the same risks as other types of HRT, because the dose is low and little of the medicine gets into the rest of your body.\n删除11：<u>More in Vaginal oestrogen\n-------------------------\n\n【13】*   About vaginal oestrogen\n*   Who can and cannot use it\n*   How and when to use it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using vaginal oestrogen with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

You can request an assessment from the council to establish your needs.\n\n【2】The money in your personal budget can be paid to you, to help you make more decisions about how it's spent. This is known as a direct payment.\n\n【3】What is a personal budget?\n--------------------------\n\n【4】Your personal budget is the amount of money your local council will pay towards any social care and support you need.\n\n【5】The amount of money in your personal budget is decided by your local council after getting a needs assessment to work out:\n\n【6】*   what kind of care and support you need\n*   how much it will cost\n*   how much you're able to afford yourself\n\n【7】### Carers and personal budgets\n\n【8】If you're a carer, you may be entitled to receive a personal budget after having a carer's assessment to see what might help make your life easier.\n\n【9】A carer's assessment is free and anyone over 18 can ask for one.\n\n【10】Choosing how to receive your personal budget\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【11】You can ask the council to either:\n\n【12】*   manage your personal budget for you\n*   pay the money to another organisation – such as a care provider\n*   pay the money directly to you or someone you choose – this is known as a direct payment\n\n【13】You can also choose a combination of these options. For example, the council could arrange some of your care but send you the rest of the money. This is often called a mixed package or \"mix and match\".\n\n【14】### If the council manages your money\n\n【15】The money in your personal budget will be spent for you by the council. They will arrange all your care and support based on your agreed care plan.\n\n【16】They still need to check you're happy with the care they're arranging for you.\n\n【17】### If your money is paid to another organisation\n\n【18】The organisation you choose, such as your care provider, will speak to the council and arrange the payments.\n\n【19】Sometimes other organisations charge you extra money to arrange payments from the council.\n\n【20】The benefits of direct payments\n-------------------------------\n\n【21】Direct payments give you more flexibility over how your care and support is arranged and provided.\n\n【22】For example, you could choose to hire care workers or personal assistants who:\n\n【23】*   are always the same people and available when you need them\n*   speak the same language as you\n*   have experience working with your care needs\n*   are a specific person that has been recommended to you\n*   can help you get to shops or social events\n\n【24】There are many ways you could choose to use the money. It's your choice as long as you're spending your personal budget on things that meet your agreed care plan.\n\n【25】Most councils will ask for evidence of how you've spent your money every 3 months.\n\n【26】### When to consider other options\n\n【27】You may decide direct payments are not helpful if:\n\n【28】*   you're worried about managing money or the people you employ\n*   you spend a lot of time in hospital\n*   you would rather the council arranged your care\n\n【29】If you are not confident about keeping records or managing the people who care for you, your local council should be able to provide support.\n\n【30】You could also consider having someone else manage your direct payments, for example a friend or family member. You'll need to set up a trust for payments that are managed by someone else.\n删除7：<u>Read more about setting up a trust on the Money Helper website.</u>\n\n【31】How to apply for direct payments\n--------------------------------\n\n【32】You should be offered direct payments as an option after your needs assessment.\n\n【33】You can also ask your local council's social services department about direct payments.\n\n【34】Find your local social care services\n\n【35】How direct payments work\n------------------------\n\n【36】If you choose direct payments, the council will send you the money in your personal budget by either:\n\n【37】*   paying it directly into a bank, Post Office, building society or National Savings and Investments account\n*   sending you a pre-paid card\n\n【38】You can then choose how you spend the money on your own care and support, as long as it matches the care plan you've agreed with the council.\n\n【39】### Signing a direct payment agreement\n\n【40】The council might ask you to sign a document called a direct payment agreement. This says:\n\n【41】*   how the council want you to record your spending – for example, keeping receipts\n*   your responsibilities as an employer – if you're paying for a care worker\n\n【42】If you spend direct payments on something that isn't agreed in your care plan, the council could take the money back or end the direct payments.\n\n【43】### If you're struggling to manage your money\n\n【44】Ask your local council for advice or call Money Helper on 0800 138 7777.\n\n【45】### If you want someone else to receive the direct payment\n\n【46】You could speak to the council and agree for the money to be sent to someone who will spend it for you. For example:\n\n【47】*   a carer\n*   a friend or family member\n*   someone else who speaks up for you (an advocate)\n\n【48】You may need to write down how they will spend the money and which decisions they can make for you. This is known as a decision-making agreement.\n\n【49】Employing your own carer or personal assistant\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【50】If you decide to hire a carer or personal assistant yourself, it's important to know the responsibilities you'll have as an employer.\n\n【51】Although support from the council should be available, you may need to arrange:\n\n【52】*   background checks or references\n*   tax\n*   National Insurance\n*   pension contributions\n删除7：<u>Read more about employing someone to work in your home on GOV.UK.</u>\n\n【53】You can also read about getting a personal assistant on the Disability Rights UK website.\n\n【54】### If you don't want to become an employer\n\n【55】You could choose to hire care workers through an agency instead.

It's very unlikely to have been caused by anything you did or did not do during pregnancy.\n\n【21】In a few cases, cleft lip and palate is associated with:\n\n【22】*   the genes a child inherits from their parents (although most cases are a one-off)\n*   smoking in pregnancy or drinking alcohol while pregnant\n*   obesity during pregnancy\n*   a lack of folic acid during pregnancy\n*   taking certain medicines in early pregnancy, such as some anti-seizure medicines\n\n【23】In some cases, a cleft lip or palate can occur as part of a condition that causes a wider range of birth defects, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (sometimes called DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndrome) and Pierre Robin sequence.\n删除7：<u>The Cleft Lip and Palate Association has more information on Pierre Robin sequence</u>\n\n【24】Diagnosing cleft lip and palate\n-------------------------------\n\n【25】A cleft lip is usually picked up during the 20-week screening scan done when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant. Not all cleft lips will be obvious on this scan and it's very difficult to detect a cleft palate on an ultrasound scan.\n\n【26】If a cleft lip or palate does not show up on the scan, it's usually diagnosed immediately after birth or during the newborn physical examination done within 72 hours of birth.\n\n【27】When a cleft lip or palate is diagnosed, you'll be referred to a specialist NHS cleft team who will explain your child's condition, discuss the treatments they need and answer any questions you have.\n\n【28】You may also find it useful to contact a support group, such as the Cleft Lip and Palate Association, who can offer advice and put you in touch with parents in a similar situation.\n\n【29】Treatments for cleft lip and palate\n-----------------------------------\n\n【30】Cleft lip and cleft palate are treated at specialist NHS cleft centres.\n\n【31】Your child will usually have a long-term care plan that outlines the treatments and assessments they'll need as they grow up.\n\n【32】The main treatments are:\n\n【33】*   surgery – an operation to correct a cleft lip is usually done when your baby is 3 to 6 months and an operation to repair a cleft palate is usually done at 6 to 12 months\n*   feeding support – you may need advice about positioning your baby on your breast to help them feed, or you might need to feed them using a special type of bottle\n*   monitoring hearing – a baby born with cleft palate has a higher chance of glue ear, which may affect hearing. Close monitoring of their hearing is important and if glue ear affects their hearing significantly, a hearing aid may be fitted or small tubes called grommets may be placed in their ears to drain the fluid\n*   speech and language therapy – a speech and language therapist will monitor your child's speech and language development throughout their childhood and help with any speech and language problems\n*   good dental hygiene and orthodontic treatment – you'll be given advice about looking after your child's teeth, and they may need braces if their adult teeth don't come through properly\n删除7：<u>Read more about how cleft lip and palate is treated</u>\n\n【34】Outlook for cleft lip and palate\n--------------------------------\n\n【35】The majority of children treated for cleft lip or palate grow up to have completely normal lives.\n\n【36】Most affected children will not have any other serious medical problems and treatment can usually improve the appearance of the face and problems with feeding and speech.\n\n【37】Surgery to repair a cleft lip may leave a small pink scar above the lips. This will fade over time and become less noticeable as your child gets older.\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【38】Maos / Thinkstock https://www.istockphoto.com/gb/photo/baby-with-cleft-before-and-after-surgery-gm520421636-90969427</u>\n\n【39】Will a cleft lip and palate happen again?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【40】Most cases of cleft lip or palate are a one-off and it's unlikely you'll have another child with the condition.\n\n【41】The risk of having a child with a cleft lip or palate is slightly increased if you've had a child with the condition before, but the chances of this happening are thought to be around 2 to 8%.\n\n【42】If either you or your partner were born with a cleft lip or palate, your chance of having a baby with a cleft is also around 2 to 8%.\n\n【43】The chances of another child being born with a cleft or of a parent passing the condition to their child can be higher in cases related to a genetic condition.\n\n【44】For example, a parent with 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome) has a 1 in 2 chance of passing the condition to their child.\n\n【45】Information about your child\n----------------------------\n\n【46】If your child has a cleft lip or palate, your cleft team will pass information about them to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【47】This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

The most common type is called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Sleep apnoea needs to be treated because it can lead to more serious problems.**\n\n【2】Check if you have sleep apnoea\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Symptoms of sleep apnoea mainly happen while you sleep.\n\n【4】They include:\n\n【5】*   breathing stopping and starting\n*   making gasping, snorting or choking noises\n*   waking up a lot\n*   loud snoring\n\n【6】During the day, you may also:\n\n【7】*   feel very tired\n*   find it hard to concentrate\n*   have mood swings\n*   have a headache when you wake up\n\n【8】Information:\n\n【9】It can be hard to tell if you have sleep apnoea.

You'll be given this for free on the NHS if you need it.\n\n【27】### CPAP machine\n\n【28】A CPAP machine gently pumps air into a mask you wear over your mouth or nose while you sleep.\n\n【29】It can help:\n\n【30】*   improve your breathing while you sleep by stopping your airways getting too narrow\n*   improve the quality of your sleep and help you feel less tired\n*   reduce the risk of problems linked to sleep apnoea, such as high blood pressure\n\n【31】Using a CPAP machine may feel strange or awkward at first, but try to keep using it. It works best if you use it every night.\n\n【32】Tell your doctor if you find it uncomfortable or hard to use.\n\n【33】### Other treatments\n\n【34】Other treatments sometimes used for sleep apnoea include:\n\n【35】*   a gum shield-like device that holds your airways open while you sleep (mandibular advancement device)\n*   surgery to help your breathing, such as removing large tonsils\n\n【36】These treatments may not work as well as a CPAP machine.\n\n【37】Information:\n\n【38】### Find out more\n\n【39】*   Asthma + Lung UK: CPAP machines\n*   Asthma + Lung UK: treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea\n\n【40】Things you can do to help with sleep apnoea\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【41】If you've been diagnosed with sleep apnoea, there are some things you can do to help.\n\n【42】These may be all you need to do if your sleep apnoea is mild.\n\n【43】### Do\n\n【44】*   try to lose weight if you're overweight\n\n【45】*   exercise regularly – being active can improve your symptoms and help you keep to a healthy weight\n\n【46】*   have good sleep habits like making sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day\n\n【47】*   sleep on your side – try taping a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear, or buy a special pillow or bed wedge to help keep you on your side\n\n【48】### Don’t\n\n【49】*   do not smoke\n\n【50】*   do not drink too much alcohol – especially shortly before going to sleep\n\n【51】*   do not take sleeping pills unless recommended by a doctor – they can make sleep apnoea worse\n\n【52】Information:\n\n【53】### Find out more\n\n【54】*   Sleep Apnoea Trust: support groups\n*   British Snoring and Sleep Apnoea Association: travel advice for people with sleep apnoea\n\n【55】Sleep apnoea can cause other problems\n-------------------------------------\n\n【56】Without treatment, sleep apnoea can lead to other problems including:\n\n【57】*   high blood pressure\n*   a higher chance of having a stroke\n*   type 2 diabetes\n*   heart disease\n*   depression or mood changes\n*   a higher chance of having a serious accident caused by tiredness, such as a car accident\n*   difficulty concentrating at work or school\n\n【58】Sleep apnoea can also be difficult for your partner and put a strain on your relationship with them.\n\n【59】### Important: Driving and sleep apnoea\n\n【60】You may need to tell the DVLA about your sleep apnoea.\n\n【61】If sleep apnoea has been confirmed, you must not drive until your symptoms are under control.\n\n【62】Check the rules for driving if you have sleep apnoea on GOV.UK\n\n【63】Causes of sleep apnoea\n----------------------\n\n【64】Sleep apnoea happens if your airways become too narrow while you sleep.

But it usually clears up by weeks 16 to 20 of your pregnancy and does not put your baby at any increased risk.\n\n【4】There is a chance of developing a severe form of pregnancy sickness called hyperemesis gravidarum. This can be serious, and there's a chance you may not get enough fluids in your body (dehydration) or not get enough nutrients from your diet (malnourishment). You may need specialist treatment, sometimes in hospital.\n\n【5】Sometimes urinary tract infections (UTIs) can also cause nausea and vomiting. A UTI usually affects the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys.\n\n【6】Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife, GP or 111 if:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】you're vomiting and:\n\n【8】*   have very dark-coloured urine or have not had a pee in more than 8 hours\n*   are unable to keep food or fluids down for 24 hours\n*   feel severely weak, dizzy or faint when standing up\n*   have tummy (abdominal) pain\n*   have a high temperature\n*   vomit blood\n*   have lost weight\n\n【9】Treatments for morning sickness\n-------------------------------\n\n【10】Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast treatment that will work for everyone’s morning sickness. Every pregnancy will be different.\n\n【11】But there are some changes you can make to your diet and daily life to try to ease the symptoms.\n\n【12】If these do not work for you or you're having more severe symptoms, your doctor or midwife might recommend medicine.\n\n【13】### Things you can try yourself\n\n【14】If your morning sickness is not too bad, your GP or midwife will initially recommend you try some lifestyle changes:\n\n【15】*   get plenty of rest (tiredness can make nausea worse)\n*   avoid foods or smells that make you feel sick\n*   eat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before you get out of bed\n*   eat small, frequent meals of plain foods that are high in carbohydrate and low in fat (such as bread, rice, crackers and pasta)\n*   eat cold foods rather than hot ones if the smell of hot meals makes you feel sick\n*   drink plenty of fluids, such as water (sipping them little and often may help prevent vomiting)\n*   eat foods or drinks containing ginger – there's some evidence ginger may help reduce nausea and vomiting (check with your pharmacist before taking ginger supplements during pregnancy)\n*   try acupressure – there's some evidence that putting pressure on your wrist, using a special band or bracelet on your forearm, may help relieve the symptoms\n删除7：<u>Find out more about vitamins and supplements in pregnancy</u>\n\n【16】### Anti-sickness medicine\n\n【17】If your nausea and vomiting is severe and does not improve after trying the above lifestyle changes, your GP may recommend a short-term course of an anti-sickness medicine, called an antiemetic, that's safe to use in pregnancy.\n\n【18】Often this will be a type of antihistamine, which are usually used to treat allergies but also work as medicines to stop sickness (antiemetic).\n\n【19】Antiemetics will usually be given as tablets for you to swallow.\n\n【20】But if you cannot keep these down, your doctor may suggest an injection or a type of medicine that's inserted into your bottom (suppository).\n\n【21】See your GP if you'd like to talk about getting anti-sickness medication.\n\n【22】Risk factors for morning sickness\n---------------------------------\n\n【23】It's thought hormonal changes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy are probably one of the causes of morning sickness.\n\n【24】But you may be more at risk of it if:\n\n【25】*   you're having twins or more\n*   you had severe sickness and vomiting in a previous pregnancy\n*   you tend to get motion sickness (for example, car sick)\n*   you have a history of migraine headaches\n*   morning sickness runs in the family\n*   you used to feel sick when taking contraceptives containing oestrogen\n*   it's your first pregnancy\n*   you're obese (your BMI is 30 or more)\n*   you're experiencing stress\n\n【26】Visit the pregnancy sickness support site for tips for you and your partner on dealing with morning sickness.\n\n【27】Find maternity services near you\n\n【28】Sign up for pregnancy emails\n----------------------------\n\n【29】Sign up for Start4Life's weekly emails for expert advice, videos and tips on pregnancy, birth and beyond.\n删除3：<u>Video: how can I cope with morning sickness?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【30】In this video, a midwife gives advice on how to deal with morning sickness during your pregnancy.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 25 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 25 January 2026</u>\n\n【31】<a>Community content from HealthUnlocked</a>\n\n【32】</u>删除11：<u>More in Common symptoms in pregnancy\n------------------------------------\n\n【33】*   Common health problems in pregnancy\n*   Back pain in pregnancy\n*   Bleeding gums in pregnancy\n*   Headaches in pregnancy\n*   Indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy\n*   Leaking from your nipples\n*   Nosebleeds in pregnancy\n*   Pelvic pain in pregnancy\n*   Piles in pregnancy\n*   Stomach pain in pregnancy\n*   Stretch marks in pregnancy\n*   Swollen ankles, feet and fingers in pregnancy\n*   Tiredness and sleep problems\n*   Thrush\n*   Vaginal bleeding\n*   Vaginal discharge in pregnancy\n*   Vomiting and morning sickness\n*   Weight gain in pregnancy\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 April 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But it's important to get them checked by a GP.\n\n【13】This is because if they're caused by cancer, finding it early means treatment is more likely to be successful.\n\n【14】What happens at the GP appointment\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】The GP may ask to examine you.\n\n【16】You can ask for a female doctor when you book your appointment.\n\n【17】You'll be asked to undress from the waist down, behind a screen. You'll be given a sheet to put over you.\n\n【18】Then the GP may:\n\n【19】*   look at the outside of your vagina (vulva)\n*   feel inside your vagina with 2 fingers while pressing on your tummy (they will be wearing gloves)\n*   gently put a smooth, tube-shaped tool (a speculum) into your vagina so they can see your cervix\n*   take a small sample of cells from your cervix using a soft brush\n\n【20】It should not be painful, but you may find it uncomfortable. Talk to the GP if you're feeling uncomfortable.\n\n【21】You can have a friend, family member or other member of staff in the room with you during your exam if you want.\n\n【22】### Important\n\n【23】You are in control and can ask the doctor to stop at any time.\n\n【24】### Referral to a specialist\n\n【25】The GP or practice nurse may refer you for more tests or to see a specialist in hospital if they think you have a condition that needs to be investigated.\n\n【26】This may be an urgent referral, usually within 2 weeks, if you have certain symptoms.

This is because they may not always notice any symptoms.\n\n【4】Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can include:\n\n【5】*   peeing more than usual\n*   feeling thirsty all the time\n*   feeling very tired\n*   losing weight without trying to\n*   itching around your penis or vagina, or repeatedly getting thrush\n*   cuts or wounds taking longer to heal\n*   blurred vision\n\n【6】You're more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:\n\n【7】*   are over 40 years old, or over 25 if you're from an Asian, Black African or Black Caribbean ethnic background\n*   have a close relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother or sister)\n*   are overweight or living with obesity or are not very physically active\n*   are from an Asian, Black African or Black Caribbean ethnic background\n\n【8】The Know Your Risk tool from Diabetes UK can help you find out your risk.

Your baby will also need to be treated at the same time with their own medicine.\n\n【8】When using it on your breasts, wash it off your breasts or nipples, then wash your hands before feeding your baby. It's usually better to use cream rather than ointment when breastfeeding, as it's easier to wash off.\n\n【9】Creams and ointments containing nystatin may also contain other ingredients such as steroids, antibacterials and antiseptics.

Gender dysphoria clinics need to know the changes you want to make in your social role will improve your life and be sustainable over time, so that they can help you with this process.\n\n【22】As part of social transitioning, most gender dysphoria clinics recommend you change your name by deed poll. You can do this for free and then use it to change your name on your passport and other personal documents, at your bank, work and at the GP surgery.\n\n【23】Once the GP has a copy of your deed poll, they should contact Primary Care Support England to change your name on medical records and issue you with a new NHS number.\n\n【24】Non-binary identities are not officially recognised, but the GP can make a note of your chosen name and preferred pronouns.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 May 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 May 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Signs</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching. Children with black and brown skin may get round patches of eczema on their skin, or eczema where hair grows.\n\n【10】Inflamed skin can look red on white skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on brown or black skin. This can also be more difficult to see on brown and black skin.\n\n【11】Scratching can affect your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.\n\n【12】Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with black and brown skin. It's not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a \"footprint\" of old inflammation and eventually skin tone returns to its normal colour.\n\n【13】Signs of an infection\n---------------------\n\n【14】Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:\n\n【15】*   your eczema getting a lot worse\n*   fluid oozing from the skin\n*   a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\n*   the skin becoming swollen and sore\n*   feeling hot and shivery and generally unwell\n\n【16】See a doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.\n删除7：<u>Read more about infections and other complications of atopic eczema</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 November 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 November 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Atopic eczema</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is one of the most common forms of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked.**\n\n【3】Atopic eczema is the most common type of eczema in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.\n\n【4】It's usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older.\n\n【5】Symptoms of atopic eczema\n-------------------------\n\n【6】Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked and sore.\n\n【7】Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread inflamed skin all over the body.\n\n【8】Inflamed skin can look red on white skin, and darker brown, purple or grey on brown and black skin. This means it may also be more difficult to see on brown and black skin.\n\n【9】Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands in adults, and the inside of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. It may also affect the outside of elbows and front of knees in children with brown and black skin.\n\n【10】People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).\n\n【11】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【12】See a GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They'll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking:\n\n【13】*   whether the rash is itchy and where it appears\n*   when the symptoms first began\n*   whether it comes and goes over time\n*   whether there's a history of atopic eczema in your family\n*   whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma\n*   whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms\n\n【14】Typically, you or your child will be diagnosed with atopic eczema if you, or they, have an itchy skin condition and 3 or more of the following:\n\n【15】*   visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under, and children with brown and black skin) at the time of examination by a health professional\n*   a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above\n*   generally dry skin in the last 12 months (in children)\n*   a history of asthma or hay fever – children under 4 must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has 1 of these conditions\n*   if your child is 4 years old or older and the condition started before the age of 2\n\n【16】Causes of atopic eczema\n-----------------------\n\n【17】The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it is not down to one single thing.\n\n【18】Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies. \"Atopic\" means sensitivity to allergens.\n\n【19】It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.\n\n【20】The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. \n\n【21】Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.\n\n【22】You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.\n\n【23】Allergy tests are not usually needed, although they're sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms.\n\n【24】Treating atopic eczema\n----------------------\n\n【25】Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms, and the condition often improves over time.\n\n【26】But there's currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally.\n\n【27】There's also an increased risk of skin infections. \n\n【28】Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:\n\n【29】*   self-care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers\n*   emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin\n*   topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups\n\n【30】Other types of eczema\n---------------------\n\n【31】Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.\n\n【32】Other types of eczema include:\n\n【33】*   discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin\n*   contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance\n*   varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins\n*   seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp\n*   dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands and bottom (soles) of the feet\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 November 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 November 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Symptoms</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Call 999 immediately as you need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【22】Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n-----------------------\n\n【23】An electrocardiogram (ECG) can be used to confirm a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. An ECG is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart.\n删除7：<u>Read more about how atrial fibrillation is diagnosed</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 May 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 May 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Atrial fibrillation</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The prostaglandins cause swelling and sometimes a high temperature and they send pain signals to the brain. This is all part of your body's natural response to injury. The swelling and high temperature can help your body heal.\n\n【3】Aspirin stops your body making prostaglandins and this lowers the pain and reduces swelling and high temperature.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】You should start to feel better 20 to 30 minutes after taking aspirin.\n\n【6】What if aspirin does not work?\n\n【7】If aspirin does not work, there are other medicines that you can use to treat pain or swelling (inflammation), including:\n\n【8】*   ibuprofen\n*   paracetamol\n*   co-codamol (a combination of paracetamol and codeine)\n\n【9】Ibuprofen and painkillers like ibuprofen are sometimes available as creams or gels that you rub on to the part of your body that's painful.\n\n【10】Some painkillers are only available on prescription.\n\n【11】If aspirin does not work for you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about other treatment options that might be more suitable. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller or recommend another treatment, such as exercise or physiotherapy.\n\n【12】Are there any long term side effects?\n\n【13】It's best to take the lowest dose that works for you for the shortest amount of time you can. That way there's less chance that you'll get unwanted side effects like stomach ache.\n\n【14】How does aspirin compare with paracetamol or ibuprofen?\n\n【15】Aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol are all effective painkillers. Aspirin may be better than paracetamol for period pain or migraines although if you have heavy periods, it can make them heavier. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are considered better than paracetamol for back pain.\n\n【16】Paracetamol is typically used for mild or moderate pain. It may be better than aspirin for headaches, toothache, sprains and stomach ache.\n\n【17】Ibuprofen works in a similar way to aspirin. It can be used for back pain, strains and sprains, as well as pain from arthritis. Like aspirin, it is also good for toothache and period pain.\n\n【18】Why do some brands of aspirin contain caffeine?\n\n【19】Caffeine is added to some of the painkillers you can buy from pharmacies.\n\n【20】Research shows that caffeine (the amount you would get in a mug of coffee) may make painkillers work better for some people who are in a lot of pain.\n\n【21】There's caffeine as well as aspirin in these brands:\n\n【22】*   Anadin Original (aspirin and caffeine)\n*   Anadin Extra (aspirin, caffeine and paracetamol)\n*   Beechams Powders (aspirin and caffeine)\n\n【23】Does aspirin cause stomach ulcers?\n\n【24】Aspirin can cause ulcers in your stomach or gut, especially if you take it for a long time or in big doses.\n\n【25】Your doctor may tell you not to take aspirin if you have a stomach ulcer, or if you've had one in the past.\n\n【26】If you're at risk of getting a stomach ulcer and you need a painkiller, take paracetamol instead of aspirin as it's gentler on your stomach.\n\n【27】Can aspirin prevent cancer?\n\n【28】Recent research suggests that aspirin could help to prevent certain types of cancer, for example bowel cancer.\n\n【29】However, do not take aspirin without discussing it with your doctor. Aspirin can cause serious side effects, such as bleeding and not everyone can take it.\n\n【30】Speak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking aspirin if you're at risk of getting cancer.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Aspirin does not affect any contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【33】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【34】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking aspirin. However, drinking too much alcohol while you're taking aspirin can irritate your stomach.\n\n【35】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【36】No, you can eat and drink normally while taking aspirin.\n删除11：<u>More in Aspirin for pain relief\n-------------------------------\n\n【37】*   About aspirin for pain\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking aspirin with other medicines\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**A number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD).**\n\n【3】Portal hypertension and varices\n-------------------------------\n\n【4】Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis. \n\n【5】It occurs when the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level.\n\n【6】When the liver becomes severely scarred, it's harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines.\n\n【7】The blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by using smaller blood vessels.\n\n【8】But these vessels are not designed to carry the weight of blood, so they can become stretched out and weakened. These weakened blood vessels are known as varices.\n\n【9】If the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the walls of the varices to split and bleed.\n\n【10】This can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to anaemia.\n\n【11】Alternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.\n\n【12】Split varices can be treated by using an endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.\n\n【13】Ascites\n-------\n\n【14】A person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites.\n\n【15】Initially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained.\n\n【16】This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic.\n\n【17】One of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).\n\n【18】This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.\n\n【19】Hepatic encephalopathy\n----------------------\n\n【20】One of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood.\n\n【21】If the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the blood increase.\n\n【22】A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n【23】Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:\n\n【24】*   agitation\n*   confusion\n*   disorientation\n*   muscle stiffness\n*   muscle tremors\n*   difficulty speaking\n*   in very serious cases, a coma\n\n【25】Hepatic encephalopathy may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medicine is used to remove toxins from the blood.\n\n【26】Infection\n---------\n\n【27】Damage to the liver can weaken the immune system.\n\n【28】This can make the body more vulnerable to infection, particularly urinary infections and respiratory infections (such as pneumonia).\n\n【29】Liver cancer\n------------\n\n【30】Liver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing liver cancer.\n\n【31】Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse.\n\n【32】It's estimated 3% to 5% of people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer every year.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 September 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 September 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Some of these may be noticeable at an early age, while others may only become obvious as your child gets older**.\n\n【3】Problems in infants\n-------------------\n\n【4】Delays in reaching normal developmental milestones can be an early sign of DCD in young children. For example, your child may take slightly longer than expected to roll over, sit, crawl or walk.\n\n【5】You may also notice that your child:\n\n【6】*   shows unusual body positions (postures) during their 1st year\n*   has difficulty playing with toys that involve good co-ordination, such as stacking bricks\n*   has some difficulty learning to eat with cutlery\n\n【7】These signs might come and go.\n\n【8】Problems in older children\n--------------------------\n\n【9】As your child gets older, they may develop more noticeable physical difficulties, plus problems in other areas.\n\n【10】### Movement and co-ordination problems\n\n【11】Problems with movement and co-ordination are the main symptoms of DCD.\n\n【12】Children may have difficulty with:\n\n【13】*   playground activities such as hopping, jumping, running, and catching or kicking a ball. They often avoid joining in because of their lack of co-ordination and may find physical education difficult\n*   walking up and down stairs\n*   writing, drawing and using scissors – their handwriting and drawings may appear scribbled and less developed compared to other children their age\n*   getting dressed, doing up buttons and tying shoelaces\n*   keeping still – they may swing or move their arms and legs a lot\n\n【14】A child with DCD may appear awkward and clumsy as they may bump into objects, drop things and fall over a lot.\n\n【15】But this in itself isn't necessarily a sign of DCD, as many children who appear clumsy actually have all the normal movement (motor) skills for their age.\n\n【16】Some children with DCD may also become less fit than other children as their poor performance in sport may result in them being reluctant to exercise.\n\n【17】### Additional problems\n\n【18】As well as difficulties related to movement and co-ordination, children with DCD can also have other problems such as:\n\n【19】*   difficulty concentrating – they may have a poor attention span and find it difficult to focus on 1 thing for more than a few minutes\n*   difficulty following instructions and copying information – they may do better at school in a 1-to-1 situation than in a group, so they can be guided through work\n*   being poor at organising themselves and getting things done\n*   being slow to pick up new skills  – they need encouragement and repetition to help them learn\n*   difficulty making friends – they may avoid taking part in team games and may be bullied for being \"different\" or clumsy\n*   behaviour problems – often stemming from a child's frustration with their symptoms\n*   low self-esteem\n\n【20】Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【21】Children with DCD may also have other conditions, such as:\n\n【22】*   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness\n*   dyslexia – a common learning difficulty that mainly affects the way people read and spell words\n*   autism – a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour\n\n【23】Some children with DCD have difficulty co-ordinating the movements required to produce clear speech.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 March 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 March 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Developmental co-ordination disorder (dyspraxia) in children</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Lumbar decompression surgery is a type of surgery used to treat compressed nerves in the lower (lumbar) spine.**\n\n【3】It's only recommended when non-surgical treatments haven't helped. \n\n【4】The surgery aims to improve symptoms such as persistent pain and numbness in the legs caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine.\n\n【5】Lumbar decompression surgery is used to treat:\n\n【6】*   **spinal stenosis** – narrowing of a section of the spinal column, which puts pressure on the nerves inside\n*   **a** **slipped disc** and **sciatica** – where a damaged spinal disc presses down on an underlying nerve\n*   **spinal injuries** – such as a fracture or the swelling of tissue\n*   **metastatic spinal cord compression** – where cancer in one part of the body, such as the lungs, spreads into the spine and presses on the spinal cord or nerves\n\n【7】What happens during lumbar decompression surgery\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】If lumbar decompression surgery is recommended, you'll usually have at least 1 of the following procedures:\n\n【9】*   **laminectomy** – where a section of bone is removed from 1 of your vertebrae (spinal bones) to relieve pressure on the affected nerve\n*   **discectomy** – where a section of a damaged disc is removed to relieve pressure on a nerve\n*   **spinal fusion** – where 2 or more vertebrae are joined together with a section of bone to stabilise and strengthen the spine\n\n【10】In many cases, a combination of these techniques may be used.\n\n【11】Lumbar decompression is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain as it's carried out. The whole operation usually takes at least an hour, but may take much longer, depending on the complexity of the procedure.\n\n【12】Recovering from lumbar decompression surgery\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【13】You'll usually be well enough to leave hospital about 1 to 4 days after having surgery, depending on the complexity of the surgery and your level of mobility before the operation.\n\n【14】Most people are able to walk unassisted within a day of having the operation, although more strenuous activities will need to be avoided for about 6 weeks.\n\n【15】You may be able to return to work after about 4 to 6 weeks, although you may need more time off if your job involves driving for long periods or lifting heavy objects.\n\n【16】Effectiveness of lumbar decompression surgery\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【17】There's good evidence that decompression surgery can be an effective treatment for people with severe pain caused by compressed nerves. \n\n【18】Many people who have the operation experience a significant improvement in pain. People who found walking difficult before surgery because of leg pain or weakness are often able to walk further and more easily after the operation.\n\n【19】Risks of lumbar decompression surgery\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Although lumbar decompression is often successful, like all types of surgery it carries a risk of complications.\n\n【21】Complications associated with lumbar decompression surgery include:\n\n【22】*   infection at the site of the operation, or in rare cases an infection elsewhere\n*   a blood clot developing in 1 of your leg veins, known as DVT (deep vein thrombosis); in rare cases, the clot can dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a serious problem called a pulmonary embolism\n*   damage to the spinal nerves or cord – resulting in continuing symptoms, numbness or weakness in 1 or both legs, or in rare cases some degree of paralysis\n\n【23】Surgery tends to be safer if you do not smoke, have good general fitness and lose weight if needed.\n\n【24】The spine and spinal cord\n-------------------------\n\n【25】The spine is made up of 33 segments, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of each other to form the spinal column. In between each vertebra are protective, circular pads of tissue called discs, which cushion the vertebrae during activities such as walking and running.\n\n【26】The spinal canal runs through the centre of the spinal column. It contains and protects the spinal cord and nerves.\n删除3：<u>Video: lumbar surgery\n---------------------\n\n【27】In this video, an expert talks about what happens during lumbar surgery.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 12 January 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 12 January 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 28 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 28 April 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : When it's used</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It also comes as slow-release tablets containing 100mg of thiamine and as a liquid containing 100mg in 5ml.\n\n【5】Your dose depends on why you need thiamine and whether it's been prescribed by a doctor.\n\n【6】### Mild thiamine deficiency\n\n【7】The usual dose for adults is between 25mg and 100mg, taken once a day.\n\n【8】### Severe thiamine deficiency\n\n【9】The usual dose for adults is 100mg, taken 2 or 3 times a day.\n\n【10】### Dose for children\n\n【11】If your child is prescribed thiamine, the doctor will use your child's weight to work out the right dose.\n\n【12】Changes to your dose\n--------------------\n\n【13】For treating a vitamin B1 deficiency, your dose will usually stay the same until your levels are back to normal and your symptoms improve.\n\n【14】Once your levels are OK, your doctor will probably put you on a lower dose to make sure you do not become deficient again.\n\n【15】How to take it\n--------------\n\n【16】You can take thiamine with or without food.\n\n【17】Swallow the tablet whole with a drink of water. If you find tablets difficult to take, break the tablet in half using the line down the middle. Take both halves separately.\n\n【18】How long to take it for\n-----------------------\n\n【19】If a doctor has prescribed thiamine to treat a vitamin B1 deficiency, you need to keep taking it until your levels have increased to normal again and your symptoms are better.\n\n【20】Many people who become deficient in vitamin B1 cannot absorb enough of the vitamin from their normal diet. They may need to continue taking a low dose of thiamine for a long time to prevent them from becoming deficient again.\n\n【21】The doctor will advise you on how much to take and how long for.\n\n【22】Speak to your doctor if you've been prescribed thiamine and you want to stop taking it for any reason.\n\n【23】If you forget to take it\n------------------------\n\n【24】Missing 1 or 2 doses will probably not matter too much. But if you have a vitamin deficiency and you keep forgetting to take your thiamine, ask a doctor for advice.\n\n【25】If you forget to take your thiamine, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case skip the missed dose and just take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【26】Do not take 2 doses to make up for a forgotten one.\n\n【27】If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask a pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【28】If you take too much\n--------------------\n\n【29】Thiamine is generally a very safe medicine. Taking too much is unlikely to harm you or your child.\n\n【30】If you're worried, speak to a pharmacist or doctor.\n删除11：<u>More in Thiamine (vitamin B1)\n-----------------------------\n\n【31】*   About thiamine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 9 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 9 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But it's important to get the symptoms checked by a GP.\n\n【13】Do not wait to contact a GP. This is because if they're caused by cancer, finding it early can mean it's easier to treat.\n\n【14】What happens at the GP appointment\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】You will be asked some questions about your health, family medical history, medical conditions and your symptoms.\n\n【16】Tell the GP if you or your family have any history of cancer or Lynch syndrome.\n\n【17】You may be asked to be examined, you can ask for a female doctor or nurse.\n\n【18】You'll be asked to undress from the waist down, behind a screen. You'll be given a sheet to put over you.\n\n【19】Then the GP may:\n\n【20】*   feel inside your vagina with 2 fingers while pressing on your tummy (they will be wearing gloves)\n*   feel inside your bottom\n*   gently put a smooth, tube-shaped tool (a speculum) into your vagina to check your cervix, like they do during cervical screening\n\n【21】The GP may ask to check inside your vagina like they do during a cervical screening.\n\n【22】They may also ask to check your tummy area and inside your bottom to feel for any lumps or changes in size or shape.\n\n【23】Before starting these checks, they should explain what will happen during them and answer any questions you have.\n\n【24】### Referral to a specialist\n\n【25】The GP may refer you for more tests or to see a specialist in hospital if they think you have a condition that needs to be investigated.\n\n【26】This may be an urgent referral, usually within 2 weeks, if you have certain symptoms.

Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice.\n\n【3】Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service.\n\n【4】Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\n----------------------------------\n\n【5】The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine.\n\n【6】NRT is a medicine that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke.\n\n【7】It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking.\n\n【8】### Where to get it and how to use it\n\n【9】NRT can be bought from pharmacies and some shops. It's also available on prescription from a doctor or NHS stop smoking service.\n\n【10】It's available as:\n\n【11】*   skin patches\n*   chewing gum\n*   inhalators (which look like plastic cigarettes)\n*   tablets, oral strips and lozenges\n*   nasal and mouth spray\n\n【12】Patches release nicotine slowly. Some are worn all the time and some should be taken off at night. Inhalators, gum and sprays act more quickly and may be better for helping with cravings.\n\n【13】There's no evidence that any single type of NRT is more effective than another. But there is good evidence to show that using a combination of NRT is more effective than using a single product.\n\n【14】Often the best way to use NRT is to combine a patch with a faster acting form such as gum, inhalator or nasal spray.\n\n【15】Treatment with NRT usually lasts 8-12 weeks, before you gradually reduce the dose and eventually stop.\n\n【16】### Who can use it\n\n【17】Most people are able to use NRT, including:\n\n【18】*   adults and children over 12 years of age – although children under 18 should not use the lozenges without getting medical advice first\n*   pregnant women – your doctor may suggest NRT if they think it would help you quit; read more about stopping smoking in pregnancy\n*   breastfeeding women – your doctor can advise you how to do this safely\n\n【19】Always read the packet or leaflet before using NRT to check whether it's suitable for you.\n\n【20】Sometimes it may be advisable to get medical advice first, for example if you have kidney or liver problems, or you've recently had a heart attack or stroke.\n\n【21】### Possible side effects\n\n【22】Side effects of NRT can include:\n\n【23】*   skin irritation when using patches\n*   irritation of nose, throat or eyes when using a nasal spray\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia), sometimes with vivid dreams\n*   an upset stomach\n*   dizziness\n*   headaches\n\n【24】Any side effects are usually mild. But if they're particularly troublesome, contact your GP as the dose or type of NRT may need to be changed.\n\n【25】Varenicline (Champix)\n---------------------\n\n【26】Varenicline (brand name Champix) is not currently available. It has been withdrawn as a precaution because of an impurity found in the medicine. It's not yet known whether it will be available again in future.\n\n【27】Varenicline is a medicine that works in 2 ways. It reduces cravings for nicotine like NRT, but it also blocks the rewarding and reinforcing effects of smoking. It was only available on prescription.\n\n【28】Speak to your GP or NHS stop smoking adviser who will be able to recommend an alternative treatment.\n\n【29】Bupropion (Zyban)\n-----------------\n\n【30】Bupropion (brand name Zyban) is a medicine originally used to treat depression, but it has since been found to help people quit smoking.\n\n【31】It's not clear exactly how it works, but it's thought to have an effect on the parts of the brain involved in addictive behaviour.\n\n【32】### Where to get it and how to use it\n\n【33】Bupropion is only available on prescription, so you'll usually need to see your GP or contact an NHS stop smoking service to get it.\n\n【34】It's taken as 1 to 2 tablets a day. You should start taking it a week or 2 before you try to quit.\n\n【35】A course of treatment usually lasts around 7 to 9 weeks.\n\n【36】### Who can take it\n\n【37】Most people can take bupropion, but there are some situations when it's not recommended. For example, it's not suitable if you:\n\n【38】*   are under 18 years old\n*   are pregnant or breastfeeding\n*   have epilepsy, bipolar disorder or an eating disorder\n\n【39】### Possible side effects\n\n【40】Side effects of bupropion can include:\n\n【41】*   dry mouth\n*   difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n*   headaches\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   constipation\n*   difficulty concentrating\n*   dizziness\n\n【42】Speak to your GP if you have any problems with side effects.\n\n【43】#### Serotonin syndrome\n\n【44】Serotonin syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially serious, set of side effects linked to some medicines. It happens when the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain become too high.\n\n【45】There's a risk of serotonin syndrome if you take more than your prescribed dose of bupropion, or if you take certain other medicines with bupropion such as:\n\n【46】*   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n*   serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n【47】Contact your GP or NHS 111 if you have any symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including:\n\n【48】*   feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   increased heart rate\n*   feeling agitated\n\n【49】You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.\n\n【50】E-cigarettes\n------------\n\n【51】An e-cigarette is an electronic device that delivers nicotine in a vapour. This allows you to inhale nicotine without most of the harmful effects of smoking, as the vapour contains no tar or carbon monoxide.\n\n【52】Research has found that e-cigarettes can help you give up smoking, so you may want to try them rather than the medicines listed above. As with other approaches, they're most effective if used with support from an NHS stop smoking service.\n\n【53】There are no e-cigarettes currently available on prescription.\n\n【54】For now, if you want to use an e-cigarette to help you quit, you'll have to buy one. Costs of e-cigarettes can vary, but generally they're much cheaper than cigarettes.\n删除7：<u>Read more about using e-cigarettes to stop smoking</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 November 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 November 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Stress is just one factor that can affect fertility.\n\n【12】Questions your doctor may ask\n-----------------------------\n\n【13】The GP will ask you about your medical and sexual history.\n\n【14】### Previous pregnancies and children\n\n【15】If you're a woman, the GP will discuss any previous births and any complications with previous pregnancies.\n\n【16】They'll also ask about any miscarriages you've had.\n\n【17】If you're a man, you'll be asked whether you've had any children from previous relationships.\n\n【18】### Length of time trying to conceive\n\n【19】The GP will ask how long you've been trying to conceive.\n\n【20】More than 8 out of 10 couples, where the woman is under 40, will conceive within 1 year if they have regular unprotected sex (every 2 to 3 days).\n\n【21】Of those who do not conceive in the first year, about half will conceive in the second year.\n\n【22】If you're under 40 and have not been trying for a baby for very long, you may be advised to keep trying for a little longer.\n\n【23】### Sex\n\n【24】You'll be asked how often you have sex and whether you have any difficulties during sex.\n\n【25】You may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed discussing your sex life with the GP, but it's best to be open and honest.\n\n【26】If the fertility problem is related to sex, it might be overcome easily.\n\n【27】### Length of time since stopping contraception\n\n【28】You'll be asked about the type of contraception you previously used and when you stopped using it.\n\n【29】It can sometimes take a while for some types of contraception to stop working and this may be affecting your fertility.\n\n【30】### Medical history and symptoms\n\n【31】The GP will discuss any medical conditions you have or had in the past, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n【32】If you're a woman, the GP may ask if you have regular periods and whether you experience any bleeding between periods or after sex.\n\n【33】### Medicine\n\n【34】Some medicines can affect your fertility. The GP will ask you about any medicine you're taking and might discuss alternative treatments with you.\n\n【35】You should mention any non-prescription medicine you're taking, including herbal remedies and supplements.\n\n【36】### Lifestyle\n\n【37】Several lifestyle factors can affect your fertility. The GP will want to know:\n\n【38】*   if you smoke\n*   how much you weigh\n*   how much alcohol you drink\n*   whether you take any illegal drugs\n*   if you're stressed\n\n【39】They may recommend making changes to your lifestyle to increase your chances of conceiving.\n删除7：<u>Read more about:</u>\n\n【40】*   Trying to get pregnant\n*   How can I improve my chances of becoming a dad?\n\n【41】After asking you questions, the GP may do a physical examination or refer you for tests.\n\n【42】Physical examination\n--------------------\n\n【43】If you are female, the GP may:\n\n【44】*   weigh you to see if you have a healthy body mass index (BMI)\n*   examine your pelvic area to check for infection, lumps or tenderness, which could be a sign of fibroids, ovarian tumours, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – see causes of infertility\n\n【45】If you are male, the GP may check your:\n\n【46】*   testicles to look for any lumps or deformities\n*   penis to look at its shape, structure and any obvious abnormalities\n\n【47】After a physical examination, you may be referred to a specialist infertility team at an NHS hospital or fertility clinic for further tests.\n\n【48】Fertility tests for women\n-------------------------\n\n【49】Tests to find out the cause of infertility in women include:\n\n【50】### Blood tests\n\n【51】Samples of your blood can be tested for a hormone called progesterone to check whether you're ovulating.\n\n【52】The timing of the test is based on how regular your periods are.\n\n【53】If you have irregular periods, you'll be offered a test to measure hormones called gonadotrophins, which stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs.\n\n【54】### Chlamydia test\n\n【55】Chlamydia is an STI that can affect fertility. A swab – similar to a cotton bud, but smaller, soft and rounded – is used to collect some cells from your cervix to test for chlamydia.\n\n【56】A urine test may be used as an alternative.\n\n【57】You'll be prescribed antibiotics if you have chlamydia.\n\n【58】### Ultrasound scan\n\n【59】An ultrasound scan can be used to check your ovaries, womb (uterus) and fallopian tubes. Certain conditions that can affect the womb, such as endometriosis and fibroids, can prevent pregnancy. \n\n【60】A scan can also be used to look for signs that your fallopian tubes (the tubes that connect the ovaries and the womb) may be blocked, which may be stopping eggs from travelling along the tubes and into the womb. \n\n【61】If the ultrasound suggests a possible blockage, your doctor will refer you to a specialist to discuss further checks, such as a laparoscopy.\n\n【62】During a transvaginal ultrasound scan, an ultrasound probe is placed in your vagina. The scan can be used to check the health of your womb and ovaries and for any blockages in your fallopian tubes.\n\n【63】A hysterosalpingo-contrast-ultrasonography is a special type of ultrasound scan sometimes used to check the fallopian tubes.\n\n【64】A small amount of fluid is injected into your womb through a tube put into the neck of your womb (the cervix). \n\n【65】Ultrasound is used to look at the fluid as it passes through the fallopian tubes to check for any blockages or abnormalities.\n\n【66】If the test suggests a possible blockage, your doctor will refer you to a specialist to discuss further checks, such as laparoscopy.\n\n【67】### X-ray\n\n【68】A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of your womb and fallopian tubes after a special dye has been injected.\n\n【69】It can be used to find blockages in your fallopian tubes, which may be stopping eggs travelling along the tubes and into your womb.\n\n【70】### Laparoscopy\n\n【71】Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) involves making a small cut in your lower tummy so a thin tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) can be inserted to examine your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries.\n\n【72】Dye may be injected into your fallopian tubes through your cervix to highlight any blockages in them.\n\n【73】Laparoscopy is usually only used if it's likely that you have a problem – for example, if you've had an episode of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the past, or if scans suggest a possible blockage of one or both of your tubes.\n\n【74】Fertility tests for men\n-----------------------\n\n【75】Tests to find out the cause of infertility in men include:\n\n【76】### Semen analysis\n\n【77】This is to check for problems with sperm, such as a low sperm count or sperm that are not moving properly.\n\n【78】### Chlamydia test\n\n【79】A sample of your urine will be tested to check for chlamydia, as it can affect fertility.\n\n【80】Your GP will prescribe antibiotics if you have chlamydia.\n\n【81】Read about the different treatments for infertility.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 09 August 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 09 August 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Causes</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Diagnosis\n4.  Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**There's currently no cure for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but there are lots of things that can be done to help manage the symptoms.**\n\n【3】As PSP can affect many different areas of your health, you'll be cared for by a team of health and social care professionals working together. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\n\n【4】Members of your MDT may include:\n\n【5】*   a neurologist (a specialist in conditions that affect the brain and nerves)\n*   a physiotherapist (who can help with movement and balance difficulties)\n*   a speech and language therapist (who can help with speech or swallowing problems)\n*   an occupational therapist (who can help you improve the skills you need for daily activities, such as washing or dressing)\n*   a social worker (who can advise you about the support available from social services)\n*   an ophthalmologist or orthoptist (specialists in treating eye conditions)\n*   a specialist neurology nurse (who may act as your point of contact with the rest of the team)\n\n【6】Medication\n----------\n\n【7】There are currently no medications that treat PSP specifically, but some people in the early stages of the condition may benefit from taking levodopa, amantadine or other medications used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n\n【8】These medications can improve balance and stiffness for some people with PSP, although the effect is often limited and only lasts for up to a few years.\n\n【9】Antidepressants can help with the depression that's often associated with PSP.\n\n【10】Some may also help with balance, stiffness, pain and sleep problems. \n\n【11】It's important to tell your doctor about the symptoms you're experiencing so they can consider which treatments are best for you.\n\n【12】Physiotherapy\n-------------\n\n【13】A physiotherapist can give you advice about making the most of your remaining mobility using exercise, while making sure you don't overexert yourself.\n\n【14】Regular exercise may help strengthen your muscles, improve your posture and prevent stiffening of your joints.\n\n【15】Your physiotherapist can advise about equipment that could benefit you, such as a walking frame or specially designed shoes to reduce the risk of slipping and falling.\n\n【16】They can teach you breathing exercises to use when you eat to reduce your risk of developing aspiration pneumonia (a chest infection caused by food particles falling into your lungs).\n删除7：<u>Read more about physiotherapy.</u>\n\n【17】Speech and language therapy\n---------------------------\n\n【18】A speech and language therapist (SLT) can help you improve your speech and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\n\n【19】They can teach you a number of techniques to help make your voice as clear as possible, and can advise you about suitable communication aids or devices you may need as the condition progresses.\n\n【20】Your therapist can also advise you about different swallowing techniques and, working together with a dietitian, they may suggest altering the consistency of your food to make swallowing easier.\n\n【21】Diet and severe swallowing problems\n-----------------------------------\n\n【22】As your swallowing problems become more severe, you'll need additional treatment to compensate for your swallowing difficulties.\n\n【23】You may be referred to a dietitian, who'll advise you about making changes to your diet, such as including food and liquids that are easier to swallow, while making sure you have a healthy, balanced diet.\n\n【24】For example, mashed potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, while scrambled eggs and cheese are high in protein and calcium.\n\n【25】Feeding tubes may be recommended for severe swallowing problems, where the risk of malnutrition and dehydration is increased. You should discuss the pros and cons of feeding tubes with your family and care team, preferably when your problems with swallowing are at an early stage.\n\n【26】The main type of feeding tube used is called a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. This tube is placed into your stomach through your tummy during an operation.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating swallowing problems (dysphagia).</u>\n\n【27】Occupational therapy\n--------------------\n\n【28】An occupational therapist (OT) can advise you about how you can increase your safety and prevent trips and falls during your day-to-day activities.\n\n【29】For example, many people with PSP benefit from having bars placed along the sides of their bath to make it easier for them to get in and out.\n\n【30】The OT will also be able to spot potential hazards in your home that could lead to a fall, such as poor lighting, badly secured rugs, and crowded walkways and corridors.\n删除7：<u>Read more about occupational therapy.</u>\n\n【31】Treating eye problems\n---------------------\n\n【32】If you're having problems controlling your eyelids, injections of botulinum toxin (such as Botox) can be used to help relax the muscles of your eyelids.\n\n【33】It works by blocking the signals from the brain to the affected muscles. The effects of the injections usually last for up to 3 months.\n\n【34】If you're experiencing dry eyes because of reduced blinking, eyedrops and artificial tears can be used to lubricate them and reduce irritation.\n\n【35】Glasses with specially designed lenses can help some people with PSP who have difficulty looking down.\n\n【36】Wearing dark wraparound glasses can help those who are sensitive to bright light (photophobia).\n\n【37】Palliative care\n---------------\n\n【38】Palliative care can be offered at any stage of PSP, alongside other treatments.\n\n【39】It aims to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms while providing psychological, social and spiritual support.\n\n【40】Palliative care can be received:\n\n【41】*   in a hospice or care home\n*   at home\n*   on a day patient basis in a hospice\n*   in a hospital\n\n【42】Advanced care planning\n----------------------\n\n【43】Many people with PSP consider making plans for the future that outline their wishes (both medical and other decisions), and make these known to both their family and the health professionals involved in their care.\n\n【44】This can be useful in case you're unable to communicate your decisions later on because you're too ill, although it's voluntary and you don't have to do it if you don't want to.\n\n【45】Issues that you may want to cover might include:\n\n【46】*   whether you want to be treated at home or in a hospice or hospital when you reach the final stages of PSP\n*   the type of painkillers you'd be willing to take\n*   whether you'd be willing to use a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid\n*   whether you're willing to donate any of your organs after you die\n*   whether you'd be willing to be resuscitated by artificial means if you experienced respiratory failure (loss of lung function)\n\n【47】If you want to decide about these issues, they can be written down in a number of ways:\n\n【48】*   advance decision to refuse treatment\n*   advance statement about your wishes\n*   emergency healthcare plan\n*   lasting power of attorney\n\n【49】Your care team can provide you with more information and advice about these decisions and how best to record them.\n删除7：<u>Read more about end of life care.</u>\n\n【50】Social care and support\n-----------------------\n\n【51】If someone you know develops PSP, you may need information and advice about caring for them.\n\n【52】The social care and support guide has a wide range of useful information about all aspects of caring for others, and advice for carers themselves.\n\n【53】You can also contact the PSP Association for help and advice:\n\n【54】*   email helpline@pspassociation.org.uk\n*   call the helpline on 0300 011 0122\n\n【55】A Parkinson's nurse at your local hospital may be able to provide you with useful information and support.\n\n【56】Research into treating PSP\n--------------------------\n\n【57】There have been several trials of different medications that aim to help symptoms of PSP or slow its progression.\n\n【58】Further research into treatments, scans and causes of the condition is ongoing.\n\n【59】If you wish to get involved in research, you can search for clinical trials for PSP or ask your care team about any ongoing or planned trials you may be suitable for.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 March 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Trastuzumab may also be used alongside chemotherapy medicines which can cause other types of side effects.\n\n【2】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【3】These common side effects of trastuzumab happen in up to 1 in 10 people. There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【4】Feeling tired and difficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n\n【5】Avoid caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals and exercise for a few hours before going to bed. Relax before bedtime by taking a warm bath or listening to calming music.\n\n【6】Do not drive, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery if you're feeling tired.\n\n【7】Diarrhoea or vomiting\n\n【8】Drink plenty of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark strong-smelling pee.\n\n【9】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick or have severe diarrhoea, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【10】Constipation\n\n【11】Try to get more fibre into your diet such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals. Drinking plenty of water each day can also help. If you can, try to exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk.\n\n【12】It's safe to use a laxative if your constipation does not go away. Check with a pharmacist or doctor which laxative would be best for you.\n\n【13】Loss of appetite and weight loss\n\n【14】You may lose your appetite while on trastuzumab as it can affect your taste or make you feel sick. This may cause you to lose weight.\n\n【15】Try to choose foods you normally enjoy but avoid rich or spicy food. Try eating smaller meals but more often. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or get worse.\n\n【16】Pain in your muscles, joints or stomach\n\n【17】Using a heat pad or covered hot water bottle may help. Speak to a pharmacist about painkillers for mild to moderate pain. Talk to your doctor if the pain does not go away or is severe.\n\n【18】A runny nose\n\n【19】Tell your doctor or nurse who may recommend an antihistamine for you to take.\n\n【20】Sore, red eyes (conjunctivitis) or watery eyes\n\n【21】Tell your doctor or nurse as you may need treatment.\n\n【22】Shaking (tremors)\n\n【23】Speak to your doctor.\n\n【24】Feeling dizzy\n\n【25】If trastuzumab makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint, then sit until you feel better.\n\n【26】Do not drive, ride a bike, or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy.\n\n【27】Hair loss\n\n【28】Your hair may thin but you're unlikely to lose all your hair. It can start after your first or second cycle of treatment and is usually temporary. Your hair will grow back after you finish your treatment.\n\n【29】Speak to your doctor if the advice on how to cope does not help and a side effect is bothering you or does not go away.\n\n【30】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【31】Call a doctor or call 111 straight away if:\n\n【32】*   you have symptoms of an infection such as a high temperature, feeling shivery or you feel unwell even though your temperature is normal – trastuzumab can reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood which increases your risk of severe infections\n*   you have swollen feet or ankles, or stomach or lower back pain – these can be signs of heart problems\n\n【33】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if:\n\n【34】*   you have chest pain – this could be a sign of heart problems\n*   you have difficulty breathing\n\n【35】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【36】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【37】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction to trastuzumab (anaphylaxis).\n\n【38】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【39】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【40】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【41】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【42】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【43】These are not all the side effects of trastuzumab.

This helps improve the symptoms of heart failure such as breathlessness, tiredness and swelling in your lower legs. It also reduces the chances of your heart getting weaker.\n\n【6】When will I feel better?\n\n【7】Empagliflozin starts to work within an hour or 2 to reduce your blood glucose levels, but it may take a week for it to work fully.\n\n【8】You may not have had any symptoms of diabetes, so you will not necessarily feel any different when you take empagliflozin. This does not mean that empagliflozin is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【9】Empagliflozin will help keep your blood sugar level stable and reduce your chances of diabetes-related problems in the future.\n\n【10】If you're taking empagliflozin for heart failure, it might be a month or 2 before you notice any improvement in your symptoms. Although you may not feel different, empagliflozin is still working to reduce the workload on your heart. This will reduce your chances of your heart failure getting worse.\n\n【11】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【12】Empagliflozin is safe to take for a long time. There is no evidence that this medicine harms your general health.\n\n【13】Are there other medicines for type 2 diabetes?\n\n【14】There are different groups of medicines that can lower blood sugar levels if you have type 2 diabetes:\n\n【15】*   metformin\n*   pioglitazone\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors or gliptins, such as saxagliptin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, such as exenatide\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin\n*   insulin\n\n【16】Empagliflozin can be prescribed on its own or together with some of these other medicines.\n\n【17】Empagliflozin can be taken on its own when diet and exercise are not enough to control your blood sugar levels, or if you cannot take metformin. It can also be taken with other diabetes medicines, including insulin, when the medicines you're already taking do not control your blood sugar properly.\n\n【18】SGLT2 inhibitors all work in the same way, by increasing the amount of sugar removed from your body when you pee.\n\n【19】These medicines can cause urinary tract infections because of the way they work.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about medicines for type 2 diabetes</u>\n\n【20】Are there other medicines for heart failure?\n\n【21】Empagliflozin is usually added to other heart failure medicines to help control your condition. Other heart failure medicines include:\n\n【22】*   ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril\n*   angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as candesartan, losartan and valsartan\n*   beta blockers, such as bisoprolol\n*   diuretics (tablets that make you pee more), such as furosemide and bumetanide\n\n【23】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【24】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【25】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate (FP92A).\n\n【26】You can get an application form at your GP surgery.\n\n【27】Can I take empagliflozin before surgery?\n\n【28】If you're going to have an operation, tell the doctor that you're taking empagliflozin.\n\n【29】You may need to stop taking your empagliflozin tablets if you need to stop eating before your operation, and while you recover after the operation.\n\n【30】This is because there's a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【31】Will it make me lose weight or put on weight?\n\n【32】Empagliflozin can cause weight loss by increasing the amount of sugar that's removed from your body when you pee.\n\n【33】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【34】Empagliflozin does not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【35】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【36】Empagliflozin should not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【37】But if you're taking empagliflozin together with other diabetes medicines, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, it can cause your blood sugar levels to go too low (hypoglycaemia or a \"hypo\").\n\n【38】Hypos can reduce your concentration. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle or use machines or tools until you feel better.\n\n【39】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking empagliflozin.

A pint of lager or beer is usually 2 to 3 units of alcohol.\n\n【45】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【46】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. However, ask your doctor for advice before starting a low-calorie, reduced carbohydrate or ketogenic (keto) diet.\n\n【47】Check the nutrition labels, as many foods and drinks are high in sugar. This can increase your blood sugar levels, so your diabetes is not controlled as well as it could be. These foods include:\n\n【48】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【49】Be careful when eating food and drink containing karela (also called bitter gourd or bitter melon). This is because it can lower your blood sugar levels, and you could have a hypo.\n\n【50】Karela is used to flavour foods, such as curries like bitter gourd masala. It has a bitter taste, and can also be made into juice and tea.\n\n【51】Can lifestyle changes help with type 2 diabetes or heart failure?\n\n【52】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes or heart failure.\n\n【53】These include:\n\n【54】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing any excess weight\n*   quitting smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week\n*   exercising – at least 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal\n\n【55】Empagliflozin is usually prescribed for type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise alone have not been enough to control your blood sugar levels.\n删除11：<u>More in Empagliflozin\n---------------------\n\n【56】*   About empagliflozin\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 2 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 2 February 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities, such as the hands, feet and arms, are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected.**\n\n【3】In the UK it's estimated almost 1 in 10 people aged 55 or over are affected by peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【4】The peripheral nervous system\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).\n\n【6】It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including:\n\n【7】*   sensory nerves – responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch\n*   motor nerves – responsible for controlling muscles\n*   autonomic nerves – responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function\n\n【8】Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy\n---------------------------------\n\n【9】The main symptoms of peripheral neuropathy can include:\n\n【10】*   numbness and tingling in the feet or hands\n*   burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas\n*   loss of balance and co-ordination\n*   muscle weakness, especially in the feet\n\n【11】These symptoms are usually constant, but may come and go.\n\n【12】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【13】It's important to see a GP if you experience the early symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【14】These include:\n\n【15】*   pain, tingling or loss of sensation in the feet\n*   loss of balance or weakness\n*   a cut or ulcer on your foot that's not getting better\n\n【16】It's also recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes, have regular check-ups.\n\n【17】A GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause.\n\n【18】You may be referred to hospital to see a neurologist, a specialist in health problems affecting the nervous system.\n\n【19】Generally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy</u>\n\n【20】Causes of peripheral neuropathy\n-------------------------------\n\n【21】In the UK diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【22】Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves.\n\n【23】This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.\n\n【24】Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes.\n\n【25】For example, it can be caused by:\n\n【26】*   physical injury to the nerves\n*   a viral infection, such as shingles\n*   a side effect of certain medicines or drinking too much alcohol\n\n【27】People who are known to be at an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed.\n\n【28】Treating peripheral neuropathy\n------------------------------\n\n【29】Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.\n\n【30】Not all of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated.\n\n【31】For example, if you have diabetes, it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol.\n\n【32】Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medicines called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers often do not work.\n\n【33】If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually.\n\n【34】For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy and walking aids.\n\n【35】Complications of peripheral neuropathy\n--------------------------------------\n\n【36】The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged.\n\n【37】Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time.\n\n【38】If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy is not treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected.\n\n【39】This can lead to gangrene if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the foot has to be amputated.\n\n【40】Peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy).\n\n【41】You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, a pacemaker.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about complications of peripheral neuropathy</u>\n\n【42】Different types of peripheral neuropathy\n----------------------------------------\n\n【43】Peripheral neuropathy may affect:\n\n【44】*   only 1 nerve (mononeuropathy)\n*   several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex)\n*   all the nerves in the body (polyneuropathy)\n\n【45】Polyneuropathy is the most common type and starts by affecting the longest nerves first, so symptoms typically begin in the feet.\n\n【46】Over time it gradually starts to affect shorter nerves, so feels as if it's spreading upwards, and later affects the hands.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 October 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 October

These antibiotics work by killing bacteria by stopping them from making the proteins that they need to survive.\n\n【3】For conditions like rosacea, doxycycline is used to make the skin less inflamed.\n\n【4】When will I feel better?\n\n【5】With most infections, you'll usually feel better within a few days. When you do, it's important to keep taking doxycycline until you finish your medicine. Taking all your medicine will help stop the infection coming back.\n\n【6】What if I do not get better?\n\n【7】If you have rosacea, doxycycline works slowly to treat it. Your doctor will usually review you after 4 to 6 weeks to check how well the medicine is working.\n\n【8】If you're taking doxycycline for any other infection, tell your doctor if you do not start feeling better after 3 days. Also tell them if, at any time, you start to feel worse.\n\n【9】If you are taking doxycycline to prevent malaria, you will not feel any different. Take doxycycline as prescribed, and continue taking it for 4 weeks after leaving the area where there is malaria.\n\n【10】Will it give me thrush?\n\n【11】Some people get a fungal infection called thrush after taking a course of antibiotics like doxycycline. This is because the antibiotics kill the normal harmless bacteria that help protect you against thrush.\n\n【12】If this happens to you, ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\n【13】Does it stain teeth?\n\n【14】Doxycycline can build up in growing bones and teeth by sticking to calcium – this can stain teeth. Because this only happens in growing bones and teeth, it's not usually given to young children, during pregnancy, or when breastfeeding.\n\n【15】Can I take doxycycline if I'm allergic to penicillin?\n\n【16】Yes, you can take doxycycline if you are allergic to penicillin. They are different types of antibiotic.\n\n【17】I'm taking doxycycline to prevent malaria while in a hot country, is it better to use another medicine so I do not react to sunlight?\n\n【18】Doxycycline has been used successfully in hot countries for many years. The best way to protect yourself against a reaction to sunlight is to be careful when out in the sun – wear clothes that cover you up, a hat and sunglasses. Use a high factor (at least SPF 30) sunscreen or sunblock on your skin.\n\n【19】Speak to your doctor of pharmacist if you have any questions about this.\n\n【20】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【21】Doxycycline does not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【22】However, if doxycycline makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your combined pill may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【23】Can I drink alcohol while taking doxycycline?\n\n【24】It's best not to drink alcohol with doxycycline because it can stop it working properly.

But it's a good idea to also know what to expect after labour.**\n\n【2】Skin-to-skin contact really helps with bonding. It's a good idea to have your baby lifted onto you as soon as they're born and before the cord is cut so you can be close to each other straight away.\n\n【3】Either before, or just after the cord is clamped, your baby will be dried and then covered with a towel to stop them getting cold. You can continue to hold and cuddle your baby while this is done.\n\n【4】Your baby may have some of your blood on their skin and perhaps vernix, the greasy white substance that protects your baby's skin in the womb.\n\n【5】If you prefer, you can ask the midwife to dry your baby and wrap them in a blanket before your cuddle.\n\n【6】Mucus may need to be cleared out of your baby's nose and mouth.\n\n【7】Some babies need a bit of help to get their breathing established.\n\n【8】Your baby may be taken to another part of the room to have some oxygen. They'll be brought back to you as soon as possible.\n\n【9】Your baby will be examined by a midwife, neonatal nurse or paediatrician, then weighed and possibly measured, and given a wrist or ankle band with your name on.\n\n【10】Your midwife or maternity support worker will help you wash and freshen up before you go to the postnatal ward.\n\n【11】Vitamin K for newborn babies\n----------------------------\n\n【12】You'll be offered an injection of vitamin K for your baby. This helps prevent a rare bleeding disorder called haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.\n\n【13】Your midwife should have discussed the injection with you while you were pregnant.\n\n【14】If you'd prefer for your baby not to have an injection, they can have vitamin K by mouth instead, but they'll need further doses.\n\n【15】Stitches for tears or cuts\n--------------------------\n\n【16】Small tears and grazes are often left without stitches because they can usually heal without treatment.\n\n【17】If you need stitches or other treatments, you should be able to carry on cuddling your baby while this is being done.\n\n【18】If you have had a large tear or an episiotomy, you'll need stitches.\n\n【19】If you have already had an epidural, it can be topped up. If you haven't, you should be offered a local anaesthetic to numb the area.\n\n【20】Preventing bleeding after the birth\n-----------------------------------\n\n【21】Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication where you bleed heavily from the vagina after your baby's birth.\n\n【22】There are 2 types of PPH, depending on when the bleeding takes place:\n\n【23】*   primary or immediate – bleeding that happens within 24 hours of birth\n*   secondary or delayed – bleeding that happens after the first 24 hours and up to 12 weeks after the birth\n\n【24】Sometimes PPH happens because your womb doesn't contract strongly enough after the birth.\n\n【25】It can also happen because part of the placenta has been left in your womb or you get an infection in the lining of the womb (endometritis). \n\n【26】To help prevent PPH, you'll be offered an injection of oxytocin as your baby is being born. This stimulates contractions and helps to push the placenta out.\n\n【27】Now read about you and your body after the birth.\n删除3：<u>Video: what are the first things that will happen once my baby is born?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】In this video, a midwife talks you through what will happen immediately after your baby is born.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 2 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 2 February 2026</u>\n\n【29】</u>删除11：<u>More in After the birth\n-----------------------\n\n【30】*   What happens straight after the birth?\n*   Your body after the birth\n*   Your newborn baby\n*   Early days\n*   Special care: ill or premature babies\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 August 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 August 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "ec5a8195-aadf-4db8-ab7a-f6ca11f51af4", "title": "Levothyroxine", "text": "【0】Levothyroxine \\- Brand name: Eltroxin\n=====================================\n\n【1】On this page\n------------\n\n【2】1.  About levothyroxine\n2.  Key facts\n3.  Who can and cannot take levothyroxine\n4.  How and when to take levothyroxine\n5.  Side effects\n6.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n7.  Cautions with other medicines\n8.  Common questions about levothyroxine\n\n【3】1\\. About levothyroxine\n-----------------------\n\n【4】Levothyroxine is a medicine used to treat an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\n\n【5】The thyroid gland makes thyroid hormones which help to control energy levels and growth. Levothyroxine is taken to replace the missing thyroid hormone thyroxine.\n\n【6】Levothyroxine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or as a liquid that you swallow.\n\n【7】2\\. Key facts\n-------------\n\n【8】*   Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of a hormone called thyroxine. It replaces thyroxine if your thyroid gland cannot produce it and prevents the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n*   Levothyroxine starts working straight away, but it may be several weeks before your symptoms start to improve.\n*   The most common side effects of levothyroxine are caused by taking a bigger dose than you need. Your doctor can lower your dose to help reduce any side effects.\n*   Before you start taking levothyroxine, your doctor will do a blood test. Once you start taking the medicine you'll have regular blood tests to see how well it's working.\n*   Levothyroxine doses need to be carefully monitored during pregnancy. If you're planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant, it's important to talk to your doctor to get the right care for you and your baby.\n\n【9】3\\. Who can and cannot take levothyroxine\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】Levothyroxine can be taken by most adults and children. However, it’s not suitable for some people.\n\n【11】Check with your doctor before taking levothyroxine if you:\n\n【12】*   have ever had an allergic reaction to levothyroxine or any other medicine\n*   you have an overactive thyroid that produces too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis)\n*   have a health problem that affects your adrenal glands (your doctor will be able to tell you if you're not sure)\n*   have a heart problem including angina, heart disease or heart failure\n*   have high blood pressure\n*   have ever had a heart attack\n*   have diabetes – the dose of your diabetes medicine may need to change because levothyroxine can raise blood sugar levels\n\n【13】4\\. How and when to take levothyroxine\n--------------------------------------\n\n【14】Take levothyroxine once a day in the morning, ideally at least 30 minutes before having breakfast or a drink containing caffeine, like tea or coffee.\n\n【15】Food and caffeinated drinks can both stop your body taking in levothyroxine properly so it does not work as well.\n\n【16】If you stop taking levothyroxine, your symptoms are likely to come back.\n\n【17】### Dosage and strength\n\n【18】The dose of levothyroxine varies from person to person.\n\n【19】You may need to take several different tablets to make up your dose. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take each day.\n\n【20】Levothyroxine comes in 12.5 microgram, 25 microgram, 50 microgram, 75 microgram and 100 microgram tablets.\n\n【21】If you're taking levothyroxine as a liquid, 5ml can have 25 micrograms, 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 125micrograms in it.\n\n【22】Although starting doses are usually the same, the dose of levothyroxine you end up taking, or how quickly the dose is increased, depends on your symptoms, hormone levels, age and whether you have any other health problems.\n\n【23】Adults usually start with a dose between 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms taken once a day. This may be increased gradually over a few weeks to between 100 micrograms and 200 micrograms taken once a day.\n\n【24】Some people, such as over-50s or people with heart disease, may start on a lower dose.\n\n【25】### How to take levothyroxine\n\n【26】Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.\n\n【27】Levothyroxine is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets. It’s available in different strengths.\n\n【28】If you or your child are taking levothyroxine as a liquid, it will usually come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose.\n\n【29】If you do not have a syringe or measuring spoon, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount.\n\n【30】### If you forget to take it\n\n【31】If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. In this case just skip the forgotten dose and take the next one at the usual time.\n\n【32】Do not take 2 doses together to make up for a missed dose.\n\n【33】If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.\n\n【34】### If you take too much\n\n【35】Taking more than your prescribed dose of levothyroxine can give you symptoms such as a racing heartbeat (palpitations).\n\n【36】#### Urgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\n【37】*   you take more than 1 extra dose of levothyroxine\n\n【38】Go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111\n\n【39】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 if:\n\n【40】*   you get chest pains – these may not happen immediately, it can be several days before they begin\n\n【41】### Having regular blood tests\n\n【42】Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check the levels of thyroid hormones in your body before and after starting levothyroxine.\n\n【43】These will allow your doctor to adjust the dose to suit you.\n\n【44】At the start of treatment you can expect to have blood tests quite often but once your hormone levels are stable and your symptoms are under control, your levels will usually be checked once a year.\n\n【45】You may need blood tests more often if you:\n\n【46】*   are pregnant\n*   start or stop a medicine that can affect the way levothyroxine works\n*   have any symptoms that could mean your dose is not quite right\n\n【47】5\\. Side effects\n----------------\n\n【48】Like all medicines, levothyroxine can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Once you are on the right dose of levothyroxine, side effects should go away.\n\n【49】Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have switched to a different brand of levothyroxine and start to get:\n\n【50】*   symptoms of an underactive thyroid including feeling tired, weight gain or feeling depressed\n*   symptoms of an overactive thyroid (similar to the common side effects below)\n\n【51】You may be sensitive to the new brand of levothyroxine you have been prescribed and may need to stay on the one you were taking before.\n\n【52】### Common side effects\n\n【53】The common side effects of levothyroxine usually happen because the dose you're taking is more than you need. These side effects usually go away after you go on to a lower dose of levothyroxine or stop treatment.\n\n【54】Common side effects are the same as the symptoms of an overactive thyroid. There are things you can do to help cope with them.\n\n【55】Feeling sick (nausea)\n\n【56】Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food.\n\n【57】Being sick (vomiting)\n\n【58】If you're being sick try to take small, frequent sips of fluids, such as water or squash, to prevent dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. If you are vomiting due to a stomach bug or illness, tell your doctor. Do not take any other medicines to treat vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【59】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【60】Diarrhoea\n\n【61】Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Speak to a pharmacist if you have signs of dehydration, such as peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. If you get severe diarrhoea from a stomach bug or illness, tell your doctor. Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor first.\n\n【62】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for over 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【63】Headaches\n\n【64】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do not drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if they last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【65】Feeling restless or excitable, or problems sleeping\n\n【66】These symptoms should improve as your body gets used to levothyroxine. If it does not go away, or if it's causing you problems, contact your doctor.\n\n【67】Flushing or sweating\n\n【68】Try cutting down on coffee, tea and alcohol.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n-------------------------------\n\n【91】### Levothyroxine and pregnancy\n\n【92】Levothyroxine is safe to take in pregnancy.\n\n【93】It's important to carry on taking levothyroxine throughout your pregnancy. Having too low or too high levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby.\n\n【94】You'll need to have regular blood tests during pregnancy to make sure you're on the right dose of levothyroxine. Your doctor may need to increase your dose of levothyroxine while you’re pregnant.\n\n【95】### Levothyroxine and breastfeeding\n\n【96】It's OK to breastfeed while you're on levothyroxine. Thyroid hormones are a normal part of breast milk. When taken as a supplement they only pass into breast milk in tiny amounts that are too small to affect your baby.\n\n【97】If you're breastfeeding, it's important that you continue to take levothyroxine, as this is replacing what your body would normally be making. Your body needs good levels of thyroid hormones to make enough breast milk for your baby.\n\n【98】If you notice that your baby is not feeding as well as usual, or if you have any other concerns about your baby, talk to your midwife, health visitor, pharmacist or doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【99】### Non-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\n【100】*   trying to get pregnant\n*   pregnant\n*   breastfeeding\n\n【101】7\\. Cautions with other medicines\n---------------------------------\n\n【102】Some medicines can affect thyroid hormones, so the dose of levothyroxine may need to be changed. They include:\n\n【103】*   epilepsy medicines like carbamazepine and phenytoin\n*   rifampicin\n*   amiodarone\n*   oestrogens – such as in combined contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n\n【104】Levothyroxine can affect how other medicines work, so their doses may need to be changed. These medicines include:\n\n【105】*   medicines for diabetes – either insulin or tablets\n*   warfarin, used to prevent blood blots\n\n【106】Some medicines should not be taken at the same time of day as levothyroxine as they can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in, including:\n\n【107】*   antacids\n*   calcium salts\n*   iron salts\n*   orlistat, a medicine used for weight loss\n*   sucralfate, a medicine used to treat stomach ulcers\n*   some cholesterol-lowering medicines such as colestyramine, colestipol or colesevelem\n删除7：<u>Find out more from the information leaflets that come with the medicines. Or get your pharmacist's advice on how much time to leave between taking these medicines and taking levothyroxine.</u>\n\n【108】### Mixing levothyroxine with herbal remedies and supplements\n\n【109】There's very little information about taking herbal remedies and supplements with levothyroxine.\n\n【110】However, biotin supplements can affect the accuracy of thyroid function tests. Do not take biotin without talking to your doctor.\n\n【111】Kelp (a type of seaweed) can contain high levels of iodine, which sometimes makes an underactive thyroid worse. Do not take supplements containing kelp if you're taking levothyroxine.\n\n【112】### Important: Medicine safety\n\n【113】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n【114】8\\. Common questions about levothyroxine\n----------------------------------------\n\n【115】How does levothyroxine work?\n\n【116】The thyroid gland in your neck makes a hormone called thyroxine. Thyroxine controls how much energy your body uses (the metabolic rate). It's also involved in digestion, how your heart and muscles work, brain development and bone health.\n\n【117】When the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroxine (called hypothyroidism), many of the body's functions slow down. Some of the most common symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland are:\n\n【118】*   tiredness\n*   feeling cold\n*   difficulty concentrating\n*   weight gain\n*   feeling depressed\n\n【119】Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of thyroxine. You take levothyroxine tablets to replace the thyroxine that your thyroid gland cannot produce and prevent the symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n\n【120】How long does levothyroxine take to work?\n\n【121】Levothyroxine starts working straight away, but it may be several weeks before your symptoms start to improve and you feel any different.\n\n【122】How long will I take levothyroxine for?\n\n【123】Treatment with levothyroxine is usually lifelong. If you stop taking levothyroxine your symptoms are likely to come back.\n\n【124】Are there any long term side effects?\n\n【125】Yes, it's safe to take levothyroxine for a long time, even many years. However, high doses of levothyroxine over a long time can sometimes cause weakening of the bones (osteoporosis).\n\n【126】This should not happen if you are on the right dose. It's important to have regular blood tests to make sure your dose is not too high.\n\n【127】Will it affect my fertility?\n\n【128】There's no evidence to suggest that taking levothyroxine reduces fertility in either men or women.\n\n【129】However, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor if you're trying to get pregnant as they may want to review your treatment.\n\n【130】Can I drink alcohol with it?\n\n【131】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking levothyroxine. Alcohol does not affect how this medicine works.\n\n【132】However, if you have side effects such as headaches, flushing or sweating with levothyroxine, alcohol may make these worse.\n\n【133】Will it make me lose weight?\n\n【134】One of the symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland is weight gain. So, once you start taking levothyroxine, you may lose weight as your body's hormones rebalance. Losing weight can also be a sign that your dose of levothyroxine is too high.\n\n【135】Once your thyroid hormone levels have returned to normal, your tendency to gain or lose weight is the same as for people who do not have thyroid problems.\n\n【136】Can I drive or ride a bike with it?\n\n【137】Yes, levothyroxine does not affect your ability to drive or ride a bike.\n\n【138】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【139】There are some foods and drinks that do not mix well with levothyroxine:\n\n【140】*   **drinks containing caffeine**, like coffee, tea and some fizzy drinks, can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in. Leave at least 30 minutes after taking levothyroxine before you drink them.\n*   **calcium-rich foods**, such as milk, cheese, yoghurt and broccoli, can reduce the amount of levothyroxine your body takes in. Leave at least 4 hours between taking levothyroxine and eating calcium-rich foods.\n*   **soya in food and supplements** may stop levothyroxine working properly. If you regularly eat soya or take soya supplements your doctor might need to do extra blood tests to make sure you're getting enough levothyroxine.\n*   **kelp (a type of seaweed)** can contain high levels of iodine, which sometimes makes an underactive thyroid worse. Do not take supplements containing kelp if you're taking levothyroxine.\n\n【141】Can I get thyroid medicines for free?\n\n【142】If you have an underactive thyroid, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines (not just your levothyroxine). To claim your free prescriptions you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【143】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【144】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【145】Levothyroxine does not affect any types of contraception, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\n【146】However, the combined pill contains oestrogen which can reduce the amount of levothyroxine in your body.\n\n【147】Speak to your doctor if you start or stop taking the Pill as your dose of levothyroxine may need to change.\n\n【148】If levothyroxine makes you sick (vomit) or you have severe diarrhoea for over 24 hours while you’re taking levothyroxine, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy.\n\n【149】If this happens, follow the instructions in the leaflet that comes with your contraceptive pills.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or you have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【150】Will I lose my hair?\n\n【151】It's having an underactive thyroid that causes hair loss – not treatment with levothyroxine.\n\n【152】Because the natural hair growth cycle takes several months, hair loss related to thyroid disease might only be seen months after the condition has begun. If treatment with levothyroxine has already started, it may seem like the medicine – rather than the underlying illness – is causing the hair loss.\n\n【153】Hair usually regrows after treatment with levothyroxine, but it may take many months.\n删除11：<u>Related conditions\n------------------\n\n【154】*   Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)\n</u>删除11：<u>Useful resources\n----------------\n\n【155】*   British Thyroid Foundation: charity\n*   Thyroid UK: charity\n*   You and your hormones: medical information\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 17 December 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 17 December 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Prevention</u>\n\n【2】**Endocarditis is caused by bacteria in the bloodstream multiplying and spreading across the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). The endocardium becomes inflamed, causing damage to your heart valves.**\n\n【3】Your heart is usually well protected against infection so bacteria can pass harmlessly by.\n\n【4】But if your heart valves are damaged or you have an artificial valve, it's easier for bacteria to take root and bypass your normal immune response to infection.\n\n【5】Small clumps of bacteria can develop at the site of the infection. There's a risk of these clumps acting in a similar way to blood clots, travelling away from the heart and blocking the blood supply to the organs. This can cause organ failure or trigger a stroke.\n\n【6】How bacteria reach the heart\n----------------------------\n\n【7】There are several ways that bacteria can enter your blood.\n\n【8】### Mouth\n\n【9】Everyday activities, such as brushing your teeth or chewing your food, can sometimes allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream.\n\n【10】The risk is increased if your teeth and gums are in bad condition because it makes it easier for bacteria to enter.\n\n【11】### Infection\n\n【12】Bacteria can spread from the site of a pre-existing infection, such as a skin infection or gum disease.\n\n【13】### Needles and tubes\n\n【14】Any medical procedure that involves placing a medical instrument inside the body carries a small associated risk of introducing bacteria into your bloodstream.\n\n【15】Who's at risk\n-------------\n\n【16】There are a number of things that can make your heart more vulnerable to infection and increase your chance of developing endocarditis.\n\n【17】These include:\n\n【18】*   heart valve disease\n*   having prosthetic valves\n*   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n*   injecting drugs\n*   congenital heart disease\n*   you've had endocarditis before\n\n【19】### Heart valve disease\n\n【20】Heart valve disease is a general term describing health problems that damage the valves of the heart.\n\n【21】Two types of heart valve disease known to increase your risk of endocarditis are:\n\n【22】*   valvular stenosis – where the valve(s) of the heart become narrowed, disrupting the blood flow through the heart\n*   valvular regurgitation – where the valve(s) of the heart do not close properly, causing blood to leak back in the wrong direction\n\n【23】Heart valve disease can be either: \n\n【24】*   congenital heart disease – where you're born with the condition\n*   acquired – where you develop the condition in later life\n\n【25】Causes of acquired heart valve disease include:\n\n【26】*   a previous heart attack – a heart attack can damage the muscles that surround and support the valves, preventing the valves from functioning properly\n*   high blood pressure (hypertension) – without treatment, high blood pressure can weaken the tissue around the valves\n*   rheumatic fever – a type of bacterial infection that can damage the heart\n\n【27】Rheumatic fever is rare since the introduction of antibiotics. But older people who had rheumatic fever during childhood may go on to develop heart valve disease.\n\n【28】### Prosthetic valves\n\n【29】The prosthetic (artificial) valves used in aortic valve replacement surgery replace heart valves that have been damaged by heart valve disease.\n\n【30】But bacteria can also take root around prosthetic valves, which can occasionally trigger endocarditis.\n\n【31】### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\n【32】In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells enlarge and the walls of the heart chambers thicken.\n\n【33】The chambers are reduced in size so they cannot hold much blood, and the walls cannot relax properly and may stiffen.\n\n【34】### Injecting drugs\n\n【35】People who inject illegal drugs such as heroin or methamphetamine (crystal meth) have an increased risk of developing endocarditis.\n\n【36】This is because unsterilised needles allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream and repeated injections make the skin more vulnerable to infection.\n\n【37】### Fungal endocarditis\n\n【38】Endocarditis caused by a fungal infection is rarer than bacterial endocarditis, and usually more serious.\n\n【39】You're more at risk of fungal endocarditis if you:\n\n【40】*   inject drugs\n*   have a history of heart surgery\n*   have a central venous catheter – a tube connected to a vein in the neck, groin or chest, which is used to deliver medicines or fluids to people who are seriously ill\n*   have a weakened immune system – either as a result of a health condition affecting the immune system, such as HIV, or as a side effect of certain types of treatments, such as chemotherapy.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 16 August 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 16 August 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

In others, it can restrict the tongue's movement, making it harder to breastfeed.\n\n【4】Tongue-tie is sometimes diagnosed during a baby's newborn physical examination, but it's not always easy to spot. It may not be obvious until your baby has problems feeding.\n\n【5】See a health visitor, midwife or GP if you're concerned about your baby's feeding and think they may have tongue-tie.\n\n【6】Signs of tongue-tie\n-------------------\n\n【7】To breastfeed successfully, a baby needs to latch on to both the breast tissue and nipple, and their tongue needs to cover the lower gum so the nipple is protected from damage.\n\n【8】Some babies with tongue-tie are not able to open their mouths wide enough to latch on to the breast properly.\n\n【9】If you're breastfeeding your baby and they have tongue-tie they may:\n\n【10】*   have difficulty attaching to the breast or staying attached for a full feed\n*   feed for a long time, have a short break, then feed again\n*   be unsettled and seem to be hungry all the time\n*   not gain weight as quickly as they should\n*   make a \"clicking\" sound as they feed – this can also be a sign you need support with the positioning and attachment of your baby at the breast\n\n【11】Tongue-tie can also sometimes cause problems for a breastfeeding mother. Problems can include:\n\n【12】*   sore or cracked nipples\n*   low milk supply\n*   mastitis (inflammation of the breast), which may keep coming back\n\n【13】Most breastfeeding problems, however, are not caused by tongue-tie and can be overcome with the right support.\n\n【14】If you're finding breastfeeding difficult, ask a midwife, health visitor or a breastfeeding specialist for help.\n删除7：<u>Read more about breastfeeding problems and how to overcome them.</u>\n\n【15】### Other signs of tongue-tie\n\n【16】Other signs that may indicate your baby has tongue-tie include:\n\n【17】*   difficulty lifting their tongue up or moving it from side to side\n*   difficulty sticking their tongue out\n*   their tongue looks heart-shaped when they stick it out\n\n【18】Treating tongue-tie\n-------------------\n\n【19】Treatment is not always needed, if your baby has tongue-tie but can feed without any problems. If their feeding is affected, treatment involves a simple procedure called tongue-tie division.\n\n【20】### Tongue-tie division\n\n【21】Tongue-tie division involves cutting the short, tight piece of skin connecting the underside of the tongue to the bottom of the mouth.\n\n【22】It's a quick, simple and almost painless procedure that usually improves feeding straight away.\n\n【23】#### The procedure\n\n【24】Tongue-tie division is done by doctors, nurses or midwives.\n\n【25】In very young babies (those who are only a few months old), it is usually done without anaesthetic (painkilling medicine).\n\n【26】The procedure does not seem to hurt babies. This is because there are very few nerve endings in the area around the bottom of the mouth. Some babies sleep through the procedure, while others may cry a bit.\n\n【27】A general anaesthetic is usually needed for older babies with teeth, which means they'll be unconscious throughout the procedure.\n\n【28】The baby's head is held securely while sharp, sterile scissors with blunt ends are used to cut the skin.\n\n【29】It only takes a few seconds, and you can start feeding your baby immediately afterwards.\n\n【30】There should not be much bleeding. Your baby may get a white patch (ulcer) under their tongue, but this should heal in 1 to 2 days. It will not bother your baby.\n\n【31】Research suggests most babies who have treatment for tongue-tie find breastfeeding easier afterwards.\n\n【32】The Association of Tongue-tie Practitioners (ATP) can help you find a tongue-tie practitioner.\n\n【33】Older children and adults\n-------------------------\n\n【34】Untreated tongue-tie may not cause any problems as a child gets older, and any tightness may resolve naturally as the mouth develops.\n\n【35】However, tongue-tie can sometimes cause problems such as speech difficulties and difficulty eating certain foods.\n\n【36】Speak to a GP if you think you or your child are having problems caused by tongue-tie.\n\n【37】Tongue-tie division can be carried out in older children and adults, although it's usually done under general anaesthetic.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 05 March 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 05 March 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "0f5d6404-d3cd-41fd-99eb-85c38527417c", "title": "Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis)", "text": "【0】Bladder pain syndrome (interstitial cystitis)\n=============================================\n\n【1】**Bladder pain syndrome is a poorly understood condition where you have pelvic pain and problems peeing.**\n\n【2】It's sometimes called interstitial cystitis (IC) or painful bladder syndrome (PBS).\n\n【3】It's difficult to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis) as there is no single test that confirms the condition.\n\n【4】Symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis)\n---------------------------------------\n\n【5】The main symptoms of BPS (interstitial cystitis) include:\n\n【6】*   intense pelvic pain (felt over your lower tummy)\n*   sudden strong urges to pee\n*   needing to pee more often than usual\n*   pain in your lower tummy when your bladder is filling up, which is relieved when you pee\n*   waking up several times during the night to pee\n\n【7】Other symptoms can include finding it difficult to pee, urinary incontinence and blood in your urine (haematuria).\n\n【8】These symptoms can sometimes be caused by other conditions, such as cancer of the bladder. This is why you'll need a range of tests to rule out other possible causes before BPS (interstitial cystitis) can be diagnosed.\n\n【9】Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if you have blood in your urine and pain in your lower tummy.\n\n【10】Blood in your pee may be bright pink, red or dark brown.\n\n【11】Who gets BPS (interstitial cystitis)\n------------------------------------\n\n【12】Although BPS (interstitial cystitis) can affect people of all ages, it's much more common in women than men, usually over the age of 30.\n\n【13】The symptoms will often come and go over time. There may be times lasting days, weeks or months where your symptoms improve, followed by flare-ups when they're worse.\n\n【14】You might also find the pain is worse during your period or after having certain foods or drinks.\n\n【15】It can have a big impact on your everyday life, including work, mental health and relationships. But when a diagnosis is confirmed there are different treatments that can help.\n\n【16】What causes interstitial cystitis?\n----------------------------------\n\n【17】The exact cause of BPS (interstitial cystitis) is not clear. However, there are several ideas about what might cause it.\n\n【18】These include:\n\n【19】*   damage to the bladder lining, which may mean pee can irritate the bladder and surrounding nerves\n*   a problem with the pelvic floor muscles used to control peeing\n*   your immune system causing an inflammatory reaction\n\n【20】Some people who have been diagnosed with BPS (interstitial cystitis), may have a long-term (chronic) urinary infection (UTI) in the bladder, which has not been picked up by current urine tests.\n\n【21】BPS (interstitial cystitis) may also be associated with chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia, myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n【22】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【23】See a GP if:\n\n【24】*   you have pelvic pain that does not go away\n*   you notice a change in your usual peeing pattern and it is affecting your daily life\n\n【25】Ask for an urgent GP appointment if you have blood in your pee.\n\n【26】### What happens when you see a GP\n\n【27】BPS (interstitial cystitis) can have similar symptoms to long-term or frequent UTIs, so the GP may give you a urine test to check for a UTI.\n\n【28】Standard urine tests used in GP surgeries and hospitals may not pick up all infections of the bladder. You may be prescribed antibiotics to see if they help.\n\n【29】A GP may also suggest simple treatments such as:\n\n【30】*   keeping a food diary and avoiding foods and drinks that make your symptoms worse\n*   stopping smoking – chemicals in tobacco can irritate your bladder\n\n【31】### When to ask a GP for referral to a hospital specialist\n\n【32】Treatments from the GP may not always work. If your symptoms keep coming back or do not go away, ask the GP to refer you to a urologist specialising in female urology or a urogynaecologist.\n\n【33】Men may be referred to a urologist.\n\n【34】How is BPS (interstitial cystitis) diagnosed?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【35】There is no single test to diagnose BPS (interstitial cystitis). You may have several tests to exclude other causes of your symptoms before a diagnosis can be confirmed.\n\n【36】The tests offered may include:\n\n【37】*   cystoscopy – a procedure to look inside your bladder using a thin camera called a cystoscope\n*   urine tests\n*   ultrasound, MRI scan or CT scan of the urinary tract and sometimes of the kidneys too\n*   urodynamics – a range of tests to check the function of your bladder and urethra\n*   vaginal swabs\n\n【38】Ask your doctor to explain what tests you are being offered and what they're for.\n\n【39】Treatments for BPS (interstitial cystitis)\n------------------------------------------\n\n【40】When you have been diagnosed by a specialist as having BPS (interstitial cystitis), there are several treatments that may help.\n\n【41】No single treatment works for everyone, and there is no conclusive evidence they work. You may need to try several treatments to find one that works for you.\n\n【42】Ask your hospital specialist to explain the treatments offered to you and why.\n\n【43】### Medicines\n\n【44】Tablets or capsules may be used to treat people with BPS (interstitial cystitis).\n\n【45】These include:\n\n【46】*   over-the-counter painkillers – such as paracetamol and ibuprofen\n*   medicines for nerve pain – such as amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin\n*   tolterodine, solifenacin or mirabegron – these can reduce the urgency to pee\n*   a prescription medicine that may help by blocking the effect of a substance called histamine in the bladder\n*   pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) – this may reduce pain (this can only be prescribed by a specialist as it's only suitable for some people)\n\n【47】### Bladder instillations\n\n【48】Some medicines can also be passed directly into the bladder using a thin tube called a catheter.\n\n【49】These are known as intravesical medicines or bladder instillations.\n\n【50】Examples of intravesical medicines include:\n\n【51】*   lignocaine - a local anaesthetic that numbs the bladder,\n*   a mixture of compounds including steroids, sodium bicarbonate and heparin are used\n*   hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulphate – this may help restore the bladder lining\n*   antibiotics alone or combined with a local anaesthetic and steroid – this can calm inflammation and reduce infection\n\n【52】As with oral medicines, the evidence is not conclusive for bladder instillations. Ask your hospital specialist to explain the different options.\n\n【53】### Supportive therapies and treatments\n\n【54】Some people may also find the following therapies and supportive treatments helpful:\n\n【55】*   physiotherapy – a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist can help you relax your muscles to ease pain.\n*   acupuncture – may help with pain relief\n*   talking therapies and counselling – to help you cope with your symptoms and their impact on your life\n*   transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) – where a small battery-operated device is used to relieve pain by sending electrical impulses into your body\n*   pain management – ask the GP to refer you to a pain specialist\n\n【56】### Surgery and procedures\n\n【57】Surgery and other procedures may be recommended if you have clear abnormal areas (lesions) in your bladder or other treatments do not work.\n\n【58】Procedures that may be carried out include:\n\n【59】*   cauterisation – ulcers inside the bladder are sealed using an electrical current or laser\n*   bladder distension – the bladder is stretched with fluid, which can aid diagnosis and may temporarily relieve symptoms\n*   botulinum toxin injections (such as Botox) – injected directly into your bladder wall to temporarily relieve symptoms of frequent peeing and pain.\n*   neuromodulation – an implant that stimulates your nerves with electricity is placed in your body to relieve pain and reduce sudden urges to pee\n\n【60】In very rare cases, and only as a last resort, it may be necessary to remove the bladder completely (cystectomy).\n\n【61】If this is done, your surgeon may need to create an alternative way for pee to leave your body.\n\n【62】Things you can do to help BPS (interstitial cystitis)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【63】Things that may help improve your symptoms include:\n\n【64】*   reducing stress – try exercise, warm baths and mindfulness-based meditation techniques\n*   making sure you are hydrated regularly throughout the day\n*   keeping a food diary – if you notice certain foods or drinks (like citrus fruits and alcohol) make symptoms worse, avoid them, but ask for medical advice first\n*   stopping smoking – the chemicals in cigarettes can irritate your bladder\n\n【65】Information:\n\n【66】**More information and support**\n--------------------------------\n\n【67】Bladder Health UK has information and forums on BPS (interstitial cystitis) as well as other bladder conditions\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 18 February 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 18 February 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's painful if it presses on nerves. It usually gets better slowly with rest, gentle exercise and painkillers.\n\n【2】Check if it's a slipped disc\n----------------------------\n\n【3】A slipped disc (also called a prolapsed or herniated disc) can cause:\n\n【4】*   lower back pain\n*   numbness or tingling in your shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs or feet\n*   neck pain\n*   problems bending or straightening your back\n*   muscle weakness\n*   pain in the buttocks, hips or legs if the disc is pressing on the sciatic nerve (sciatica)\n\n【5】Not all slipped discs cause symptoms. Many people will never know they have slipped a disc.\n\n【6】### Other causes of back pain\n\n【7】Sometimes the pain may be a result of an injury such as a sprain or strain, but often there's no obvious reason.\n\n【8】Back pain is rarely caused by anything serious.\n\n【9】How you can ease the pain from a slipped disc yourself\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】### Keep active\n\n【11】If the pain is very bad, you may need to rest at first. But start gentle exercise as soon as you can – it'll help you get better faster.\n\n【12】The type of exercise is not important, just gradually increase your activity level.\n\n【13】### Take painkillers\n\n【14】Alternate painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol. Paracetamol on its own is not recommended for back pain.\n\n【15】Take them regularly (up to the recommended daily amount) rather than just when the pain is particularly bad. This will help you to keep moving.\n\n【16】A pharmacist can help with a slipped disc\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are not suitable for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist if you're not sure.\n\n【18】Stronger painkillers containing codeine may help for pain that's just started.\n\n【19】But these types of painkillers can cause addiction and should only be used for a few days.\n\n【20】Find a pharmacy\n\n【21】### Non-urgent advice: See a GP if you have back pain and:\n\n【22】*   painkillers are not helping\n*   the pain is no better after a month\n*   a very high temperature or you feel hot and shivery\n*   unexplained weight loss\n*   a swelling in your back\n*   the pain is worse at night\n\n【23】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if you have back pain and:\n\n【24】*   numbness around your bottom or genitals\n*   cannot pee\n*   lose feeling in 1 or both legs\n*   cannot control when you pee or poo\n*   got it after a serious accident, such as a car accident\n\n【25】### What happens at your appointment\n\n【26】Your GP will usually be able to tell if you have a slipped disc from your symptoms.\n\n【27】You may also have a physical examination. Your GP might ask you to raise your arms or do simple leg exercises to find out where the slipped disc is.\n\n【28】Treatment for a slipped disc from a GP\n--------------------------------------\n\n【29】A GP might prescribe a stronger painkiller, a steroid injection or a muscle relaxant to use in the short term.\n\n【30】If your symptoms do not get better, a GP might recommend further tests, like an MRI scan.\n\n【31】They might also refer you to a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy from the NHS might not be available everywhere and waiting times can be long. You can also get it privately.\n\n【32】Find a physiotherapist\n\n【33】Surgery for a slipped disc\n--------------------------\n\n【34】Surgery is not usually needed, but a GP might refer to you a specialist to discuss surgery if your symptoms:\n\n【35】*   have not improved using other treatments\n*   include worsening muscle weakness, or numbness\n\n【36】Alternative treatments for a slipped disc\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【37】There's some evidence that manual therapies, like osteopathy, can help ease lower back pain.\n\n【38】You'll usually have to pay for this treatment privately.\n\n【39】What causes a slipped disc\n--------------------------\n\n【40】They can happen because of:\n\n【41】*   ageing\n*   exercising too hard\n*   lifting heavy objects the wrong way\n*   vibration from driving or operating machinery\n*   being inactive or overweight\n\n【42】To help prevent a slipped disc\n------------------------------\n\n【43】### Do\n\n【44】*   keep active – take regular exercise\n\n【45】*   use a safe technique when lifting heavy objects\n\n【46】### Don’t\n\n【47】*   do not smoke – nicotine weakens the disc tissue\n\n【48】删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 March 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 March 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It comes as a twisthaler type of inhaler.\n\n【3】Some inhalers contain mometasone mixed with other medicines that help your breathing (bronchodilators). They are Breezehalers which are a different type of inhaler (brand names Atectura and Enerzair).\n\n【4】Mometasone is a type of medicine known as a steroid (or corticosteroid).

This is to prevent infections and a sore mouth.\n*   Using mometasone inhalers can mean you're more likely to get infections. Tell your doctor if you get an infection, such as COVID-19, or if you come into contact with anyone who has shingles, chickenpox or measles. These infections can make you very ill. This is particularly important for children.\n*   You may get a blue steroid treatment card if you need high doses of mometasone to control your symptoms.

It can appear on your tummy, chest, back or neck, and less often on your face or scalp, or near your genitals.\n\n【10】### Widespread rash\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【11】ISM/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/694054/view</u>\n\n【12】Up to 2 weeks after the herald patch appears, a more widespread rash develops, which may continue to spread over the following 2 to 6 weeks.\n\n【13】This rash is small, raised, scaly patches that usually range in size up to 1.5cm. Most people get many patches on their chest, back, tummy, neck, upper arms and upper thighs. The face is not usually affected.\n\n【14】The rash is not painful, but it can be itchy.\n\n【15】In light-skinned people the patches are usually a pinkish-red. In dark-skinned people the patches can sometimes be grey, dark brown or black.\n\n【16】Both the herald patch and rash usually last for 2 to 12 weeks, although they can last for up to 5 months.\n\n【17】After the rash has gone, you may have some darker or lighter areas of skin. These should return to normal within a few months and will not leave permanent scarring.\n\n【18】When to see a GP\n----------------\n\n【19】See a GP if you have an unexplained rash. They'll usually be able to confirm whether it's pityriasis rosea, or another skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis or ringworm.\n\n【20】If the GP is uncertain, they may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).\n\n【21】Treating pityriasis rosea\n-------------------------\n\n【22】Pityriasis rosea usually gets better without treatment within 12 weeks. Treatment is not needed unless you experience discomfort and itching.\n\n【23】Possible treatments for pityriasis rosea include:\n\n【24】*   emollients – creams that moisturise and soothe the skin. Some emollients can be used as soap, and are often recommended, because normal soap can irritate the rash. You can buy these over the counter from most pharmacists\n*   steroid creams or ointments – such as hydrocortisone and betamethasone cream. These are prescribed by a GP and can reduce swelling and relieve itching\n*   antihistamines – if you're having trouble sleeping because of the itching, a GP may prescribe an antihistamine that will make you feel sleepy, such as hydroxyzine or chlorphenamine\n*   UVB light therapy – if other treatments do not work, you may be referred for UVB light therapy\n\n【25】What causes pityriasis rosea?\n-----------------------------\n\n【26】It's not known what causes pityriasis rosea. One theory is that the rash may be caused by a viral infection.\n\n【27】Pityriasis rosea is not contagious and cannot be spread to other people through physical contact.\n\n【28】Pityriasis versicolor\n---------------------\n\n【29】Pityriasis versicolor is another common skin condition that can be confused with pityriasis rosea, as the rash may look similar.\n\n【30】But there are important differences between these 2 conditions. Pityriasis versicolor is caused by a yeast infection and can be treated with antifungal medicines, including antifungal creams and antifungal shampoos.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 13 March 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 13 March 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The best way to protect loved ones is to quit smoking. At the very least, make sure you have a smokefree home and car.**\n\n【2】When you smoke a cigarette (or roll-up, pipe or cigar), most of the smoke doesn't go into your lungs, it goes into the air around you where anyone nearby can breathe it in.\n\n【3】Secondhand smoke is the smoke that you exhale plus the \"sidestream\" smoke created by the lit end of your cigarette.\n\n【4】When friends and family breathe in your secondhand smoke – what we call passive smoking – it isn't just unpleasant for them, it can damage their health too.\n\n【5】People who breathe in secondhand smoke regularly are more likely to get the same diseases as smokers, including lung cancer and heart disease.\n\n【6】Pregnant women exposed to passive smoke are more prone to premature birth and their baby is more at risk of low birthweight and sudden infant death syndrome (cot death).\n\n【7】And children who live in a smoky house are at higher risk of breathing problems, asthma, and allergies.\n\n【8】How to protect against secondhand smoke\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】The only way to protect your friends and family from secondhand smoke is to keep the environment around them smoke free.\n\n【10】The best way to do that is to quit smoking completely. If you're not ready to quit, make every effort to keep your cigarette smoke away from other people and never smoke indoors or in the car.\n\n【11】You should:\n\n【12】*   always smoke outside\n*   ask your visitors to smoke outside\n*   not smoke in the car or allow anyone else to\n\n【13】Take steps NOW to stop smoking.\n\n【14】The risks of passive smoking\n----------------------------\n\n【15】Secondhand smoke is a lethal cocktail of more than 4,000 irritants, toxins and cancer-causing substances.\n\n【16】Most secondhand smoke is invisible and odourless, so no matter how careful you think you're being, people around you still breathe in the harmful poisons.\n\n【17】Opening windows and doors or smoking in another room in the house doesn't protect people. Smoke can linger in the air for 2 to 3 hours after you've finished a cigarette, even with a window open. Also, even if you limit smoking to one room, the smoke will spread to the rest of the house where people will inhale it.\n\n【18】Children and passive smoking\n----------------------------\n\n【19】Passive smoking is especially harmful for children as they have less well-developed airways, lungs and immune systems.\n\n【20】Children who live in a household where at least 1 person smokes are more likely to develop:\n\n【21】*   asthma\n*   chest infections – like pneumonia and bronchitis\n*   meningitis\n*   ear infections\n*   coughs and colds\n\n【22】Children are particularly vulnerable in the family car where secondhand smoke can reach hazardous levels even with the windows open.\n\n【23】To protect children, smoking in cars and other vehicles carrying children was banned in 2015. It is against the law to smoke in a private vehicle if there's a young person under 18 present.\n\n【24】Read about the law on smoking in private vehicles on GOV.UK.\n\n【25】How safe is e-cig vapour?\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Using e-cigarettes, also known as vaping, does not produce tobacco smoke, so the risks of passive smoking with conventional cigarettes do not apply to e-cigs.\n\n【27】Research into this area is ongoing, but it seems that e-cigs release negligible amounts of nicotine into the atmosphere and the limited evidence available suggests that any risk from passive vaping to bystanders is small relative to tobacco cigarettes.\n\n【28】But as a precaution, it's best not to vape around babies and children if you can avoid it. Young children also often copy adults.\n\n【29】Your GP can give you advice about quitting smoking.\n删除11：<u>More in Quit smoking\n--------------------\n\n【30】*   NHS stop smoking services help you quit\n*   Using e-cigarettes to stop smoking\n*   Passive smoking\n*   Paan, bidi and shisha\n*   Stopping smoking for your mental health\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 5 May 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 5 May 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Availability\n3.  Types\n4.  Afterwards\n5.  Risks</u>\n\n【2】**Weight loss surgery carries a risk of complications, some of which can be serious.**\n\n【3】Before having surgery, speak to your surgeon about the possible benefits and risks of the procedure.\n\n【4】Blood clots\n-----------\n\n【5】You'll have treatment to reduce your risk of blood clots after surgery, such as special leg stockings or blood-thinning medicine, but you can sometimes still get them.\n\n【6】Common places to get blood clots are in the lower leg (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism).\n\n【7】Symptoms can include:\n\n【8】*   your lower leg becoming painful, achy and tender\n*   swelling, redness or warmth in your lower leg\n*   a sharp, stabbing chest pain that may be worse when breathing in\n*   shortness of breath or a cough\n*   feeling faint or dizzy\n\n【9】Contact a GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you think you might have a blood clot.\n\n【10】Wound infection\n---------------\n\n【11】Sometimes the wounds from your surgery can become infected while they're healing.\n\n【12】Signs of a wound infection can include:\n\n【13】*   pain in or around the wound\n*   red, hot and swollen skin\n*   pus coming from the wound\n\n【14】Contact a GP or NHS 111 if you think your wound may be infected. They may prescribe a course of antibiotics.\n\n【15】Gastric band slipping out of place\n----------------------------------\n\n【16】If you have gastric band surgery, there's a small risk that the band could move out of position.\n\n【17】This can cause:\n\n【18】*   heartburn\n*   feeling sick\n*   vomiting\n\n【19】See a GP if you have these symptoms and they do not go away. If your band has moved, you'll need further surgery to put it back in place or remove it.\n\n【20】Leak in the gut\n---------------\n\n【21】In the days or weeks after a gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, there's a small chance that food could leak out into your tummy.\n\n【22】This can cause a serious infection inside your tummy.\n\n【23】Symptoms of a leak can include:\n\n【24】*   a high temperature\n*   a fast heartbeat\n*   tummy pain\n*   chills and shivering\n*   fast breathing\n\n【25】Call your GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. You may need surgery to repair the leak and antibiotics to treat any infection.\n\n【26】Blocked gut\n-----------\n\n【27】Sometimes the stomach or small intestine can become narrower or blocked after weight loss surgery. This can happen as a result of the side effects of the surgery, such as scarring and reduced blood flow to the area.\n\n【28】The blockage can cause a number of complications, including food getting stuck and your gut becoming kinked or twisted.\n\n【29】This can then cause the following symptoms:\n\n【30】*   difficulty swallowing\n*   you keep being sick (vomiting)\n*   tummy pain\n*   not needing to poo as often as usual\n\n【31】Contact a GP or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. You may need to have a procedure to widen or clear the blockage using a thin, flexible tube passed down your throat (endoscope).\n\n【32】Cutting food into small chunks, chewing thoroughly and not drinking during meals can help reduce the risk of a blockage.\n\n【33】Malnutrition\n------------\n\n【34】Weight loss surgery can make it harder for your gut to absorb vitamins and minerals from food, so there's a risk you could become malnourished.\n\n【35】This might not always be obvious, but possible symptoms can include:\n\n【36】*   feeling tired or lacking energy all the time\n*   shortness of breath\n*   noticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\n*   pale skin\n*   pins and needles\n*   feeling weak\n\n【37】Having a balanced diet can help reduce the risk of malnutrition, but most people need to take extra nutritional supplements for life after surgery.\n\n【38】You'll have regular blood tests after surgery to measure your vitamin and mineral levels, so any problems can be picked up and treated.\n\n【39】Gallstones\n----------\n\n【40】It's common to develop gallstones in the first year or two after weight loss surgery. These are small, hard stones in the gallbladder that can form if you lose weight quickly.\n\n【41】The main symptom of gallstones is episodes of severe tummy pain that come on suddenly and can last a few minutes to a few hours.\n\n【42】They can also sometimes cause:\n\n【43】*   a high temperature\n*   a fast heartbeat\n*   yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n*   itchy skin\n*   chills or shivering\n*   confusion\n\n【44】See a GP if you have symptoms of gallstones. You may need an operation to remove your gallbladder.\n\n【45】Excess skin\n-----------\n\n【46】As you lose weight after surgery, you may be left with excess folds and rolls of skin, particularly around your breasts, tummy, hips and limbs.\n\n【47】Surgery, such as a tummy tuck, can be used to remove the excess skin. But its usually considered cosmetic surgery so it is not always available on the NHS.\n\n【48】Ask as GP if surgery to remove excess skin after weight loss surgery is provided on the NHS where you live.\n\n【49】Risk of dying\n-------------\n\n【50】Weight loss surgery is a major operation and there is a chance of dying during the procedure or as a result of a serious complication afterwards.\n\n【51】But this is rare.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 14 April 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 14 April 2023</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Afterwards</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

They also reduce how severe your symptoms are when you're exposed to substances which you're allergic to.\n\n【3】How long does it take to work?\n\n【4】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops usually take a few days to start working, and a few weeks to work fully. Tell your doctor if you do not feel any better after using the eye drops for 2 weeks.\n\n【5】Can I use it for a long time?\n\n【6】You can use sodium cromoglicate eye drops for as long as you are in contact with the substance that triggers your allergy (use them during the hay fever season). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think you need to use them for longer than 2 weeks.\n\n【7】But do not use your bottle of eye drops for longer than 4 weeks. If it is open longer than that, throw it away and start a new one.\n\n【8】How effective is it for hay fever?\n\n【9】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops are often used if you keep getting symptoms, or your symptoms last a long time. You need to use them regularly for several weeks for them to work best.\n\n【10】If your symptoms do not get better, speak to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【11】How do sodium cromoglicate eye drops compare to similar medicines?\n\n【12】Lodoxamide eye drops work in a similar way to sodium cromoglicate eye drops. There is not enough information to say whether one works better than the other.\n\n【13】Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not helping your symptoms.\n\n【14】What will happen if I stop taking it?\n\n【15】If you stop taking sodium cromoglicate eye drops, your symptoms may come back.\n\n【16】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【17】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops do not affect any type of contraception, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【18】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【19】Sodium cromoglicate eye drops can cause blurry vision for a few minutes after using them. If this happens, do not drive, cycle or operate machinery straight away. Wait until your eyes feel OK again and your vision is back to normal.\n\n【20】Can I drink alcohol while using sodium cromoglicate eye drops?\n\n【21】Yes, it is OK to drink alcohol while using these eye drops.\n\n【22】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【23】You can eat and drink normally while using sodium cromoglicate eye drops.\n\n【24】Can lifestyle changes help with hay fever?\n\n【25】It will help if you do not spend too much time outside if the pollen count is high.\n\n【26】### Tips for when you're outside\n\n【27】*   Do not cut grass or walk on grass.\n*   Wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyes.\n*   Put Vaseline around your nostrils to help trap pollen.\n*   Shower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash off pollen.\n\n【28】### Tips for when you're inside\n\n【29】*   Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible.\n*   Vacuum regularly and dust with a damp cloth.\n*   Do not keep fresh flowers in the house.\n*   Do not smoke or be around smoke as it makes hay fever symptoms worse.\n删除11：<u>More in Sodium cromoglicate eye drops\n-------------------------------------\n\n【30】*   About sodium cromoglicate eye drops\n*   Who can and cannot use them\n*   How and when to use them\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Using sodium cromoglicate eye drops with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 22 July 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 22 July 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It's unlikely to be a tumour, but it's best to be sure.\n\n【8】Types\n-----\n\n【9】There are lots of types of brain tumour. They have different names depending on where they are in the brain.\n\n【10】They're also given a number from 1 to 4, known as the grade.\n\n【11】The higher the number, the more serious a tumour is:\n\n【12】*   grade 1 and 2 brain tumours are non-cancerous (benign) tumours that tend to grow quite slowly\n*   grade 3 and 4 brain tumours are cancerous (malignant) tumours that grow more quickly and are more difficult to treat\n\n【13】Brain tumours are also called primary (which start in the brain) and secondary (which spread to the brain).\n\n【14】Cancer Research UK has more on types of brain tumours.\n\n【15】Treatments\n----------\n\n【16】Treatment for a brain tumour aims to remove as much of it as possible and try to stop it coming back.\n\n【17】The main treatments are:\n\n【18】*   surgery – a small section of skull is removed and the tumour is cut out before the piece of skull is fixed back in place\n*   radiotherapy – radiation from an external machine is used to kill cancer cells after surgery\n*   chemotherapy – medicine is used to kill cancer cells after surgery, or relieve symptoms if the tumour can't be removed\n*   radiosurgery – lots of tiny beams of radiation are aimed at the cancer to kill it if you can't have surgery\n*   carmustine implants (glial wafers) – a new way of giving chemotherapy for some high-grade tumours, where implants are inserted into the brain (read more about carmustine implant treatment on Cancer Research UK)\n\n【19】Medicines may also be used to relieve symptoms like headaches, seizures and being sick (vomiting).\n\n【20】Outlook\n-------\n\n【21】The outlook for a malignant brain tumour depends on things like where it is in the brain, its size, and what grade it is.\n\n【22】It can sometimes be cured if caught early on, but a brain tumour often comes back and sometimes it isn't possible to remove it.\n\n【23】Speak to your care team if you'd like to know what the outlook is for you, as it varies from person to person.\n\n【24】You can also find general survival statistics for brain tumours on the Cancer Research UK website.\n\n【25】Recovery and after effects\n--------------------------\n\n【26】After treatment, you might have some lasting problems, such as:\n\n【27】*   seizures\n*   walking difficulties\n*   speech problems\n\n【28】You may need treatment and support like occupational therapy and physiotherapy to help you recover or adapt to any problems.\n\n【29】It's important to follow a healthy lifestyle to lower your risk of stroke.\n\n【30】This means stopping smoking if you smoke, following a healthy diet and doing regular exercise.\n\n【31】You may be able to gradually return to your normal activities as you recover, although some things (like contact sports) may need to be avoided for life.\n\n【32】### Side effects of treatment\n\n【33】Some people who have had a brain tumour can develop side effects from treatment months or years later, such as:\n\n【34】*   cataracts\n*   epilepsy\n*   problems with thinking, memory, language or judgement\n\n【35】Rarely, a stroke might happen.\n\n【36】If you or someone you care for has any worrying symptoms that develop after brain tumour treatment, see your doctor.\n\n【37】If you think it's a stroke, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\n\n【38】More information\n----------------\n\n【39】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information and support, see:</u>\n\n【40】*   The Brain Tumour Charity\n*   Brain Tumour Research\n*   Cancer Research UK: brain tumours\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: brain tumours\n*   Macmillan Cancer Support: brain tumours in children\n删除4：<u>Help us improve our website\n---------------------------\n\n【41】Can you answer some questions about your visit today?\n\n【42】Take our survey\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 06 April 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 06 April 2024</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away.**\n\n【3】In a few cases, if the initial cancer is very small and can be removed during a biopsy, no further treatment may be needed.\n\n【4】Your treatment plan\n-------------------\n\n【5】The recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, as many of the treatments can put a strain on the body.\n\n【6】Discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma.\n\n【7】This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you.\n\n【8】But you shouldn't be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan.\n\n【9】Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.\n\n【10】You'll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins.\n\n【11】You can ask your care team if a clinical trial is available to take part in.\n\n【12】Find clinical trials for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the Cancer Research UK website\n\n【13】Wait-and-see approach\n---------------------\n\n【14】If non-Hodgkin lymphoma is low grade (slow developing) and you're well, a period of \"watch and wait\" is often recommended.\n\n【15】This is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary.\n\n【16】If watch and wait is recommended, you'll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse.\n\n【17】Chemotherapy\n------------\n\n【18】Chemotherapy is a widely used treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma that involves using medicine to kill cancer cells.\n\n【19】It may be used on its own, combined with biological therapy, or combined with radiotherapy.\n\n【20】The medicine can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.\n\n【21】You'll normally get chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), as tablets taken by mouth, or a combination of both.\n\n【22】If there's a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine.\n\n【23】Chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you get treatment during the day and shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight.\n\n【24】But there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed.\n\n【25】If you're taking chemotherapy as tablets, you might be able to take these at home.\n\n【26】Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow.\n\n【27】This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:\n\n【28】*   feeling very tired (fatigue)\n*   breathlessness\n*   increased vulnerability to infection\n*   bleeding and bruising more easily\n\n【29】If you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells.\n\n【30】Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.\n\n【31】Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\n【32】*   nausea and vomiting\n*   diarrhoea\n*   loss of appetite\n*   mouth ulcers\n*   tiredness\n*   skin rashes\n*   hair loss\n*   infertility, which may be temporary or permanent 通用删除1(英):<u>(see complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for more information)</u>\n\n【33】Most side effects should pass once your treatment has finished.\n\n【34】Tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.\n删除7：<u>Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy.</u>\n\n【35】### High-dose chemotherapy\n\n【36】If non-Hodgkin lymphoma doesn't get better with initial treatment (known as refractory lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose.\n\n【37】But this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the side effects mentioned.\n\n【38】You'll need a stem cell or bone marrow transplant to replace the damaged bone marrow.\n\n【39】Radiotherapy\n------------\n\n【40】Radiotherapy is most often used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body.\n\n【41】How long you will need treatment for will depend on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma you have and what stage it's at.\n\n【42】It's normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, usually for no more than 3 weeks.\n\n【43】You shouldn't have to stay in hospital between appointments.\n\n【44】Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated.\n\n【45】For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.\n\n【46】Other common side effects include:\n\n【47】*   sore and red skin in the treatment area\n*   tiredness\n*   nausea and vomiting\n*   dry mouth\n*   loss of appetite\n\n【48】Most side effects are temporary, but there's a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.\n删除7：<u>Read more about:</u>\n\n【49】*   side effects of radiotherapy\n*   complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n【50】Monoclonal antibody therapy\n---------------------------\n\n【51】For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody.\n\n【52】These medicines attach themselves to both healthy and cancerous cells, and signal to the immune system to attack and kill the cells.\n\n【53】Once the treatment is over the level of healthy cells goes back to normal over time.\n\n【54】You may be given monoclonal antibody therapy as your only treatment, or they're sometimes given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective.\n\n【55】For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n【56】This can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future.\n\n【57】One of the main monoclonal antibody medicines used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab. \n\n【58】Rituximab can be given as an injection directly into a vein over the course of a few hours.\n\n【59】Side effects of rituximab can include:\n\n【60】*   tiredness\n*   feeling sick (nausea)\n*   night sweats\n*   an itchy rash\n*   tummy pain\n*   hair loss\n\n【61】You may be given additional medicine to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to rituximab.\n\n【62】Steroid medicine\n----------------\n\n【63】Steroid medicine is commonly used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【64】This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective.\n\n【65】The steroid medicine is normally given as tablets or injections, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy.\n\n【66】You'll usually take the steroids for a few days or 1 week during each cycle of chemotherapy, and take breaks in between. This helps to reduce the side effects.\n\n【67】Common side effects of short-term steroid use include:\n\n【68】*   increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain\n*   indigestion\n*   problems sleeping\n*   feeling agitated\n\n【69】On rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis.\n\n【70】Side effects of long-term steroid use include high blood pressure, weight gain, and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids.\n\n【71】The side effects of steroid medicine usually start to improve once treatment finishes.\n\n【72】Immunotherapy\n-------------\n\n【73】A type of immunotherapy called CAR T-cell therapy can be used for some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, if other treatments have not worked, or your cancer has come back after treatment.\n\n【74】CAR T-cell therapy works by changing immune cells in your body to help them fight cancer cells.\n\n【75】It is given in hospital after a short course of chemotherapy.\n\n【76】You will have tests to check that you are well enough to have CAR T-cell therapy as it can cause severe side effects.\n\n【77】Side effects of CAR T-cell therapy include:\n\n【78】*   a high temperature and chills\n*   headache and dizziness\n*   feeling or being sick\n*   diarrhoea\n*   problems with your brain or nerves, such as confusion and speech problems\n*   infections\n\n【79】After treatment you will stay in hospital for at least 10 days so you can be checked for any side effects.\n\n【80】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【81】After your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked.\n\n【82】Following this, you'll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a relapse).\n\n【83】These appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.\n\n【84】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, see:</u>\n\n【85】*   Lymphoma Action\n*   Cancer Research UK: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n*   Cancer Research UK: living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n*   Macmillan: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n*   Macmillan: after non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment\n\n【86】Your multidisciplinary team\n---------------------------\n\n【87】During your treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may see any of the following professionals:\n\n【88】*   specialist cancer nurse or key worker – the first point of contact between you and the members of the care team\n*   haematologist – a specialist in drug treatments\n*   clinical oncologist – a specialist in radiotherapy\n*   pathologist – a specialist in looking at biopsies\n*   radiologist – a specialist in X-rays and scans\n*   social worker\n*   transplant specialist\n*   psychologist\n*   counsellor\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 20 June 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 20 June 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Diagnosis</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Complications</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.**\n\n【3】It's not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people who are around 70 to 75 years old, and is rare in people under 50.\n\n【4】Several treatments can help reduce the rate at which IPF gets worse, but there's currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs.\n\n【5】Symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【6】The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.\n\n【7】Symptoms can include:\n\n【8】*   shortness of breath\n*   a persistent dry cough\n*   tiredness\n*   loss of appetite and weight loss\n*   rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)\n\n【9】Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape.\n\n【10】But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.\n\n【11】When to get medical advice\n--------------------------\n\n【12】See a GP if you have struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than 3 weeks.\n\n【13】These symptoms are not normal and should not be ignored.\n\n【14】If a GP thinks you could have a lung condition such as IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as:\n\n【15】*   breathing (lung function) tests\n*   blood tests\n*   a chest X-ray and CT scan\n*   a lung biopsy, where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed\n删除7：<u>Find out more about the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</u>\n\n【16】Causes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n---------------------------------------\n\n【17】In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred.\n\n【18】This causes the lungs to become stiff and makes it difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.\n\n【19】The reason this happens is not clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown.\n\n【20】IPF has been linked to:\n\n【21】*   exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust\n*   viral infections\n*   a family history of IPF – around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition\n*   acid reflux\n*   smoking\n\n【22】But it's not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF.\n\n【23】Treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【24】There's currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.\n\n【25】Treatments include:\n\n【26】*   self care measures, such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly\n*   medicines to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib\n*   breathing oxygen through a mask – you can do this while you're at home or while you're out and about\n*   exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily (pulmonary rehabilitation)\n*   a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare\n删除7：<u>Find out more about how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated</u>\n\n【27】### Further information\n\n【28】UK Charities Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Trust provide information and support for people affected by IPF as well as news items about ongoing research into the condition.\n\n【29】Outlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【30】IPF gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable.\n\n【31】Some people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating.\n\n【32】Other problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.\n\n【33】It's very difficult to predict how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【34】Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it's getting worse quickly or slowly.\n\n【35】National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】If you have IPF, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\n\n【37】The NCARDRS help scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat IPF.

It can help with shaking (tremors), slowness and stiffness. These are called motor symptoms because they affect the way you move.\n\n【2】Parkinson's disease can make it harder for your brain to send messages to your muscles. This can make you shake, make your muscles stiff or slow your movements. Co-careldopa works by making it easier for your brain to send messages to your muscles again.\n\n【3】Co-careldopa contains 2 medicines, called levodopa and carbidopa. These are both used for Parkinson's disease.\n\n【4】It’s available on prescription only. It comes as tablets, including slow-release tablets that get the medicine into your body gradually.\n\n【5】Duodopa gel\n-----------\n\n【6】Co-careldopa can sometimes be used as a gel, called Duodopa, that goes through a tube into your small intestine. You’ll need to have surgery to have the tube fitted.\n\n【7】Your specialist may recommend Duodopa gel if your symptoms are difficult to manage and tablets are no longer working.\n\n【8】Key facts\n---------\n\n【9】*   Co-careldopa helps with motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors and stiffness. It does not help with non-motor symptoms such as depression or losing your sense of smell.\n*   You may feel co-careldopa beginning to work after your first dose but it usually takes up to 1 week to feel the full effects.\n*   The most common side effects of co-careldopa are feeling sick or dizzy, problems sleeping and uncontrollable jerking movements.\n*   It's important to take your tablets at the same time each day. This is important to control your symptoms.\n*   Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly.

It's unlikely to cause any side effects in your baby.\n\n【9】Take care that your baby does not touch any areas of your body where you've used hydrocortisone.\n\n【10】If you need to treat your breasts, wash off any cream or ointment from your breasts or nipples, then wash your hands before feeding your baby. It's usually better to use cream rather than ointment when breastfeeding, as it's easier to wash off.\n\n【11】Skin treatments containing hydrocortisone may also contain other ingredients such as antibacterials and antifungals.

Sulfonylureas increase the amount of insulin that your pancreas makes. Insulin is the hormone that controls the level of sugar in your blood.\n\n【3】When will I feel better?\n\n【4】You may not have had any symptoms of diabetes, so you will not necessarily feel any different when you take gliclazide. This does not mean that gliclazide is not working. It's important to keep taking it.\n\n【5】Gliclazide will help keep your blood sugar level stable and reduce your chances of diabetes-related problems in the future.\n\n【6】What will happen if I stop taking gliclazide?\n\n【7】Do not stop taking gliclazide without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking gliclazide suddenly, your diabetes may get worse.\n\n【8】How does gliclazide compare with other diabetes medicines?\n\n【9】There are other groups of medicines that can lower blood sugar levels:\n\n【10】*   metformin\n*   pioglitazone\n*   DPP-4 inhibitors, such as saxagliptin\n*   SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin\n*   GLP-1 agonists, such as exenatide\n*   insulin\n\n【11】Gliclazide can be prescribed on its own or in combination with these medicines. It is usually prescribed if you cannot take metformin, or if metformin is no longer keeping your blood sugar level under control when used by itself.\n\n【12】Gliclazide is a sulfonylurea. There are 4 other sulfonylureas available:\n\n【13】*   glibenclamide\n*   glimepiride\n*   glipizide\n*   tolbutamide\n\n【14】These all work in the same way, by increasing the amount of insulin your body makes.\n\n【15】Will I put on weight?\n\n【16】Gliclazide can make you hungrier, so it can be quite challenging to avoid putting on weight while you're taking it.\n\n【17】Try to eat a healthy, balanced diet without increasing your portion sizes so you do not gain too much weight.\n\n【18】Regular exercise will also help keep your weight stable.\n\n【19】Can I get diabetes medicines for free?\n\n【20】If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your diabetes ones.\n\n【21】To claim your free prescriptions, you'll need to have a medical exemption certificate. The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery.\n\n【22】You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【23】Can I take gliclazide before surgery?\n\n【24】If you're going to have an operation, tell the doctor you're taking gliclazide. This is because gliclazide increases your risk of low blood sugar during the operation.\n\n【25】Low blood sugar can be difficult to detect when a general anaesthetic (that puts you to sleep) is used.\n\n【26】For a few days around the time of your operation, your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin instead.\n\n【27】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【28】Gliclazide does not affect how any type of contraception works.\n\n【29】But you might need your gliclazide dose adjusting if you start taking the combined pill. This is because contraceptive pills can occasionally increase blood sugar levels.\n\n【30】If gliclazide makes you sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.</u>\n\n【31】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【32】If your blood sugar levels are stable, gliclazide should not affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machines or tools.\n\n【33】But if your blood sugar levels become too low, this can reduce your concentration. If this happens to you, do not drive, cycle or use machines or tools until you feel better.\n\n【34】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking gliclazide. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【35】### Important\n\n【36】Do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools if you start to feel the symptoms of low blood sugar.\n\n【37】Can I drink alcohol while taking gliclazide?\n\n【38】Yes, you can drink alcohol while taking gliclazide, but it's best to drink no more than 2 units a day. Drinking more than this can increase the risk of low blood sugar.\n\n【39】Try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week.\n\n【40】Is there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\n【41】It's a good idea to cut down on foods with added sugar. Check the nutrition labels as many foods and drinks are high in sugar, such as:\n\n【42】*   sweets\n*   cakes\n*   biscuits\n*   chocolate\n*   some fizzy drinks\n*   juice drinks\n\n【43】Be careful eating food and drink containing karela, as it can lower your blood sugar levels and mean your diabetes is not controlled as well as it should be. Karela (also called bitter gourd) is used to flavour foods such as curries like bitter gourd masala. It has a bitter taste and is also made into juice and tea.\n\n【44】Can lifestyle changes help my diabetes?\n\n【45】There are some lifestyle changes you can make to help control the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. These include:\n\n【46】*   eating a healthy diet\n*   losing any excess weight\n*   not smoking\n*   cutting down on alcohol – try to keep to the recommended guidelines of no more than 14 units of alcohol a week\n*   exercising – 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is ideal\n删除11：<u>More in Gliclazide\n------------------\n\n【47】*   About gliclazide\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking gliclazide with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 24 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 24 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol μ followed by the letter g (μg).\n\n【6】Folic acid reduces the risk of your baby having a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.\n\n【7】A neural tube defect is when the foetus's spinal cord (part of the body's nervous system) does not form normally.\n\n【8】You might be advised to take a higher dose supplement of 5 milligram (5mg) every day.\n\n【9】You may need to take a 5mg supplement of folic acid if:\n\n【10】*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a neural tube defect\n*   you previously had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect\n*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a family history of neural tube defects\n*   you have diabetes\n\n【11】Your doctor may also recommend a a 5mg supplement if you take certain medicines, such as anti-epilepsy medicine or anti-retroviral medicine for HIV.\n\n【12】Talk to a GP if you think you need a 5mg dose of folic acid, as they can prescribe a higher dose.\n\n【13】You can get folic acid tablets at pharmacies, or talk to a GP about getting a prescription.\n\n【14】Do not worry if you get pregnant unexpectedly and were not taking a folic acid supplement at the time. Start taking them as soon as you find out, until you're past the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【15】Stop smoking\n------------\n\n【16】Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to a variety of health problems, including:\n\n【17】*   premature birth\n*   low birth weight\n*   sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death\n*   miscarriage\n\n【18】Quitting can be hard, no matter how much you want to, but support is available.\n\n【19】NHS Quit Smoking offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking, including when you're pregnant, and can give you details of local support services.\n\n【20】Smoke from other people's cigarettes can damage your baby, so ask your partner, friends and family not to smoke near you.\n\n【21】Cut out alcohol\n---------------\n\n【22】Do not drink alcohol if you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Alcohol can be passed to your unborn baby.\n\n【23】Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby, and the more you drink, the greater the risk.\n\n【24】Find out about alcohol and pregnancy.\n\n【25】Keep to a healthy weight\n------------------------\n\n【26】If you're overweight, you may have problems getting pregnant and fertility treatment is less likely to work.\n\n【27】Being overweight (having a BMI over 25) or obese (having a BMI over 30) also raises the risk of some pregnancy problems, such as high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis, miscarriage and gestational diabetes.\n\n【28】Before you get pregnant you can calculate your BMI. But this may not be accurate once you're pregnant, so consult your midwife or doctor.\n\n【29】Having a healthy diet and doing moderate exercise are advised in pregnancy, and it's important not to gain too much weight.\n\n【30】You can keep to a healthy weight by having a balanced diet and doing regular exercise.\n删除7：<u>Read more about exercise in pregnancy</u>\n\n【31】Know which medicines you can take\n---------------------------------\n\n【32】Not all medicines are safe to take when you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, whether they're on prescription or medicines you can buy in a pharmacy or shop.\n\n【33】Information:\n\n【34】If you take prescribed medicine and you're planning to get pregnant, talk to a doctor.\n\n【35】Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to a doctor.\n\n【36】Find out about medicines in pregnancy.\n\n【37】Vaccinations and infections\n---------------------------\n\n【38】Some infections, such as rubella (German measles), can harm your baby if you catch them during pregnancy.\n\n【39】Most people in the UK are immune to rubella, thanks to the uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.\n\n【40】If you have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, or you're not sure if you have, ask your GP surgery to check your vaccination history.\n\n【41】If you have not had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP surgery.\n\n【42】You should avoid getting pregnant for 1 month after having the MMR vaccination, which means you'll need a reliable method of contraception.\n\n【43】Talk to a doctor if you have a long-term condition\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】If you have a long-term condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes, it could affect the decisions you make about your pregnancy – for example, where you might want to give birth.\n\n【45】Before you get pregnant, have a discussion with your specialist or a GP about getting pregnant.\n\n【46】You can also talk to your GP if you have a mental health condition and are planning to get pregnant. They may be able to refer you to a specialist mental health team who offer support before, during and after pregnancy.\n\n【47】If you're taking medicine for a condition, do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor.\n\n【48】Testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia\n----------------------------------------\n\n【49】Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia are inherited blood disorders that mainly affect people whose ancestors come from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.\n\n【50】If you are pregnant and live in England you will be offered screening tests for these disorders, but you do not have to wait until you're pregnant before you have a test.\n\n【51】If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier for 1 of these disorders, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before starting a family.\n\n【52】You can ask for a free blood test from either a GP or a local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia in pregnancy</u>\n删除11：<u>More in Trying for a baby\n-------------------------\n\n【53】*   Trying to get pregnant\n*   Getting pregnant if you have a mental health condition\n*   Planning your pregnancy\n*   Doing a pregnancy test\n*   Signs and symptoms of pregnancy\n*   How long does it usually take to get pregnant?\n*   Planning another pregnancy\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 April 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 April 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment</u>\n\n【2】**Undescended testicles are a common childhood condition where a boy's testicles are not in their usual place in the scrotum.**\n\n【3】It's estimated about 1 in every 25 boys are born with undescended testicles.\n\n【4】In most cases no treatment is necessary, as the testicles will usually move down into the scrotum naturally during the first 3 to 6 months of life.\n\n【5】But around 1 in 100 boys has testicles that stay undescended unless treated.\n\n【6】The medical term for having 1 or 2 undescended testicles is unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.\n\n【7】When to see your GP\n-------------------\n\n【8】Undescended testicles are usually detected during the newborn physical examination carried out soon after birth, or during a routine check-up at 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n【9】See your GP if at any point you notice that 1 or both of your child's testicles are not in the normal place within the scrotum.\n\n【10】Undescended testicles aren't painful and your child isn't at risk of any immediate health problems, but they should be monitored by a doctor in case treatment is needed later on.\n\n【11】What causes undescended testicles?\n----------------------------------\n\n【12】During pregnancy, the testicles form inside a baby boy's tummy (abdomen) before slowly moving down into the scrotum about a month or 2 before birth.\n\n【13】It's not known exactly why some boys are born with undescended testicles. Most boys with the condition are otherwise completely healthy.\n\n【14】Being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) and having a low birth weight and a family history of undescended testicles may increase the chances of a boy being born with the condition.\n\n【15】Diagnosing undescended testicles\n--------------------------------\n\n【16】Undescended testicles can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination.\n\n【17】This will determine whether the testicles can be felt near the scrotum (palpable) or if they can't be felt at all (impalpable).\n\n【18】This physical examination can sometimes be difficult, so your doctor may need to refer your child to a paediatric surgeon.\n\n【19】No further scans or tests are needed to locate the testicles if they can be felt by the doctor.\n\n【20】If they can't be felt, part of the initial surgical treatment may involve keyhole surgery (a diagnostic laparoscopy) to see if the testicles are inside the abdomen.\n\n【21】How undescended testicles are treated\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】If the testicles haven't descended by 6 months, they're very unlikely to do so and treatment will usually be recommended.\n\n【23】This is because boys with untreated undescended testicles can have fertility problems (infertility) in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer.\n\n【24】Treatment will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum. This is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate.\n\n【25】Surgery is ideally carried out before 12 months of age. If undescended testicles are treated at an early age, the risk of fertility problems and testicular cancer can be reduced.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating undescended testicles.</u>\n\n【26】Retractile testicles\n--------------------\n\n【27】In most boys, the testicles can move in and out of the scrotum at different times, usually changing position as a result of temperature changes or feelings of fear or excitement.\n\n【28】If the testicles move in and out of the scrotum and do not stay ascended, this is known as retractile testicles.\n\n【29】Retractile testicles in young boys aren't a cause for concern, as the affected testicles often settle permanently in the scrotum as they get older.\n\n【30】But they may need to be monitored during childhood because they sometimes don't descend naturally and treatment may be required.\n\n【31】See your GP if you notice that your child's testicles are not within the scrotum. Your GP can carry out an examination to determine whether your child's testicles are undescended or retractile.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 October 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Treatment</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

This helps reduce swelling (inflammation) in people with autoimmune conditions, where your immune system attacks your own body.\n\n【4】For example, it helps reduce the inflammation that causes swollen and stiff joints in rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【5】Hydroxychloroquine is not a painkiller. But because it reduces the inflammation caused by the condition, you may notice that you have less pain as your symptoms improve.\n\n【6】How long does it take to work?\n\n【7】Hydroxychloroquine starts to work gradually.\n\n【8】For inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, it can take 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefits.\n\n【9】It's important to keep taking hydroxychloroquine. You may not feel any different at first, but it is likely to be working.\n\n【10】If you have been taking this medicine for rheumatoid arthritis for a long time (more than 6 months) and you do not feel that it's helping you, speak to your doctor or specialist. Your treatment may need to be reviewed.\n\n【11】### Important\n\n【12】Keep taking hydroxychloroquine until your doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop taking it just because you feel better. If you stop, your symptoms may get worse again.\n\n【13】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【14】You can take hydroxychloroquine for a long time if it's working for you, but your doctor will monitor you while you're taking it.\n\n【15】For example you may have regular full blood counts (tests to check the types and numbers of cells in your blood) and eye examinations.\n\n【16】If you take this medicine for a long time, your doctor will occasionally check your muscles and tendons to make sure they are working properly.\n\n【17】Speak to your doctor if you're worried about taking hydroxychloroquine long term.\n\n【18】Are there other treatments for inflammatory conditions?\n\n【19】There are several different treatments that can help the symptoms of inflammatory conditions. These include medicines, other types of therapy and even surgery.\n\n【20】Other treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include:\n\n【21】*   immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, biological medicines such as adalimumab, and steroids\n*   painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n*   supportive treatments, including physiotherapy\n*   surgery, including joint replacement\n\n【22】Other treatments for lupus include:\n\n【23】*   painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n*   steroids\n*   immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and methotrexate\n*   biological medicines such as belimumab\n\n【24】Other treatments for skin problems where your skin is sensitive to light include:\n\n【25】*   creams and ointments that you put on your skin\n*   steroids\n*   immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and azathioprine\n\n【26】Your doctor will be able to recommend the best treatment for you.\n\n【27】Do I need to be careful of infections?\n\n【28】Hydroxychloroquine is not considered an immunosuppressant but it may lower the number of white cells in your blood. This can make you more likely to get an infection.\n\n【29】It's important to reduce your risk of getting an infection. When possible, avoid close contact with people who you know are unwell.\n\n【30】Tell your doctor if you start to feel unwell, for example if you're getting a sore throat or if you have a high temperature.\n\n【31】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【32】Hydroxychloroquine does not stop any type of contraception from working, including the combined pill and emergency contraception.\n\n【33】However, if hydroxychloroquine makes you vomit, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Read more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.</u>\n\n【34】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【35】It's usually safe to drive or ride a bike when taking hydroxychloroquine. But hydroxychloroquine can sometimes make you feel dizzy or affect your eyesight. If this happens to you, do not drive, ride a bike or use tools or machinery until you feel better.\n\n【36】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking hydroxychloroquine.

In some people, this can cause fainting or fits (seizures).**\n\n【2】Symptoms of long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【3】Some people with long QT syndrome do not have any symptoms. They may only become aware of their condition after having an electrocardiogram (ECG) for another reason.\n\n【4】Those who do have symptoms usually have:\n\n【5】*   **blackouts or** **fainting**, because the heart has stopped pumping blood properly and the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen – the heart's rhythm returns to normal within a few minutes and the person regains consciousness\n*   **seizures**, which sometimes happen instead of a blackout when the brain is starved of oxygen\n*   **heart palpitations**, when the heart is beating in a fast or unpredictable way\n\n【6】These symptoms can start unexpectedly and may be triggered by:\n\n【7】*   stress\n*   a sudden noise – such as an alarm\n*   strenuous exercise – particularly swimming\n*   a slow heart rate during sleep\n\n【8】### Risk of death\n\n【9】The heart usually returns to its normal rhythm after it's been beating abnormally.\n\n【10】But if it continues to beat abnormally and is not treated in time with a defibrillator, the heart will stop pumping and the person will die. This is called cardiac arrest, and the heart rarely returns to normal if it is not electrically corrected with shock.\n\n【11】**Call 999 for an ambulance if someone with long QT syndrome suddenly collapses and does not regain consciousness. If you're able to, perform** **cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)** **until medical help arrives.**\n\n【12】Long QT syndrome is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy, people. It can also be an underlying cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\n【13】Causes of long QT syndrome\n--------------------------\n\n【14】Long QT syndrome is usually caused by a faulty gene inherited from a parent. The abnormal gene affects the heart's electrical activity.\n\n【15】Certain medicines can also trigger long QT syndrome, including some types of:\n\n【16】*   antibiotics\n*   antihistamines\n*   antidepressants\n*   antipsychotics\n*   diuretics\n*   heart medicines\n\n【17】But drug-induced long QT syndrome tends to only affect people who already have a tendency to develop the condition.\n\n【18】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information, see Cardiac Risk in the Young: medicines people with long QT syndrome should avoid.</u>\n\n【19】Diagnosing long QT syndrome\n---------------------------\n\n【20】A GP may recommend you have an ECG and refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist) if:\n\n【21】*   you have long QT syndrome\n*   you have blackouts during exercise\n*   you have a family history of unexpected and unexplained sudden death\n\n【22】An ECG records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. If you have long QT syndrome, the trace of the QT section (showing part of the heartbeat) will be longer than normal. Sometimes an exercise ECG will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Genetic testing may be needed to identify the faulty gene causing long QT syndrome. It can also help identify other family members who may have inherited the faulty gene and need clinical assessment.\n\n【24】Treating long QT syndrome \n--------------------------\n\n【25】Most people with inherited long QT syndrome will need treatment with medicines. Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, may be prescribed to help control irregular heartbeats and slow down your heart rate.\n\n【26】If your symptoms are frequent or severe, and you have a high risk of having a life-threatening arrhythmia, you may need to have a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.\n\n【27】In some cases of long QT syndrome, surgery may be needed to control the flow of chemicals into the heart. This is known as a sympathectomy.\n\n【28】If medicines are causing long QT syndrome, your medicines will be reviewed and an alternative may be prescribed.\n\n【29】Living with long QT syndrome\n----------------------------\n\n【30】With the right treatment, it's possible to avoid long QT syndrome having a major impact on your day-to-day life. However, you may need to make some lifestyle adjustments to reduce your risk of having blackouts.\n\n【31】For example, you may not be able to exercise strenuously or play competitive sports, and may need to try to avoid startling noises, such as alarm clocks. Avoiding stressful situations may also be recommended.\n\n【32】Rehydrating properly after a tummy upset is also essential, usually with supplements containing salt and sugar.\n\n【33】Your doctor may prescribe potassium supplements or suggest increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods in your diet. Good sources of potassium include:\n\n【34】*   bananas\n*   vegetables\n*   pulses\n*   nuts and seeds\n*   milk\n*   fish\n*   shellfish\n*   beef\n*   chicken\n*   turkey\n*   bread\n\n【35】Always tell medical staff that you have long QT syndrome. Any new medicine, whether prescription or over the counter, will need to be carefully checked to see if it's suitable for you.\n\n【36】通用删除3(英):<u>For more information you can get a booklet about life with inherited abnormal heart rhythms from the British Heart Foundation.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 26 October 2020  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 26 October 2023</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Recovery</u>\n\n【2】**The decision to have knee surgery will depend on the extent of damage to your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), if there is other knee damage and if your quality of life is affected.**\n\n【3】If your knee feels stable and you do not have an active lifestyle, you may decide not to have ACL surgery.\n\n【4】But delaying surgery could cause further damage to your knee, if it gives way or becomes unstable.\n\n【5】Your doctor will discuss options with you and assess if you need surgery, once swelling goes down and if rest and physio has helped to treat your symptoms.\n\n【6】Things to consider\n------------------\n\n【7】When deciding whether to have ACL surgery, the following factors should be taken into consideration:\n\n【8】*   your age – older people who are not very active may be less likely to need surgery\n*   your lifestyle – for example, whether you'll be able to follow the rehabilitation programme after having surgery\n*   how often you play sports – you may need to have surgery if you play sports regularly\n*   your occupation – for example, whether you do any form of manual labour\n*   how unstable your knee is – if your knee is very unstable, you're at increased risk of doing further damage if you do not have surgery\n*   whether you have any other injuries – for example, your menisci (small discs of cartilage that act as shock absorbers) may also be torn and may heal better when repaired at the same time as ACL reconstruction\n\n【9】Children\n--------\n\n【10】If necessary, children can also have ACL reconstructive surgery. But as they're still growing, the procedure is likely to be modified to ensure that the growth areas are not affected.\n\n【11】It's a trickier operation and may need to be carried out by a surgeon with a special interest in childhood injuries.\n\n【12】If surgery is not possible, a brace and refraining from sports until the child is fully grown may be an alternative.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 15 September 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 15 September 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Knee ligament surgery</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Preparations</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Lifestyle FAQs\n7.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**If left untreated, hepatitis C can sometimes cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). This can develop up to 20 years or more after you first become infected.**\n\n【3】A number of things can increase your risk of getting cirrhosis, including:\n\n【4】*   drinking alcohol\n*   smoking\n*   being overweight\n*   having type 2 diabetes\n*   getting hepatitis C at an older age\n*   having HIV\n*   having another type of hepatitis, such as hepatitis B\n\n【5】Overall, up to 1 in every 3 people infected with hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis within 20 to 30 years. Some of these will then go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.\n\n【6】Cirrhosis\n---------\n\n【7】If you have cirrhosis, the scarred tissue in your liver gradually replaces healthy tissue and prevents the liver from working properly.\n\n【8】There are usually few symptoms in the early stages. But as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you may experience:\n\n【9】*   tiredness and weakness\n*   loss of appetite\n*   weight loss\n*   feeling sick\n*   very itchy skin\n*   tenderness or pain in your tummy\n*   tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin\n*   yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\n【10】There's no cure for cirrhosis. However, lifestyle measures and hepatitis C medications can help stop the condition getting worse.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating cirrhosis.</u>\n\n【11】Liver failure\n-------------\n\n【12】In severe cases of cirrhosis, the liver loses most or all of its functions. This is known as liver failure or end-stage liver disease.\n\n【13】Each year, around 1 in every 20 people with hepatitis-associated cirrhosis will develop liver failure.\n\n【14】Symptoms of liver failure include:\n\n【15】*   hair loss\n*   build-up of fluid in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema)\n*   build-up of fluid in your tummy (ascites)\n*   dark urine\n*   black, tarry poo or very pale poo\n*   frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums\n*   bruising easily\n*   the whites of your eyes turning yellow, or your skin turning yellow, although this may be less noticeable on black or brown skin\n*   vomiting blood\n\n【16】It's usually possible to live with liver failure for several years by taking medication. However, a liver transplant is currently the only way to cure the condition.\n\n【17】Liver cancer\n------------\n\n【18】Having hepatitis-associated cirrhosis increases your risk of developing liver cancer.\n\n【19】Symptoms of liver cancer can include:\n\n【20】*   loss of appetite\n*   unintentional weight loss\n*   tiredness\n*   feeling and being sick\n*   pain or swelling in your tummy\n*   jaundice\n\n【21】Unfortunately, it's not usually possible to cure liver cancer, especially in people with cirrhosis, although treatment can help control your symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treatment for liver cancer.</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 27 October 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 27 October 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Lifestyle FAQs</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

An adult portion of fruit or vegetables is 80g.**\n\n【2】The guide below will give you an indication of typical portion sizes for adults.\n\n【3】Children should also eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\n【4】The amount of food a child needs varies with age, body size and levels of physical activity.\n\n【5】As a rough guide, 1 portion is the amount they can fit in the palm of their hand.\n\n【6】5 A Day fruit portions\n----------------------\n\n【7】### Small fresh fruit\n\n【8】A portion is 2 or more small fruit – for example, 2 plums, 2 satsumas, 2 kiwi fruit, 3 apricots, 6 lychees, 7 strawberries or 14 cherries.\n\n【9】### Medium fresh fruit\n\n【10】A portion is 1 piece of fruit, such as 1 apple, banana, pear, orange or nectarine.\n\n【11】### Large fresh fruit\n\n【12】A portion is half a grapefruit, 1 slice of papaya, 1 slice of melon (5cm slice), 1 large slice of pineapple or 2 slices of mango (5cm slices).\n\n【13】### Dried fruit\n\n【14】A portion of dried fruit is around 30g. This is about 1 heaped tablespoon of raisins, currants or sultanas, 1 tablespoon of mixed fruit, 2 figs, 3 prunes or 1 handful of dried banana chips. \n\n【15】But dried fruit can be high in sugar and can be bad for your teeth.\n\n【16】Try to swap dried fruit for fresh fruit, especially between meals.\n\n【17】To reduce the risk of tooth decay, dried fruit is best enjoyed as part of a meal – as dessert, for example, not as a between-meal snack.\n\n【18】### Tinned or frozen fruit\n\n【19】A portion is roughly the same quantity of fruit that you would eat for a fresh portion, such as 2 pear or peach halves, 6 apricot halves, 8 segments of tinned grapefruit, or 2 handfuls (4 heaped tablespoons) of frozen blueberries.\n\n【20】Choose fruit canned in natural juice, rather than syrup.\n\n【21】5 A Day vegetable portions\n--------------------------\n\n【22】### Green vegetables\n\n【23】A portion is 2 broccoli spears, 2 heaped tablespoons of cooked spinach or 4 heaped tablespoons of cooked kale, spring greens or green beans.\n\n【24】### Cooked vegetables\n\n【25】The same quantity as you would eat for a fresh portion. For example, a portion is 3 heaped tablespoons of cooked vegetables, such as carrots, peas or sweetcorn, or 8 cauliflower florets.\n\n【26】### Salad vegetables\n\n【27】A portion is 3 celery sticks, a 5cm piece of cucumber, 1 medium tomato or 7 cherry tomatoes.\n\n【28】### Tinned and frozen vegetables\n\n【29】The same quantity as you would eat for a fresh portion. For example, 3 heaped tablespoons of tinned or frozen carrots, peas or sweetcorn count as 1 portion each.\n\n【30】For tinned, choose those canned in water with no added salt or sugar.\n\n【31】### Pulses and beans\n\n【32】A portion is 3 heaped tablespoons of baked beans, haricot beans, kidney beans, cannellini beans, butter beans or chickpeas.\n\n【33】Remember, however much of these you eat, beans and pulses can only count as a maximum of 1 portion of your 5 A Day.\n\n【34】### Potatoes\n\n【35】Potatoes don't count towards your 5 A Day. This is the same for yams, cassava and plantain, too. \n\n【36】They're classified nutritionally as a starchy food, because when they're eaten as part of a meal they're usually used in place of other sources of starch, such as bread, rice or pasta. \n\n【37】Although they don't count towards your 5 A Day, potatoes do play an important role in your diet as a starchy food.\n\n【38】You can learn more in 5 A Day: what counts?\n\n【39】5 A Day in juices and smoothies\n-------------------------------\n\n【40】Unsweetened 100% fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies can only ever count as a maximum of 1 portion of your 5 A Day.\n\n【41】For example, if you have 2 glasses of fruit juice and a smoothie in 1 day, that still only counts as 1 portion.\n\n【42】Smoothies include any drink made up of any combination of fruit or vegetable juice, purée, or all the edible pulped fruit or vegetable.\n\n【43】Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies shouldn't be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.\n\n【44】For example, if you have 150ml of orange juice and 150ml smoothie in 1 day, you'll have exceeded the recommendation by 150ml.\n\n【45】When fruit is blended or juiced, it releases the sugars. This increases the risk of tooth decay, so it's best to drink fruit juice or smoothies at mealtimes.\n\n【46】Whole fruits are less likely to cause tooth decay because the sugars are contained within the structure of the fruit.\n\n【47】Watch out for drinks that say \"juice drink\" on the pack as they're unlikely to count towards your 5 A Day and can be high in sugar.\n\n【48】5 A Day and ready-made foods\n----------------------------\n\n【49】Fruit and vegetables contained in shop-bought, ready-made foods can also count toward your 5 A Day.\n\n【50】Always read the label. Some ready-made foods contain high levels of fat, salt and sugar, so only have them occasionally or in small amounts as part of a healthy, balanced diet.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about food labels</u>\n删除11：<u>More in 5 A Day\n---------------\n\n【51】*   Why 5 A Day?\n*   5 A Day: what counts?\n*   5 A Day portion sizes\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 19 July 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 19 July 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It can happen naturally, or as a side effect of some treatments.**\n\n【2】For most women, the menopause starts between the ages of 45 and 55.\n\n【3】If you're under 45 and have noticed your periods becoming infrequent or stopping altogether, you should speak to a GP.\n\n【4】Causes of early menopause\n-------------------------\n\n【5】### The ovaries stop working\n\n【6】Early menopause can happen naturally if a woman's ovaries stop making normal levels of certain hormones, particularly the hormone oestrogen.\n\n【7】This is sometimes called premature ovarian failure, or primary ovarian insufficiency.\n\n【8】The cause of premature ovarian failure is often unknown, but in some women it may be caused by:\n\n【9】*   chromosome abnormalities – such as in women with Turner syndrome\n*   an autoimmune disease – where the immune system starts attacking body tissues\n*   certain infections, such as tuberculosis, malaria and mumps – but this is very rare\n\n【10】Premature ovarian failure can sometimes run in families. This might be the case if any of your relatives went through the menopause at a very young age (20s or early 30s).\n\n【11】### Cancer treatments\n\n【12】Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause premature ovarian failure. This may be permanent or temporary.\n\n【13】Your risk of having an early menopause will depend on:\n\n【14】*   your age – girls who have not yet reached puberty can tolerate stronger treatment than older women\n*   the type of treatment you're given – different types of chemotherapy may affect the ovaries differently\n*   where on your body any radiotherapy is focused – your risk of developing premature menopause is higher if you have radiotherapy treatment around your brain or pelvis\n\n【15】### Surgery to remove the ovaries\n\n【16】Surgically removing both ovaries will also bring on premature or early menopause.\n\n【17】For example, the ovaries may need to be removed during a hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb).\n\n【18】Symptoms of early menopause\n---------------------------\n\n【19】The main symptom of early menopause is periods becoming infrequent or stopping altogether without any other reason (such as pregnancy).\n\n【20】Some women may also get other typical menopausal symptoms, including:\n\n【21】*   hot flushes\n*   night sweats\n*   vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex\n*   difficulty sleeping\n*   low mood or anxiety\n*   reduced sex drive (libido)\n*   problems with memory and concentration\n删除7：<u>Read more about the symptoms of the menopause.</u>\n\n【22】Women who go through early menopause also have an increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease because of their lowered oestrogen hormone levels.\n\n【23】Diagnosing early menopause\n--------------------------\n\n【24】A GP should be able to make a diagnosis of early menopause based on your symptoms, your family history, and blood tests to check your hormone levels.\n\n【25】You may be referred to a specialist.\n\n【26】Treatments for early menopause\n------------------------------\n\n【27】The main treatment for early menopause is either the combined contraceptive pill or HRT to make up for your missing hormones.\n\n【28】A GP will probably recommend you take this treatment until at least the age of natural menopause (around 51 on average), to give you some protection from osteoporosis and other conditions that can develop after the menopause.\n\n【29】If you have had certain types of cancer, such as certain types of breast cancer, you may not be able to have hormonal treatment.\n\n【30】The GP will talk to you about other treatment options and lifestyle changes you can make to help protect your health.\n\n【31】If you're still getting symptoms, the GP can refer you to a specialist menopause centre.\n删除7：<u>Read more about treating the symptoms of the menopause.</u>\n\n【32】Getting support\n---------------\n\n【33】Going through the menopause early can be difficult and upsetting.\n\n【34】Permanent early menopause will affect your ability to have children naturally.\n\n【35】You may still be able to have children by using IVF and donated eggs from another woman, or using your own eggs if you had some stored. Surrogacy and adoption may also be options for you.\n\n【36】Counselling and support groups may be helpful.\n\n【37】Here are some you may want to try:\n\n【38】*   The Daisy Network – a support group for women with premature ovarian failure\n*   healthtalk.org – provides information about early menopause, including women talking about their own experiences\n*   Fertility friends – a support network for people with fertility problems\n*   Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) – provides information on all types of fertility treatment\n*   Adoption UK – a charity for people who are adopting children\n*   Surrogacy UK – a charity that supports both surrogates and parents through the process\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 02 February 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 02 February 2024</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

A doctor can usually gently pull them apart by hand, or by using a small blunt probe.\n\n【32】A surgical separation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic, where you're asleep, or local anaesthetic, where the area is numbed, as the procedure can be quite painful and can cause distress.\n\n【33】To allow the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, it's advised to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream or Vaseline, to the labia for a few weeks afterwards.\n\n【34】There's a high chance the fusion will return after treatment, whether it's with oestrogen cream or surgery.\n\n【35】Complications of labial fusion\n------------------------------\n\n【36】Labial fusion is not linked to any medical condition and has no long-term implications for your child.\n\n【37】It will not affect her future fertility or sexual life. In most cases, a fusion corrects itself during puberty.\n\n【38】In up to 1 in 7 of cases, a fusion may come back, but this tendency usually stops before puberty begins.\n\n【39】Rarely, labial fusion can cause:\n\n【40】*   infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs)\n*   soreness or pain in the genital area\n*   pee becoming trapped in the vagina, leading to pee leaking between visits to the toilet\n删除3：<u>Video: labial fusion in children\n--------------------------------\n\n【41】This video explains what labial fusion is and gives advice on where to seek help.\n删除1：<u>Media last reviewed: 3 April 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Media review due: 3 April 2025</u>\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 08 February 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 08 February 2026</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

It helps your body to take in more calcium and phosphorous from the food you eat, and helps your kidneys to keep more calcium instead of peeing it out.\n\n【2】We usually get our vitamin D through exposure to sunlight and our diet. Not having enough vitamin D in your body can lead to bone conditions such as rickets and osteomalacia in children, and osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) in adults.\n\n【3】Long-term vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle weakness, falls and fractures in older people.\n\n【4】Everyone can benefit from taking colecalciferol as a daily vitamin D supplement. Adults who are not at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider taking a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D during autumn and winter.\n\n【5】Adults who are at risk of vitamin D deficiency should take a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D, throughout the year.\n\n【6】It is recommended that you take vitamin D if you have a deficiency, or to prevent a deficiency if you:\n\n【7】*   are not often outdoors, for example if you're housebound or in an institution, like a care home\n*   are pregnant or breastfeeding\n*   usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when you're outside\n*   have dark skin – darker skin may not make enough vitamin D from sunlight\n*   are 1 to 4 years old or a baby that is breastfed or having less than 500ml of infant formula a day\n\n【8】Vitamin D deficiency is the most common cause of rickets so if your child has low vitamin D levels, your doctor may prescribe colecalciferol for them.\n\n【9】To find out if you have low vitamin D levels, your doctor will give you a blood test. If your levels are severely low, they may prescribe a loading dose course of vitamin D. This is a high strength dose that is only available on prescription.\n\n【10】If your vitamin D levels are OK, or you want to prevent deficiency, you can buy lower dose colecalciferol from pharmacies and shops.\n\n【11】Colecalciferol comes as chewable, dissolvable (soluble) and melt-in-the-mouth (orodispersible) tablets, capsules, a syrup, and oral drops.\n\n【12】There is also a type of vitamin D called calcipotriol, which sounds similar to colecalciferol. Calcipotriol is used to treat the skin condition caused by plaque psoriasis.\n\n【13】Key facts\n---------\n\n【14】*   Taking low doses of colecalciferol daily is safe and does not normally cause side effects.\n*   Taking too much colecalciferol can cause calcium and phosphate to build up in your body (hypercalcaemia).\n*   It may take a few weeks or months to raise your vitamin D levels after a loading dose and you may not feel any different. You'll usually take a blood test 1 month after starting your treatment and then again after 3 to 6 months to check your levels.\n*   Most of your vitamin D comes from exposure to sunlight but you can also get it from your diet by eating more oily fish and foods with added nutrients.\n删除11：<u>More in Colecalciferol\n----------------------\n\n【15】*   About colecalciferol\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking it with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 January 2026</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Treatment\n5.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch.**\n\n【3】Symptoms of acne\n----------------\n\n【4】Acne most commonly develops on the:\n\n【5】*   face – this affects almost everyone with acne\n*   back – this affects more than half of people with acne\n*   chest – this affects about 15% of people with acne\n删除9：<u>Credit:\n\n【6】DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/250116/view</u>\n\n【7】Types of spots\n--------------\n\n【8】There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne:\n\n【9】*   blackheads – small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces colour\n*   whiteheads – have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and will not empty when squeezed\n*   papules – small red bumps that may feel tender or sore\n*   pustules – similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus\n*   nodules – large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful\n*   cysts – the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring\n\n【10】Things you can try if you have acne\n-----------------------------------\n\n【11】These self-help techniques may be useful:\n\n【12】*   Do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse.\n*   Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse.\n*   Do not try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring.\n*   Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin.\n*   Completely remove make-up before going to bed.\n*   If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based emollient.\n*   Regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne.\n*   Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face.\n\n【13】Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment.\n\n【14】If you develop mild acne, it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice.\n\n【15】Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies.\n\n【16】Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing.\n\n【17】If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription.\n\n【18】When to seek medical advice\n---------------------------\n\n【19】If you have mild acne, speak to a pharmacist about medicines to treat it.\n\n【20】If these do not control your acne, or it's making you feel very unhappy, see a GP.\n\n【21】You should see a GP if you have moderate or severe acne or you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. \n\n【22】Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.\n\n【23】Treatments can take several months to work, so do not expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.\n\n【24】Why do I have acne?\n-------------------\n\n【25】Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.\n\n【26】Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).\n\n【27】This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.\n\n【28】The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.\n\n【29】### Other possible causes\n\n【30】Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.\n\n【31】Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.\n\n【32】There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.\n\n【33】Who's affected?\n---------------\n\n【34】Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent.\n\n【35】Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19.\n\n【36】Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older.\n\n【37】Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s.\n\n【38】In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 03 January 2023  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 03 January 2026</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Next : Causes</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

Overview\n2.  Symptoms\n3.  Causes\n4.  Diagnosis\n5.  Treatment\n6.  Complications</u>\n\n【2】**An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland does not produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).**\n\n【3】Most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of treatments for thyroid cancer or an overactive thyroid.\n\n【4】Immune system\n-------------\n\n【5】An underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it's not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine, leading to the symptoms of an underactive thyroid.\n\n【6】A condition called Hashimoto's disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction that causes an underactive thyroid.\n\n【7】It's not clear what causes Hashimoto's disease, but it runs in families. It's also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as type 1 diabetes and vitiligo.\n\n【8】Previous thyroid treatment\n--------------------------\n\n【9】An underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.\n\n【10】These treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid (where the thyroid gland produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.\n\n【11】Less common causes\n------------------\n\n【12】Worldwide, a lack of dietary iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is uncommon in the UK.\n\n【13】Babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland does not develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is uncommon. It's usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.\n删除7：<u>The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children has more information about congenital hypothyroidism</u>\n\n【14】A problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid. The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.\n\n【15】An underactive thyroid has also been linked to some viral infections or some medicines used to treat other conditions, such as:\n\n【16】*   **lithium** – a medicine sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including depression and bipolar disorder\n*   **amiodarone** – a medicine sometimes used to treat an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\n*   **interferons** – a class of medicine sometimes used to treat certain types of cancer and hepatitis C\n\n【17】Speak to a GP or specialist if you're concerned that a medicine you're taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.\n删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 10 May 2021  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 10 May 2024</u>\n删除1：<u>*   Previous : Symptoms</u>删除1：<u>*   Next : Diagnosis</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}

But most people have no side effects or only minor ones.\n\n【2】Some of the common side effects of duloxetine will gradually improve as your body gets used to it.\n\n【3】Common side effects\n-------------------\n\n【4】These common side effects of duloxetine can happen in up to 1 in 10 people. There are things you can do to help cope with them:\n\n【5】Difficulty sleeping\n\n【6】Try taking duloxetine first thing in the morning.\n\n【7】Headaches\n\n【8】Make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Try not to drink too much alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if the headaches last longer than a week or are severe.\n\n【9】Feeling dizzy\n\n【10】If duloxetine makes you feel dizzy when you stand up, try getting up very slowly or stay sitting down until you feel better. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint, then sit until you feel better. Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy.\n\n【11】Blurred vision\n\n【12】Avoid driving, cycling or using tools or machinery while this is happening. If it lasts for more than a day or two, your doctor may need to change your treatment.\n\n【13】Constipation\n\n【14】Try to get more fibre into your diet, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to exercise more regularly, for example by going for a daily walk or run.\n\n【15】Diarrhoea\n\n【16】Drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【17】Do not take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.\n\n【18】If you take contraceptive pills and you have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【19】Feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\n【20】Stick to simple meals and do not eat rich or spicy food. Make sure you take duloxetine in the morning with some food. Try small, frequent sips of water if you're being sick to avoid dehydration. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee.\n\n【21】If you take contraceptive pills and you're being sick, your contraception may not protect you from pregnancy. Check the pill packet for advice.\n\n【22】Dry mouth\n\n【23】Chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free sweets.\n\n【24】Sweating\n\n【25】Try wearing loose clothing, use a strong anti-perspirant, and keep cool using a fan if possible. If this does not help, you may need to try a different type of antidepressant.\n\n【26】Tiredness\n\n【27】Do not drive, cycle or use tools or machinery if you're feeling this way. Try taking duloxetine 1 hour before bedtime. Cut down the amount of alcohol you drink as alcohol will make you feel more tired.\n\n【28】If the tiredness does not go away after 2 weeks, ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【29】Less appetite than usual and weight loss\n\n【30】This side effect should get better as your body gets used to the medicine. It may also help to eat smaller meals more often and eat foods you really enjoy. If your appetite does not improve or you lose a lot of weight, ask your doctor for advice.\n\n【31】Feeling less interested in sex, or having problems keeping an erection or reaching orgasm\n\n【32】Speak to your doctor if you get this side effect and it does not go away.\n\n【33】Speak to a doctor or pharmacist if the advice on how to cope does not help and a side effect is still bothering you or does not go away.\n\n【34】Serious side effects\n--------------------\n\n【35】Serious side effects are rare and happen in less than 1 in 100 people.\n\n【36】Book an appointment with your doctor if you get changes in your periods, such as heavy bleeding, spotting or bleeding between periods.\n\n【37】Call a doctor or call 111 straight away if you have:\n\n【38】*   hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), or you become aggressive and angry\n*   feelings of euphoria, excessive enthusiasm or excitement, or feeling restless so that you cannot sit or stand still\n*   constant headaches, long-lasting confusion or weakness, or frequent muscle cramps – these can be signs of low sodium levels in your blood\n*   yellowing of the whites of your eyes, or your skin although this may be less obvious on brown or black skin – these can be signs of a liver problem\n*   eye pain or blurred vision\n*   black or red poo or blood in your vomit – these can be signs of bleeding from your gut\n*   coughed up blood or have blood in your pee\n*   bleeding from your gums, or bruises that appear without a reason or get bigger\n\n【39】### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E now if you get:\n\n【40】*   tightness in your chest or shortness of breath\n*   any heavy bleeding that you cannot stop, such as cuts or nosebleeds that do not stop within 10 to 15 minutes\n*   painful erections that last longer than 2 hours – this may happen even when you're not having sex\n*   thoughts about harming yourself or ending your life\n\n【41】Find your nearest A&E\n\n【42】### Serious allergic reaction\n\n【43】In rare cases, it's possible to have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to duloxetine.\n\n【44】#### Immediate action required: Call 999 now if:\n\n【45】*   your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen\n*   you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)\n*   your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow\n*   your skin, tongue or lips turn blue, grey or pale 通用删除1(英):<u>(if you have black or brown skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet)</u>\n*   you suddenly become very confused, drowsy or dizzy\n*   someone faints and cannot be woken up\n*   a child is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)\n\n【46】You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised, itchy, blistered or peeling.\n\n【47】These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital.\n\n【48】Other side effects\n------------------\n\n【49】These are not all the side effects of duloxetine.

{"seq_id": "e5cbb341-3113-4617-b54b-33690b7d788d", "title": "Carbamazepine", "text": "【0】Common questions about carbamazepine\n====================================\n\n【1】How does carbamazepine work?\n\n【2】Carbamazepine is an anti-convulsant (or anti-epileptic) medicine. It works by stabilising the electrical activity in the brain and nerves.\n\n【3】For epilepsy, carbamazepine works by stopping electrical signals from building up in the nerve cells in the brain. It also reduces the release of a chemical (neurotransmitter) called glutamate. Too much glutamate can cause seizures.\n\n【4】For nerve pain, carbamazepine works by stabilising the electric signals in your nerves. This stops the pain signals being sent to your brain.\n\n【5】We do not fully understand how carbamazepine works for treating bipolar disorder. However, it's thought to reduce the glutamate activity in the brain.\n\n【6】How long does it take to work?\n\n【7】It can take 1 to 2 weeks for carbamazepine to work fully.\n\n【8】Are there any long-term side effects?\n\n【9】Many people take carbamazepine safely for many months or years.\n\n【10】However, there are some side effects that can happen over a long time. Long-term treatment with carbamazepine can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia (increasing your risk of breaking a bone).\n\n【11】Your doctor can arrange for tests to check the strength of your bones. Regular exercise and a good diet can also help to keep your bones strong.\n\n【12】How does carbamazepine compare with other medicines for epilepsy?\n\n【13】There are many different medicines for treating epilepsy.\n\n【14】It's not possible to say that one works better than the other. It varies from person to person and depends on the type of seizures and how often you have them.\n\n【15】If you have epilepsy, the choice will depend on the type of seizures that you have. Your doctor will discuss the best medicine for you.\n\n【16】Other epilepsy medicines include:\n\n【17】*   gabapentin\n*   lamotrigine\n*   levetiracetam\n*   phenytoin\n*   pregabalin\n*   sodium valproate\n*   topiramate\n*   valproic acid\n*   brivaracetam\n*   clobazam\n*   ethosuximide\n\n【18】To help to decide, your doctor will take into account your age and sex, the medicines you're already taking and any other health problems you have.\n\n【19】It's usual to try to treat epilepsy using a single medicine. If this medicine is not working well, or you're getting side effects, your doctor will generally try you on a different one.\n\n【20】If a single medicine is not preventing your seizures, then your doctor may recommend taking 2 or more epilepsy medicines at the same time.\n\n【21】If carbamazepine is giving you side effects, or you're worried it is not working for you, ask your doctor or specialist to recommend a different medicine.\n\n【22】How does carbamazepine compare with other medicines for nerve pain or trigeminal neuralgia?\n\n【23】Carbamazepine is usually the first medicine given to treat nerve pain or trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n【24】Medicines called phenytoin or gabapentin might be used if carbamazepine does not work or causes too many side effects.\n\n【25】Some other medicines may be used to treat nerve pain or trigeminal neuralgia. Your doctor or specialist will find the medicine that works best for you.\n\n【26】How does it compare with other medicines for bipolar disorder?\n\n【27】If you have bipolar disorder, there are several types of medicine to prevent low mood. It's not possible to say that one works better than another and it varies from person to person.\n\n【28】Lithium is commonly used for treating low mood in bipolar disorder, as well as a medicine called quetiapine (an antipsychotic medicine).\n\n【29】Your doctor or specialist will find the medicines that work best for you.\n\n【30】Can I switch to a different medicine?\n\n【31】If you want to switch medicines, it's very important to follow your doctor's advice.\n\n【32】Switching from carbamazepine to a different medicine will be different for each person.\n\n【33】If you want to switch, you'll usually start taking the new one at a low dose and slowly build up the dose while you are still taking carbamazepine. If you have epilepsy this protects you from seizures until the new medicine starts to work.\n\n【34】Once you're taking the correct dose of the new medicine, you should be able to slowly reduce your dose of carbamazepine.\n\n【35】It can take several weeks or months until you've stopped taking carbamazepine completely.\n\n【36】Can I stop taking carbamazepine?\n\n【37】If you take carbamazepine for epilepsy, you may have seizures once you stop taking it. You can prevent these withdrawal seizures by reducing the dose of your carbamazepine gradually.\n\n【38】If you are taking if for bipolar disorder or nerve pain, your condition could get worse for a short time after stopping it.\n\n【39】However, you're unlikely to get any withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking this medicine.\n\n【40】### Important\n\n【41】Do not stop taking carbamazepine unless your doctor tells you to.\n\n【42】Can I take carbamazepine before surgery?\n\n【43】You can take carbamazepine as normal before and after surgery.\n\n【44】Carbamazepine may reduce the effects of some muscle relaxants so these may need to be increased.\n\n【45】Tell your doctor you are on carbamazepine if you need surgery.\n\n【46】Will it affect my contraception?\n\n【47】Carbamazepine might stop these contraceptives from working:\n\n【48】*   combined hormonal contraceptives (the combined pill, patches, and vaginal ring) – look out for bleeding between periods, which might be a sign that the pill is not working. Talk to your doctor if this happens. Your doctor may advise you to use a different type of contraceptive, or condoms as well as combined hormonal contraception\n*   progestogen-only contraceptive pill or implants – your doctor may advise you to use a different type of contraceptive that is not affected by carbamazepine\n*   emergency contraception – tell your doctor or pharmacist that you take carbamazepine if you need emergency contraception – you may need an increased dose or to use a coil\n\n【49】You can use the contraceptive injection or coil with carbamazepine.\n\n【50】If carbamazepine makes you sick (vomit), your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n删除7：<u>Find out more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick.</u>\n\n【51】Can I get epilepsy medicines for free?\n\n【52】If you have epilepsy, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your epilepsy ones.\n\n【53】To claim your free prescriptions you'll need a medical exemption certificate.\n\n【54】The application form for the medical exemption certificate is called FP92A. You can get this from your doctor's surgery. You will need to fill in the form, then your doctor will sign it and send it off.\n\n【55】Can I drive or ride a bike?\n\n【56】You may feel sleepy, tired or dizzy when you first start taking carbamazepine. This may also happen if your dose has increased. If you're affected, do not drive, ride a bike, or operate machinery until you feel better.\n\n【57】It's an offence to drive a car if your ability to drive safely is affected. It's your responsibility to decide if it's safe to drive. If you're in any doubt, do not drive.\n删除7：<u>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking carbamazepine. GOV.UK has more information on the law on drugs and driving.</u>\n\n【58】If you have epilepsy, you're not allowed to drive until you've had no seizures for 1 year.\n\n【59】You are also not allowed to drive for 6 months after you change your epilepsy medicine.\n\n【60】Information:\n\n【61】Driving rules if you change or withdraw your medicine, Epilepsy Action\n\n【62】Epilepsy and driving information, GOV.UK\n\n【63】Can I drink alcohol while taking carbamazepine?\n\n【64】Drinking alcohol while taking carbamazepine may make you feel sleepy or tired. It's best to stop drinking alcohol for the first few days, until you see how the medicine affects you.\n\n【65】Are there any foods and drinks I need to avoid?\n\n【66】Do not drink grapefruit juice if you're taking carbamazepine. It increases the concentration of carbamazepine in your body and increases the risk of side effects.\n删除11：<u>More in Carbamazepine\n---------------------\n\n【67】*   About carbamazepine\n*   Who can and cannot take it\n*   How and when to take it\n*   Side effects\n*   Pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility\n*   Taking carbamazepine with other medicines and herbal supplements\n*   Common questions\n</u>删除1：<u>Page last reviewed: 4 March 2022  </u>删除1：<u>Next review due: 4 March 2025</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nhs", "batch_name": "20240109", "version": "version0"}
