Two distinct types of arthritis are described in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO). Management of arthritis in people with cystic fibrosis is uncertain and complex because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To review the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis in adults and children with cystic fibrosis.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.\n\n【6】Date of most recent search: 27 November 2009.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of anti‐inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g. non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory agents, systemic corticosteroids, intra‐articular corticosteroids) with each other, with no treatment or with placebo for CFA and HPO.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】No relevant studies were identified.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】No studies were included in this review.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Although it is generally recognised that CFA may be episodic and resolve spontaneously, treatment with analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents may be needed. While this approach may be sufficient to manage symptoms, it is disappointing that no randomised controlled trials to rigorously evaluate these agents were found, nor could the authors identify any quasi‐randomised. This systematic review has identified the need for a well‐designed adequately‐powered randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents for the symptomatic management of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis (CFA and HPO) in adults and children with cystic fibrosis. Studies should also better define the two conditions. A study has recently been conducted in CFA and may help fill this gap when analysed and published.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Cystic Fibrosis\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Arthropathy Associated With Cystic Fibrosis\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug\n*   Analgesics\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug\n*   Analgesics\n*   Placebo\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Painful Swelling Of Joint\n*   Arthritis By Pattern Of Joint Involvement\n*   Limitation Of Joint Movement\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Functional ability\n*   Swollen Joints\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There are two distinct types of arthritis in cystic fibrosis: cystic fibrosis‐related arthropathy (CFA) and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO). The best treatment for these conditions is not clear because of the underlying disease and its intense treatment. We planned to report evidence from clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different anti‐inflammatory analgesic drugs compared with placebo, with each other or with no treatment. However, we were disappointed that we could not find any completed randomised controlled trials of these treatments or any evidence from non‐randomised controlled trials. One study in CFA has recently finished and may provide some evidence when published. We suggest that there should be a randomised controlled trial to look at the effects and the safety of using anti‐inflammatory drugs or painkillers or both to manage the symptoms of cystic fibrosis‐related arthritis.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Beginning in the 1990s, nonlatex male condoms made of polyurethane film or synthetic elastomers were developed as alternative male barrier methods for individuals with allergies, sensitivities or preferences that prevented the consistent use of condoms made of latex.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】The review sought to evaluate nonlatex male condoms in comparison with latex condoms in terms of contraceptive efficacy, breakage and slippage, safety, and user preferences.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】In December 2012, we searched computerized databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTS) of nonlatex condoms (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Previous searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we wrote to the manufacturers of nonlatex condoms and known investigators to locate other trials not identified in our search.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】The review included RCTs that evaluated a male nonlatex condom made of polyurethane film or synthetic elastomers in comparison with a latex condom.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We evaluated all titles and abstracts located in the literature searches for inclusion. Two authors independently extracted data from the identified studies. We analyzed data with RevMan. The Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome of contraceptive efficacy, condom breakage and slippage, discontinuation of use, safety, and user preference. Contraceptive efficacy, early discontinuation, and safety outcomes were also measured with survival analysis techniques.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】While the eZ·on condom did not protect against pregnancy as well as its latex comparison condom, no differences were found in the typical‐use efficacy between the Avanti and the Standard Tactylon and their latex counterparts. The nonlatex condoms had higher rates of clinical breakage than their latex comparison condoms: the Peto OR for clinical breakage ranged from 2.64 (95% CI 1.63 to 4.28) to 4.95 (95% CI 3.63 to 6.75). Few adverse events were reported. Substantial proportions of participants preferred the nonlatex condom or reported that they would recommend its use to others.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Although the nonlatex condoms were associated with higher rates of clinical breakage than their latex comparison condoms, the new condoms still provide an acceptable alternative for those with allergies, sensitivities, or preferences that might prevent the consistent use of latex condoms. The contraceptive efficacy of the nonlatex condoms requires more research.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Vaginal Penetration\n*   Heterosexual\n*   Sexually Active\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Latex-free Condom\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Latex Condom\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Condom breakage\n*   Condom slippage\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Nonlatex compared to latex male condoms for birth control\n\n【24】The male condom can prevent pregnancy by keeping sperm out of the birth canal. Nonlatex condoms can be used by people who are allergic or sensitive to latex. Some people may not have used latex condoms because they did not like them. This review compared nonlatex condoms with latex condoms. The main issues were effect on birth control, whether the condom broke or slipped, and which condom people liked.\n\n【25】In December 2012, we used a computer to find randomized trials of nonlatex condoms. For the initial review, we also wrote to researchers and makers of nonlatex condoms to find other trials. We included all studies that compared a male nonlatex condom with a latex condom.\n\n【26】The eZ·on condom did not prevent pregnancy as well as latex condoms. The Avanti and the Standard Tactylon condoms were similar to latex condoms for birth control. The nonlatex condoms broke more often than the latex condoms. However, many people liked the nonlatex condoms better. They may be useful for people who are allergic or sensitive to latex.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of different xylitol‐containing products on preventing dental caries in children and adolescents.\n\n【3】In this review we are specifically interested in xylitol‐containing gels, toothpastes, varnishes, mouthrinses, chewing gums and sprays.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Dental caries affects 60% to 90% of children as well as the majority of adults . The condition has been defined as an indigenous infection caused by cariogenic bacteria . Although a variety of bacteria have been implicated in the caries process, Streptococcus mutans (a gram‐positive bacteria) has been identified as the primary pathogen . The development of dental caries is a dynamic process, and four factors need to be present simultaneously :\n\n【8】*   a fermentable carbohydrate (dietary sugars);\n\n【9】*   bacteria (in dental plaque/biofilm);\n\n【10】*   a susceptible tooth surface;\n\n【11】*   sufficient time for the preceding factors to interact.\n\n【12】If there is time (inadequate oral hygiene measures) then bacteria in the oral cavity will build up, adhere to tooth surfaces and interact with saliva to form a biofilm . Acid is subsequently derived from the metabolic processes within this biofilm (the main driver for this is the availability of dietary sugars, namely sucrose) leading to a reduction in pH. Subsequently mineral is lost from the tooth surface (demineralisation); as the availability of dietary sugars depletes and the pH increases then remineralisation occurs . The net result of this is the maintenance of an intact tooth. However, the frequent intake of dietary sugars leads to an imbalance in demineralisation and remineralisation in favour of the former, this leads to the formation of a carious lesion . The diagnosis of dental caries is based on clinical and, where appropriate, radiographic examination.\n\n【13】An estimation of the depth of demineralisation (extent of the carious lesion) and a judgement of whether the lesion is active dictates its management . Management may be operative or non‐operative (preventative) .\n\n【14】Operative management consists of removal of demineralised dental tissue and replacement with a synthetic material to prevent the continuation of the carious process. This restorative process can result in the repeated need for repair and/or replacement of the restoration, and with each intervention greater tooth loss inevitably occurs. Eventually the tooth may become unrestorable leading to its loss. This has been referred to as the restorative staircase .\n\n【15】Prevention of caries can avoid the initiation of this process. Preventative strategies are focused on reducing one or all of the four factors required for the development of dental caries (listed above). Several Cochrane reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy, dental floss, fissure sealants, dietary advice and fluorides in the prevention of dental caries . The most widely reported preventive measure has been the use of fluorides . Fluoride inhibits demineralisation when it is present as a solution; it also aids remineralisation and has been reported to be a bacteriostatic agent .\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5‐carbon polyol sugar of crystalline structure derived from corn and hardwood. It occurs in many fruits and plants . It achieves equal sweetness to sucrose without resulting in a physiological requirement for insulin production, consequently xylitol is used as a sucrose substitute in many diabetic food products . In addition, xylitol is not fermentable by the majority of oral cariogenic bacteria and it has also been shown to have antibacterial properties, thus it is recommended for use as an alternative to sucrose without contributing to the development of dental caries . The main reported adverse side effect of xylitol is its laxative effect .\n\n【18】Xylitol has been produced in a variety of preparations including gum, syrup, lozenges, sprays, mouthwashes, gels, toothpaste, candies and varnishes . In this review we are specifically interested in xylitol‐containing gels, toothpastes, varnishes, mouthrinses, chewing gums and sprays.\n\n【19】### How the intervention might work\n\n【20】Xylitol inhibits the growth and metabolism of cariogenic bacteria; it is most effective against Streptococcus mutans , the primary bacteria responsible for the dental caries process . Xylitol becomes involved in bacterial metabolism and forms xylitol–5–phosphate, which in turn inhibits glycolytic enzymes and bacterial growth.\n\n【21】In addition, the presence of xylitol‐5‐phosphate results in the failure of cariogenic bacteria to adhere to dental surfaces . Previous research has shown that 1% and 5% xylitol concentrations have resulted in significant reductions in oral cariogenic bacteria . Interestingly, xylitol has been shown to reduce the occurrence of acute otitis media in children up to the age of 12 years, this has been attributed to a reduction in bacteria from the oral cavity .\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】The dental caries process and its management has the potential to cause pain, infection and may even lead to the development of dental anxiety, in addition it can be costly . Experience of dental caries has been shown to adversely affect oral health related quality of life outcomes . Reviewing the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of xylitol‐containing products for preventing dental caries is therefore essential.\n\n【24】#### Summary of previous systematic reviews\n\n【25】Previous reviews relating to this topic have been published. However, none of them offer a robust methodology comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of xylitol for preventing dental caries. Two reviews, both narrative in nature, compared xylitol to sorbitol . A further narrative review considered xylitol in sweeteners and gum only . Two reviews  also studied xylitol in chewing gum for the prevention of dental caries; one further review considered the use of xylitol as a dietary supplement in the form of candies and lozenges ; however, all three reviews restricted their search to the English language. Interestingly, xylitol has also been compared to fluoride  but the authors of this review limited the product types for inclusion and the literature search was restricted to one database only.\n\n【26】Objectives\n----------\n\n【27】To assess the effects of different xylitol‐containing products on preventing dental caries in children and adolescents.\n\n【28】In this review we are specifically interested in xylitol‐containing gels, toothpastes, varnishes, mouthrinses, chewing gums and sprays.\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster randomised trials but excluding cross‐over trials. Cross‐over trials are inappropriate for studies with caries as an outcome.\n\n【33】#### Types of participants\n\n【34】Inclusion criteria: children and adolescents below 18 years of age who have permanent or deciduous teeth, or both.\n\n【35】Exclusion criteria: studies in which the majority of participants are undergoing fixed or removable orthodontic treatment, the intervention is provided for less than one year, and groups of children are selected as they have underlying health conditions.\n\n【36】#### Types of interventions\n\n【37】Xylitol‐containing gels, toothpastes, varnishes, mouthrinses, chewing gums and sprays will be compared with placebo or no intervention (which includes routine care). We will also include trials comparing one xylitol‐containing product with another. The interventions must be provided for at least one year.\n\n【38】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【39】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【40】Change in dental caries increment (dental caries is defined as clinical or radiographic lesions or both recorded at the dentine level), determined by change from baseline in the following.\n\n【41】*   Decayed‐missing‐filled tooth surfaces (DMFS) and decayed‐missing‐filled teeth (DMFT) d(e)fs d(e)ft indices. Data on permanent and deciduous teeth will be analysed separately. The summary statistics for the indices will be those for all permanent and deciduous teeth erupted at the start and erupting over the course of the study.\n\n【42】*   Number of children with and without dental caries increment.\n\n【43】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【44】*   Discolouration.\n\n【45】*   Pain and discomfort.\n\n【46】*   Quality of life (QOL).\n\n【47】*   Patient satisfaction.\n\n【48】*   Cost (including use of health service resources (such as visits to dental care units, length of dental treatment time)).\n\n【49】*   Adverse effects, gastrointestinal complaints.\n\n【50】*   Adverse effects, any specific adverse effects related to any clinically diagnosed reactions to any of the active interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There is a clear need for randomized controlled trials to address this evidence gap. Such trials should stratify participants by their age, the retinal disorder leading to vitrectomy, and the status of the underlying disease process in the contralateral eye. Outcomes assessed in such trials may include gain of vision on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, quality of life, and adverse events such as posterior capsular rupture. Both short‐term (six‐month) and long‐term (one‐year or two‐year) outcomes should be examined.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Cataract\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Vitrectomy\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Extraction Of Cataract\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Retinal Detachment\n*   Posterior Capsule Opacification\n*   Visual Acuity Testing\n*   Cystoid Macular Edema\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### Surgery to remove cataracts after vitrectomy\n\n【23】**Review question**\n\n【24】We reviewed the evidence about the effect of surgery to remove cataracts (cloudy lens in front of the eye) in people who develop cataracts after vitrectomy, a surgery to remove the vitreous (the clear gel) in the center of the eye.\n\n【25】**Background**\n\n【26】Vitrectomy, a procedure performed for disorders that affect the back part of the eye, can result in the formation or acceleration of cataract. The underlying problem that led to vitrectomy may limit the benefits from cataract surgery.\n\n【27】**Results**\n\n【28】We found no randomized controlled trials (trials in which participants are randomly assigned to one treatment group or another) that evaluated the benefits or risks (or both) of cataract surgery following vitrectomy. Since cataract surgery may lead to loss of vision due to worsening or recurrence of the condition that prompted the vitrectomy, its role in these patients remains uncertain. Future trials to address this review question should separate participants by age, the disorder leading to vitrectomy, and the status of the underlying disease process in the opposite eye. Outcomes relevant to patients such as improvement of vision and quality of life, and harms should be examined both in the short term (six months after surgery) and in the long term (one to two years after surgery).\n\n【29】--------------\n\n【30】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【31】### Implications for practice\n\n【32】In the absence of data from controlled trials, ophthalmologists have no reliable evidence to use when counseling patients regarding the risks and benefits of surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract, and no basis for recommendations for or against cataract surgery or when to intervene surgically. It is possible that some of the complications of surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract could be reduced if surgery were known to be beneficial and to be beneficial if performed at an early stage of development of nuclear sclerosis. Data from retrospective studies are inadequate for these purposes.\n\n【33】### Implications for research\n\n【34】There is a clear need for well‐designed randomized controlled trials to evaluate the benefits and risks of surgery for cataracts that develop following vitrectomy. We recommend that randomization in such trials be stratified by patients' age, retinal disorder leading to vitrectomy, and status of the pathologic process in the contralateral eye. Because patients who undergo vitrectomy already have reduced vision due to the underlying condition that prompted vitrectomy, relevant outcomes such as quality of life should be considered in addition to visual acuity and other clinical measures of vision. We recommend that restoration or gain of eight or more letters vision on the ETDRS scale with cataract surgery would be a reasonable expectation in this patient population. Analyses should include both short‐term (six months) and long‐term (one‐year to two‐year) outcomes. Data on adverse outcomes, including complications of surgery such as posterior capsular rupture, should be documented in future trials.\n\n【35】However, there are ethical difficulties in conducting a randomized trial of surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract. Observation of progression of post‐vitrectomy cataract may not be considered an ethical alternative. In certain patient populations, such as those with significant central vision loss due to macular scars, observation of post‐vitrectomy cataract may be ethical, and conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine if cataract surgery improves quality of life may be a reasonable option. One possible trial design would be to enroll patients over the age of 50 years who are scheduled for vitrectomy, who do not have visually significant cataract in the study eye, and who have visual acuity better than 20/40 in the fellow eye in a two‐stage RCT. The initial randomization would be between vitrectomy alone and vitrectomy plus lens removal. Any cataract surgery in the fellow eye would be deferred for at least six months. At six months, study eyes in the deferred group in which visually significant cataract had developed would then be randomized to cataract surgery or deferment for another six months. At the end of the second six‐month period, all patients with visually significant cataract in the study eye could be offered surgery. This design would permit evaluation of:\n\n【36】*   time to development or progression of cataract in the initial vitrectomy only arm;\n\n【37】*   time to progression or recurrence of the underlying retinal problem that led to vitrectomy in the two initial treatment arms;\n\n【38】*   comparison of quality of life between the two arms of the original randomization; and\n\n【39】*   (with the second randomization) comparison of the above outcomes with and without cataract surgery.\n\n【40】This design would take account of the large number of patients who have lens surgery at the time of vitrectomy and might support that practice or suggest that it was desirable only in selected subgroups of patients, as long as the fellow eye had useful vision.\n\n【41】Concerns about surgical complications, prognosis for recovery of visual acuity, and uncertainty regarding progression of underlying retinal disorder, are important considerations in establishing equipoise necessary for randomization. Further, insufficient information on outcomes important to patients, such as vision‐related quality of life, indicates an inability to reasonably assess risks and benefits of surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract.\n\n【42】Background\n----------\n\n【43】### Description of the condition\n\n【44】Cataract, an opacification of the crystalline lens in the eye, can be caused by many factors including the natural aging process, metabolic abnormalities, nutritional disorders, chronic ocular inflammation, and trauma. The three types of cataract are classified according to the location of the opacity: cortical, nuclear sclerosis, and posterior subcapsular. Cataract formation or acceleration also can occur after intraocular surgery, especially following vitrectomy, a surgical technique for removing the vitreous that is used in the treatment of disorders that affect the posterior segment of the eye. Vitrectomy causes progression of nuclear sclerotic cataracts.\n\n【45】Vitrectomy was first developed by Machemer in 1971 . It is a microsurgical technique in which specialized instruments and techniques are used to gain access to the vitreous cavity and retina. During vitrectomy surgery, three small incisions, each approximately 1.4 mm in length, are made in the eye in order to place instruments: a vitreous cutter, a fiberoptic light source to illuminate the inside of the eye, and an infusion cannula to maintain proper intraocular pressure during the surgery. During the past 40 years, advances in surgical technique and instrumentation have made vitrectomy a common surgical procedure for posterior segment disorders. Vitrectomy is indicated for numerous ocular conditions including vitreous loss in cataract surgery, subluxation of the lens, malignant glaucoma, dense pupillary membranes, non‐clearing vitreous hemorrhage due to diabetic retinopathy or vein occlusions, retinal detachment, macular hole, macular pucker, vitreo‐macular traction, and endophthalmitis.\n\n【46】Although vitrectomy has revolutionized the treatment of posterior segment disorders and improved visual outcomes in patients with retinal diseases requiring surgical intervention, vitrectomy also is associated with co‐morbidities that may compromise visual acuity such as retinal detachment, corneal decompensation, and cataract formation or progression in phakic eyes . The type of cataract that forms or accelerates after vitrectomy is nuclear sclerotic cataract. Cataract formation or progression is believed to be the most common complication associated with vitrectomy. In fact, in many eyes undergoing vitrectomy, the lens is removed at the same time. Often, the nuclear sclerotic cataracts that develop after vitrectomy limit visual acuity outcomes to a degree that would result in surgical removal of the lens in an otherwise 'normal' eye.\n\n【47】The exact pathogenesis of cataract formation or acceleration after vitrectomy is unknown. Older studies have suggested that light toxicity, oxidation of lens proteins, use of intraocular gas, and length of operative time may be causative factors . Newer research suggests that vitrectomy surgery increases oxygen tension within the eye; oxygen exposure has been linked with progressive nuclear sclerotic cataract formation .\n\n【48】#### Epidemiology\n\n【49】Although cataract progression is common after vitrectomy, only a few prospective studies have evaluated this occurrence. Do and Hawkins performed a review (unpublished) of the pertinent literature in the PubMed database published from 1966 through 2005. A total of 51 studies were found. The majority of published studies on cataract progression after vitrectomy were retrospective analyses. The reported incidence of cataract was highly variable, from 6% to 100% of cases, depending upon the condition that prompted vitrectomy, duration of follow‐up, and the method used to monitor development of cataract. These retrospective studies are limited by the non‐uniformity of the lens grading system used or the absence of a description of the lens grading system in the published report.\n\n【50】The Vitrectomy for Macular Hole Study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated vitrectomy for the treatment of macular holes, retrospectively examined the incidence of cataract development among 74 eyes of patients that participated in the study . Investigators used a scoring system similar to the Lens Opacities Classification System II, which contains five grading categories for nuclear and posterior subcapsular opacities. Although duration of surgery did not increase the risk for cataract progression, vitrectomy itself was a risk factor for cataract acceleration; 60/74 (81%) eyes in the surgery cohort had nuclear sclerotic cataract progression at six months of follow‐up, compared to only 13/74 (18%) fellow eyes in the control group. By two years, 100% of eyes in the surgery cohort had cataract progression, compared to 8% of control eyes. Similarly, Cherfan and colleagues retrospectively reviewed 100 eyes after vitrectomy for idiopathic macular pucker . After an average follow‐up of 29 months (range six to 99 months), 80/100 (80%) eyes in the vitrectomy group and only 24/100 (24%) fellow eyes had developed a visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract or had undergone cataract extraction.\n\n【51】During the late 1990s, the Submacular Surgery Trials (SST) were initiated to evaluate surgical removal of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) compared with observation in patients with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (SST Group N and Group B), ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS) (SST Group H), and idiopathic CNV (SST Group H) . In these three randomized controlled trials, visually significant cataract was defined as either cataract surgery or lens opacity reported by the SST ophthalmologist to be sufficient to reduce visual acuity by two or more lines in a normal eye. Among the AMD participants in the SST Group N study, 80% of eyes assigned to vitrectomy and surgical removal of their subfoveal CNV developed visually significant cataracts at two years of follow‐up. Sixty per cent of eyes had undergone cataract surgery by their last follow‐up examination two to four years after enrollment. Among the OHS participants in the SST Group H study, 39% of eyes assigned to vitrectomy developed visually significant cataracts, among which 24% underwent cataract removal. The difference between eyes with AMD and eyes with OHS developing post‐vitrectomy cataract is likely due to the median age of the patients. Patients under the age of 50 years are less likely to develop post‐surgical accelerated nuclear sclerosis . Data from the SST provide the largest and most complete follow‐up of eyes undergoing vitrectomy that are at high risk for developing visually significant post‐surgical nuclear sclerotic cataracts.\n\n【52】#### Presentation and diagnosis\n\n【53】Patients who develop post‐vitrectomy cataract present with decreased visual acuity despite anatomic or functional success (or both) of the vitrectomy surgery. Individuals who have undergone vitrectomy may have lower levels of baseline (pre‐cataract) visual acuity due to the underlying nature of their retinal pathology; therefore patients with post‐vitrectomy cataract are more likely to present with poorer vision than individuals with typical senile cataracts. Diagnosis is made with ocular examination using slit‐lamp biomicroscopy.\n\n【54】### Description of the intervention\n\n【55】Cataract surgery, typically using phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, is commonly recommended for individuals with visually significant lens opacities. Two features of post‐vitrectomy nuclear sclerosis make affected lenses especially challenging for cataract surgeons to remove. The nucleus tends to be harder than in age‐related nuclear sclerosis, requiring longer phacoemulsification time during the procedure. Also, the absence of vitreous in the posterior segment allows for more mobility of the posterior capsule, increasing the risk of capsular rupture. Thus, surgery for post‐vitrectomy nuclear sclerotic cataract may have a higher incidence of complications, although evidence from comparative studies is lacking .\n\n【56】### How the intervention might work\n\n【57】Patients who develop cataract after vitrectomy may undergo cataract extraction; however, visual acuity and other outcomes after cataract surgery may be poor due to the underlying retinal disorder. Most patients who have vitrectomy surgery have serious underlying problems, as indicated by the reasons for vitrectomy. Furthermore, eyes with post‐vitrectomy cataract are at risk of complications that affect all eyes that undergo cataract surgery such as endophthalmitis, cystoid macular edema, etc. Thus, vision is often already impaired before cataract surgery and may remain impaired after cataract surgery. Although cataract surgery in a normal eye typically improves vision, the visual prognosis after surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract is uncertain. It likely depends on the success of treatment for the retinal disorder and avoidance of complications during cataract surgery.\n\n【58】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【59】The incidence of cataract formation after vitrectomy varies widely and has been reported to be between 6% and 100%. The majority of published studies confirm that a high rate of cataract formation occurs, but few data are available on visual acuity outcomes after cataract removal. The retinal problem that led to vitrectomy may progress or recur. However, peer‐reviewed data on outcomes after surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract are scarce. Even in situations in which cataract formation is not due to vitrectomy, visual impairment can still exist despite cataract extraction. The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study  published visual acuity outcomes after cataract extraction in adult Latinos and reported that 41% of eyes had visual impairment (defined as a best‐corrected visual acuity of 20/40 Snellen equivalent or less). Age‐related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy accounted for approximately 57% of retinal pathology after cataract extraction. In addition, in eyes that have undergone vitrectomy surgery the absence of vitreous in the posterior segment allows for more mobility of the posterior capsule, increasing the risk of capsular rupture. Surgery for post‐vitrectomy nuclear sclerotic cataract may have a higher incidence of complications. A systematic review of outcomes from controlled clinical trials would provide information for adequate counseling of patients and for guiding ophthalmologists' recommendations.\n\n【60】Objectives\n----------\n\n【61】The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgery for post‐vitrectomy cataract with respect to visual acuity, quality of life, and other outcomes.\n\n【62】Methods\n-------\n\n【63】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【64】#### Types of studies\n\n【65】We planned to include both randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials in this review. We considered quasi‐randomized trials to be trials that had adopted a method of allocation intended to allocate patients in a random fashion but were not strictly random. Examples include allocation by date of birth, social security number, etc. We were to include trials with at least six months' follow‐up to allow for reporting of early adverse effects, even though we planned our primary analyses to focus on outcomes at the end of one year of follow‐up.\n\n【66】#### Types of participants\n\n【67】We planned to include trials that enrolled adult participants (age 18 years and over) with cataract that had developed after vitrectomy for any indication except for trauma. However, we planned not to exclude trials that included both adult patients who had post‐traumatic vitrectomy and patients who had other indications for vitrectomy, except when outcomes were reported separately by indication. We planned to exclude trials that included only trauma cases, because these patients typically are younger and the pathogenesis of cataract formation is different.\n\n【68】#### Types of interventions\n\n【69】We planned to include trials that compared cataract surgery (of any type) with no surgery in such patients.\n\n【70】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【71】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【72】Visual acuity improvement after cataract surgery of at least three letters on a logMAR chart, one line on the Snellen chart, or equivalent changes on other scales. While we planned to analyze the outcomes at one year, two years, and at longer time points of follow‐up as available from included studies, our primary analysis was to focus on one‐year follow‐up.\n\n【73】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【74】1.  Quality of life measured by a validated scale.\n\n【75】2.  Contrast sensitivity: improvement of at least one level, regardless of the manner in which it was measured in included trials.\n\n【76】3.  Progression of the condition that was the original indication for vitrectomy in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) as defined by standard grading scales such as the Diabetic Retinopathy Scale for DR  and the International Scale for AMD .\n\n【77】###### Adverse outcomes\n\n【78】Specific adverse effects of interest included:\n\n【79】*   cystoid macular edema;\n\n【80】*   intraocular lens‐related complications, including dislocation, difficulty in placing the lens;\n\n【81】*   capsular opacification;\n\n【82】*   retinal detachment (new or recurrent).\n\n【83】We also planned to summarize all other adverse effects reported in included studies.\n\n【84】###### Economic outcomes\n\n【85】We planned to tabulate or summarize data on the costs of procedures, consequences of complications, and any cost‐effectiveness data reported in included studies in a narrative fashion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Hysteroscopy involves fluid or gas being injected via the cervix (neck of the womb) into the uterus (womb), which enables the visualisation of the cervical canal and uterine cavity with a hysteroscope (small telescopic camera). This can be a painful procedure. The purpose of this review was to determine which, if any, pain relief drug should be used during outpatient hysteroscopy. Analysis of 13 studies investigating 1881 women found evidence of benefit for pain relief with the use of analgesia during or within 30 minutes after the procedure, especially in post‐menopausal women.\n\n【32】Further high quality, well powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration, and dose of local anaesthetics to be used.\n\n【33】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy and safety of anti‐MAdCAM antibody for the induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease involving the colon. Worldwide incidence ranges between 1.25 to 20.3 new cases per 100,000 persons per year, with approximately 10 to 12 new cases per 100,000 persons per year in North America and Europe . While typical symptoms of UC include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fecal urgency, more severe or extensive disease may be indicated by fever, weight loss, malaise, and fatigue.\n\n【7】Current treatment options for UC include corticosteroids, oral and topical 5‐aminosalicylic acid products, immunosuppressives (e.g. azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine and methotrexate), and anti‐TNF alpha (TNF‐α) antagonists (e.g. infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab and adalimumab) . Vedolizumab, an anti‐adhesion molecule against the α4β7 integrin, is the most recently approved biologic therapy for UC.\n\n【8】Despite medical therapy, many patients with UC eventually require colectomy due to treatment failure, severe disease, drug intolerance or toxic megacolon. New pharmaceutical agents, particularly those specific to the intestinal tract, may offer advantages over existing therapies.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Traditional management of moderate to severe UC involves indiscriminate suppression of the immune system. While aminosalicylates are effective for the treatment of mild to moderate disease ( Feagan 2012 ; ), patients who fail to respond to these drugs often require corticosteroids . Corticosteroids are highly effective for induction of remission, but are ineffective for maintenance of remission. These drugs cause significant adverse events, including osteoporosis, glucose intolerance, and increased risk of infection .\n\n【11】Immunosuppresive agents, including azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, and methotrexate play a limited role in the maintenance of remission in moderate to severe UC . Azathioprine and 6‐mercaptopurine are often used in combination with TNF‐α antagonists for the treatment of disease flares. TNF‐α antagonists are associated with small but increased risk of lymphoma and non‐melanoma skin cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) .\n\n【12】Monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF‐α, such as infliximab (Remicade®), golimumab (Simponi®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®) and adalimumab (Humira®), are useful for induction and maintenance of remission in UC ; however, treatment with biologic medications has been linked to serious adverse events (SAEs) involving opportunistic infection and hypersensitivity .\n\n【13】Another class of biologic agents, referred to as selective adhesion molecule inhibitors, has also been studied in patients with IBD. There is evidence to suggest that natalizumab (Tysabri®), a humanized anti‐alpha4 (α4) integrin antibody, is effective for induction of remission and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD) . Natalizumab is associated with a number of SAEs, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often‐fatal neurological disease in which polyomavirus JC (JC virus) reactivates, spreads to the brain and destructs myelin‐producing cells. The JC virus remains latent in healthy individuals, causing disease only when the immune system is compromised. One patient with CD and two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab developed PML while participating in clinical trials . As a result the drug was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer due to safety concerns. Several months later natalizumab was reintroduced for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and approved by the US Federal Drug Administration for active CD that is refractory to standard and anti‐TNF‐α therapies .\n\n【14】The anti‐adhesion molecule vedolizumab (Entyvio®) was developed to selectively control gut lymphocyte trafficking, in contrast to natalizumab, which blocks lymphocyte trafficking to multiple organs including the gut, kidneys, bone marrow and brain . While natalizumab inhibits both the alpha4beta1 (α4β1) and alpha4beta7 (α4β7) integrins, vedolizumab is believed to exclusively target the α4β7 integrin, thereby preventing the blockade of lymphocytes to the central nervous system and avoiding the risk of PML. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrates that vedolizumab is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with UC .\n\n【15】PF‐00547,659 (anti‐MAdCAM antibody; Pfizer, New York, NY), has been identified as another potential gut‐specific treatment for patients with UC and CD who have failed other drug therapies . Results from an in‐vivo (mice) study confirm the theory that the addressin cell adhesion molecule‐1 (MAdCAM‐1) is involved in the regulation of lymphocyte activation in the inflamed gut . Treatment with anti‐MAdCAM led to a significant reduction in intestinal inflammation in mice with dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis . These findings suggests that anti‐MAdCAM antibody may be an effective treatment strategy for UC.\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Anti‐MAdCAM antibody is a fully human IgG <sub>2K </sub> mononclonal antibody that decreases lymphocyte homing to the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting interactions between MAdCAM‐1 and the α4β7 integrin expressed on lymphocytes. MAdCAM is expressed primarily in normal intestine, pancreas, stomach, esophagus and spleen tissue. While it is also expressed to a lesser extent in liver, lung and bladder tissue, MAdCAM is not found in the central nervous system. As a result, anti‐MAdCAM antibody is expected to selectively restrict lymphocyte homing to the gastrointestinal tract thus avoiding the risk of developing generalized immunosuppression and PML.\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】There is a need for safe and effective treatment options for patients with UC, particularly among those who have failed other therapies or have steroid‐dependent disease. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the currently available evidence on the efficacy and safety of anti‐MAdCAM antibody for the induction of clinical response and remission in patients with moderate to severe UC.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】The objective of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy and safety of anti‐MAdCAM antibody for the induction of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) will be considered for inclusion.

The specific null hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference in outcome between cemented and cementless total hip revision. The primary outcome measures will be revision rate and functional assessment. Secondary outcome measures for assessing this will be length of operation, wear rates, intraoperative and postoperative complication rates and bone loss.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Revision hip arthroplasty is an operation that forms a significant proportion of overall joint arthroplasties as demonstrated by many national and regional arthroplasty registries with reported rates from 9 to 15% . Many surgeons favour the use of one particular technique or type of hip replacement when performing these revisions. The method of fixation of the revision of acetabular and femoral implants can be broadly divided into cemented implants with or without bone grafting and cementless implants with the hope of bony ingrowth. Which method of fixation should be used remains a hotly debated topic.\n\n【6】Cemented Acetabular revision  \nCement to fix the acetabular cup has been the traditional approach to revision acetabular surgery but with poor long‐term results especially if there was inadequate initial bone stock . Bulk allograft with a cemented cup has been used but again has inconsistent results . The use of morsellized impacted allograft with a cemented cup has been reported to have good results . Cement with different support rings and allograft for a variety of acetabular defects has had variable outcomes reported. .\n\n【7】Cementless Acetabular revision  \nRegarding cementless acetabular components, there is a difficulty in determining radiographically if bony ingrowth has occurred as there is not a consistent pelvic remodeling pattern associated with an implanted porous‐coated uncemented cup . Various cementless acetabular revision shells have been reported to have successful clinical and radiographic outcomes with a low rate of acetabular components requiring revision of the shell  However, if the acetabular defect resulted in the allograft supporting more than 50% of the cup, then the revision rate was high  Results depend on bone quality, rheumatoid arthritis and cup shape, material and surface finish .\n\n【8】Cemented Femur revision  \nImpacted allograft and cemented stems exchange procedures, employing various types and designs of stems, have repeatedly been reported to produce good results in the short, medium and longer term .

Some series have not used bone graft and still produce good mid‐term results but these have not been as reproducible \n\n【9】Cementless Femur revision  \nThere are numerous reports with good mid‐term results of cementless revision stems. These generally rely on distal diaphyseal fixation with either an extensively coated or tapered textured surface promoting bony ingrowth . The main complication is a general 5 to 10% fibrous ingrowth and a tendency to stress shield the proximal femur .\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cemented or cementless revision of the acetabular or femoral components of a total hip arthroplasty.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of environmental interventions (excluding taxation) targeted at sugar‐sweetened beverages or low‐calorie alternatives to sugar‐sweetened beverages on consumption levels, diet‐related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, and on any reported unintended consequences or adverse outcomes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Sugar‐sweetened beverages and health\n\n【7】Dietary and diet‐related risk factors are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The association of unhealthy diets with non‐communicable diseases is well established . It is estimated that 9% of the global burden of disease can be attributed to diets of poor nutritional content, 4% to overweight and obesity and 4% to hyperglycaemia (increased blood glucose levels) .\n\n【8】Among the various potential dietary risk factors sugar‐sweetened beverages (SSB) have recently received particular attention. Frequent consumption of SSB has been linked to an increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dental caries . It is estimated that due to their direct adverse health effects, 0.34% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23% to 0.46%) of the global burden of disease can be attributed to diets high in SSB .\n\n【9】There is no established definition of SSB. In the broadest sense, the term is used for liquids with added caloric sweeteners . Contrary to the literal meaning of the term SSB, alcoholic beverages with added sugar and sugar‐sweetened milk are generally not included in the definitions used in the literature . Following this convention we define, for the purpose of this review, SSB as non‐alcoholic, non‐dairy beverages with added caloric sweeteners. This definition includes, but is not limited to, carbonated and caffeinated soft drinks (sodas), fruit juices with less than 100% fruit content and added sugar, sugar‐sweetened energy and sports drinks, sugar‐sweetened vitamin waters and flavoured water, and sugar‐sweetened coffee and tea.\n\n【10】There is strong evidence for a causal role of SSB in the development of overweight and obesity . A review of reviews on the association between SSB intake and weight gain published in 2013 identified 17 systematic reviews (with 18 conclusions), of which 11 found positive associations. Of the seven systematic reviews that did not find positive associations, five were written by authors with links to the food and beverage industry . Since then, a number of systematic reviews  and high‐quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  have provided further evidence for a causal role of SSB in weight gain. Reported effect sizes vary by study design, population and follow‐up.\n\n【11】Moreover, a number of systematic reviews have found positive associations between SSB intake and type 2 diabetes . Based on a systematic review and meta‐analysis of prospective cohort studies, it was estimated that 4% to 13% of type 2 diabetes incidence in the USA, and 2% to 6% in the UK can be attributed to SSB . Furthermore, several systematic reviews have found positive associations between SSB consumption and cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, including hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease, for some but not all population groups . However, no increased risk for stroke was found .\n\n【12】In addition, in cross‐sectional and longitudinal observational studies, frequent consumption of SSB has been associated with an increased risk of dental caries, even after adjustment for possible confounders . However, evidence from high‐quality RCTs is still missing for the relationship between SSB consumption and oral health.\n\n【13】Findings for other health outcomes are less consistent, but positive associations have been reported for reduced bone density and increased risk of bone fracture , hyperuricaemia (increased levels of uric acid in blood) and gout  and chronic kidney disease . No significantly increased risks for cancer were found .\n\n【14】#### The pathophysiology of sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption\n\n【15】A number of physiological and psychological mediating mechanisms are discussed as explanations for the negative health outcomes linked to SSB. With regard to the causal role of SSB in weight gain, it has been shown that individuals incompletely compensate for calories consumed as SSB . Incomplete caloric compensation refers to the following phenomenon: when SSB are added to a diet, calorie intake from other sources is generally reduced by an amount smaller than the amount obtained from the SSB consumed _._ Two mechanisms may be responsible for this phenomenon: the inability of SSB to induce feelings of satiety equivalent to their caloric content, and the tendency of individuals to consume SSB regardless of hunger and satiety. A number of factors may contribute to this bi‐directional uncoupling of SSB consumption from normal feelings of hunger and satiety:\n\n【16】*   The lack of chewing and the lower orosensory response, as well as the faster gastric emptying time and lower mechanical fullness sensations associated with liquids as compared to solid foods .\n\n【17】*   The limited capacity of liquid calories to induce a satiating hormone response, including an attenuated release of glucagon‐like peptide 1, and a lower ghrelin suppression, as compared to solid calories .\n\n【18】*   The lower fullness sensation and satiating hormone response to SSB as compared to isocaloric beverages containing milk or other sources of protein .\n\n【19】*   The central nervous response to sugar, in particular its capacity to activate the endogenous reward system of the brain .\n\n【20】*   The caffeine content of many SSB, which can induce dependence effects .\n\n【21】*   The reduced perception of sweetness, and of the sugar and caloric content of chilled foods and beverages.\n\n【22】*   The relatively high glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) of SSB, as compared to beverages without added sugars and unprocessed foods, which can result in postprandial hyperglycaemia, a subsequent rapid insulin response followed by a marked drop in plasma glucose levels and concomitantly increased hunger .\n\n【23】The positive association of SSB with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease seems to be mediated largely through adiposity, which is a known risk factor for these conditions . However, it has been argued that additional direct causal pathways may exist . More specifically, highly processed dietary sugars, as they are present in SSB, may have adverse metabolic effects above and beyond their caloric content . The sugars most commonly used in SSB are either sucrose (a disaccharide made up of equal parts of glucose and fructose) or high‐fructose corn syrup, which consists of glucose and fructose in monomeric form, with a fructose content ranging from 42% to 55% . The degree to which sucrose and high‐fructose corn syrup are used in SSB varies by product and geographic region .\n\n【24】SSB constitute a source of empty calories, i.e. they contain energy but no micro‐ and macronutrients except water and sugars. SSB consumption can therefore lead to a reduced intake of micro‐ and macronutrients through alternative beverages as well as through solid foods, even under conditions of incomplete caloric compensation . It is estimated that 6.6% (95% CI: 4.7% to 8.4%) of the global burden of disease can be attributed to diets low in fruits, vegetables, fibre, milk and calcium . To achieve healthy dietary patterns, nutrient needs must be met without exceeding energy needs . Reducing intake of energy‐dense but nutrient‐poor foods and beverages, such as SSB, and replacing them with foods and beverages that provide substantial amounts of nutrients and relatively few calories, is therefore a key recommendation in a number of national and international dietary guidelines . More specifically, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommend to limit intake of SSB and to increase intake of unsweetened low‐fat or fat‐free milk , while the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on dietary sugars strongly recommends to reduce the intake of free sugars (including sugars from SSB) throughout the life‐course . Potentials causal pathways between SSB consumption and adverse health outcomes are shown in Figure 1 .\n\n【25】Physiological and psychological mechanisms linking SSB intake with adverse health outcomes.\n\n【26】#### Alternatives to sugar‐sweetened beverages\n\n【27】Plain water has been the most commonly used source of hydration for the largest part of the evolution of the human species . In the context of obesity and obesity‐related diseases, increased consumption of drinking water has been linked to a reduced total energy intake among certain populations . This effect of drinking water on energy intake may be due to a concomitantly reduced intake of caloric beverages, and possibly also due to a reduced intake of solid foods when water is consumed with or before meals, even though this second effect is disputed . Current dietary guidelines therefore recommend drinking water as a preferred alternative to SSB .\n\n【28】Another recommended alternative to SSB is low‐fat or fat‐free milk , which is an important source of micronutrients for which intake is lower than recommended among many populations, including calcium, vitamin D and potassium . For the purpose of this review, and following the Scientific Report of the 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, we consider fortified soy beverages, but not almond or other plant‐based “milk‐type” products as a substitute for milk . Furthermore, tea and coffee are recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015‐2020 as alternatives to SSB for the general public , but caffeine intake from coffee, tea and other sources should be limited to moderate amounts among children, adolescents and women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy .\n\n【29】Beverages containing non‐nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are not generally recommended by dietary guidelines as preferred alternatives to SSB . NNS, also known as low‐calorie, low‐energy or artificial sweeteners, are chemically diverse compounds with no or minimal caloric content and a sweet taste of varying intensity . In cross‐sectional and cohort studies frequent consumption of beverages with NNS was associated with adverse health outcomes similar to those associated with SSB, including an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes . However, most RCTs directly comparing beverages sweetened exclusively with NNS with SSB have shown results favouring the former with regard to weight gain . Moreover, available prospective studies indicate that after adjustment for possible confounders consumption of beverages with NNS is associated with a lower risk of diabetes than consumption of equal amounts of SSB . Furthermore, safety reviews by regulatory and scientific bodies have generally found NNS to be safe at the levels consumed by most populations .\n\n【30】Full‐fat milk and 100% fruit juice are both relevant sources of essential nutrients and relatively energy‐dense. Excessive amounts of these beverages can therefore contribute to a positive energy balance. Consequently, current dietary guidelines recommend to limit intake of 100% fruit juice among children and adolescents to moderate amounts, particularly among those who are overweight and obese, and to replace full‐fat milk with low‐fat or fat‐free milk . Moreover, full‐fat milk is relatively high in saturated fat . By contrast, beverages prepared by adding varying amounts of 100% fruit juice to carbonated or uncarbonated water without adding additional caloric sweeteners are generally considered acceptable alternatives to SSB .\n\n【31】Sugar‐sweetend milk constitutes another grey area. While dietary guidelines generally recommend to choose unsweetened milk , it remains controversial whether sugar‐sweetened milk should be targeted in public health interventions or not . It has been argued that limits on the consumption of sugar‐sweetened milk could decrease overall milk intake, and thus overall dietary quality . We will therefore consider interventions targeting sugar‐sweetened milk as a separate category. A table with all beverage categories to be considered in this review, and relevant definitions, is provided in Appendix 3 .\n\n【32】#### Sugar‐sweetened beverage consumption patterns\n\n【33】SSB consumption varies considerably by geographic location, gender, age and socio‐economic status. Based on a systematic review and pooled analysis of dietary surveys, global mean adult daily SSB consumption was estimated at 137 mL (95% CI: 88 mL to 211 mL) in 2010 . Mean daily SSB consumption is higher in upper‐middle income countries (189 mL) and lower‐middle income countries (140 mL) than in high‐income (121 mL) and low‐income (83 mL) countries, with substantial variation within regions  . Consumption is generally higher in younger age groups, among males, and in the Americas as compared to other world regions .\n\n【34】Estimated SSB consumption by country in 2010 (an 8 oz. serving is equivalent to approximately 237 ml). Reproduced with permission from Singh 2015 .\n\n【35】Over the past decades, consumption of SSB has increased substantially in most countries, with decreases observed in some, but not all countries beginning around 2000 . Among the populations with the highest intake, SSB constitute a substantial source of energy . It is estimated that in Mexico in 2012, SSB accounted for 7% of total energy intake among children, youth, and adults . For the USA, mean SSB consumption was estimated to account for 8% of total energy intake among youth in 2010, and for 6.9% of total energy intake for adults . In the USA, consumption levels have been shown to be particularly high among ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups .\n\n【36】The increase in the consumption of SSB observed over the past decades, and SSB consumption in general, have been attributed to a number of factors. Positive associations, which may or may not indicate causal relationships, have been shown for the following factors:\n\n【37】*   Exposure to advertisements and other forms of marketing .\n\n【38】*   Availability of SSB at school and in other educational settings .\n\n【39】*   Increases in unit and serving sizes .\n\n【40】*   Low relative and absolute prices .\n\n【41】*   Television watching and other screen‐based activities .\n\n【42】*   Low household and individual income, and insecure employment status .\n\n【43】*   Availability and regular visits of fast food restaurants serving SSB .\n\n【44】*   Exposure to and consumption of other energy‐dense, micronutrient‐poor foods both at and out of home .\n\n【45】*   Unawareness or disbelief in the association of SSB consumption and weight gain .\n\n【46】*   Mistrust in the safety of tap water .\n\n【47】*   Unfavorable parenting practices, including parental consumption of SSB, access to SSB at home, irregular family dinners, and overly permissive and pressuring parenting styles .\n\n【48】### Description of the intervention\n\n【49】Various interventions intended to reduce SSB intake and its effects on health, or to increase the intake of low‐calorie alternatives to SSB, have been implemented so far. Two approaches, which can be implemented separately or jointly as part of multi‐component interventions, can be distinguished :\n\n【50】*   Environmental interventions, targeting the environment, physical, socio‐economic, socio‐cultural or legal, in which individuals make food and beverage choices.\n\n【51】*   Behavioural interventions, targeting the dietary preferences, knowledge, attitudes, motivations, skills and abilities of individuals, as well as their subjective perception of social norms on food and beverage consumption.\n\n【52】The difference between environmental and behavioural interventions is not always clear‐cut. Interventions, such as marketing regulations, may aim to influence individual preferences by altering the environment encountered by individuals. In the present review, we will classify interventions as environmental when they aim to alter the food and beverage environment in a permanent way. Interventions that alter the food and beverage environment temporarily with the aim of influencing individual preferences (e.g. a one‐off public media campaign) will be considered as behavioural interventions.\n\n【53】In the present review, behavioural interventions will only be considered when they are part of larger interventions that also include environmental components, as a separate systematic review specifically on behavioural interventions is ongoing . In addition, we will exclude taxation, as a systematic review and meta analysis on SSB taxes has been published , and another one is ongoing .\n\n【54】To categorise included studies by intervention area we will use the NOURISHING framework, which has been developed by the World Cancer Research Fund International to classify nutrition interventions . It is consistent with the intervention categories used in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non‐Communicable Diseases 2013–2020  and the INFORMAS food environment benchmarking network . It distinguishes seven environmental and policy intervention areas (including the food system):\n\n【55】*   Labelling and food claim rules.\n\n【56】*   Interventions changing the availability of different foods and beverages in public institutions and other settings.\n\n【57】*   Pricing interventions (including both fiscal and non‐fiscal interventions altering the absolute and relative prices of SSB or low‐calorie alternatives to SSB; in the present review, we will exclude fiscal interventions, as they are covered by a separate review).\n\n【58】*   Advertisement regulation.\n\n【59】*   Reformulation.\n\n【60】*   Changes to the beverage retail and food service environment.\n\n【61】*   Food system approaches (including health‐in‐all policies approaches in sectors such as agriculture and trade).\n\n【62】In addition, the NOURISHING framework distinguishes three behavioural intervention areas:\n\n【63】*   Information on food and nutrition.\n\n【64】*   Nutrition counselling in health‐care settings.\n\n【65】*   Nutrition education and skills building.\n\n【66】Appendix 4 presents the NOURISHING framework in more detail, as well as relevant examples for interventions targeted at SSB or low‐calorie alternatives to SSB identified in a scoping literature search.\n\n【67】Moreover, interventions can be classified by their level of implementation :\n\n【68】*   Policy interventions, which are adopted and implemented on the level of geographically‐defined political or administrative units, such as supra‐national organisations, states, regions or municipalities. Alternative terms include jurisdiction‐based or macro‐level interventions.\n\n【69】*   Setting‐based interventions, which are adopted and implemented within individual settings, such as schools, work sites, local retail, food service or recreational facilities. Synonyms are community interventions, or meso‐level interventions.\n\n【70】Some interventions may be implemented either within individual settings or on a policy level, or they may even target both levels at the same time. Examples include bans on the sale of SSB at schools, which may be mandated by a local school director for his or her individual school, or by national legislation as part of a national school nutrition policy. Similarly, interventions such as labelling or content disclosure requirements are often first evaluated by trials within specific settings, e.g. an individual shop or restaurant, before they are implemented on a policy level, e.g. as part of national regulation. Such pilot trials can help to identify intervention options worth scaling up, and thus provide valuable information for policymakers. However, scaling up interventions which have proven successful within individual settings to the policy level poses specific challenges. Evaluations of interventions implemented within individual settings therefore provide only indirect and limited evidence on whether the intervention will or will not work on a policy level. In the present review, we will therefore classify interventions only as policy level when they are implemented on the level of a geographically‐defined political or administrative unit, and when the original studies reporting on them evaluate their effects on the same level (e.g. by analysing the effects of a national school nutrition policy on the SSB consumption of school children in that country). All other interventions, including pilot trials and evaluations restricted to individual settings will be classified as setting‐based interventions, regardless of whether the intervention in question is suitable for implementation on a policy level or not.\n\n【71】### How the intervention might work\n\n【72】All environmental nutrition interventions ultimately aim to change human food and beverage intake by providing conductive environments at different levels. A theoretical framework commonly used to conceptualise the effects of such interventions is the social‐ecological model. It postulates that dietary behaviour is influenced by a host of individual and environmental factors, which can interact to create complex, multi‐layered systems  . Environmental interventions generally target the macro‐ and meso‐level, i.e. policies and settings. Behavioural interventions generally target the micro‐level, i.e. interpersonal factors such as social norms and networks of social support, and intrapersonal factors such as personal preferences, attitudes and skills .\n\n【73】Socio‐ecological model of food and beverage intake. Adapted from CDC 2015 .\n\n【74】Behavioural interventions are often informed by theories of human behaviour, including the Theory of Planned Behaviour, and Social Cognitive Theory. The Theory of Planned Behaviour postulates that behavioural intentions depend on the personal attitudes (or preferences) of individuals and their perception of social norms, as well as on their perceived behavioural control . Social Cognitive Theory focuses on the influence of role models, outcome expectancies, self‐efficacy and identification . In practice, both theories and their constitutive concepts overlap.\n\n【75】Environmental interventions targeting the macro‐ and meso‐level are generally considered to have a larger potential population effect, and more likely to be cost‐effective and equitable when compared to micro‐level interventions . At the same time, it is more difficult to achieve political consensus regarding their implementation, and to evaluate them with rigorous scientific study designs  .\n\n【76】Determinants of diet‐related health outcomes and related interventions. Adapted from Swinburn 2011 .\n\n【77】How a given intervention will work additionally depends on a number of collateral factors, such as the characteristics of the target population, the delivery mechanisms, implementation aspects and further contextual factors. The intervention is thus nested in a complex system, as illustrated by the system‐based logic model shown in Figure 5 , which we developed for this systematic review and which will guide our data extraction, analysis and interpretation.\n\n【78】System‐based logic model for the influence of environmental interventions to reduce SSB intake on beverage choices and diet‐related health and non‐health outcomes.\n\n【79】Public health and health promotion interventions can have unintended consequences, including boomerang effects and other adverse outcomes . Boomerang effects are effects opposite to those intended by the intervention, and may be due to a number of phenomena, including psychological reactance, factual misunderstanding of health messages, reduced perceptions of self‐effectiveness, increased stigmatisation as well as adverse forms of compensatory behaviour, among others . In our scoping literature search, we found no reports on adverse outcomes of interventions targeted at reducing SSB consumption, or increasing the consumption of low‐calorie alternatives to SSB. However, a number of adverse outcomes of such interventions are conceivable. Interventions focused on reducing SSB intake may lead to decreased fluid intake and dehydration, in particular in settings where access to safe drinking water is limited. Insufficient hydration has been documented for a number of populations and has been linked to diverse negative health outcomes . In settings where access to safe drinking water is limited, we will pay particular attention to potential effects on health outcomes related to unsafe drinking water, such as diarrhoeal disease, although we are not currently aware of any reports to this end. Moreover, caffeine has been shown to improve concentration among certain populations, such as shift workers , which suggests that a decrease in the consumption of caffeinated SSB might have the potential to decrease productivity and safety among certain occupational groups. Nutrition interventions targeted at specific foods or beverages may lead to adverse compensatory behaviour, such as increased consumption of alternative but likewise unhealthy foods and beverages, or decreased physical activity  _._ Furthermore, nutrition interventions may increase stigmatisation of overweight and obese individuals, including internalised stigma , as well as stigmatisation of disadvantaged groups who are perceived as practicing unhealthy lifestyles . Additionally, nutrition interventions may exacerbate body image and eating disorders, including unhealthy weight control and dieting practices, and psychosocial distress . Given the popularity of SSB, it can be assumed that many people enjoy their consumption. It has therefore been suggested that limits on SSB may have the potential to decrease the quality of life of targeted populations, even though a cohort study among the adult population in Spain found no evidence for a beneficial effect of SSB consumption on health‐related quality of life . Finally, policy interventions in particular can have repercussions on the society and economy as a whole, including varying effects on employment and resource use in different sectors .\n\n【80】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【81】Numerous studies have explored the effects of interventions aimed at reducing the consumption of SSB or at increasing the consumption of low‐calorie alternatives to SSB. A number of systematic reviews on nutrition interventions in general have been published, some of which include studies on interventions targeting SSB, among others . Moreover, there are systematic reviews on interventions altering specific aspects of food and beverage environments, such as labelling , pricing  and portion sizes .\n\n【82】A number of non‐systematic reviews on interventions to reduce SSB consumption or to increase consumption of low‐calorie alternatives to SSB, including drinking water, have been published . One systematic review and meta‐analysis on SSB taxes has been published , and a Cochrane review on taxation of SSB for preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes is ongoing . One systematic review on interventions directed at SSB consumption of youth has been published , as well as one systematic review on interventions to reduce SSB intake among children leading to changes in body fatness . One mixed‐methods review on policies to reduce the intake of added sugar has been published . A Cochrane review protocol on drinking extra water or other non‐caloric beverages for promoting weight loss or preventing weight gain has been published .\n\n【83】One systematic review on behavioural interventions to reduce SSB intake has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews , as well as one systematic review on interventions to reduce SSB intake in children and adults . According to the published protocol, the latter will include behavioural and environmental interventions, considering randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials from a number of academic databases . In contrast, our review will focus on environmental interventions only, and consider additional, uncontrolled study designs which are commonly used to assess the effects of policy interventions. We will also search additional databases to identify studies in the grey literature and policy documents. In addition, we will report a different set of outcome measures, including unintended consequences, adverse outcomes and measures of cost‐effectiveness that may be of relevance to policymakers. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable systematic review, focusing on environmental interventions (other than taxation) to reduce the consumption of SSB among children, youth and adults has been published or registered yet.\n\n【84】Numerous global, regional and national policy initiatives in the field of nutrition and health call for action to reduce intake of added sugars , for which SSB are the most important source among many population groups, including the USA general population . Environmental interventions show particular promise to be effective and cost‐effective on a population level . A systematic synthesis of the available evidence in this field will help policymakers, regulators, health promotion authorities and professionals, and other relevant stakeholders to identify and implement effective interventions in their own constituencies.\n\n【85】Objectives\n----------\n\n【86】To assess the effects of environmental interventions (excluding taxation) targeted at sugar‐sweetened beverages or low‐calorie alternatives to sugar‐sweetened beverages on consumption levels, diet‐related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, and on any reported unintended consequences or adverse outcomes.\n\n【87】Methods\n-------\n\n【88】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【89】#### Types of studies\n\n【90】We will consider the following study types, as recommended by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) Group , using the definitions proposed by EPOC:\n\n【91】*   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Experimental studies in which people are allocated to different interventions using methods that are random. This includes both individually‐randomised controlled trials, in which the randomisation occurs on the level of individuals, and cluster‐randomised controlled trials (cluster‐RCTs), in which the randomisation occurs on the level of clusters of individuals, e.g. study groups or study sites.\n\n【92】*   Non‐randomised controlled trials (NRCTs): Experimental studies in which people (individuals or clusters of individuals) are allocated to different interventions using methods that are not random.\n\n【93】*   Controlled before‐after (CBA) studies: Studies in which observations are made before and after the implementation of an intervention, both in a group that receives the intervention and in a control group that does not. Unlike in NRCTs, the allocation to the intervention and control groups is not determined by the investigators, but by nature or by other factors outside the control of the investigators.\n\n【94】*   Interrupted‐time‐series (ITS) study: A study that uses observations at multiple time points before and after an intervention (the ‘interruption’). The design attempts to detect whether the intervention has had an effect greater than any underlying trend over time.\n\n【95】*   Repeated measures study (RMS): An ITS study where measurements are made in the same individuals at each time point.\n\n【96】For the exact classification of study designs we will use the algorithm provided by EPOC .\n\n【97】We will include only study designs that satisfy the following criteria specified by EPOC :\n\n【98】*   For cluster‐RCTs, NRCTs and CBA studies: studies with at least two intervention and two control sites.\n\n【99】*   For ITS and RMS: a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred and at least three data points before and three data points after the interventions.\n\n【100】Randomised and non‐randomised cross‐over trials will be included if they satisfy the criteria specified by EPOC for their respective study design.\n\n【101】The inclusion of evidence from non‐randomised controlled and uncontrolled study designs in systematic reviews is controversial . While non‐randomised study designs are commonly used for the evaluation of public health interventions, cluster‐randomisation is feasible for most setting‐based interventions which are of relevance to this review. Indeed, a number of RCTs of setting‐based interventions targeting SSB or low‐calorie alternatives to SSB have been done . However, NRCTs and CBA studies are more common . Even though NRCTs, CBA studies, ITS studies and RMS are generally of higher risk of bias than RCTs, we have decided to include these non‐randomised study designs in order to cover a broader set of study populations, interventions types, and intervention contexts.\n\n【102】#### Types of participants\n\n【103】Any participants, including adults, adolescents and children, regardless of their weight and health status.\n\n【104】#### Types of interventions\n\n【105】We will consider interventions that are intended to reduce the consumption of SSB and sugar‐sweetened milk, or their adverse effects on health, or to increase the consumption of low‐calorie alternatives to SSB, implemented at an environmental level. Where these include behavioural (individual‐level) components in addition to environmental components, this will be clearly documented. Stand‐alone behavioural interventions will not be included. We will exclude studies on taxation, as a separate Cochrane review on taxation to reduce the consumption of SSB is ongoing.\n\n【106】We will consider both ready‐to‐use SSB and SSB prepared from syrups, concentrates or powder. We will also include interventions that use beverages with NNS as a substitute for SSB, or in which the energy content of SSB is reduced by substituting caloric sweeteners with NNS through reformulation. Full‐fat milk and 100% fruit juice are, for the purpose of this review, not considered recommended alternatives to SSB. Interventions targeting these beverages will not be included. We will try to present results separately and examine and discuss differences in results for interventions targeting SSB, sugar‐sweetened milk, beverages with NNS, or unsweetened beverages. Appendix 3 presents a list of all beverage categories included in this review and relevant definitions.\n\n【107】We will exclude the following:\n\n【108】*   Studies conducted in laboratory or virtual settings, as the results may not be generalisable to real‐world environments.\n\n【109】*   Studies with a follow‐up period of less than three months, as the effects of environmental interventions may peter out due to habituation, which may severely limit their long‐term public health impact. In this review, we define the follow‐up period as the time span between the start of the intervention and the last outcome assessment.\n\n【110】*   Very small studies with less than 20 individuals in the intervention or control group, as the results may not be generalisable.\n\n【111】*   Studies in which participants are administered SSB or alternatives to SSB as part of clinical trials on the physiological effects of SSB consumption, as these studies provide only limited evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of public health interventions aimed at reducing SSB intake among free‐living individuals outside controlled research settings. This may include studies in which participants consume pre‐defined amounts of beverages under supervision, or in which bottled beverages are delivered for free to the homes of participants with additional measures taken to ensure and monitor compliance.\n\n【112】*   Studies on interventions that combine components to reduce the consumption of SSB with broader components to improve diet or increase physical activity, as it would be difficult to attribute effects to the environmental or policy intervention of interest. During the screening process we will document which studies we exclude for this reason. We will provide a list of the citations to allow reflection on the quantity of relevant evidence contained therein and consider to some extent how inclusion of these studies might have influenced conclusions.\n\n【113】The comparison will be no intervention, minimal or alternative interventions, such as behavioural intervention only.\n\n【114】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【115】Based on structured feedback from our Review Advisory Group, we identified a set of outcome measures that reflects short‐ and long‐term health and non‐health, and intended and unintended outcomes . We will use SI units (i.e. the metric system) to report results, except for energy, for which we will report both joules and calories. Values reported in the primary studies will be converted where necessary. To meet inclusion criteria, studies must report at least one primary outcome. For reformulation interventions that report effects on SSB consumption levels, at least one additional primary outcome is needed to justify inclusion.\n\n| **Table 1: Primary and secondary outcomes**  | **Table 1: Primary and secondary outcomes**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Examples**  |\n| **Primary outcomes**  | **Primary outcomes**  |\n| Direct and indirect measures of SSB intake  | The amount of SSB consumed or purchased in mL/day/person, energy intake from SSB and total energy intake in kcal/day/person.  |\n| Diet‐related anthropometric measures  | Body mass index (BMI), age‐ and sex‐standardised body mass index (zBMI or BMI z‐scores), waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, body weight change, incidence and prevalence of overweight and obesity, body composition or total body fat.  |\n| Diet‐related health outcomes (other than body weight)  | Incidence and prevalence of pre‐diabetes and diabetes, insulin resistance, blood lipids and blood pressure, incidence of dental caries and other indicators of oral health.  |\n| Any reported adverse outcomes or unintended consequences  | Compensatory behaviour, reduced fluid intake and dehydration, reduced intake of essential nutrients, body image changes, unhealthy dietary practices, unhealthy weight control, perceived reduction of freedom of choice and other forms of target group and stakeholder dissatisfaction, negative effects on employment or other adverse economic consequences.  |\n| **Secondary outcomes**  | **Secondary outcomes**  |\n| Measures of financial and economic viability  | Costs, cost‐effectiveness, return on investment, and staff time requirements  |\n| Diet‐related psychosocial variables  | Perceived dietary self‐efficacy, general self‐efficacy, health‐related and general quality of life.  |\n| Target group perceptions of the intervention  | Satisfaction with the intervention, satisfaction with the way the intervention was implemented, support for the continuation of the intervention.  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , LILACS , Web of Science  and the UK Department of Health National Research Register .\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate.\n\n【12】We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies.\n\n【13】In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms.\n\n【14】In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period.\n\n【15】Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.\n### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Populatio\n\n【19】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Acute Cough\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Interventio\n\n【21】*   Oral\n\n【22】###### Compariso\n\n【23】*   Oral\n\n【24】###### Outcom\n\n【25】*   Acute Cough\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

We found 29 trials involving 4835 people.\n\n【30】**Background**\n\n【31】Acute cough is a common and troublesome symptom in children and adults suffering from acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Many people self prescribe over‐the‐counter (OTC) cough preparations, and health practitioners often recommend their use for the initial treatment of cough. There is substantial variation between countries in the availability and guidelines for use of many of these preparations.\n\n【32】**Study characteristics**\n\n【33】We identified a broad range of studies of different types of preparations used at different dosages in both adults and children.\n\n【34】**Key results**\n\n【35】The evidence is current up to March 2014. We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough. Nineteen studies reported adverse effects of these medications and described infrequent, mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness.\n\n【36】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【37】The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult. While all studies were placebo‐controlled randomised controlled trials only a minority reported their methods of allocation and randomisation and there was lack of reporting of blinding of outcome assessors and whether cough outcome measures were validated. In addition, studies supported by pharmaceutical companies or other providers were more likely to have positive results. Studies were very different from each other in terms of treatment types, treatment duration and outcomes measured, making evaluation of overall effectiveness of OTC cough medicines difficult.\n\n【38】--------------\n\n【39】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【40】### Implications for practice\n\n【41】There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over‐the‐counter (OTC) cough medicines, and from the studies included in this review it remains unclear whether these medications are helpful for the treatment of acute cough. Although a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared OTC cough preparations with placebo, the number of trials in each group was small. This review suggests that most preparations appear to be safe, based on those studies reporting side effects, which only described a low incidence of mainly minor adverse effects. However, more serious concerns about the safety of OTC cough medicines have arisen since this review was last updated, particularly in young children and, in general, larger numbers of patients are required in order to identify serious, though less common adverse effects . This systematic review confirms the lack of evidence for or against an effect of OTC cough preparations despite using an extensive search strategy. This lack of evidence of effectiveness also has implications for the regulatory bodies and brings into question how these products can continue to be promoted using language that implies that their effectiveness is not in doubt.\n\n【42】The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes varied markedly between studies, limiting the generalisability of the results. All results were based on a small number of studies. It is also questionable as to whether all of the positive results obtained with unclear outcome measures are clinically relevant.\n\n【43】### Implications for research\n\n【44】Further high‐quality RCTs of OTC cough preparations are needed as the results of this review are based on a small number of often underpowered studies. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, particularly in relation to the use of honey in adults and children, as identification of effective self care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Research should also include individuals who self medicate with OTC cough preparations, as there is likely to be a variation between countries in the proportion of individuals using these medications, with or without professional advice, particularly given the international variation in what products are available OTC or on a prescription basis. There is also a need to identify ineffective preparations in order to lower costs for consumers and healthcare providers. Studies will need to be rigorously designed and should use clinically relevant outcome measures, including cough frequency, severity and duration. It is important that future RCTs use OTC drugs in doses recommended by the manufacturers for an appropriate length of time, as drugs tested in a single and possibly too low a dose are likely to be ineffective. Trials should also report details on effect sizes and provide data on adherence and adverse effects. This review also highlights a need for an outcome measure for acute cough that is clinically relevant, valid, reliable and easy to use in RCTs.\n\n【45】Background\n----------\n\n【46】### Description of the condition\n\n【47】Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is one of the most common symptoms worldwide. A large number of people self prescribe non‐prescription over‐the‐counter (OTC) cough medicines for themselves or their children, and many health professionals in primary care settings recommend them to their patients as a first‐line treatment . OTC medicines are available to the public from pharmacies, chemists and shops without medical or dental prescription in most countries, as opposed to prescription‐only medicines (POM). A national telephone survey of medication use in the US indicated that in a given week, 10% of children are given an OTC cough preparation by their carers . Numerous OTC cough preparations are available, but evidence regarding their efficacy is inconclusive. Some studies of cough preparations have been shown to reduce cough symptoms, whereas others found no effect compared with placebo . In recent years there have been safety concerns that led to the withdrawal of OTC cough medicines containing antihistamines and antitussives in children under six years. These regulatory changes were based on rare fatalities identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, highlighting the potential of these agents to cause harm, particularly if there is accidental overdosage. However, these medicines are still available for children over the age of six years. In addition, following concerns about QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, the non‐narcotic antitussive clobutinol was withdrawn in the European Union in 2008.\n\n【48】### Description of the intervention\n\n【49】Many studies have involved patients from different populations that have included participants with chronic cough due to underlying disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or that were carried out on healthy volunteers in whom cough had been induced by chemical irritants . Other randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared active agents and did not include a placebo. Cough preparations may contain different drugs with a variety of modes of action, which can make them difficult to compare .\n\n【50】### How the intervention might work\n\n【51】Non‐prescription oral OTC medicines for cough have different modes of action based on their active ingredients as follows.\n\n【52】1.  Antitussives, for example centrally acting opioid derivatives , or other peripherally active agents, act by reducing the cough reflex.\n\n【53】2.  Expectorants, i.e. drugs leading to increased bronchial mucus production, make secretions easier to remove by cough or ciliary transport .\n\n【54】3.  Mucolytics, i.e. drugs aiming to decrease the viscosity of bronchial secretions, act to make secretions easier to clear through coughing .\n\n【55】4.  Antihistamine‐decongestant combinations, i.e. drugs that are combined antihistamine H1‐receptor antagonists and alpha‐adrenoceptor agonists, act by causing vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels thus reducing congestion .\n\n【56】5.  Antihistamines, i.e. antihistamine H1‐receptor agonists, act by reducing histamine release and thus reducing local congestion and production of secretions.\n\n【57】6.  Other drug combinations, i.e. fixed drug combinations using different ingredients, have mechanisms of action based on individual ingredients.\n\n【58】7.  Honey is regarded as having bactericidal properties and there has been recent interest in its potential effectiveness in relieving the symptoms of URTI, including cough. In studies to date it has been administered as a single dose before bedtime or diluted in a non‐caffeinated beverage. An existing Cochrane review of honey for acute cough has concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of honey in acute cough in children .\n\n【59】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【60】Previous systematic reviews of OTC cough and cold preparations revealed that there is insufficient evidence for or against an effect of OTC cough preparations compared to placebo . However, these reviews did either not use a systematic search for RCTs , or performed searches that were limited to the MEDLINE database . By using a more extensive search strategy, this systematic review aims to answer the question of whether OTC medications used for the treatment of acute cough associated with URTI are effective.\n\n【61】Objectives\n----------\n\n【62】To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.\n\n【63】Many different groups of OTC medicines are available, therefore we aimed to make comparisons only within groups of preparations with a similar mode of action or other similar features.\n\n【64】Methods\n-------\n\n【65】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【66】#### Types of studies\n\n【67】All placebo‐controlled RCTs of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough.\n\n【68】#### Types of participants\n\n【69】1.  Community or ambulatory settings in primary care and hospital outpatients.\n\n【70】2.  Children and adults with acute onset of cough (less than three weeks' duration).\n\n【71】We excluded studies testing OTC medicines for chronic cough (more than three weeks' duration), cough due to underlying respiratory disease (such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung malignancy). We also excluded studies where cough was induced artificially (through inhalation of chemicals) in healthy volunteers.\n\n【72】#### Types of interventions\n\n【73】Non‐prescription oral OTC medicines for cough are classified according to their mode of action, as outlined above, and we have grouped them as follows.\n\n【74】1.  Antitussives, for example, centrally acting opioid derivatives .\n\n【75】2.  Expectorants, i.e. drugs leading to increased bronchial mucus production .\n\n【76】3.  Mucolytics, i.e. drugs aiming to decrease the viscosity of bronchial secretions .\n\n【77】4.  Antihistamine‐decongestant combinations, i.e. drugs that are combined antihistamine H1‐receptor antagonists and alpha‐adrenoceptor agonists, which cause vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels .\n\n【78】5.  Antihistamines, i.e. antihistamine H1‐receptor agonists.\n\n【79】6.  Other drug combinations, i.e. fixed drug combinations using different ingredients.\n\n【80】7.  Honey.\n\n【81】We excluded studies that used non‐oral preparations (for example, nasal sprays, inhalers, nebulised solutions) or that tested ingredients other than those accepted in Western (allopathic) medicine (for example, herbal or homeopathic medicines) because we felt that this review would have become too broad.\n\n【82】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【83】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【84】All cough outcomes (such as frequency, severity, amount of sputum, improvement in cough symptoms using continuous and categorical data and different ways of measurement including cough sound pressure levels, cough counts, patient questionnaires, physician assessment, etc).

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To evaluate the benefits and harms of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements as a treatment for DSPN in people with diabetes mellitus compared to placebo or no treatment.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Peripheral neuropathies are the most common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus, and can be classified into three broad subgroups: 1. diffuse distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN), sometimes with autonomic neuropathy; 2. mononeuropathy and multiple mononeuropathies; and 3. radiculopathy or polyradiculopathy . DSPN is the most common neuropathy and in people with diabetes approximately 75% are of this type . Damage can be to small fibres, large fibres, or both.\n\n【8】DSPN progression evolves in a classic length‐dependent, symmetrical distribution, affecting first the longest nerves in the lower limbs . Large, myelinated nerve fibres are involved in proprioception and pressure detection, and damage to these nerves can result in numbness, tingling and poor balance . Clinical signs of large nerve fibre involvement include a reduction or loss of ankle reflexes, vibration perception, proprioception and 10‐g monofilament perception . Small myelinated nerve fibres are involved in nociception and protective sensation. Damage to these nerves results in neuropathic pain (i.e. burning, lancinating or shooting sensations), which is typically worse at night and may be associated with hyperalgesia, allodynia, or both . Up to 50% of people with DSPN are symptomatic, and neuropathic pain is reported in 15% to 25% of cases . If not identified, and if preventive foot care is not implemented, people with DSPN are further at risk for injuries due to their insensate feet .\n\n【9】Diagnosis of DSPN is principally on clinical grounds, based on a clinical history and examination to establish neuropathic deficits . Electrodiagnostic studies, such as nerve conduction studies (NCS), provide informative and validated measures of nerve function and are suitable for monitoring progression . However, while NCS are sensitive for detecting large myelinated nerve fibre damage, they cannot detect small nerve fibre damage . Small fibre involvement is instead assessed by fibre‐type specific tests, such as quantitative sensory testing . Corneal nerve parameters, measured from in vivo confocal microscopy images, are also sensitive surrogate markers for assessing small nerve fibre structure and monitoring DSPN progression . Symptoms and signs of nerve damage are often assessed using validated neuropathy scales or composite scores , which can further quantify impairment and the impact of DSPN on quality of life. While signs are better predictors of polyneuropathy than symptoms alone, the combination of symptoms, clinical signs and electrodiagnostic findings provide the most accurate diagnosis of DSPN .\n\n【10】Table 1.

It is hypothesised that oxidative and inflammatory stressors in the context of metabolic dysfunction contribute to neuronal damage and the impairment of nerve function . Under conditions of hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress combined with vascular dysfunction impairs neuronal blood flow and induces local inflammatory reactions through the release of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, metabolic dysregulation leads to decreased neurotrophic support and impaired neural function, and, over time, precipitates the apoptosis of peripheral nerve neurons and Schwann cells . Other possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy include accelerated metabolism in the polyol pathway, accumulation of advanced glycation end‐products and activation of protein kinase C pathways . Although motor neuron cell bodies of the peripheral nervous system are protected by the blood–brain barrier, sensory neuron cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia and are not protected; therefore, they are potentially more vulnerable to injury from systemic metabolic and hypoxic stressors .\n\n【15】Strict glycaemic control is known to partially prevent, or at least delay, the onset and progression of DSPN in type 1 diabetes . This suggests that insulin‐dependent pathways impaired in type 1 diabetes may also be important for maintaining peripheral nerve function. By contrast, in type 2 diabetes, improving glycaemic control does little to affect the course of established DSPN . This suggests that components of the metabolic syndrome (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, visceral adiposity and impaired glucose regulation) play a role in the onset and progression of DSPN. Modifiable risk factors for DSPN include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity and smoking cessation . While glycaemic control can reduce DSPN development, on its own it is not adequate to prevent progression of nerve loss in DSPN associated with type 2 diabetes .\n\n【16】Like the pathophysiology of DSPN, the prevalence of DSPN also differs between populations with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Whilst in type 1 diabetes at least 20% of people will have DSPN after 20 years of disease , DSPN may be present in 10% to 15% of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and in 50% after 10 years of disease . Impaired glucose tolerance has also been associated with DSPN, particularly the painful small‐fibre neuropathy subtype, being present in 10% to 30% of this population .\n\n【17】#### Management of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy\n\n【18】Current clinical management of DSPN aims to prevent progressive nerve damage by optimising glycaemic control and other risk factors, reduce any associated symptoms, and prevent and proactively treat complications as they arise . Symptomatic treatments, such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants, can be implemented to reduce pain and improve quality of life . Disease‐modifying agents for DSPN are being evaluated, with the aims of preventing, slowing or reversing DSPN progression by targeting aspects of the pathogenesis and reducing oxidative stress .\n\n【19】### Description of the intervention\n\n【20】Omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are one of two main classes of essential fatty acids (EFAs) that play a role in modulating cellular function and systemic inflammation in the body. PUFAs are termed 'essential' as they must be obtained from dietary sources because humans lack the enzymes for their de novo synthesis.\n\n【21】There are two main types of omega‐3 PUFAs: 1. short‐chain omega‐3 PUFAs (alpha‐linolenic acid), which typically derive from plant sources and act as a metabolic precursor to the long‐chain forms; and 2. long‐chain omega‐3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)), which are present in abundance in oily fish . Consumption of long‐chain omega‐3 PUFAs bias towards the systemic production of anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective bioactive lipid mediators. By contrast, the other major class of diet‐derived EFAs, the omega‐6 fatty acids, predominantly yield proinflammatory arachidonic acid‐associated mediators .\n\n【22】Omega‐3 and omega‐6 PUFAs are functionally distinct and not interconvertible. As the enzymatic conversion of omega‐3 and omega‐6 PUFAs occurs in competition, the balance of omega‐3 to omega‐6 fatty acid consumption affects systemic inflammatory processes and immune activity, and can be an important determinant of systemic health status . Diets rich in omega‐6 fatty acids, such as typical Western diets, shift systemic physiology towards a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state. By contrast, incorporation of omega‐3 PUFAs into cellular phospholipid membranes can result in a shift towards the systemic production of anti‐inflammatory mediators . Both the American Heart Association (AHA) and Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) dietary guidelines recommend that people consume approximately 500 mg of DHA and EPA per day (combined), either as fatty fish or supplements, for preventing chronic disease . Oral omega‐3 fatty acid supplements in various dosages have been reported to improve chronic inflammatory conditions, such as dry eye disease , rheumatoid arthritis , and inflammatory bowel disease . A minimum of 2000 mg (EPA plus DHA) per day is clinically effective for improving metabolic profiles in people with elevated triglycerides, including people with diabetes . The AHA further recommends 4000 mg per day (either EPA or EPA plus DHA), as either monotherapy or as an adjunct to other triglyceride‐lowering therapies, for managing hypertriglyceridaemia . A role for omega‐3 PUFAs in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy relates to the postulated oxidative and inflammatory stress mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy.\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】PUFAs are major components of cellular phospholipid membranes . Systemic omega‐3 PUFAs alter the biophysical properties of membranes and regulate protein signalling and gene expression . Long‐chain omega‐3 PUFAs are also precursors for a range of anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective mediators . Dietary consumption of long‐chain omega‐3 PUFAs is also associated with lowering systemic triglycerides  and improving insulin sensitivity , both of which are modifiable risk factors implicated in the development of DSPN .\n\n【25】Preclinical studies have investigated a role for omega‐3 PUFAs in preserving peripheral nerve function and promoting neurogenesis. Mice with higher endogenous omega‐3 PUFA levels showed increased resistance to peripheral nerve injury and greater neuronal growth relative to wild‐type mice . Omega‐3 supplementation has also been shown to modify neuronal Na <sup>+ </sup> /K <sup>+ </sup> ‐ATPase transportation (which contributes to the impairment of nerve function in DSPN) by altering fatty acid composition and restoring sciatic membrane activity in rats with experimentally induced diabetes . Alterations to endogenous omega‐3 PUFA levels can thus modify neuroendocrine cellular interactions, which are affected in diabetes, through effects on platelet aggregation, immune function and neuronal development, to potentially limit neuronal damage and improve nerve function in DSPN.\n\n【26】DHA, as an integral component in cellular membrane structures of the brain and retina, has been involved in perinatal visual and neural development . Its metabolite, neuroprotectin D‐1 (NPD‐1), in addition to its roles in attenuating inflammation, mediates neuroprotection by attenuating proapoptotic signalling pathways to reduce oxidative stress‐induced cellular apoptosis . DHA and NPD‐1 are reported to have therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative conditions of both the central and peripheral nervous systems . Low‐certainty evidence from two small studies suggests that oral consumption of combined EPA and DHA supplements taken over the course of taxol or oxaliplatin chemotherapy may reduce the incidence of chemotherapy‐induced neuropathy .\n\n【27】Omega‐3 PUFA supplementation, in particular supplements with a relative abundance of DHA, can improve EFA dysmetabolism in type 1 diabetes. In clinical settings, omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation has been reported to improve small nerve fibre anatomy, function, or both, in people with type 1 diabetes with no to moderate DSPN . In type 2 diabetes, there is a rationale, but no proof, that high dietary omega‐3 fatty acids could reduce the risk of developing DSPN by improving inflammatory parameters and the overall metabolic profile .\n\n【28】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【29】The disability and psychosocial impairments associated with DSPN are significant, and so too is the economic burden in terms of healthcare costs and medical resources . In the US, the total estimated annual cost of treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its complications is approximately USD 13.7 billion ; a larger economic burden is placed upon those with painful DSPN . There is currently an unmet need for effective treatments to prevent the onset of DSPN or slow its progression; such disease‐modifying agents would greatly improve clinical outcomes, and reduce impairment and concomitant healthcare costs.\n\n【30】There is biological rationale that a person's diet, in particular omega‐3 PUFA consumption, may modify peripheral nerve function in DSPN. Preclinical experimental models show that dietary modification with omega‐3 PUFAs can reduce motor and sensory nerve conduction losses and modify vascular and peripheral nerve damage in rats with diabetes . Translating these findings to humans, clinical studies have shown that oral omega‐3 PUFA supplementation improves corneal nerve health in subclinical DSPN. Specifically, one open‐label, single‐arm trial found that oral omega‐3 PUFA supplementation for 12 months was associated with an increased density of corneal sensory nerves relative to pretreatment, providing evidence of regeneration in people with type 1 diabetes .\n\n【31】Objectives\n----------\n\n【32】To evaluate the benefits and harms of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements as a treatment for DSPN in people with diabetes mellitus compared to placebo or no treatment.\n\n【33】Methods\n-------\n\n【34】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【35】#### Types of studies\n\n【36】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs that use a partly systematic method, such as dates, alternation or case‐record numbers, to allocate participants), as we expect to find few relevant RCTs. We will include cross‐over trials (using only data obtained before cross‐over). We will exclude cluster‐randomised trials. We will include studies reported as full text, as abstract only and unpublished data where these data can be sourced. There will be no language restrictions. In cases where more than one publication reports data from the same cohort of participants (i.e. from the same trial), we will collate the data from multiple reports under one study ID, and use the data reporting on the largest number of participants from the study.\n\n【37】#### Types of participants\n\n【38】We will include studies involving adults (i.e. aged 18 years and over) with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and DSPN of any severity (including subclinical DSPN, as defined by the study authors), recruited within any setting. We will accept populations with DSPN diagnosed using symptoms, signs or clinical assessments of peripheral nerve structure or function. We will include subsets of people with DSPN in studies of mixed neuropathies if results are reported separately for the subset of participants with DSPN, provided that the studies are otherwise eligible for inclusion. If this information is not available, we will contact the corresponding study authors via email. If we fail to receive a response from the corresponding author within four weeks, or if the authors are unable to provide us with the requested information, we will use the information that is available.\n\n【39】#### Types of interventions\n\n【40】We will include trials comparing oral short‐chain or long‐chain omega‐3 PUFA supplements, or both, in any form and at any daily dosage, with placebo or no treatment. We will include studies where co‐interventions have been administered, provided these are administered to each group equally. We will include studies where the treatment duration is at least 180 days, which is the time required for the incorporation of PUFAs into erythrocyte membranes to reach a steady state .\n\n【41】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【42】The outcomes listed here are not eligibility criteria for this review, but are outcomes of interest within whichever studies are included.\n\n【43】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【44】*   **Impairment:** change from baseline in an impairment score, measured using a validated measure (e.g. the Neuropathy Impairment Score , Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score ), or by sensory function, quantified using validated tools, such as the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Sensory Sum Score , at the final study visit after at least six months of follow‐up (and a minimum treatment period of 180 days).\n\n【45】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【46】Change from baseline at the final study visit after at least six months of follow‐up for the following secondary outcomes.\n\n【47】*   **Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy:** measured using a validated, participant‐reported total symptom score (e.g. visual analogue scale , Neuropathy Total Symptom Score )\n\n【48】*   **Pain:** measured using a validated, participant‐reported pain score (e.g. visual analogue scale , McGill Pain Questionnaire )\n\n【49】*   **Quality of life:** measured using a participant‐reported questionnaire\n\n【50】*   **Change in corneal nerve fibre length:** measured in millimetres per millimetre squared from in vivo confocal microscopy images\n\n【51】*   **Sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes:** measured in microvolts\n\n【52】*   **Adverse events:** considered as 1. any adverse events, 2. adverse events leading to discontinuation of the interventions and 3. serious adverse events, being those leading to hospitalisation or prolonged admission, a life‐threatening event or death.\n\n【53】If data are reported as endpoint measures, rather than as the change from baseline, we will use this information in our analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The aim of this review is to assess the effects of protease inhibitors in acute pancreatitis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process that occurs in the pancreas where restoration of normal pancreatic function after the episode is expected. From a clinical point of view, it is classified as acute unless there are computed tomographic or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis . The pathologic spectrum of acute pancreatitis varies from a mild and usually self‐limited disorder (that is interstitial or edematous pancreatitis) to a more severe form (that is necrotizing pancreatitis) which may cause pancreatic necrosis, systemic manifestations, and death.\n\n【7】The incidence of acute pancreatitis has increased in the last decades, probably as a consequence of changing risk factors . In the majority of patients the disease presents in its mild form and resolves without serious morbidity, but in those with the severe form mortality may be as high as 25% .\n\n【8】There are many causes of acute pancreatitis. Biliary stone migration and alcohol consumption are the most frequent aetiologies. Other causes include hypertriglyceridemia, hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic malignancy, ERCP, trauma, infectious agents, drugs, autoimmunity and heredity characteristics .\n\n【9】The pathogenesis underlying the initiation of the inflammatory process is not completely understood. Animal models and human studies show similar biochemical and structural changes in initial phases, which suggest that a similar cascade of events occurs once pancreatitis begins irrespective of the initial factor that triggers the disease .\n\n【10】The predominant pathogenic theory is autodigestion. According to this, pancreatitis results when proteolytic enzymes are activated in the pancreas rather than in the intestinal lumen. In the early phases, there is an activation of the pancreatic proteolytic enzyme trypsin, while its secretion is blocked. This leads to intra‐pancreatic activation of trypsinogen into active trypsin, within acinar cells. This causes the activation of other enzymes like phospholipase A2, chymotrypsin and elastase, overcoming natural defence mechanisms like pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, autolysis of prematurely activated trypsin, mesotrypsin, enzyme Y, and antiproteases such as alpha‐1 antitrypsin and alpha‐2‐macroglobulin. The activation of proteolytic enzymes causes microcirculatory dysfunctions, activation of the inflammatory cascade, leukocyte and macrophage migration, complement and kinin pathways activation, release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, all of which contribute to the damage of pancreatic and peri‐pancreatic tissue.\n\n【11】In some patients, the response extend beyond the pancreas, leading to systemic complications like fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pleural effusions, renal failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunctions probably produced by cytokines and pancreatic enzymes released into the circulation.\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】The protease inhibitors are a group of proteins with broad inhibitory actions on serine‐proteases, coagulation system, and production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines .\n\n【14】Aprotinin is a bovine protein similar to human pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and was the first antiprotease agent used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis . It has also been used as an antifibrinolytic agent to minimize bleeding in cardiac surgery, but concerns about its safety have been raised by the results of recent trials in this setting, where aprotinin increases the mortality in comparison with other antifibrinolytics .\n\n【15】Gabexate, ulinastatin and nafamostat share with aprotinin its effects on serine‐proteases, coagulation, fibrinolysis and on production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines  but seem to be safer than the latter even when administered in high doses. Ulinastatin and nafamostat have a longer half‐life and are more potent than gabexate.\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】The key pathogenic process in the beginning of acute pancreatitis is the massive activation of trypsin and other proteases within acinar cells that overcomes natural antiproteases like alpha‐1 antitrypsin and alpha‐2‐macroglobulin. This initial injury is amplified in some patients by the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, which leads to a systemic inflammatory response. Theoretically, the inhibition of proteases within acinar cells, and also circulating proteases and inflammatory cytokines, may improve the prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis.\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】The current evidence on the usefulness of protease inhibitors has limitations.\n\n【20】Two systematic reviews and meta‐analyses from the 90s showed that gabexate significantly reduced complications and the rate of surgical intervention in acute pancreatitis when compared with placebo. However, no effect on mortality was observed .

In patients from different age groups undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV), it has been observed that particular positions, such as prone position, may improve some respiratory parameters. Benefits from these positions have not been clearly defined in critically ill newborns who may require mechanical ventilation for extended periods of time.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of different positioning of newborn infants receiving MV on short term respiratory outcomes and complications of prematurity.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Databases searched  were the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . Hand searches of proceedings of the Society for Pediatric Research from 1990 to May 2006 were used to identify unpublished studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised or quasi randomised clinical trials comparing different positions in newborns receiving mechanical ventilation.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Three independent and unblinded reviewers assessed the trials for inclusion in the review and extracted the data. Data were double‐checked and entered into the Review Manager software.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eleven trials involving 206 infants were included in this review. Several positions were compared: prone vs. supine, prone vs. lateral right, lateral right vs. supine, lateral left vs. supine, lateral right vs. lateral left and good lung dependent vs. good lung uppermost. Apart from one of the two studies that compared lateral right vs. lateral left positions, and one comparing prone vs. supine position, all the included studies had a crossover design. Comparing prone vs. supine position, an increase in arterial P02 in the prone position of between 2.75 and 9.72 mm Hg (95%CI) was observed (one trial). When % hemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured with pulse oximetry, improvement in the prone position was from 1.18 to 4.36% (typical effect based on four trials). In addition, there was a slight improvement in the number of episodes of desaturation. It was not possible to establish whether this effect remained once the intervention was stopped. Negative effects from the interventions were not described, although this issue was not studied in sufficient detail. Effects of position on other outcomes were not statistically significant; however, either positive nor negative effects cannot be excluded considering the small numbers that were studied.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The prone position was found to slightly improve the oxygenation in neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, we found no evidence concerning whether particular body positions during mechanical ventilation of the neonate are effective in producing sustained and clinically relevant improvements.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Term infant (37-41 weeks)\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Preterm Infant\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Supine positioning\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Prone positioning\n*   Positioning Patient\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Catheter Dislodgment\n*   Pulse Oximetry\n*   Pneumothorax\n*   Ventilator Associated Pneumonia\n*   Chronic Lung Disease\n*   Intraventricular Hemorrhage\n*   Device Dislodgement\n*   Neonatal Oxygen Desaturation\n*   Pulmonary Interstitial Emphysema Syndrome\n*   Carbon Dioxide Measurement\n*   Lung function test\n*   Neurodevelopmental Delay\n*   Partial Arterial Pressure Of Oxygen\n*   Airway peak pressure\n*   Inadvertent Tracheal Extubation\n*   Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Of Newborn\n*   Death\n*   Oxygen Saturation\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n*   Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen\n*   Perinatal Periventricular Hemorrhage\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

In this minor update the following databases have also been searched CINAHL, LILACS, KoreaMed, IndMed, PakMediNet, Current Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to May 2009.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】RCTs involving transfusions of granulocytes, given therapeutically, to patients with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil dysfunction.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two reviewers completed data extraction independently. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random effects model were reported for dichotomous outcomes. Pre‐specified subgroup analyses were done and reported eg granulocyte dose.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eight parallel RCTs were included with 310 total analysed patient episodes. Different policies were applied for the schedule of transfusion, method of granulocyte procurement and process of donor selection including leucocyte compatibility. Each study used different criteria for neutropenia (range < 0.1 to < 1.0 x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and definition of infection requiring treatment.\n\n【12】For mortality, which was extracted from six trials, the summary RR = 0.64 in favour of transfusion (95% CI 0.33, 1.26), but with evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity (Chi‐square 11.3 and I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 56%). The data for the combined RR for mortality for the four studies transfusing higher granulocyte doses greater than 1x10 <sup>10 </sup> indicated a significant summary RR= 0.37 (95% CI 0.17, 0.82); Chi‐square 3.9, I <sup>2 </sup> 23%. Data on rates of reversal of infection could be extracted from four studies, and the combined RR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.26), again with evidence of heterogeneity. In addition to the observed clinical diversity between all studies, uncertainty about the quantitative and qualitative analyses for these studies is compounded by methodological deficiencies. The searches were updated in May 2009 identified one small additional RCT and an ongoing trial, both of which will be included in a full update when data is available.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Currently, there is inconclusive evidence from RCTs to support or refute the generalised use of granulocyte transfusion therapy in the most common neutropenic patient populations, that is caused by myeloablative chemotherapy with or without haematopoietic stem cell support. Contemporary well designed prospective trials are required to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in these patient populations and to establish definitively whether it has clinical benefit.

In very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight < 1500 g) infants, _Candida albicans_ is the third most common cause (5.8%) of first episodes of late onset sepsis (LOS) (defined as sepsis after the first 72 hours of life) . The incidence of infections due to Candida varies inversely with the gestational age and birth weight , with an incidence between 2.6% to 12.9% in VLBW infants  and 5.5% to 20% in ELBW infants (extremely low birth weight infants, birth weight < 1000 g) . Although _Candida albicans_ is the major Candida species isolated from neonates, infection with other species such as _C. parapsilosis_ , _C. tropicalis_ and fluconazole resistant _C. glabrata_ are also increasing . In a multicenter cohort study of 2847 infants, overall mortality in infants with candidemia was 22.9% . In addition, systemic candidiasis was associated with an increase in hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation . Candida infection and colonization is associated with significant health care costs, which are due to increased length of hospital stay, costs of antifungal therapy and associated co‐morbidities .\n\n【10】Infection with candida can manifest as mucocutaneous or systemic candidiasis. Mucocutaneous candidiasis (MCC) may be defined as candidal infection of the skin and mucous membranes. MCC includes oral thrush, diaper dermatitis, congenital candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis that has the potential to spread systemically into the blood or other tissues . Colonization can be defined as the presence of a microorganism in or on a host, with growth and multiplication, but without any overt clinical expression or detected immune response in the host at the time the microorganism is isolated . Use of third generation cephalosporins, central venous catheters, intravenous lipids and H2 receptor antagonists (ranitidine) are risk factors for _C. albicans_ colonization, whereas delivery by cesarean section is protective . In a prospective study of 146 VLBW infants, fungal colonization was noted to be 26.7%; of those colonized; 28% developed mucocutaneous candidiasis and 7.7% developed systemic candidiasis . Colonization has been noted to precede invasive fungal infection in neonates .\n\n【11】**Transmission**  \n\n【12】Transmission of _C. albicans_ vertically from mother to the infant ( Waggoner‐Fountain 96 ) and the nosocomial transmission of both albicans and non‐albicans species of Candida have been well documented . In addition to the endemic prevalence of Candida colonization and infection, epidemics or outbreaks with a single strain or multiple strains may be associated with clusters of infections and disease in the neonatal unit . Health care staff may harbour Candida and be a source of infection. In one study of 2989 cultures from health care workers' hands, 5% were positive for _C. albicans_ and 19% for _C. parapsilosis_ . _C. albicans_ and _C. parapsilosis_ have been shown to survive on glass (three days), stainless steel (14 days), fabrics (14 days) and finger pads of volunteers (20% of _C. albicans_ remained detectable one hour post‐inoculation) for sufficient duration to cause cross infection . Cross infection by health care workers causing outbreaks of _Candida albicans_ , _Candida parapsilosis_ , _Candida tropicalis_  and _Candida lusitaniae_  have been reported.\n\n【13】**Infection control measures**  \n\n【14】Infection control measures routinely employed in the neonatal unit include handwashing, use of standard precautions with all patient contact, appropriate catheter care to minimize the risk of catheter contamination, optimizing nurse‐patient ratio, avoiding overcrowding and continuous monitoring and surveillance of nosocomial infection . The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of 'Standard precautions' consistently in all patients , which should be undertaken for blood, all body fluids, secretions and excretions, non‐intact skin and mucous membranes. These precautions include hand washing, use of gloves, masks, gowns, eye and face shields. Unlike bacterial nosocomial infections, efficacy of hand washing in the prevention of Candida transmission in the neonatal unit is not proven. In a study evaluating the efficacy of antiseptic soaps for hand washing _in vitro_ against Candida species, germicidal chlorine with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (Clorox), 4% chlorhexidene gluconate in alcohol (Hibiclens) and 10% povidone‐iodine (Clinidine) were found to be effective but 3% para‐meta‐chloro‐xylenol (Ultradex) was not .\n\n【15】Isolation and or cohorting may be effective in controlling nosocomial infections . It is clear that candida can be spread from patient to patient. Protective isolation has been demonstrated to reduce colonization rate in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) . The use of single isolation rooms in a PICU led to a reduction of nosocomial infections including candida infections . CDC guidelines recommend that single room isolation is preferable for infections transmitted by contact, either directly or indirectly _via_ equipment or other surfaces . However, neonatal intensive care units are often faced with lack of isolation rooms and/or health care personnel devoted to the care of babies in these isolation rooms. Isolation requirements may depend on factors including severity of illness in the infant, available resources and the transmissibility of the infection. Guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) state that it may be unnecessary to isolate a neonate (except in the case of neonatal varicella‐zoster or epidemic of bacterial infection) if:  \ni) there is sufficient medical and nursing staff on duty  \nii) sufficient space between stations  \niii) two or more sinks for hand washing available in each nursery area  \niv) continuing instruction is provided regarding the way infections spread \n\n【16】Cohorting is physical segregation of infants in separate areas where newborns with similar exposures, colonization or infections, are cared for. Care is usually provided by designated staff assigned exclusively for these infants. Cohorting infants colonized or infected with pathogens that are transmissible by contact may be useful in controlling or reducing horizontal transmission of infection or colonization. Cohorting may be more feasible than single room isolation during outbreaks in the NICU setting. Cohorting does not require isolation rooms and may reduce resource utilization compared to single room isolation. However, the success of this system depends on the strict adherence of the health care staff to the cohort system .\n\n【17】The implications of the spread of candida infections in the neonatal unit especially to VLBW and ELBW infants, are enormous. Infection control measures can be expensive and consume valuable resources. It is not known whether the additional costs of these measures are worth the benefits in terms of reduction in the transmission of candida in the neonatal unit. There is a need for economic evaluation of infection control measures in the present cost conscious health care environment . The effect of single room isolation or cohorting of candida colonized or infected infants as an adjunct to routine infection control measures on the transmission Candida in the neonatal unit and it's economic implications, have not been systematically reviewed.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】1\\.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of telbivudine as compared with no treatment, placebo, or other antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis B, with HBeAg‐positive or HBeAg‐negative status.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Chronic viral hepatitis B remains a global public health concern. Firstly, hepatitis B virus can be easily transmitted. There are three main routes for transmission: perinatal , sexual , and contaminated blood or needles . Household contact and occupational exposure are other risk factors. Secondly, it is estimated that 2 billion people worldwide have been infected; 350 million are chronically infected, and 50 million new patients with chronic hepatitis B are diagnosed annually . Thirdly, chronic hepatitis B may cause severe complications leading to liver failure, cirrhosis with hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . It is estimated that 235,000 people die annually due to liver cirrhosis and 328,000 people die annually due to hepatocellular carcinoma .\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Hepatitis B virus belongs to the family of hepadna viruses whose genome is a circular, partially double stranded DNA of approximately 3,200 base pairs. There are four partially overlapping, open reading frames encoding the envelope (pre‐S/S), core (precore/core), polymerase, and X proteins, which encode HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg, DNA polymerase, and HBxAg .\n\n【8】Based on the presence or the absence of HBeAg, chronic hepatitis B can be subdivided into two groups: HBeAg‐positive and HBeAg‐negative chronic hepatitis B. These two groups differ in their natural history and response to various drugs. HBeAg‐negative chronic hepatitis B is caused by a mutant form of virus that lacks the ability to synthesise HBeAg and is associated with worse prognosis and a poorer response to treatment .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Currently, several drugs are recommended for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. These drugs can be divided into two main groups based on their mechanism of action, namely immunomodulatory drugs like interferons (peg‐interferon alpha‐2a, peg‐interferon alpha‐2b, and unmodified interferon) and anti‐viral drugs including lamivudine (an L‐nucleoside), adefovir (an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate), entecavir (a deoxyguanosine analogue), tenofovir (an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate), and telbivudine (an L‐nucleoside) .\n\n【11】The advantages of interferon therapy include lack of hepatitis B virus resistance and a defined duration of therapy , but their use is limited by high cost for parenteral administration, frequent adverse effects , and low response proportion.\n\n【12】In comparison with interferons, anti‐viral drugs have less acquisition cost, a more convenient oral route of administration, and few adverse events. However, anti‐viral drugs are associated with time‐dependent development of viral resistance .\n\n【13】The antivirals can be divided into 'lamivudine‐like' and 'adefovir‐like' drugs . While the 'lamivudine‐like' antivirals (telbivudine, clevudine, emtricitabin, and even entecavir) share mutations pattern at position M204 of the YMDD motif of the hepatitis B virus‐polymerase, the 'adefovir‐like' antivirals seem to remain fully active against those mutants . The differing resistance profile makes them good for combination therapy.\n\n【14】Telbivudine was approved by the US FDA on October 25, 2006. It is highly selective for hepatitis B virus DNA and inhibits viral DNA synthesis with no effect on human DNA or other viruses . It is superior to lamivudine in many aspects, eg, in reduction of hepatitis B virus DNA, in alanine aminotransferase normalisation, and in histological response . Furthermore, telbivudine use results in fewer patients with treatment failure and has less virological resistance than lamivudine . However, the resistance of the virus to telbivudine was much higher than that of other new antivirals such as tenofovir and entecavir, and it is not effective against lamivudine‐resistant hepatitis B virus. What is worse, there are still some adverse events, including elevations in creatine kinase _(_ Nash 2009 _)._\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Telbivudine is efficiently phosphorylated by human cellular kinases to the active triphosphate form . It blocks viral reverse‐transcriptase activity and inhibits DNA synthesis, which prevents reverse transcribing of hepatitis B virus pregenomic mRNA and terminates viral DNA synthesis, respectively. Telbivudine inhibits both strands of hepatitis B virus DNA replication, especially the second (+) strand. Like lamivudine, it does not inhibit hepatitis B virus DNA priming . In an in vitro model, the hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase binds preferentially to telbivudine triphosphate, while the active form does not affect human DNA polymerase (α, β, γ), mitochondrial function, or morphology .\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】We have not been able to identify a systematic review or a meta‐analysis evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of telbivudine for chronic hepatitis B.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of telbivudine as compared with no treatment, placebo, or other antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis B, with HBeAg‐positive or HBeAg‐negative status.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】All relevant randomised clinical trials will be included, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. Quasi‐randomised studies and observational studies will be excluded except for their reported data on harm.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Male or female patients, including children, of any ethnic origin, who have chronic hepatitis B, defined as chronic hepatitis B virus infection with evidence of hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation of at least one and a half times the upper limit of normal range) and of viral replication (detectable hepatitis B virus DNA by DNA hybridisation method or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), will be included. Patients will be included irrespective of whether they are treatment‐naive or have been previously treated unsuccessfully for chronic hepatitis B virus infection with another drug. Patients with cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, HIV, hepatocellular carcinoma, prior liver transplantation, and concomitant renal failure will also be included but analysed separately.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】The comparisons will include:\n\n【29】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of different methods of communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer including\n\n【3】a) the patient's recall of information  \nb) patient satisfaction with information  \nc) the patient's coping strategies  \nd) the patient's quality of life  \ne) service and economic indicators (such as length of hospital stay, number of admissions and cost).\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide WHO 2005 . The incidence is estimated annually at 1,151,289 new cases (2002) with 410,712 patients dying from the disease each year Parkin 2005 . In comparison to western cultures, the incidence of breast cancer is lower in developing countries but similar to Western cultures it is continuing to increase annually.\n\n【7】Alongside the increase in breast cancer there is a plethora of literature concerning what women do when they first discover a breast abnormality Lindop 2001 . The anxiety and emotional responses of women whilst waiting for and on receiving a definitive diagnosis is well documented Fallowfield 1991 ; Greer 1991 ; Iwamitsu 2005 . Little is known however, about women's psychological well‐being, coping strategies and recall connected to the method and level of communication used to deliver a primary diagnosis of breast cancer. The diagnosis of breast cancer may be given by a variety of professionals some of whom the patient may never see again. A vast amount of evidence relating to breast cancer in general exists with some studies showing the majority of women perceive a diagnosis of breast cancer as life threatening and impacting on their quality of life Galloway 1997 . A survey by Loge 1996 involving 497 Norwegian cancer patients revealed that the manner in which the diagnosis was presented limited conversation between physician and patient. These findings are substantiated by a more recent Cochrane systematic review which concluded that many people with cancer find it difficult to recall information provided during consultations Scott 2003 .\n\n【8】A number of studies and reviews have been conducted on methods of communicating with cancer patients generally and their findings support the view that the methods of delivering information influences a number of factors such as patient recall and satisfaction. McPherson 2001 conducted a systematic review of the methods of information giving in cancer and concluded that interventions such as written information, audiotapes, audiovisual aids and other interactive medium improved at least one patient related outcome. A more recent Cochrane systematic review on the interventions for improving communication with children and adolescents about a family member's cancer concluded that many people find it difficult to remember information provided during medical consultations Scott 2003 thus supporting the view that additional communication methods may be necessary.\n\n【9】Current practice is influenced by a number of evidence based clinical practice guidelines. In the United Kingdom the National Institute of Clinical Excellence NICE 2002 guidance on improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer reviewed evidence for communication strategies used at diagnosis of various cancers. This report found that interventions varied in outcomes and that there were inconsistent effects on patient knowledge and levels of satisfaction with the exception of a Cochrane Review which showed a high percentage of patients with cancer (90%) found recordings of summaries of their consultation valuable Scott 1999 . Similarly in Australia more recent clinical practice guidelines for the provision of psychosocial care of patients with cancer published by the National Breast Cancer Centre and National Cancer Control Initiative NBCC/NCCI 2003 made recommendations based on available evidence. The guidelines suggested the patient's understanding, recall and/or satisfaction with care was increased when communications methods such as providing a tape of the consultation, sending a summary follow up letter and or a support person was present during the consultation. The evidence available to support these recommendations was from single randomised controlled trials.\n\n【10】A thorough systematic review of the evidence for methods of communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to patients is lacking and is necessary to guide professionals when they are considering how to best communicate this information. The consultation this review refers to is the initial consultation where the patient receives their diagnosis of breast cancer. The aim of this review is therefore to focus on the communication strategies used when delivering the initial diagnosis of breast cancer to patients and to make recommendations for practice and further research based on the findings.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】To assess the effectiveness of different methods of communicating a primary diagnosis of breast cancer including\n\n【13】a) the patient's recall of information  \nb) patient satisfaction with information  \nc) the patient's coping strategies  \nd) the patient's quality of life  \ne) service and economic indicators (such as length of hospital stay, number of admissions and cost).\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】Randomised controlled trials (RCT)\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving care in a variety of settings, including hospital (inpatients and outpatients) and primary care.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】Studies which involve patients being given a diagnosis of breast cancer using one or more of the following methods;\n\n【22】Verbal, face‐to‐face consultations compared with\n\n【23】*   Verbal, face‐to‐face with written information\n\n【24】*   Verbal, face‐to‐face with audio‐tape\n\n【25】*   Verbal, face‐to‐face with audio‐tape and written information\n\n【26】*   Telephone consultation\n\n【27】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【28】**_Primary outcome measures_**\n\n【29】Patient reported measures of recall of information and satisfaction with information measured using reliable and valid assessment tools.

Some menopausal women with type 1 diabetes are treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but the effects of this treatment have, to date, not been established.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of HRT for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO from their inception to June 2012. The last search was run for all databases on 18 June 2012.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We selected randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials that involved peri‐ or postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes undergoing HRT as an intervention.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two researchers independently applied the inclusion criteria to the identified studies and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by intervention by a third party. Descriptive analysis was conducted for the review.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Ninety‐two publications were screened. No studies met the inclusion criteria exclusively but one study that included both type 1 and type 2 diabetes participants was considered. This randomised clinical trial (RCT) compared HRT (N = 27) with placebo (N = 29) over 12 months. The outcome measures were cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid profile, glycaemic control, blood pressure and body weight. No significant differences between placebo and HTR were detected. Patient‐important outcomes like all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetic complications or health‐related quality of life were not investigated.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is a lack of evidence around the use of HRT in women with type 1 diabetes. The one study that has been undertaken in this area is underpowered. More RCTs are required in the area to examine the impact of HRT on glycaemic control and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n【14】### Hormone replacement therapy for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus\n\n【15】There are increasing numbers of people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The main aim of treatment for diabetes is to maintain good quality of life and to minimise, or prevent, the development of diabetic complications by controlling blood glucose levels. Women with type 1 diabetes frequently express difficulties in controlling their blood glucose levels during the menopausal phase of their lives. However, the cause of this has not been explored.\n\n【16】Hormone replacement therapy is a treatment that is prescribed to many women to alleviate the symptoms associated with the menopause.\n\n【17】The literature surrounding hormone replacement therapy and type 1 diabetes has never been systematically searched and reviewed.\n\n【18】The evidence available for healthcare professionals to call upon relating to the management of menopausal women with type 1 diabetes is vague. There is conflicting literature regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy in women with type 1 diabetes, as many of the studies also included women with type 2 diabetes. We found one study with a type 1 diabetes subgroup involving 56 participants receiving either hormone replacement therapy or placebo over 12 months. No statistically significant differences were found between hormone replacement therapy and placebo. Patient‐important outcomes like death from any cause, cardiovascular disease (for example, heart attack, stroke), diabetic complications (for example, diabetic eye disease, diabetic kidney disease) or health‐related quality of life were not investigated.\n\n【19】--------------\n\n【20】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【21】### Implications for practice\n\n【22】There is currently a lack of evidence regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy amongst menopausal women with type 1 diabetes. HRT may impact upon glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk of women with type 1 diabetes but this review cannot make any recommendations for practice.\n\n【23】### Implications for research\n\n【24】Research to examine this topic needs to be undertaken to inform future practice. Randomised controlled trials to measure the impact of HRT on glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in women with type 1 diabetes are possible. Descriptive and qualitative studies would be beneficial to examine the impact of HRT from the healthcare professional and patient perspectives.\n\n【25】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【26】Summary of findings for the main comparison.\n\n| **Hormone replacement therapy compared with placebo for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus**  | **Hormone replacement therapy compared with placebo for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus**  | **Hormone replacement therapy compared with placebo for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus**  | **Hormone replacement therapy compared with placebo for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Patient or population:** peri‐ or postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus **Settings:** outpatients **Intervention:** hormone replacement therapy ((oestrogen (17B‐oestradiol, 2 mg) and progesterone (norethisterone acetate, 1 mg)) **Comparison:** placebo  | **Patient or population:** peri‐ or postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus **Settings:** outpatients **Intervention:** hormone replacement therapy ((oestrogen (17B‐oestradiol, 2 mg) and progesterone (norethisterone acetate, 1 mg)) **Comparison:** placebo  | **Patient or population:** peri‐ or postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus **Settings:** outpatients **Intervention:** hormone replacement therapy ((oestrogen (17B‐oestradiol, 2 mg) and progesterone (norethisterone acetate, 1 mg)) **Comparison:** placebo  | **Patient or population:** peri‐ or postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes mellitus **Settings:** outpatients **Intervention:** hormone replacement therapy ((oestrogen (17B‐oestradiol, 2 mg) and progesterone (norethisterone acetate, 1 mg)) **Comparison:** placebo  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **No of Participants(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Diabetes and non‐diabetes related morbidity**  | See comment  | See comment  | Not investigated  |\n| **Death from any cause**  | See comment  | See comment  | Not investigated  |\n| **Adverse effects** \\[follow‐up: 12 months\\]  | 5  | ⊕⊝⊝⊝**very low a**  | Most frequently reported event was breast pain (37 type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus participants on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) versus nine placebo participants);

A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long‐term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer is increased.\n\n【32】It is acknowledged that there is an increasing number of people who suffer from type 1 diabetes . The main aims of treatment for type 1 diabetes are to maintain good health‐related quality of life and to minimise, or prevent, the microvascular and macrovascular complications caused by the disease through good glycaemic control . A major trial has demonstrated conclusively that optimal glycaemic control can improve the physical and psychological well‐being of people with type 1 diabetes . Physiological changes like pregnancy, weight gain, puberty and psychological issues like stress are known to affect glycaemic control . It is well recognised that changes in sex hormones can increase insulin resistance during puberty and pregnancy . These findings imply that during the menopause a woman's requirement for insulin will be altered.\n\n【33】The menopause is a stage in the female reproductive cycle that occurs as the ovaries stop producing oestrogen causing the reproductive system to cease functioning . As the body adapts to changing levels of natural hormones various symptoms may be experienced. These include amongst others hot flushes, palpitations, night sweats mood swings, lack of concentration vaginal dryness, decreased libido weight changes. To overcome some of these symptoms hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be prescribed. There is emerging evidence about the benefits and disadvantages of HRT in women with type 1 diabetes . Insulin resistance can be modified by HRT but to date much of the evidence relating to HRT in diabetes has been extrapolated from non‐diabetic women. There is some evidence that women with diabetes have a blunted response to the beneficial effects of HRT on lipids . Women with diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease with the pathogenesis linked to insulin resistance . Interestingly, HRT has been found to be prescribed less in women with diabetes than in women without diabetes . However, no link has been found between the use of HRT and mortality in a longitudinal study of women with diabetes in the US , while there is a suggestion that glycosylated haemoglobin may be significantly decreased in women with type 2 diabetes who take postmenopausal oestrogen .\n\n【34】The experience and management of the menopause amongst women is unique and at times complex. It is proposed that for women with type 1 diabetes managing the menopause is more complex due to changes in their physical and psychological status impacting on their glycaemic control. These women usually have an earlier onset of menopause than women without diabetes . From practice it is known that often women confuse the signs of the menopause with hypoglycaemia. Both of these physiological changes can result in night sweats, mood changes and palpitations; therefore, it is difficult for the women to distinguish whether they are suffering from hypoglycaemia or experiencing menopausal symptoms. Interestingly, clinical experience suggests that menopausal women are sometimes inappropriately treating their perceived hypoglycaemic symptoms resulting in hyperglycaemia.\n\n【35】Additionally, some people are administering HRT to alleviate symptoms of the menopause but the effectiveness of this intervention has not been clearly established. In addition to the signs and symptoms of the menopause being confused by women with the symptoms of hypoglycaemia causing possible inappropriate insulin use, alterations in diet, weight and mood sometimes experienced during the menopause can also necessitate changes in insulin use. Overall, this can necessitate women to alter their self‐management regimen significantly which can cause further physical and psychological stress.\n\n【36】The evidence available to patients and healthcare professionals surrounding the management of menopausal women with type 1 diabetes and health‐related quality of life issues is vague. There is conflicting literature surrounding the use of HRT in women with type 1 diabetes and this literature has never been systematically searched, retrieved and reviewed.\n\n【37】### Description of the intervention\n\n【38】The intervention under investigation is HRT versus no hormone therapy in women with type 1 diabetes.\n\n【39】For many years, oestrogen alone or in combination with progestogens, otherwise known as HRT, has been the treatment of choice for control of problematic menopausal symptoms and for the prevention of osteoporosis. A recent publication from the International Menopause Society 2008 has stated that HRT remains the first‐line and most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. The use of HRT in all women has declined after the publication of several studies which linked the treatment to increased risk of breast cancer , coronary heart disease  and venous thromboembolism .\n\n【40】HRT should currently only be prescribed for menopausal symptoms and not for prevention of osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease. It is currently recommended that the lowest dose of HRT based on relieving menopausal symptoms should be prescribed . Oral HRT regimens are well tolerated and are considered as first‐line therapy in most women. There is significant individual variation in response to HRT and it is often appropriate to try two or three different preparations. Women should be encouraged to persevere with a new preparation for two to three months as any side‐effects experienced initially may settle with time. Women should be reviewed three months after commencing therapy. The ongoing need for HRT should be reassessed at least annually. Blood pressure should be checked 6 to 12 monthly, and each woman encouraged to attend cervical and breast screening programmes. Breast awareness should be encouraged. Stopping HRT abruptly can cause some women to have hot flushes and it should, therefore, be withdrawn gradually by decreasing dosages over three to six months.\n\n【41】HRT is contra‐indicated in the presence of active venous thromboembolism, unexplained vaginal bleeding, oestrogen dependent tumours (breast and endometrial cancer), current or recent cardiovascular disease and acute porphyria. Women who have not had a hysterectomy should be commenced on a sequential or continuous combined form of HRT starting at the lowest dose available and increasing if required to give symptom control. Continuous combined therapy (period‐free HRT) should only be used by women who are at least a year past the menopause or over 54 years of age. Both oestrogen and progestogen are taken daily to give a period‐free regimen. Erratic bleeding is common in the first few months of use. For women who have had a hysterectomy unopposed oestrogens should be prescribed.\n\n【42】#### Possible and known adverse effects of the intervention\n\n【43】##### Glycaemic control\n\n【44】Studies have indicated that HRT appears to lower glycaemic control as indicated by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in women who have type 2 diabetes. HRT users have a lower than average HbA1c than non‐HRT users . Furthermore, current HRT users may experience better glycaemic control than those who have never used it or who had previously done so . Both these studies indicate that glycaemic control is affected and can be improved in women who have type 2 diabetes taking HRT.\n\n【45】To our knowledge the relationship between HRT and glycaemic control has not been investigated in type 1 diabetes.\n\n【46】##### Changes in insulin sensitivity\n\n【47】Studies involving women with type 2 diabetes indicate that oestradiol given orally or transdermally tends to improve insulin sensitivity . However, it has also been shown that a dose of 1.25 mg/day reduces insulin sensitivity .\n\n【48】Combining HRT with progestogen may reduce insulin sensitivity . Furthemore, high doses of approximately 20 mg have no effect on insulin sensitivity, with lower doses of 10 mg/day leading to a decrease in insulin concentrations .\n\n【49】To our knowledge the relationship between HRT and changes in insulin sensitivity has not been investigated in type 1 diabetes.\n\n【50】##### Health‐related quality of life\n\n【51】The provision of information, education and psychological support to facilitate self management are essential components of diabetes care and are known to improve health‐related quality of life. The interpretation of the data on the effect of HRT on health‐related quality of life varies, with the WISDOM study showing measurable improvements in health‐related quality of life, sexuality and joint pain in symptomatic women ; however, women with diabetes were not investigated separately. HRT has been found to be efficacious in comparison with placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes in healthy menopausal women .\n\n【52】##### Coronary heart disease (CHD)\n\n【53】The Women's Health Initiative study  showed an increase in CHD events from 30 to 37 cases per 10,000 treated women. However, more recent studies have suggested that HRT does not cause an increase in CHD risk and may have a cardioprotective role in younger women in the early postmenopausal years . Whether this is the case in women with type 1 diabetes is unclear.\n\n【54】##### Venous thromboembolism (VTE)\n\n【55】While the risk of VTE with HRT remains low, a two‐fold increase in VTE has been found when standard doses of oral HRT are compared to placebo . Healthy postmenopausal women are at low risk of VTE but the use of HRT is best avoided in women with a previous history of VTE.\n\n【56】##### Ovarian cancer\n\n【57】While the Million Women Study collaborators found an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women using HRT compared to women who had never used HRT, the risks were 'small' (one extra case of cancer in 2500 users of HRT) with the risk falling back to pre‐use levels when the HRT was discontinued .\n\n【58】##### Breast cancer\n\n【59】The effects of HRT on breast cancer appear to be related to the type of HRT and the duration of the therapy with combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy taken over five years demonstrating the greatest risk. The Women's Health Initiative showed an increase in breast cancer of eight cases per 10,000 treated women .\n\n【60】##### Reduced bone mineral density\n\n【61】HRT has a beneficial effect on bone mineral density with the large studies  showing HRT was effective in preventing fractures secondary to osteoporosis.\n\n【62】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【63】There is currently some ambiguity surrounding the use of HRT in women with type 1 diabetes . The current literature offers conflicting information making clinical decisions problematic. There have been no systematic reviews of the evidence for methods relating to the impact of HRT on menopausal women with type 1 diabetes undertaken to date. This information is necessary to guide professionals when they are considering how best to empower women to manage their diabetes during this stage in their life and also to inform future studies on this group.\n\n【64】Objectives\n----------\n\n【65】To assess the effects of hormone replacement therapy for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【66】Methods\n-------\n\n【67】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【68】#### Types of studies\n\n【69】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs).\n\n【70】#### Types of participants\n\n【71】Peri‐ and postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes.\n\n【72】#### Types of interventions\n\n【73】##### Intervention\n\n【74】*   Hormone replacement therapy for women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【75】##### Control\n\n【76】*   Placebo.\n\n【77】*   No intervention.\n\n【78】*   Usual care.\n\n【79】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【80】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【81】*   Glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood glucose levels (self monitored)).\n\n【82】*   Diabetes and non‐diabetes related morbidities.\n\n【83】*   Health‐related quality of life (using validated instruments).\n\n【84】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【85】*   Total daily insulin dosage.\n\n【86】*   Body mass index (BMI), weight.\n\n【87】*   Frequency and severity of hypoglycaemia.\n\n【88】*   Death from any cause.\n\n【89】*   Adverse effects.\n\n【90】*   Economic data.\n\n【91】###### Covariates, effect modifiers and confounders\n\n【92】*   Duration of diabetes.\n\n【93】*   Compliance with treatment.\n\n【94】*   Diabetes management skills.\n\n【95】*   Presence of diabetes complications.\n\n【96】*   Age.\n\n【97】*   Level of physical activity.\n\n【98】###### Timing of outcome measurement\n\n【99】**Short term (less than six months)**\n\n【100】*   Glycaemic control.\n\n【101】*   Total daily insulin dose.\n\n【102】*   Diabetes and non‐diabetes related morbidities.\n\n【103】*   Averse effects.\n\n【104】**Medium term (six to 12 months)**\n\n【105】*   Diabetes and non‐diabetes related morbidities.\n\n【106】*   Health‐related quality of life.\n\n【107】*   Adverse effects.\n\n【108】*   BMI, weight or both.\n\n【109】**Long term (more than 12 months)**\n\n【110】*   Diabetes and non‐diabetes related morbidities.\n\n【111】*   Adverse effects.\n\n【112】*   Death from any cause.\n\n【113】*   Economic data.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effectiveness and safety of prostanoids in people with critical limb ischemia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】The term critical limb ischemia (CLI) should be used for all chronic ischemic rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease. Unlike individuals with intermittent claudication (IC), patients with CLI have resting perfusion that is inadequate to sustain viability in the distal tissue bed. The European Working Group on CLI specifically defined this illness as the presence of ischemic rest pain requiring analgesia for more than two weeks, or ulceration, or gangrene of the lower extremity with an ankle systolic blood pressure < 50 mm Hg and/or toe systolic pressure < 30 Hg.\n\n【6】Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 20% of adults older than 55 years, and an estimated 27 million persons in North America and Europe . Critical limb ischemia is the initial clinical presentation in only 1% to 2% of cases, whereas 40% to 50% of those affected begin with atypical leg pain, 10% to 35% with IC, and 20% to 50% are asymptomatic. After five years of progressive functional impairment, a further 1% to 2% of PAD cases will result in CLI and eventual amputation . Current incidence of CLI is around 300 per million per year , similar to that estimated previously (for example, 0.25 to 0.45 per 1000 per year in Denmark  and Italy  respectively). The Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) found, up to 30 June 2005, that 4.5% of all acute vascular events were due to CLI .\n\n【7】The prognosis for limb and patient survival is impaired in chronic CLI. Within a six‐month period, 20% of patients die, 35% live but require amputation, and the remaining 45% live with no immediate need for amputation . In the United States, 150,000 leg amputations each year are performed for unremitting CLI . The Edinburgh Artery Study showed that the prevalence of CLI was 4.5%, and the incidence was 15.5 per 1,000 persons‐years . In individuals who were initially symptomatic, 28.8% continued to have pain after five years, 8.2% underwent revascularization or amputation, and 1.4% developed ischemic ulcers.\n\n【8】Amputation and mortality rates at one year for patients with CLI are approximately 25% , but mortality rates could be as high as 45% in those who had suffered an amputation . A cohort of patients with CLI from the ICAI trial who were followed for up to one year, showed an overall mortality of 13.4% at six months and 19.1% at 12 months. By the end of the clinical observation period, 12% had had an amputation and 47.8% had persistent CLI. Age was a strong predictor of all clinical outcomes. For each year of age, the risk of dying within six or 12 months was increased by about 5%, the risk of being amputated by about 2% and the probability of not recovering from CLI by about 1%. Previous minor amputation per se apparently implied a greater probability of subsequent major amputation .\n\n【9】Besides age, the most important clinical predictors for CLI progression are smoking and diabetes. The risk associated with smoking applies to all ages and increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. Major peripheral arterial disease deterioration occurs in heavy‐smoking claudicant patients . Diabetes appears to be more important for progression than for initial development of symptoms of PAD. Patients suffering intermittent claudication and diabetes have a 35% risk of deterioration , twice the risk in claudicant patients without diabetes . Consistently, CLI deteriorates to gangrene in 40% of diabetic patients compared with 9% of non‐diabetic patients . The most important risk factors for amputation are the ones involved in the progression to CLI. Smoking is associated with a major amputation rate of 11% in claudicant patients , and diabetes is associated with a 21% risk amputation as compared with 3% in non‐diabetic persons . Another important clinical predictor of amputation is an ankle‐brachial index (ABI) below 0.5 .\n\n【10】The prognosis after amputation is even worse. According to the Second European Consensus Document on chronic critical limb ischemia , the peri‐operative mortality is 5% to 10% for below‐knee amputation, and 15% to 20% for above‐the‐knee amputation. Even when these patients survive, nearly 40% will die within two years of their major amputation. A second amputation is required in 30% of cases, and full mobility is achieved in only 50% of patients who have below‐knee amputation and 25% of those who have above‐knee amputation. Furthermore, it is well known that patients with CLI have an elevated risk of future myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular death, three‐fold higher than patients with IC . Inflammatory mediators were related to cardiac rhythm disturbances and ischemic ECG changes, and predicted one‐year mortality rates . Psychological testing of such patients has typically disclosed quality‐of‐life indices similar to those of patients with cancer in critical or even terminal phases . Therefore, due to its negative impact on quality of life, and the poor prognosis both in terms of limb and patient survival, CLI is a critical health issue.\n\n【11】Therapeutic options for CLI are limited to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgical revascularization. Unfortunately, many patients with CLI are poor candidates for either procedure, because of co‐morbidities or anatomy (lack of conduit). These patients only have medical treatment as a therapeutic alternative, and amputation (when necessary) as the last chance to survive. An innovative treatment for CLI is therapeutic angiogenesis , but studies are still at an initial stage for example, Talisman Study ( Talisman ), Phase II Tact ‐ Nagoya Study ( Tact‐Nagoya ). In a recent study, signs of continuous muscle regeneration process have been seen in amputated ischemic human limbs . Perhaps medical treatment still has a chance in CLI.\n\n【12】Medical therapies for CLI that decrease pain, promote healing of skins lesions, and reduce the risk of amputation would be attractive alternatives. Several drugs have been used at this stage (for example, cilostazol, pentoxifylline, or naftidrofuryl) with no significant benefit. Prostanoids have been used for the treatment of PAD for more than two decades, due to some trials that recommended their use . Prostanoids (prostaglandin E <sub>1 </sub> , prostacyclin and iloprost) have been shown to have many pharmacologic actions that in theory could favorably alter the otherwise inexorable downhill course of CLI. These include the inhibition of activation, adhesion and aggregation of platelets, vasodilatation, vascular endothelial cytoprotection, inhibition of leukocyte activation, and antithrombotic and profibrinolitic activities . A few meta‐analyses and systematic reviews have been published , but they did not include all types of prostanoids and new ways of administration. Taking into account new approaches regarding this therapeutic option, it would be very important to perform an updated systematic review, in order to find conclusive evidence about effectiveness and safety of the whole family of prostanoids in critical limb ischemia.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To determine the effectiveness and safety of prostanoids in people with critical limb ischemia.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Randomized controlled trials.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】People irrespective of age or gender, presenting with critical limb ischemia, without chance of rescue or reconstructive intervention.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】Prostaglandin E <sub>1 </sub> (PGE <sub>1 </sub> ) (alprostadil), prostacyclin PGI <sub>2 </sub> (epoprostenol), iloprost, beraprost or cisaprost compared with placebo or other control treatments (for example, pentoxifylline, cilostazol, naftidrofuryl, angiogenic therapy or other prostanoids).\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【25】*   all‐cause mortality;\n\n【26】*   cardiovascular mortality/morbidity (myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmia (variation form the normal rhythm of the heart beat), sudden death);\n\n【27】*   progression of disease (stabilization, major amputation, minor amputation);\n\n【28】*   quality of life.\n\n【29】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【30】*   evaluation of pain and/or use of analgesic drugs;\n\n【31】*   evolution of tissue lesions (for example, non‐healing ulcers, ankle‐brachial index;\n\n【32】*   adverse effects of treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Postnatal psychosis is almost always a mood disorder accompanied by features such as loss of contact with reality, hallucinations, severe thought disturbance, and abnormal behaviour. It is a world‐wide life‐threatening condition with abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Symptoms rapidly reach a climax of severity in new mothers developing frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours that affect functioning . Some women have typical manic symptoms, such as euphoria, overactivity, decreased sleep requirement, loquaciousness, flight of ideas, increased sociability, disinhibition, irritability, violence and delusions, which are usually grandiose or religious in content. Others have severe depression with delusions, auditory hallucinations, mutism, stupor or transient swings into hypomania. Some switch from mania to depression (or vice versa) within the same episode. Atypical features include perplexity, confusion, emotional states including extreme fear and ecstasy, catatonia or rapid changes of mental state with transient delusional ideas.The most commonly recalled symptoms are feeling excited, elated or high, not needing to sleep or inability to sleep, feeling active or energetic and talking more or feeling very chatty . Postnatal Psychosis affects approximately 1 to 2 in every 1,000 new mothers within a few days of childbirth , and it follows an episodic course. It can last many months without treatment, but usually resolves within a few weeks with modern therapy. Postnatal psychosis is more common in first time mothers, and it appears to have a specific heritable factor  with probable linkage to chromosome 16 . Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single or in older age , past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis in first or second degree relatives , prenatal depression  and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction . Mothers who have experienced a previous postnatal psychosis are at significant risk of future episodes, some of which occur after other children are born, some during pregnancy or after an abortion, and some unrelated to childbearing . The risk of a future postnatal recurrence lies between 25% and 57% and the risk of non‐postnatal relapse is even higher.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Postnatal psychosis is a psychiatric emergency, with inpatient psychiatric treatment essential to ensure the safety of mother and baby. Treatment should be guided by the symptom profile . Acute treatment involves the issue of mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Insomnia should be treated aggressively . Electro‐convulsive therapy is highly effective  and should be considered for management of illness that is unresponsive to conventional therapy or when a quick resolution is required because of illness severity or safety concerns . The neuroendocrine role in the pathophysiology of postpartum disorders suggests that hormone replacement may be therapeutic in postpartum affective states .\n\n【9】Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy . Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs  and hormone therapy  may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at high risk.\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】The causes of postnatal psychosis are still poorly understood. Hormonal fluctuations are associated with increased risk of affective dysregulation and mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder , and there may be a genetic basis for the trait of postpartum mood symptoms in women with bipolar disorder . A review of available studies supports a link between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, with implications for perinatal prophylactic treatment . Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis might work through early diagnosis and prophylactic treatment with mood stabilisers and antipsychotic drugs. Risk factors can be easily identified and are highly predictive , and early detection may be followed by a variety other interventions. Lithium is the mood stabiliser with the most evidence for prophylaxis of psychosis . Given either in late pregnancy or immediately after delivery, lithium may prevent the development of postnatal psychosis in high risk women . In addition, preventing sleep loss near delivery may avert an episode of postpartum psychosis .\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Given the high risk of relapse and recurrence in women with postpartum psychosis, prophylaxis is imperative . In addition, postnatal psychosis has serious consequences for the mother and the newborn. Potential risks include suicide , child neglect and abuse , or infanticide . Prevention could, therefore, save the lives of both the mother and her baby, improve the mother‐baby relationship, and save family relationships and economical status. This review is important because it summarises the best available evidence for the benefits and harms of preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】All relevant randomised controlled trials. If a trial is described as 'double blind' but implies randomisation, we will include such trials in a sensitivity analysis . If their inclusion does not result in a substantive difference, they will remain in the analyses. If their inclusion does result in important clinically significant but not necessarily statistically significant differences, we will not add the data from these lower quality studies to the results of the better trials, but will present such data within a subcategory. We will exclude quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by alternate days of the week.\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Pregnant women at increased risk of postnatal psychosis, e.g. women with a personal history of postpartum psychosis and related disorders, or a family history of postpartum psychosis and related disorders.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】##### 1\\.

Visual problems in older people are often not reported to medical services. Screening has been recommended because vision could be improved by encouraging treatment in the majority of older people with impaired vision. The review found five studies in which vision was tested as part of a broader screening assessment. No improvement in vision was seen two to four years after screening compared to elderly people who were not screened. This may be due to the lack of a clear plan of intervention for visual problems found on screening. In another study, the risk of having visual impairment in either eye was similar with universal and targeted screening, three to five years after screening.\n\n【23】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Worldwide, several systemic opioid regimens are available for pediatricians, neonatologists, and general practitioners to control pain in neonates undergoing surgical procedures. However, the most effective and safe regimen is still unknown in the current body of literature.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effects of different regimens of systemic opioid analgesics in neonates submitted to surgery on all‐cause mortality, pain, and significant neurodevelopmental disability. Potentially assessed regimens might include: different doses of the same opioid, different routes of administration of the same opioid, continuous infusion versus bolus administration, or 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Searches were conducted in June 2022 using the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials \\[CENTRAL\\], PubMed, and CINAHL. Trial registration records were identified via CENTRAL and an independent search of the ISRCTN registry.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomized, cluster‐randomized, and cross‐over controlled trials evaluating systemic opioid regimens' effects on postoperative pain in neonates (pre‐term or full‐term). We considered suitable for inclusion: I) studies evaluating different doses of the same opioid; 2) studies evaluating different routes of administration of the same opioid; 3) studies evaluating the effectiveness of continuous infusion versus bolus infusion; and 4) studies establishing an assessment of an 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】According to Cochrane methods, two investigators independently screened retrieved records, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias. We stratified meta‐analysis by the type of intervention: studies evaluating the use of opioids for postoperative pain in neonates through continuous infusion versus bolus infusion and studies assessing the 'as needed' administration versus 'as scheduled' administration. We used the fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), median, and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data. Finally, we used the GRADEpro approach for primary outcomes to evaluate the quality of the evidence across included studies.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】In this review, we included seven randomized controlled clinical trials (504 infants) from 1996 to 2020. We identified no studies comparing different doses of the same opioid, or different routes. The administration of continuous opioid infusion versus bolus administration of opioids was evaluated in six studies, while one study compared 'as needed' versus 'as scheduled' administration of morphine given by parents or nurses. Overall, the effectiveness of continuous infusion of opioids over bolus infusion as measured by the visual analog scale (MD 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.23 to 0.23; 133 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0); or using the COMFORT scale (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.89 to 0.75; 133 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0), remains unclear due to study designs' limitations, such as the unclear risk of attrition, reporting bias, and imprecision among reported results (very low certainty of the evidence).  None of the included studies reported data on other clinically important outcomes such as all‐cause mortality rate during hospitalization, major neurodevelopmental disability, the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity or intraventricular hemorrhage, and cognitive‐ and educational‐related outcomes.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Limited evidence is available on continuous infusion compared to intermittent boluses of systemic opioids. We are uncertain whether continuous opioid infusion reduces pain compared with intermittent opioid boluses; none of the studies reported the other primary outcomes of this review, i.e. all‐cause mortality during initial hospitalization, significant neurodevelopmental disability, or cognitive and educational outcomes among children older than five years old. Only one small study reported on morphine infusion with parent‐ or nurse‐controlled analgesia.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Surgery\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Parenteral\n*   Opioids\n*   Continuous Administration\n*   Pro re nata\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Fixed schedule\n*   Opioids\n*   Enteral\n*   Intravenous Bolus\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Comfort Scale\n*   Cognitive Developmental Delay\n*   Bayley Scale Of Infant Development\n*   Intellect Impaired\n*   Neonatal Infant Pain Scale\n*   Visual Analog Scale\n*   Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale\n*   Neonatal, Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale\n*   Sensorineural Hearing Loss\n*   Pain\n*   Blindness\n*   Death\n*   Premature Infant Pain Profile\n*   Child Developmental Finding\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Like adults, babies experience pain, and this pain must be managed (reduced) after surgery. Opioids are pain‐relieving medications. Examples of opioids are codeine and morphine. Opioids work by interacting with opioid receptors in the body and reducing feelings of pain.\n\n【28】Opioids affect the whole body system and this is why this review refers to them as systemic opioids. Opioids can be given to babies in a few ways, by different routes. One route is by using a needle injected into a vein; this is called parenteral drug administration. Another way (or route) is to place a medication in the baby's mouth, under the tongue or with a tube. These types of drug delivery are called enteral administration. Opioids, like most drugs, can be given at different strengths (dosages). Opioids can be given continuously (without stopping), or on and off over a period of time (intermittently).\n\n【29】All of these things together, how the opioid is given to the baby, how often the opioid is given, and the strength of the opioid, create what is called a drug regimen.\n\n【30】This review aims to evaluate how different opioid regimens affect babies.\n\n【31】**Key results**\n\n【32】This review included seven studies involving 504 babies. We identified no studies comparing different doses of the same opioid. We identified no studies comparing different routes to delivery of opioids. Six studies compared continuous opioid administration versus intermittent opioid administration. One study assessed the use of continuous morphine infusion compared with a parent‐ or nurse‐controlled administration.\n\n【33】Based on the studies we found that we were unable to determine whether continuous or intermittent opioid regimens are better for controlling babies' pain. Since we did not find studies comparing different dosages of opioids, we do not know which dosage is better for reducing babies' pain. Since we did not find studies comparing different routes of opioid administration, we do not know if parenteral is better than enteral for reducing babies' pain. Considering the body of literature evaluated, the effectiveness of continuous systemic opioid infusion compared with intermittent systemic opioid administration is still undetermined. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of continuous systemic opioid administration and intermittent opioid administration in reducing the pain.  \nWe searched for studies that were available up to 10 June 2022.\n\n【34】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effects of various disease‐modifying treatment modalities in people with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is a condition characterised by the presence of autoantibodies which bind to surface of the patient's own red blood cells (RBCs) leading to premature destruction . Such destruction of RBCs (haemolysis) can occur within the circulation (intravascular haemolysis) or within the spleen (extravascular haemolysis). Incidence of AIHA ranges from 0.8 to 3 new cases per 100,000 individuals per year, and the estimated prevalence is 17 per 100,000 individuals, more commonly occurring in individuals after 50 years of age . AIHA may run an acute or chronic course; severity of the condition can range from fully compensated disease to life‐threatening anaemia, and can be classified by the temperature reactivity of RBC autoantibodies, as well as by the underlying aetiology. Warm AIHA is the most common type; it is associated with autoantibodies, often immunoglobulin G (IgG), being most reactive at 37 <sup>o </sup> C and can be secondary to rheumatological disorders and lymphoproliferative conditions. Haemolysis is usually extravascular and takes place in the spleen, with a disease course that is typically chronic and relapsing. Cold AIHA, on the other hand, is a result of autoantibodies, usually immunoglobulin M (IgM), with the highest affinity at 0 <sup>o </sup> C to 4 <sup>o </sup> C and can be associated with underlying lymphoproliferative conditions and infections (e.g. mycoplasma, Ebstein‐Barr virus). IgM causes complement fixation and results in intravascular haemolysis, which tends to be abrupt but self‐limiting. Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria is a rare subtype of cold AIHA caused by IgG that preferentially binds at a lower temperature, mostly in children following infections. Infrequently, mixed‐type AIHA may occur in an individual where a combination of warm and cold autoantibodies exist. Drug‐induced immune haemolytic anaemia (DIIHA) is a distinct entity that may be associated with both warm and cold AIHA . This review will focus on the treatment for primary, or idiopathic AIHA, where no underlying systemic disease can be identified.\n\n【7】Diagnosis of primary AIHA depends on the demonstration of haemolysis, serologic evidence of autoantibody against patients' own RBCs and exclusion of secondary causes (identifiable in 20% to 80% of cases) . The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is commonly used to demonstrate the presence of autoantibody‐coated patient RBCs, although it is important to bear in mind alternative causes for a positive DAT including the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, drug‐induced autoantibodies, haemolytic transfusion reaction, thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, and multiple myeloma . Haemolysis on the other hand, is suggested clinically when yellowish discolouration of the skin (jaundice), together with pallor is detected with or without the presence of enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). In terms of laboratory evaluation, complete blood count with peripheral smear, serum bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, methaemalbumin and urine haemoglobin are useful in determining the presence and type of haemolysis (presence of schistocytes, low haptoglobin, raised methaemalbumin and urine haemoglobin in intravascular haemolysis; presence of spherocytes, raised unconjugated bilirubin in extravascular haemolysis). In warm AIHA, anti‐IgG anti‐sera is typically detected in DAT while in cold AIHA, anti‐C3d anti‐sera is usually present due to IgM‐mediated haemolysis.\n\n【8】Individuals with AIHA may required immunomodulatory therapies and a proportion of them, especially those with severe anaemia and mixed serological type, may require multiple agents to achieve treatment response . They also experience morbidities and mortality due to the use of immunomodulatory therapies including splenectomy. Between a quarter and half of all individuals who achieve remission might develop disease relapse . Non‐responders or those who relapse may be dependent on regular transfusions to alleviate the symptoms of anaemia.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Treatment depends on the severity of haemolysis. Supportive treatment including folic acid supplementation, red cell transfusion and avoidance of cold exposure in individuals with cold AIHA are not within the scope of the current review . In AIHA with identifiable secondary causes, treatment should be targeted towards the underlying condition.\n\n【11】Specific treatment for idiopathic AIHA includes immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. Traditionally, glucocorticoids (prednisolone 1 mg to 1.5 mg/kg/day for one to three weeks then tapered) are the first‐line therapy for patients with AIHA with up to three quarters of patients demonstrating improvement within three weeks. Relapse is nevertheless common (15% to 40%) after tapering of glucocorticoids in the first six months to one year, and thus the majority of patients responding to glucocorticoids would have to be continued with a lower maintenance dose . Adverse effects from prolonged glucocorticoid use include Cushingoid changes, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, peptic ulcers, and reduced bone mineral density. Splenectomy has been considered the second‐line therapy for patients failing glucocorticoid therapy. Response rates after splenectomy ranged from 60% to 75%, but carry the risk of thrombosis as well as infection due to encapsulated bacteria and parasites including malaria .\n\n【12】In patients with refractory disease, a number of interventions have been tested with various degree of success. These include immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide, danazol, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil , as well as monoclonal antibodies including anti‐CD20 (rituximab) and anti‐CD52 (alemtuzumab) . With a response rate of 80% to 90%, rituximab is increasingly being used in AIHA patients failing glucocorticoids. Each medication possesses its own side effects which are detailed in the next section. , Interventions targeted at removing circulating autoantibodies include intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange . Accessibility to the above measures may be limited in resource‐poor countries.\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy interfere with the immune destruction of RBCs\n\n【15】1.  Glucocorticoids inhibit Fc receptor‐mediated removal of sensitised RBCs, and in the longer term reduce production of autoantibodies .\n\n【16】2.  Splenectomy removes a major site of RBC destruction and autoantibody production .\n\n【17】3.  Rituximab is an anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody given as four weekly intravenous infusions. The antibody targets and depletes host B cells, which are responsible for the generation of autoantibodies . Side effects include infusion reactions, immunosuppression and hepatitis B reactivation.\n\n【18】4.  Alemtuzumab is an anti‐CD52 monoclonal antibody targeting CD52, which is an antigen expressed by mature lymphocytes. Lymphodepletion with alemtuzumab would effectively devoid the host's capability of autoantibody generation . Side effects include infusion reactions and immunosuppression.\n\n【19】5.  Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent with potent myelosuppressive effect. Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to the drug and depletion would disrupt the autoimmunity involved . Nausea, vomiting, alopecia, myelosuppression, haemorrhagic cystitis, and gonadal toxicity are potential adverse effects with the drug.\n\n【20】6.  Danazol is a semi‐synthetic androgen with immunomodulatory effect via decreasing IgG production and cell‐bound IgG and complement . Side effects include its androgenic effects and derangement in liver function.\n\n【21】7.  Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that suppresses T helper cells activities, decreasing autoantibodies synthesis . Patients should be monitored for hair growth, gum hypertrophy, renal impairment, hypertension and rarely, neurological complications.\n\n【22】8.  Mycophenolate mofetil reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and in turn inhibits purine synthesis required in the proliferation of B and T cells . Adverse effects are gastrointestinal disturbances and myelosuppression.\n\n【23】9.  Use of intravenous immunoglobulin in AIHA is based on its effectiveness in immune thrombocytopenia, but its efficacy with AIHA is more controversial. The mechanism of action is hypothesised to be through competitive inhibition of autoantibody adsorption to patient blood cells, as well as by decreasing uptake of autoantibody‐coated blood cells by the reticuloendothelial system through blockage of macrophage Fc receptors . Infusion reactions, fever, arthralgia, haemolysis, and aseptic meningitis are possible complications.\n\n【24】10.  Plasma exchange is usually reserved for patients with fulminant AIHA. The process effectively removes host circulating immunoglobulins and complements that are responsible for the immune destruction of RBCs . Side effects are attributed to the insertion of the apheresis catheter, and the process of apheresis which may cause haemodynamic disturbances, hypocalcaemia and coagulopathy.\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】Various immunosuppressive medications and other specific treatment modalities are available for the management of idiopathic AIHA. As an uncommon condition, it remains uncertain whether high‐quality evidence exists to support any treatment regimen and what the most effective regimen is, in particular for relapsing or refractory disease. This systematic review will provide an evidence base for the selection of immunomodulatory treatment that most likely benefits people with idiopathic AIHA.\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】To determine the effects of various disease‐modifying treatment modalities in people with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】We will only include randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【33】#### Types of participants\n\n【34】We will include people of both genders and all ages suffering from idiopathic AIHA.

Depression is commonly treated with antidepressants and/or psychotherapy, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. There are a number of theoretical reasons why exercise may improve depression.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched Medline, Embase, Sports Discus, PsycLIT, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for eligible studies. In addition, we hand‐searched several relevant journals, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of retrieved articles, and performed citation searches of identified studies. We also searched www.controlled‐trials.com.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised controlled trials in which exercise was compared to standard treatment, no treatment or a placebo treatment in adults (aged 18 and over) with depression, as defined by trial authors. We excluded trials of post‐natal depression.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Cohen's method and a standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect, using a random effects model. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Twenty‐eight trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria, of which 25 provided data for meta‐analyses. Randomisation was adequately concealed in a minority of studies, most did not use intention to treat analyses and most used self‐reported symptoms as outcome measures.  For the 23 trials (907 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD was ‐0.82 (95% CI ‐1.12, ‐0.51), indicating a large clinical effect.  However, when we included only the three trials with adequate allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD was ‐0.42 (95% CI ‐0.88, 0.03) i.e. moderate, non‐significant effect.  The effect of exercise was not significantly different from that of cognitive therapy. There was insufficient data to determine risks and costs.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Exercise seems to improve depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of depression, but when only methodologically robust trials are included, the effect sizes are only moderate and not statistically significant.   Further, more methodologically robust trials should be performed to obtain more accurate estimates of effect sizes, and to determine risks and costs.  Further systematic reviews could be performed to investigate the effect of exercise in people with dysthymia who do not fulfil diagnostic criteria for depression.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Depression\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Physical exercise therapy\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Placebo\n*   Waiting list control\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Hamilton Rating Scale For Depression\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Depression\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Beck Depression Inventory\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Exercise has been advocated as an adjunct to usual treatment. This review identified all available randomised trials which compared exercise with either no treatment or an established treatment (e.g. talking therapy) for people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Data from 25 trials were combined. We found exercise did seem to improve the symptoms of depression, but we cannot be sure exactly how effective it is, or the most effective type of exercise. The evidence suggests that exercise probably needs to be continued in the longer‐term for benefits on mood to be maintained.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Our review aims to identify and evaluate data on the anticonvulsant effects and tolerability of add‐on pregabalin in patients with drug‐resistant partial epilepsy. Drug resistance will be defined as accepted by the authors of the trial analysed.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Epilepsy is a common neurological condition: approximately three per cent of the population will suffer from it at some time in their lives . For the majority of those diagnosed a single antiepileptic drug will induce remission. Up to 30% of patients, however, will fail to respond to monotherapy . Their continuing attacks will result in reduced quality of life, and may also lead to injuries, social isolation and depression . This group poses a significant therapeutic problem, leading to the development of new antiepileptic drugs as well as exploration of non‐pharmacological treatment options, such as vagal nerve stimulation and epilepsy surgery.\n\n【6】Over the past two decades numerous new AEDs have become available, raising the hope for more potent and better tolerated treatment of epilepsy. Pregabalin is one of these new compounds with antiepileptic, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. It acts through binding to an auxillary protein (α2‐δ) associated to voltage‐gated calcium channels. It has been shown to reduce calcium influx into nerve terminals resulting in reduced neurotransmitter release . Pregabalin was launched onto the UK market in 2004 as an add‐on antiepileptic drug for partial onset seizures, as well as a treatment for neuropathic pain.\n\n【7】Clinical trials published on the antiepileptic properties of pregabalin so far have focused on patients with refractory partial onset epilepsy. In these randomized placebo controlled trials patients were randomized to have either pregabalin or placebo added to their existing AED treatment. This in keeping with international guidelines on the development of antiepileptic drugs ( ILAE Commission ). Once a drug has proven efficacy and safety as an add‐on therapy, it can be tested as monotherapy. The use of pregabalin as monotherapy will be the subject of a future Cochrane review.\n\n【8】In this review we aim to summarise existing data regarding the effects of add‐on pregabalin for patients with refractory partial onset seizures. This review is one in a series in which the efficacy and tolerability of seven new AEDs (gabapentin, lamotrigine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, zonisamide and pregabalin) are investigated, in patients with drug‐resistant partial epilepsy.\n\n【9】Objectives\n----------\n\n【10】Our review aims to identify and evaluate data on the anticonvulsant effects and tolerability of add‐on pregabalin in patients with drug‐resistant partial epilepsy. Drug resistance will be defined as accepted by the authors of the trial analysed.\n\n【11】Methods\n-------\n\n【12】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【13】#### Types of studies\n\n【14】To be included in our review, studies will have to meet all of the following criteria:  \n(1) randomized controlled trials, in which an adequate method of concealment of randomization is used (eg allocation of sequentially sealed packages of medication, sealed opaque envelopes, telephone randomization);  \n(2) double blind trials, in which both participant and clinician treating or assessing outcome are blinded to treatment allocated;  \n(3) placebo controlled;  \n(4) parallel group or cross‐over studies.\n\n【15】#### Types of participants\n\n【16】People of any age with drug‐resistant partial epilepsy (ie experiencing simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalized tonic‐clonic seizures).\n\n【17】#### Types of interventions\n\n【18】(1) The active treatment group receive pregabalin in addition to antiepileptic drug regimen taken at time of randomization.  \n(2) The control group receive matched placebo in addition to antiepileptic drug regimen taken at time of randomization.\n\n【19】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【20】**_(1) 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency_**  \nThe proportion of people with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in the treatment period compared to the pre‐randomization baseline period was chosen as the primary outcome. It was chosen as it is a commonly reported outcome, and can be calculated for studies that do not report this outcome provided that baseline seizure data were recorded.\n\n【21】**_(2) Seizure freedom_**  \nThe proportion of patients with a complete cessation of seizures during the treatment period.\n\n【22】**_(3) Treatment withdrawal_**  \nThe proportion of people having treatment withdrawn during the course of the treatment period was used as a measure of global effectiveness. Treatment is likely to be withdrawn due to adverse effects, lack of efficacy or a combination of both, and this is an outcome to which the individual makes a direct contribution. In trials of short duration, it is likely that adverse effects will be the most common reason for withdrawal.\n\n【23】**_(4) Adverse effects_**  \n(a) The proportion of individuals experiencing the following five adverse effects:  \n(i) ataxia;  \n(ii) dizziness;  \n(iii) fatigue;  \n(iv) nausea;  \n(v) somnolence.  \nWe have chosen the above adverse effects as we consider them to be common and important adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs. These data will assist direct comparison of tolerability of various AEDs in polytherapy.\n\n【24】(b) In addition to the above we will look at the proportion of individuals experiencing the five most common adverse effects if different from (a) above. These symptoms may include:  \n(i) weight gain;  \n(ii) peripheral oedema;  \n(iii) dry mouth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels which prevent normal drainage of aqueous from the anterior segment of the eye. Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) agents are specific inhibitors of the primary mediators of neovascularization. Studies have reported the effectiveness of anti‐VEGFs for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in NVG.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the IOP lowering effects of intraocular anti‐VEGF agents to no anti‐VEGF treatment, as an adjunct to existing modalities for the treatment of NVG.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2012, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, , EMBASE , Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) , the _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT) ( www.controlled‐trials.com ), ClinicalTrials.gov  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) . We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 11 January 2013.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of people treated with anti‐VEGF agents for NVG.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third author. Since no trial met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of risk of bias or meta‐analysis was undertaken.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】No RCTs were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two RCTs of anti‐VEGF agents for treating NVG were not included in the review due to the heterogeneity and uncontrolled assignment of adjunct treatments received by the study participants.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Currently available evidence is insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of anti‐VEGF treatments, such as intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab, as an adjunct to conventional treatment in lowering IOP in NVG. Well designed RCTs are needed to address this issue, particularly trials that evaluate long‐term (at least six months) benefits and risks since the effects of anti‐VEGF agents may be short‐term only. An RCT comparing anti‐VEGF agents with no anti‐VEGF agents taking into account the need for co‐interventions, such as panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), glaucoma shunt procedures, cyclodestructive procedures, cataract surgery, and deep vitrectomy, could be of use to investigate the additional beneficial effect of anti‐VEGF agents in treating NVG. Since decisions for when and which co‐interventions should be used are based on clinical criteria, they would not be appropriate for randomization. However, the design of a study on this topic should aim to balance groups by stratification of co‐intervention at time of randomization or by enrolling a sufficient number of participants to conduct subgroup analysis by co‐interventions (ideally 15 participants per treatment group for each subgroup). Alternatively, the inclusion criteria for a trial could limit participants to those who receive the same co‐intervention.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Neovascular Glaucoma\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Ranibizumab\n*   Monoclonal Antibodies\n*   Aflibercept\n*   Bevacizumab\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Visual Acuity Testing\n*   Blood Vessels In Iris\n*   Disease Condition Determination, Well Controlled\n*   Intraocular pressure\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### Anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular glaucoma\n\n【23】Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a painful and potentially blinding secondary glaucoma. It is associated with a reduction of the blood supply to the retina due to blood vessel blockage. To compensate for the lack of blood flow, the retina releases vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) to stimulate the formation of new abnormal blood vessels. Thus, treatment of the underlying cause of NVG is as important as reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and inflammation associated with NVG.\n\n【24】The conventional treatment for NVG is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), wherein a laser is used to destroy areas of the retina in order to minimize the blood supply needed by the retina, and thus reduce growth of new abnormal blood vessels. However, poor view of the retina in the back of the eye may prevent its use. Anti‐VEGF agents, which are injected into the eye, may prevent the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Another potential advantage of anti‐VEGF agents over PRP is the reduced time needed to recover from the procedure because of ocular inflammation and/or blurred vision associated with PRP. The effects of anti‐VEGF agents for treating NVG, however, may be temporary, generally lasting four to six weeks.\n\n【25】Although we identified many published reports on anti‐VEGF agents in NVG, none were eligible for inclusion. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these agents compared with or in addition to conventional surgical or medical treatment in lowering IOP in NVG.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】We did not find any evidence from which to draw reliable conclusions comparing the effects of intraocular anti‐VEGF agents with no anti‐VEGF injection alone or as an adjunct to existing modalities for the treatment of NVG. Retrospective studies and case series have reported short‐term reductions in neovascularization, inflammation, and IOP among people with NVG. Since information regarding the effectiveness of anti‐VEGF agents are not available from high‐quality RCTs and long‐term studies, clinical practice decisions will need to based on the physician’s experience and judgment and the patient's wishes.\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】There was no evidence from controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of intraocular anti‐VEGF agents with no anti‐VEGF injection alone or as an adjunct to existing modalities for the treatment of NVG. Although the ideal method to evaluate the effectiveness of anti‐VEGFs would be to compare directly anti‐VEGF treatment with no anti‐VEGF treatment in an RCT in which no other co‐interventions were given, the established benefit of some surgical procedures (such as PRP) in the management of NVG and the harmful effects of raised IOP that may result from surgeries not being done would make it unethical to withhold conventional procedures. Thus a well thought out RCT comparing anti‐VEGF agents with no anti‐VEGF agents taking into account the need for co‐interventions, such as PRP, glaucoma shunt procedures, cyclodestructive procedures, cataract surgery, and deep vitrectomy, could be of use to investigate the additional beneficial effect of anti‐VEGF agents in treating NVG. Since decisions for when and which co‐interventions should be used are based on clinical criteria, they would not be appropriate for randomization. However, the design of a study on this topic should aim to balance groups by stratification of co‐intervention at time of randomization or by enrolling a sufficient number of participants to conduct subgroup analysis by co‐interventions. Sample size calculations reported by Yazdani 2009 suggest enrolling 14 participants per study group to detect an 8 mm Hg change with 90% power. Alternatively, the inclusion criteria for a trial could limit participants to those who receive the same co‐intervention.\n\n【32】Background\n----------\n\n【33】### Description of the condition\n\n【34】Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a secondary glaucoma in which new vessels, and subsequently fibrous tissue, form in the anterior chamber angle of the eye. This leads to blockage of the angle which inhibits aqueous drainage causing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). This condition was described as early as 1871 . Historically, it also has been referred to as rubeotic glaucoma, hemorrhagic glaucoma, thrombotic glaucoma, congestive glaucoma, and diabetic hemorrhagic glaucoma.\n\n【35】Clinical conditions causing retinal ischemia such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and ocular ischemic syndrome are associated with NVG. The condition can be unilateral or bilateral depending on the underlying cause for the NVG. Diabetic retinopathy is usually bilateral and CRVO unilateral. Retinal ischemia results in the release of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The angiogenic factors then diffuse into the aqueous and anterior segment and trigger neovascularization of the iris and anterior chamber angle. This process leads to fibrous tissue proliferation and subsequent synechial angle‐closure (closure of the angle due to the iris adhering to the cornea). Increased levels of VEGF have been measured in the aqueous of patients with NVG . Elevated IOP is a direct result of this secondary angle‐closure glaucoma.\n\n【36】NVG is a potentially devastating glaucoma. Delayed diagnosis or poor management can result in complete loss of vision with intractable pain. Early diagnosis of the disease, followed by immediate and aggressive treatment, is imperative. In managing NVG, it is essential to treat both the elevated IOP and the underlying cause of the disease.\n\n【37】General principles for treating patients with NVG include identifying the underlying etiology, reducing the symptoms, and controlling or eliminating retinal ischemia. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) ablates the ischemic retina by shrinking and eliminating the abnormal blood vessels; however, when most of the angle is closed due to synechiae consequent to the angle neovascularization, surgical treatment to control IOP is necessary. Aqueous drainage devices , Nd‐Yag cyclophotocoagulation , vitrectomy with PRP and trabeculectomy , as well as cyclocryotherapy  are the methods of treatment for NVG. These surgical treatments may be done in conjunction with wound healing agents, such as 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) . Conventional filtering surgery has had poor success in treating NVG.\n\n【38】### Description of the intervention\n\n【39】Currently, anti‐VEGF agents are being used for various conditions in which hypoxia‐induced VEGF release and subsequent neovascularization lead to ocular damage. Initially used in ophthalmology for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization in age‐related macular degeneration (ARMD), the application of anti‐VEGF agents has expanded rapidly to include treatment for other conditions such as NVG, diabetic macular edema and retinopathy of prematurity. Bevacizumab (Avastin™), ranibizumab (Lucentis™), and pegaptanib sodium (Macugen™) are some of the anti‐VEGF agents most frequently used in the eye . Multiple clinical trials have shown that intravitreal injections of anti‐VEGF agents not only prevent loss of vision, but also may improve vision in patients with ARMD ‐ ANCHOR  , MARINA , PrONTO , SAILOR , SUSTAIN , VISION . In most of these studies, three initial induction injections at monthly intervals are followed by injections administered on an 'as needed' basis (i.e., pro re nata (PRN)) during follow‐up of the patients. The mean number of injections administered in the first year was similar in various studies: 5.6 injections in PrONTO  and SUSTAIN  and 4.9 injections in SAILOR . Fewer number of injections were reported in the second year (PrONTO) .\n\n【40】### How the intervention might work\n\n【41】In treating NVG, it is critical to address the underlying pathology: angiogenic factors released by the ischemic retina. The issue of retinal ischemia can be addressed by PRP, which ablates the ischemic retina and reduces further production of angiogenic agents. However, in many patients, the view of the fundus is poor due to corneal edema or vitreous hemorrhage and therefore precludes PRP. Hence, interventions aimed at blocking angiogenic factors directly could help reduce the formation of new vessels and possibly reverse the neovascularization. Reduction in levels of VEGF in the aqueous following intraocular injection of bevacizumab has been demonstrated .\n\n【42】In eyes in which PRP can be done, variable times for regression of new vessels have been reported and the newly formed vessels may not regress until four to six weeks after treatment. In one study, Doft and Blankenship reported regression of new vessels in 20% of patients at three days, 50% at two weeks, 72% at three weeks and 62% at six months . Rogell reported substantial regression in 38% of patients at one month which improved 88% after retreatment . Blankenship in another study reported regression in 97% of patients at one month . Comparision of studies is difficult due to variation in the laser treatments, variation in the response to laser between type 1 and 2 diabetics as well as the variation in the definition of substantial regression in different studies.\n\n【43】Anti‐VEGF agents, on the other hand, have been shown to cause regression of new vessels in the anterior chamber angle within a few days, along with a drop in IOP . Intravitreal , and less commonly intracameral  anti‐VEGF agents have been used in the management of NVG to control angiogenesis in the angle and iris. The effects of anti‐VEGF agents for treating NVG, however, are temporary, generally lasting four to six weeks . Thus many studies have combined the use of anti‐VEGF agents with traditional treatments such as PRP  with or without other surgery .\n\n【44】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【45】Various reports of the excellent response to anti‐VEGF agents in NVG have been published . In most cases, anti‐VEGF treatment has been supplemented with PRP and, in some cases, treatments such as aqueous drainage devices, Nd‐Yag cyclophotocoagulation, vitrectomy with pars plana implantation of glaucoma drainage devices and cyclocryotherapy. Anti‐VEGF agents alone may not be sufficient to treat NVG related to conditions with a progressive natural history, such as PDR. However, the combination of anti‐VEGF treatments with conventional treatments have the potential to be more effective than conventional treatments alone.\n\n【46】PRP may not be effective in controlling NVG associated with CRVO . On the basis of studies showing that ischemic CRVO tends eventually to subside to a state of quiescence , it has been suggested that anti‐VEGF agents alone can treat NVG secondary to CRVO effectively . In two patients with CRVO who had persisting neovascularization and high IOP in spite of PRP, Yazdani et al reported regression of new vessels and control of IOP following intravitreal bevacizumab . Maintenance of IOP control was reported for as long as six months following a second dose of intravitreal bevacizumab in both these patients, one at eight weeks and the other at six weeks. So the question arises: Are intravitreal anti‐VEGF agents alone sufficient in the management of NVG due to CRVO? The Rubeosis Anti‐VEGF (RAVE) trial is an ongoing trial investigating the role of intravitreal anti‐VEGF agents alone in the management of NVG subsequent to CRVO .\n\n【47】A systematic review of the available literature is necessary to evaluate the effects of anti‐VEGF to inform evidence‐based practice.\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】The objective of this review was to compare the beneficial and adverse effects of intraocular anti‐VEGF agents to no anti‐VEGF treatment as an adjunct to existing modalities for the treatment of NVG. In the subgroup of participants with NVG due to CRVO, we also aimed to compare the effects of intraocular anti‐VEGF alone to no anti‐VEGF treatment.\n\n【50】Methods\n-------\n\n【51】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【52】#### Types of studies\n\n【53】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.\n\n【54】#### Types of participants\n\n【55】We included studies of people with NVG.

In the subgroup of participants with NVG due to CRVO, the intervention group could be those people who received intraocular anti‐VEGF injection alone without additional conventional therapy.\n\n【59】##### Control group\n\n【60】People who underwent the same conventional therapy as the intervention group but without intraocular anti‐VEGF agents. In the subgroup of participants with NVG due to CRVO, the control group could be those people who received placebo injections or no treatment without additional conventional therapy.\n\n【61】We did not include dosing studies in which one dose of anti‐VEGF agent was compared to another dose unless the study also had a control arm.\n\n【62】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【63】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【64】The primary outcome of this review was the proportion of participants with control of IOP at six weeks after treatment.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the efficacy of ambulatory oxygen in patients with COPD using single assessment studies.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive disorder characterised by airflow obstruction which does not change markedly with time or treatment . The degree of airway narrowing is largely fixed but may be partially reversed with bronchodilator therapy. . Patients usually present with breathlessness on a background of long standing cough and sputum production. As the disease progresses gas exchange becomes more abnormal and normal oxygenation can no longer be maintained. Oxygen may be prescribed as long term oxygen therapy (LTOT), acutely to tide a patient over an exacerbation, or as ambulatory therapy. Long term oxygen therapy has been used in hypoxaemic patients with COPD to increase life expectancy, quality of life, exercise tolerance and decrease shortness of breath. The efficacy of LTOT in patients with chronic hypoxaemia has been shown in a Cochrane review and its use and prescription are well established .\n\n【6】Ambulatory oxygen is defined as the use of supplemental oxygen during exercise and activities of daily living . Ambulatory oxygen therapy is often used for patients on LTOT during exercise or for non LTOT users, who achieve some subjective and/or objective benefit from oxygen. Ambulatory oxygen may be indicated for non LTOT users with hypoxaemia at rest or without resting hypoxaemia if they show evidence of exercise desaturation and demonstrate improvement in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen. There are guidelines that provide some guidance on assessment for and use of ambulatory oxygen therapy . The RCP guidelines provide the most objective criteria which can be used to ascertain if ambulatory oxygen is required . These criteria include (i) a fall in SaO2 of at least 4% to reach a reading below 90% during a baseline walking test whilst breathing air; and (ii) an improvement of at least 10% in walking distance and/or breathlessness score when walking with supplemental oxygen compared with an air cylinder.\n\n【7】Ambulatory oxygen therapy is provided in small oxygen cylinders lasting between 1‐3 hours at 2L/min or liquid oxygen systems which have a higher oxygen carrying capacity lasting up to 6‐10 hours at 2L/min. Ambulatory therapy is prescribed to patients with COPD at substantial cost. The evidence for the use of ambulatory oxygen therapy is extrapolated from two sources: longer term studies and single assessment studies. Longer term studies assess the impact of ambulatory therapy used at home during activities of daily living. Single assessment studies assess performance during an exercise test using ambulatory oxygen compared to performance during an exercise test using compressed air. Assessment studies focus on the improvement in exercise test performance whilst wearing supplemental oxygen compared to exercise test performance whilst wearing compressed air.\n\n【8】A Cochrane review investigating the long term efficacy of ambulatory therapy showed that there was little evidence of its effectiveness  however this review did not include single assessment studies.

Only assessment studies comparing performance during a single exercise test using ambulatory oxygen compared to performance during a single exercise test with placebo ambulatory oxygen will be considered. Longer term studies assessing the efficacy of ambulatory oxygen therapy or studies assessing the efficacy of LTOT will not be included.\n\n【15】#### Types of participants\n\n【16】Studies will be included only where adult patients with stable COPD have been randomised to either ambulatory or compressed air. COPD needs to be diagnosed according to internationally accepted clinical criteria eg Pauwels 2001 , Romain 2001 , BTS 1997 , ATS 1995 . Patients who do not have a diagnosis of COPD or are predominantly asthmatic will be excluded.\n\n【17】#### Types of interventions\n\n【18】The intervention in the actively treated group will be ambulatory oxygen therapy, provided either through portable oxygen cylinders or with liquid oxygen canisters.

Previously, it was found that 5‐ASA drugs in doses of at least 2 g/day, were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP for inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the efficacy and safety of 5‐ASA preparations used for the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy, dose‐responsiveness and safety of oral 5‐ASA compared to placebo, SASP, or 5‐ASA comparators for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. A secondary objective of this systematic review was to compare the efficacy and safety of once daily dosing of oral 5‐ASA with conventional (two or three times daily) dosing regimens.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】A computer‐assisted literature search for relevant studies  was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Studies were accepted for analysis if they were randomized controlled clinical trials of parallel design, with a minimum treatment duration of four weeks. Studies of oral 5‐ASA therapy for treatment of patients with active ulcerative colitis compared with placebo, SASP or other formulations of 5‐ASA were considered for inclusion. Studies that compared once daily 5‐ASA treatment with conventional dosing of 5‐ASA (two or three times daily) and 5‐ASA dose ranging studies were also considered for inclusion.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】The outcomes of interest were the failure to induce global/clinical remission, global/clinical improvement, endoscopic remission, endoscopic improvement, adherence, adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and withdrawals or exclusions after entry. Trials were separated into five comparison groups: 5‐ASA versus placebo, 5‐ASA versus sulfasalazine, once daily dosing versus conventional dosing, 5‐ASA versus comparator 5‐ASA, and 5‐ASA dose‐ranging. Placebo‐controlled trials were subgrouped by dosage. SASP‐controlled trials were subgrouped by 5‐ASA/SASP mass ratios. Once daily versus conventional dosing studies were subgrouped by formulation. 5‐ASA‐controlled trials were subgrouped by common 5‐ASA comparators (e.g. Asacol, Claversal, Salofalk and Pentasa). Dose‐ranging studies were subgrouped by 5‐ASA formulation. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention to treat basis.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Forty‐eight studies (7776 patients) were included. The majority of included studies were rated as low risk of bias. 5‐ASA was significantly superior to placebo with regard to all measured outcome variables. Seventy‐two per cent of 5‐ASA patients failed to enter clinical remission compared to 85% of placebo patients (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.91). A dose‐response trend for 5‐ASA was also observed. No statistically significant differences in efficacy were found between 5‐ASA and SASP. Fifty‐four per cent of 5‐ASA patients failed to enter remission compared to 58% of SASP patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). No statistically significant differences in efficacy or adherence were found between once daily and conventionally dosed 5‐ASA. Forty‐two per cent of once daily patients failed to enter clinical remission compared to 44% of conventionally dosed patients (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10). Eight per cent of patients dosed once daily failed to adhere to their medication regimen compared to 6% of conventionally dosed patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.86). There does not appear to be any difference in efficacy among the various 5‐ASA formulations. Fifty per cent of patients in the 5‐ASA group failed to enter remission compared to 52% of patients in the 5‐ASA comparator group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02). A pooled analysis of the ASCEND (I, II and III, n = 1459 patients) studies found no statistically significant difference in clinical improvement between Asacol 4.8 g/day and 2.4 g/day used for the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis. Thirty‐seven per cent of patients in the 4.8 g/day group failed to improve clinically compared to 41% of patients in the 2.4 g/day group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with moderate disease may benefit from the higher dose of 4.8 g/day. One study compared (n = 123 patients) Pentasa 4 g/day to 2.25 g/day in patients with moderate disease. Twenty‐five per cent of patients in the 4 g/day group failed to improve clinically compared to 57% of patients in the 2.25 g/day group (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71). A pooled analysis of two studies comparing MMX mesalamine 4.8 g/day to 2.4 g/day found no statistically significant difference in efficacy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29). 5‐ASA was generally safe and common adverse events included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache and worsening ulcerative colitis. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of adverse events between 5‐ASA and placebo, once daily and conventionally dosed 5‐ASA, 5‐ASA and comparator 5‐ASA formulation and 5‐ASA dose ranging (high dose versus low dose) studies. SASP was not as well tolerated as 5‐ASA. Twenty‐nine percent of SASP patients experienced an adverse event compared to 15% of 5‐ASA patients (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】5‐ASA was superior to placebo and no more effective than SASP. Considering their relative costs, a clinical advantage to using oral 5‐ASA in place of SASP appears unlikely. 5‐ASA dosed once daily appears to be as efficacious and safe as conventionally dosed 5‐ASA. Adherence does not appear to be enhanced by once daily dosing in the clinical trial setting. It is unknown if once daily dosing of 5‐ASA improves adherence in a community‐based setting. There do not appear to be any differences in efficacy or safety among the various 5‐ASA formulations. A daily dosage of 2.4 g appears to be a safe and effective induction therapy for patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients with moderate disease may benefit from an initial dose of 4.8 g/day.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Ulcerative Colitis\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Oral\n*   Aminosalicylic Acid And Similar Agents\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n*   Sulfasalazine\n*   Aminosalicylic Acid And Similar Agents\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Ulcerative Colitis In Remission\n*   Treatment Failure\n*   Medication adherence\n*   Withdrawal Due To Adverse Events\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Failure\n*   Clinical Improvement\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Oral 5‐aminosalicylic acid for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis\n\n【24】Sulfasalazine (SASP) has been used for treating ulcerative colitis for decades. SASP is made up of 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) linked to a sulfur molecule. Up to a third of patients treated with SASP have reported side effects, which are thought to be related to the sulfur part of the molecule. Common side effects associated with SASP include nausea, indigestion, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. 5‐ASA drugs were developed to avoid the side effects associated with SASP. This review includes 48 randomized trials with a total of 7776 participants. Oral 5‐ASA was found to be more effective than placebo (fake drug). Although oral 5‐ASA drugs are effective for treating active ulcerative colitis, they are no more effective than SASP therapy. Patients taking 5‐ASA are less likely to experience side effects than patients taking SASP. Side effects associated with 5‐ASA are generally mild in nature, and common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea), headache and worsening ulcerative colitis. Male infertility is associated with SASP and not with 5‐ASA, so 5‐ASA may be preferred for patients concerned about fertility. 5‐ASA compounds are more expensive than SASP, so SASP may be the preferred option where cost is an important factor. 5‐ASA dosed once daily appears to be as effective and safe as conventionally dosed (two or three times daily) 5‐ASA. There do not appear to be any differences in effectiveness or safety among the various 5‐ASA formulations. A daily dosage of 2.4 g appears to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients with moderate disease may benefit from an initial dose of 4.8 g/day.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To examine the effect and safety of corticosteroids on reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Sore throat is a very common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for more than 1% of all ambulatory care visits in the US in 2005 .  Sore throat is a term which can refer both to a patient's complaint of pain in the throat due to an infection, but also includes more pathologic based conditions such as tonsillitis or pharyngitis. The majority of sore throats are due to viral infections such as rhinovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus. The main bacterial pathogen is Group A beta _Haemolytic streptococcus_ (GABHS), found in approximately 10% of adult and 15 to 30% of child sore throats . Despite the low overall percentage of bacterial pathogens which are responsible for sore throat, the rate of antibiotic prescribing for this condition remains high . In part, this may be due to attempts by clinicians to reduce symptoms in patients with sore throat, and also to reduce the risk of known complications of streptococcal throat infection such as peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. However, the incidence of these complications is currently very low in high‐income countries, for example, hospital admission for peritonsillar abscess occurs in less than 4 per 100,000 people and the effects of antibiotics overall in patients with sore throats is small . Furthermore, unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Corticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones which are secreted naturally by the adrenal cortex, and are also synthetically produced. They are hormones that are involved in a large range of physiological systems in the human body, particularly those related to inflammation and immune response. Synthetic corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice in topical, oral and parenteral forms. The intervention we will examine is the use of corticosteroids administered locally (for example, sprays into the throat), or systemically (by oral or parenteral administration) to participants suffering from sore throats.\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】The discomfort experienced by peoples with sore throat is due to inflammation in the oropharyngeal mucosa. This results in pain, and particularly pain with swallowing saliva or ingesting food or drink. Therefore, reducing the level of inflammation could lead to fewer symptoms. Currently used analgesics for sore throat include topical agents with mild local anaesthetic properties, as well as oral agents including the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids are widely used to reduce inflammation in many conditions, both locally (for example, topical corticosteroids for eczema, steroid joint injections for inflamed joints), as well as systemically (for example, oral steroids for rheumatoid arthritis). Moreover, corticosteroids decrease inflammation in the respiratory tract epithelium  and improve symptoms and other outcomes in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis  and viral croup . They also provide short‐term relief from the symptoms of sore throat in infectious mononucleosis . The question that we will address is whether corticosteroids offer any relief for symptoms in adults and children with sore throats.\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】It is important to do this review because there are currently few therapeutic options for managing sore throats in adults and children. There is wide consensus that antibiotics are overused for treating sore throat in primary care, and contribute to growing antibiotic resistance . However, there are currently few other therapeutic options available for management of sore throat in adults and children. Oral and topical analgesics are often recommended or prescribed for sore throat, with unclear benefit . If corticosteroids provided significant symptomatic benefit in people with sore throat they could potentially fill this therapeutic vacuum. If corticosteroids reduce symptoms, then it is possible that they would reduce the demand for or use of antibiotics for this condition. Although corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice, they can sometimes be associated with side effects, so it is important to determine how frequently these occur in treating patients with sore throat and whether the benefits of corticosteroids for this condition outweigh the side effects and any adverse events. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review to determine whether corticosteroids reduce symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To examine the effect and safety of corticosteroids on reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】We will include adults and children (older than three years of age) with sore throat. Specifically sore throat includes\n\n【21】1.  Clinical signs of acute tonsillitis ‐ inflammation of the tonsils.\n\n【22】2.  Pharyngitis ‐ inflammation of the oropharynx.\n\n【23】3.  Clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia).\n\n【24】We will exclude studies of hospitalised participants, but will include studies examining outpatients seen in an Emergency Department setting. We will exclude studies of participants with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】Studies which use steroids versus standard clinical care or placebo in the control group will be included. All routes and types of corticosteroid administration will be included. Trials reporting combined interventions will be included if they allow a direct comparison between corticosteroids and usual care. The definition of standard clinical care will be reported for each of the included trials, and will include reporting of whether antibiotics and analgesics were used, which antibiotics were used, and the use of scheduled or as required doses of analgesics.\n\n【27】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【28】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【29】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of PE.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life‐threatening condition in which a blood clot blocks the supply to the lungs. PE is often a consequence of a thrombus in the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) that dislodges and travels in the blood to the pulmonary arteries. The prevalence of PE has been estimated as 3 to 4 per 10,000 people, although the true prevalence is hard to measure due to underestimation by diagnostic imaging and overestimation by postmortem data. DVT is present in approximately 70% to 80% of people with a PE, yet only 15% of PE cases have symptoms of DVT . One complication of PE is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH). CTPH occurs when the clot obstructs the pulmonary arteries causing excessive pressure in the pulmonary artery and stress to the right ventricle. CTPH is less common but it can result in heart failure .\n\n【7】Risk factors for PE are similar to those for DVT and are classified as provoked or unprovoked . Provoked PE occurs following surgery or pregnancy, or by a non‐surgical transient risk factor such as history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), venous insufficiency, chronic heart failure, thrombophilia, obesity, immobility (such as prolonged travel, acute medical illness or hospitalisation), cancer, oestrogens (pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy) and trauma .\n\n【8】Diagnosis of PE is made by general assessment of the patient's medical history, physical examination and clinical pre‐test probability. However, it can be particularly challenging as the symptoms (dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, retrosternal chest pain, cough and haemoptysis) are not specific . In severe cases, the right ventricle fails leading to dizziness, syncope, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypoxia, elevated jugular venous pressure, systemic hypotension and cardiogenic shock . The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend that people presenting with a suspected PE should be assessed using a two‐level PE Wells score . Points are awarded for clinical features present including clinical signs of DVT, heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, recent immobilisation or surgery, previous DVT, haemoptysis and malignancy . For patients with a low pre‐test probability, the use of a D‐dimer assay combined with a clinical prediction rule has a high negative predictive value and avoids the need for unnecessary imaging . However, for patients who have intermediate or high pre‐test probability of PE, imaging is essential. Patients with a score of greater than 4 are judged to be likely to have had a PE and should undergo immediate diagnostic imaging. If this cannot be performed immediately, patients should be given immediate interim parenteral anticoagulant therapy until the imaging test is done. Patients with a negative diagnosis in whom a DVT is likely should be given a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan .\n\n【9】There are two types imaging techniques used to diagnose PE: computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan.\n\n【10】#### 1\\. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram\n\n【11】CTPA involves injecting a contrast agent intravenously and performing a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to visualise the pulmonary arteries and detect any thrombi in the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental branches. The procedure has over 90% specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing PE in the main, lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries . However, the radiation dose administered to the patient is much larger than that of a V/Q scan, and thus patients who have a CTPA are at increased life‐time risk of cancer . CTPA is contraindicated in patients who have an allergy to contrast media, renal impairment or in whom the risk of radiation is too high. In these patients, a V/Q scan is performed instead .\n\n【12】#### 2\\. Ventilation perfusion scan\n\n【13】A V/Q scan comprises of two parts: the ventilation part where the patient breathes in a radioisotope (in the form of a gas or an aerosol) and the perfusion part where the patient is given an intravenous injection of the isotope. A gamma camera is used to detect where the isotopes are in the lungs and the images show which areas of the lungs are ventilated but not perfused . Another version of this test, the V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (V/Q SPECT) has been developed. The camera is rotated around the patient thus generating three‐dimensional images and leading to a more accurate diagnosis .\n\n【14】### Description of the intervention\n\n【15】Until recently, standard treatment of a PE was with an indirect thrombin inhibitor, namely unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). These drugs block the action of thrombin either by \"activating naturally occurring thrombin inhibitors or by inhibiting specific factors in the coagulation system that subsequently impact on thrombin generation or activity\" . Present guidelines recommend initial therapy for PE with a parenteral anticoagulant (UFH or LMWH or fondaparinux) and initial VKA initiation . Recommendations include the use of LMWH or fondaparinux over UFH for initial therapy of PE. Although heparin and VKAs are effective anticoagulants, there are limitations associated with each. LMWH must be administered parenterally and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and haemodynamic instability . Meanwhile VKAs have a narrow therapeutic window, require frequent monitoring and dosage adjustments and can have multiple interactions with other drugs .\n\n【16】Two further classes of oral anticoagulants have been developed; direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) and factor Xa inhibitors. DTIs and factor Xa inhibitors have characteristics that may be favourable over heparin and VKAs, including ease of oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or re‐dosing and fewer known drug interactions (compared with the VKA) .\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】#### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors\n\n【19】DTIs work by binding directly to the enzyme thrombin without the need for a co‐factor such as antithrombin. Unlike heparins and VKAs, DTIs can inhibit both soluble thrombin and fibrin‐bound thrombin . Other advantages include a more predictable anticoagulant effect because of their lack of binding to other proteins, lack of an antiplatelet effect and no suspected concern of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) . There are several types of DTIs.\n\n【20】##### 1\\. Dabigatran\n\n【21】Dabigatran etexilate is a reversible oral DTI that is metabolised to its active ingredient, dabigatran, in the gastrointestinal tract . It does not require anticoagulation monitoring, is excreted by the kidneys and has a half‐life of 12 to 17 hours. As well as a treatment for venous thrombosis, this drug has been involved in many large randomised studies of atrial fibrillation , acute coronary syndromes , and prevention of thrombosis following orthopaedic surgery , and in patients with mechanical heart valves . In common with the other novel oral anticoagulants, dabigatran is associated with a lower incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (compared with VKA). However, again compared with VKA, dabigatran showed a higher incidence of indigestion and heartburn and a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Dabigatran, in the atrial fibrillation studies, showed a tendency (although ultimately not statistically significant) to increased incidence of myocardial infarction .\n\n【22】##### 2\\. Ximelagatran\n\n【23】Ximelagatran is a prodrug that is metabolised to melagatran as it is better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract . It has a plasma half‐life of three hours, has a predictable response after oral administration and does not require coagulation monitoring. Ximelagatran was found to be effective in the treatment of VTE but caused unacceptable liver toxicity , and was, therefore, never licensed.\n\n【24】#### Oral factor Xa inhibitors\n\n【25】Factor Xa inhibitors bind directly to the active site of factor Xa, thus blocking the activity of the clotting factor. Unlike indirect factor Xa inhibitors such as fondaparinux, direct factor Xa inhibitors \"inactivate free FXa and FXa incorporated with the prothrombinase complex equally well\" and do not require interaction with the inhibitor antithrombin . They have been shown to be non‐inferior to VKA but without the need for regular blood test monitoring. They appear to have fewer drug interactions (compared with VKA) and no food or alcohol interactions\n\n【26】##### 1\\. Rivaroxaban\n\n【27】Rivaroxaban is a reversible direct factor Xa inhibitor. For the initial treatment of acute PE, the recommended dosage of rivaroxaban is 15 mg twice daily for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg once daily for continued treatment and prevention of recurrence . The plasma half‐life, if renal function is normal, is 12 hours.\n\n【28】##### 2\\. Apixaban\n\n【29】Apixaban is an oral, small molecule, reversible inhibitor of factor Xa with a plasma half‐life of 8 to 15 hours, taken twice daily .\n\n【30】##### 3\\. Betrixaban\n\n【31】Betrixaban is an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor. It also has a half‐life of 15 hours, offers the convenience of once daily dosing and may exhibit fewer drug interactions than warfarin .\n\n【32】##### 4\\. Edoxaban\n\n【33】Edoxaban is an oral direct inhibitor of activated factor X that is rapidly absorbed with a half‐life of 9 to 11 hours. Edoxaban has a dual mechanism of elimination with one‐third eliminated via the kidneys and the remainder excreted in the faeces. It also offers the convenience of once‐daily dosing , and is used in conjunction with LMWH for five days.\n\n【34】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【35】The effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of VTE has been studied in several randomised controlled trials (EINSTEIN‐DVT Study ( EINSTEIN Investigators ), ODIXa‐DVT Study , Botticelli Study ( Botticelli Investigators ), AMPLIFY Study , RE‐COVER II Study , THRIVE Studies ). One non‐Cochrane systematic review has examined the effectiveness of DTIs and factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs in the treatment of acute VTE . The primary outcome was VTE and results were not presented for DVT and PE separately. To date, no systematic review has been conducted examining the effectiveness of oral inhibitors in the treatment of PE alone.\n\n【36】We are currently conducting another Cochrane systematic review measuring the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of DVT .\n\n【37】Objectives\n----------\n\n【38】To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of PE.\n\n【39】Methods\n-------\n\n【40】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【41】#### Types of studies\n\n【42】Randomised controlled trials in which patients with a confirmed PE were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the treatment of PE.

Compared to CAP, the Hazard ratio (HR) for deaths of treatment with fludarabine was estimated to be 1.04, with a standard error of 0.30 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.48) and it indicated that the mean difference of median survival time was ‐4.00 months, and 16.00 months for response duration. The relative risks (RR) of response rate was 2.80 (95% CI 1.10 to 7.12).

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) refers to loss of blood from any site of the digestive tract resulting from many causes . It is divided into upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) according to the bleeding site. The former bleeding site arises proximal to the ligament of Treitz , but the latter is distal to this point . The manifestations of GIB vary, ranging from no symptoms or unexplained fatigue or pallor to obvious symptoms including seeing blood on paper after a bowel movement or mixed in stool, tarry black stools, and bloody diarrhoea and vomiting . Acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding often results in hypovolaemic shock and threatens life . Vomiting of bloody or brown material or tarry black stools usually indicates UGIB and bloody diarrhoea or stool mixed or coated with blood often suggests LGIB .\n\n【7】In paediatric clinical practice, GIB usually has two scenarios. It is one of the chief complaints when children attend an emergency department , acting as a symptom of many diseases . Alhough the incidence of this scenario has not been well established, because epidemiologic data are scarce, especially for LGIB , the spectrum of diseases causing GIB is closely related to the age of children and there is overlap among different age groups. For neonates, UGIB often occurs from vitamin K deficiency, congenital anomalies including intestinal duplication or vascular anomalies, coagulopathy, or milk protein intolerance LGIB in neonates is usually caused by anorectal fissures, necrotising enterocolitis, malrotation with volvulus, Hirschsprung disease or coagulopathy. For infants, the disease spectrum causing GIB is similar to that of neonates.In addition, their UGIB can be caused by Mallory‐Weiss tear resulting from vomiting, ulcers or gastritis after use of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, oesophagitis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent emesis, caustic ingestion, gastric or oesophageal varices from cirrhosis or portal vein thrombosis, and ingestion of a foreign body.The most common causes of LGIB in infants are anorectal fissures, allergic colitis induced by milk or soy protein, infectious colitis, intussusception, Meckel's diverticulum, lymphonodular hyperplasia or intestinal duplication. For older children and adolescents, the causes of GIB are similar to adults. The most common causes of UGIB are Mallory‐Weiss tears, peptic ulcers, gastritis, varices, foreign body, caustic ingestion, Henoch‐Schoenlein purpura and Crohn's disease. Causes of LGIB in this age group are anorectal fissures, haemorrhoids, infectious colitis, polyp, Meckel's diverticulum, Henoch‐Schoenlein purpura, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphonodular hyperplasia . It is noteworthy that there is a difference between high income and low‐and‐middle income countries in causes of UGIB in children. It is reported that peptic ulcers, oesophagitis, gastritis or duodenitis are the most common causes in America , Japan  and Israel , but varices are the most common lesions in India . However, the spectrum of LGIB in India is similar to that of developed countries .\n\n【8】The second scenario for GIB is that it occurs in critically‐ill children who are in a high risk group for high incidence GIB. They usually have GIB from stress‐induced gastropathy at several days after their admission to hospital . There have been substantial cases in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), especially in developing countries . This occur at any age. The incidence of GIB in PICUs has been reported as 25% in America , 6.4%  to 15.3% in Canada , 43.5%  to 51.8% in Thailand , and for newborn infants was 20% in Finland . However, clinically‐significant bleeding was relatively rare , with the reported incidence of it being 0.4%  to 1.6% in Canada , and 3.6%  to 5.3%  in Thailand. While this condition can be severe, it rarely causes death .\n\n【9】The basic pathogenesis of GIB in children is vascular injury of the gut induced by any underlying disease. In the first scenario described above, the differential diagnosis is wider, and the most likely causes of bleeding can be broadly divided into following categories:\n\n【10】*   Vascular anomalies (e.g. hemangiomas), collateral vessel formation (e.g. gastric or oesophageal varices from cirrhosis), and erosion of mucosa (e.g. inflammation, ulcer) bringing blood vessels close to the gastrointestinal lumen and making it easy for them to be injured and rupture;\n\n【11】*   Systematic vasculitis which can involve gastrointestinal blood vessel or capillaries (e.g. Henoch‐Schoenlein purpura);\n\n【12】*   Vascular congestion, thrombosis or ischemias (e.g. intussusception or malrotation with volvulus); coagulopathy (e.g. vitamin K deficiency or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura);\n\n【13】*   Violent or frequent vomiting or retching, which could tear blood vessels or break capillaries directly (e.g. Mallory‐Weiss tear or emetogenic gastropathy).\n\n【14】In this setting, the bleeding varies greatly by etiology and the condition can be very different.For example bleeding from peptic ulcers and rupture of gastric or oesophageal varices usually comes from only one site, but is an urgent problem which can quickly become life‐threateningIn contrast, bleeding from milk protein intolerance usually comes from numerous sites, but only causes a small amount of blood loss. Necrotizing enterocolitis or malrotation with volvulus require strict fasting but Crohn's disease and haemorrhoid almost never affect eating. The treatment for GIB of Henoch‐Schoenlein purpura is very different from that of coagulopathy, although both of them cause diffuse bleeding from small blood vessel or capillaries. UGIB is likely to be diagnosed and stopped by endoscopy more easily than LGIB in children.\n\n【15】In the second scenario, the pathophysiology of GIB in critically‐ill children is stress‐induced gastropathy which involves mucosal ischemias, mucosal integrity, gastrointestinal motility disturbance, secretion of gastric acid and nutrition problems . This bleeding comes from multiple diffuse erosions or very shallow ulcers which most commonly occur in the fundus of the stomach. The bleeding is usually low volume and does not need to be stopped by performing endoscopy or another haemostasis techniques. Hence, a consideration of the underlying diseases is crucial in determining the management of GIB caused by different etiology.\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】GIB in children requires combined treatments. Therapies directed to underlying diseases causing GIB are key , but stabilising haemodynamics must be the immediate action . Prompt and appropriate fluid resuscitation is essential . Then, a series of measures should be taken to arrest bleeding, mainly including endoscopic techniques  and pharmacologic treatments, such as acid‐suppressive agents , fibrinolysis inhibitors , and splanchnic vasoconstrictors . Acid‐suppressive agents and fibrinolysis inhibitors are mainly to facilitate haemostasis in the gastrointestinal environment based on the evidence that haemostasis may be impaired by low pH value and pepsin . Splanchnic vasoconstrictors are safe and effective in stopping variceal bleeding  by reducing portal pressure . At the same time, fasting will be prescribed for most children for fear that eating may affect haemostasis or aggravate bleeding , although there is no clear statement about it in any guideline relevant to GIB as far as we know. Almost all decisions about fasting for GIB were made based on paediatricians' education and clinical experience, and most paediatricians paid much more attention to GIB rather than fasting.\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Fasting is thought to be required in the treatment of GIB in children for the following reasons:\n\n【20】1.  feeding stimulates further gastroduodenal secretion which will interfere with the action of acid‐suppressive agents and impair haemostasis by adversely affecting blood clotting over the lesions and fibrinolytic activity ;\n\n【21】2.  feeding increases blood flow to the gastrointestinal systematic circulation,and increased blood pressure  which could lead to variceal re‐bleeding ;\n\n【22】3.  feeding also initiates gastrointestinal motility to mix and empty food  which could impair stabilising of the clot.\n\n【23】4.  feeding may interfere with endoscopy therapy.\n\n【24】In summary, fasting seems to be a way to eliminate the above risk factors contributing to failed haemostasis or re‐bleeding, but the real effect of fasting in this context is unknown. In addition, the therapy mechanism of fasting may be different in different conditions, e.g. fasting may be more effective for necrotising enterocolitis than for peptic ulcer, and reducing gastric acid secretion by fasting may be effective in UGIB but not in LGIB.\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】Fasting is unpleasant and not necessarily safe. First, parenteral nutrition following fasting, which appears to be able to compensate for fasting, is invasive, expensive , and is associated with catheter‐related infections , catheter‐related thrombosis  and other risks . Secondly, fasting may bring potential disadvantages. Recent observations and prospective studies have shown that both short‐term and prolonged fasting could induce insulin resistance and metabolic stress, which were found to increase postoperative infection, and cause longer hospital stays and mortality . Fasting could increase acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage by reactivating and aggravating pre‐existing gastrointestinal disease ; and prolonged fasting could result in coagulation disorder . At present, there is no clear guideline about fasting for GIB caused by any condition. Strict or prolonged fasting is common even though it may be unnecessary or harmful in some conditions. Doctors are concerned about the adverse effects of feeding much more than fasting, although both lack systematically‐reviewed evidence for efficacy and safety. It is necessary to assess the effects and safety of fasting for people with GIB and explore the most appropriate length of fasting for different conditions.\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】To assess the effects and safety of fasting for haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding in children.\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of parallel design, irrespective of blinding, length of follow up, language, or publication status.\n\n【33】#### Types of participants\n\n【34】Children aged 0 to 18 years, who were suspected to have or had identified gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (by any evidence of GIB).\n\n【35】#### Types of interventions\n\n【36】Fasting + routine treatments versus feeding + routine treatments.\n\n【37】We define fasting as abstaining from all food including water.\n\n【38】We define feeding as any feeding type and any food formula. Feeding type could be oral feeding, sip feeding, or tube feeding using nasogastric, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy tubes. Food formula could be ordinary diets, elemental diets, synthetic or semisynthetic diets, space diets, tube‐feeding diets, complete liquid diets, supplemental liquid or solid diets.\n\n【39】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【40】We will not include or exclude studies on the basis of reported outcomes. We will only measure short‐term outcomes within one month and include all related time‐points for each outcome measurement. If an outcome measure is reported at multiple time points in a study, the time point closest to one month will be used for the main analysis . Among the following outcomes, It is difficult to define re‐bleeding and continued bleeding which can be measured by various clinical, laboratory or endoscopic findings or any combinations of these, so we will include all trials reporting re‐bleeding or continued bleeding regardless of definition by the original author, and then investigate of heterogeneity and conduct a sensitivity analysis .\n\n【41】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【42】1.  all‐cause case fatality rate (measured by number of children who died from any cause),\n\n【43】2.  incidence of re‐bleeding (measured by number of children with re‐bleeding as defined by the original author),\n\n【44】3.  incidence of continued bleeding (measured by number of children with continued bleeding as defined by the original author).\n\n【45】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【46】1.  incidence of surgery (measured by number of children requiring surgery to stop bleeding),\n\n【47】2.  incidence of secondary infections (measured by number of children suffering any infection after GIB),\n\n【48】3.  incidence of transfusion (measured by number of children requiring transfusion),\n\n【49】4.  any other adverse events (any adverse event in addition to the outcomes mentioned above, such as additional or repeated endoscopic haemostasis, fail to conduct endoscopic haemostasis due to feeding, longer hospital stay, and so on).\n\n【50】According to the definition in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, adverse events refers to \"any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. .\n\n【51】We will report the all‐cause case fatality rate, incidence of re‐bleeding, incidence of continued bleeding, incidence of surgery and incidence of secondary infections in the 'Summary of findings' table of our completed review.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effect of ginkgo biloba extract on the walking capacity of patients with intermittent claudication.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) suffer from progressive narrowing and hardening of the arteries in one or both legs (atherosclerosis). The most common symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication defined as pain in the muscles of the leg occurring during exercise and which is relieved by a short period of rest. This clinical phenomenon affects 1.6% to 4.5% of all people in the general population .\n\n【6】Basic conservative treatment for patients with intermittent claudication includes risk‐factor modification and exercise therapy. Intermittent claudication is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, thus all patients with this symptom should be treated with medical therapy for cardiovascular risk factors. Glucose and cholesterol metabolism and blood pressure should be optimised and, as smoking is considered the most important modifiable vascular risk factor, attention should be paid to smoking cessation. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for all patients with intermittent claudication to reduce the risk of a cardiovascular event . Exercise therapy can improve the maximal walking distance by 150%  and should be prescribed for symptom relief. A supervised exercise programme has more clinical benefits than an unsupervised exercise programme. A recent Cochrane review showed approximately 150‐metre difference in increased walking distance after three months in favour of supervised exercise therapy programmes compared with non‐supervised therapy . Pharmacological treatments reported to be associated with improvement of leg symptoms include cilostazol, pentoxifylline, naftidrofuryl, statins, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and ginkgo biloba extract .\n\n【7】Ginkgo biloba extract is derived from leaves of _Ginkgo biloba,_ the only surviving species of the Ginkgoaceae family of trees. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. In the western world ginkgo biloba extract is prescribed mainly for intermittent claudication, cerebral insufficiency and tinnitus. The extract is made from dried leaves, and preparations for use are standardised to contain the same ingredients in similar doses of 24% ginkgo flavonoids and 6% terpenoids. Flavonoids are believed to contribute to ginkgo's antioxidant properties. In vitro studies of _Ginkgo biloba_ demonstrated free‐radical scavenging properties  and prolongation of the half‐life of endothelial‐derived relaxing factor  resulting in improved microcirculation by inducing relaxation of contracted blood vessels . In other in vitro experiments, the ginkgolides, components of the terpenoids, inhibit the activity of platelet‐activating factor , resulting in diminished platelet aggregation, neutrophil degranulation and oxygen‐free radical production . To establish the clinical effect in patients with PAD we propose to perform a systematic review. Possible problems with such a review of ginkgo biloba extract is the potential for small unpublished studies, especially from relatively inexperienced and small research groups. Moreover, strong beliefs and financial interest could hamper the publication of negative trials. Hence, it is important to explore the possibility of publication bias in detail.\n\n【8】Objectives\n----------\n\n【9】To determine the effect of ginkgo biloba extract on the walking capacity of patients with intermittent claudication.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【12】#### Types of studies\n\n【13】All randomised controlled trials of ginkgo biloba extract versus placebo in patients with intermittent claudication (stage II according to Fontaine ; stages 1 to 3 according to Rutherford ).\n\n【14】#### Types of participants\n\n【15】Adults (18 years and older) with intermittent claudication, according to Fontaine stage II or Rutherford stages 1 to 3.\n\n【16】#### Types of interventions\n\n【17】We will compare ginkgo biloba extract with placebo for intermittent claudication.

As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI‐CAJ). We also searched the _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Fifty‐one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta‐analysis, including 17 cluster‐RCTs and 33 studies with non‐randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation improving participants' existing sanitation facility, o behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions.\n\n【12】**Providing access to any sanitation facility**\n\n【13】Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster‐RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low‐certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non‐randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants).\n\n【14】**Sanitation facility improvement**\n\n【15】Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster‐RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low‐certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non‐randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants).\n\n【16】**Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided)**\n\n【17】Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster‐RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non‐randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations.\n\n【18】**Any sanitation intervention**\n\n【19】A pooled analysis of cluster‐RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow‐up times for children under five years.\n\n【20】There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all‐cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants).\n\n【21】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【22】There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.\n### PICOs\n\n【23】###### Populatio\n\n【24】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【25】###### Interventio\n\n【26】*   Sanitation measures\n\n【27】###### Compariso\n\n【28】*   Usual Care\n\n【29】###### Outcom\n\n【30】*   Diarrhea\n\n【31】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

However, the effects varied by the type of intervention and setting, and the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.\n\n【37】**What was studied in this review?**\n\n【38】Diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially amongst young children in low‐income countries. Many of the pathogens that cause diarrhoea are transmitted through exposure to human faeces. Sanitation facilities, such as toilets and latrines, serve as a primary barrier to separate pathogens excreted in human faeces from the environment. This review examined intervention studies to improve sanitation access, facilities, or use. We identified 51 studies of such interventions, most of which were from low‐ or middle‐income countries.\n\n【39】**What were the main results of this review?**\n\n【40】The results suggest that sanitation interventions reduce diarrhoea by about 15% to 26%, both in vulnerable young children and all age populations. However, not all interventions were protective, and effects varied substantially by the type of intervention and setting. We estimated that an intervention to provide sanitation access to people practising open defecation would probably reduce diarrhoea by about 11% to 21%, an intervention to improve existing sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea by about 15% to 35%, and a behaviour change intervention to improve sanitation access or use without providing infrastructure or subsidies would probably reduce diarrhoea by about 15% to 18%. However, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, and additional research is likely to change these estimates, particularly for interventions that provide sanitation access or improve existing sanitation facilities. Further research is also necessary to understand which type of interventions would yield the most protective health effects in various types of settings.\n\n【41】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo for the treatment of people with diagnoses of cognitive impairment or dementia.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】By 2050 the world’s population aged 60 and older is expected to total 2 billion . While this represents a triumph for population health it carries an inherent set of challenges – adapting the current healthcare system to the needs of this burgeoning cohort. A key area of focus for policy, research and care services is addressing prevention and management of dementia and cognitive decline associated with aging.\n\n【8】Alzheimer’s disease has recently advanced from the seventh to the sixth leading cause of death in the USA . The estimated USA prevalence is 5.5 million, a number that is expected to triple to 16 million by 2050 . The disease accounted for USD (US dollar) 259 billion of USA expenditures on health care in 2016 with more than USD 109 billion of direct costs, which is greater than heart failure and cancer combined . More than 47 million people have the disease worldwide, with an expected prevalence of 131.5 million people by 2050, most of whom will be living in the developing world .\n\n【9】Dementia is not a single entity. It encompasses a variety of clinical syndromes which are most commonly due to progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. In the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ , Fifth Edition (DSM‐5), the term 'dementia' has been replaced by 'major neurocognitive disorder'. Diagnosis requires evidence of cognitive decline that is not due to another mental disorder and is severe enough to interfere with independent functioning . The commonest subtype of dementia is that due to Alzheimer's disease. Other common subtypes are vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, dementia in Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Around 50% of cases are mixed type . There are some reversible dementia syndromes, for example due to thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies; none of the common neurodegenerative dementias have cures, however. Dementia is often preceded by a period of milder cognitive dysfunction. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition intermediate between normal cognitive changes that may occur with age and more serious symptoms that indicate dementia. Someone with MCI has detectable cognitive decline, more than expected from age alone, but retains functional independence. MCI is a risk factor for eventually developing dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, although it should be noted that mild cognitive impairment does not always progress to dementia .\n\n【10】The diagnosis of dementia is based on clinical assessment, including a history from an informant who knows the person well, neuropsychological tests and functional assessment. It is important to note that some cognitive changes are part of the normal aging process . These changes primarily involve relatively subtle decreases in speed of processing, attention and memory . Differentiating between these normal changes and MCI can be challenging and often focuses on greater than usual declines in memory or executive functioning . By definition MCI does not impair everyday functioning while dementia impacts an individual’s ability to function independently. The later stages of dementia are associated with increased healthcare costs and eventually result in severe disability and death .\n\n【11】Given the different clinical and pathological variants of dementia, it is evident that no single causal factor is sufficient and necessary to explain progression from normal age‐related cognitive decline to dementia. Although the etiology for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease remains uncertain, there are genetic factors – with genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) contributing to early‐onset Alzheimer's disease; and apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele associated with an increased risk for late‐onset Alzheimer’s disease . A review by the Lancet Commission also identified nine health and lifestyle risk factors that, in combination, contribute to 35% of the risk for dementia . It is clear that the mechanisms responsible for dementia are complex and comprize numerous interactions between biological, psychological and social factors that exert different effects at different stages of the disease process. However, there is currently no known effective treatment for most progressive forms of dementia.\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】_Ginkgo biloba_ (Ginkgo) is the only surviving species of the plant division Ginkgophyta and is an endangered nonflowering tree that can be traced over 200 million years . Although native to China, Ginkgo is also cultivated elsewhere, and the fruits and leaves have been used since early human history as both a food and a traditional medicine . Ginkgo leaves and other aerial parts have been part of traditional East Asian medicine practices for at least the last 2000 years . In addition to ongoing empirical traditional use of the plant, numerous commercially‐prepared products containing Ginkgo extractions (i.e. extracts) are currently available. Various parts of the Ginkgo tree possess bioactive compounds, including ginkgolides and bilobalides (i.e. terpene trilactones unique to the plant), as well as flavonoids (flavones, biflavones, flavonols, tannins, and associated glycosides) . In recent decades, extracts of the dried green Ginkgo leaves have been investigated for treating several medical conditions, particularly those related to diseases of the peripheral and cerebral circulation . Ginkgo‐derived extract EGb 761 has been used in many existing studies ; the makeup of this product includes flavone glycosides (22% to 27%), terpene lactones including ginkgolides A, B and C (2.8% to 3.4%) and bilobalide (2.6% to 3.2%), and less than 5 ppm ginkgolic acids, constituents of known allergic and cytotoxic potency . Because Ginkgo natural products encompass a variety of preparations and doses of active compounds, a comprehensive investigation of various Ginkgo natural products is warranted to determine which, if any, may be beneficial for the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】For centuries the raw material from Ginkgo has been used for its broad medicinal efficacy in various parts of Asia. Currently, the most commonly used and studied extract is EGb 761 and its major purified components, which include ginkgolides A, B, C, and J as well as bilobalide. EGb 761 and its components have been studied in pre‐clinical and clinical settings for their beneficial effects on a wide range of pathological states, from vascular problems  and ischemic stroke  to diabetes‐related health complications  to neurodegenerative conditions leading to cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease . Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid‐beta (A _ß_ ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein‐based neurofibrillary tangles. Many of these pathologies are of reasonably well‐known etiologies involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. EGb 761 reportedly acts as an anti‐oxidant , anti‐inflammatory , stress‐reducing , and neuroprotective agent . The molecular mechanisms and pathways of Alzheimer's disease are not completely understood, however, with the result that the identification of therapeutic targets and the design of effective therapies remain very challenging.\n\n【16】The complexity of the pathophysiology combined with the challenge of using an herbal extract has, not surprisingly, led to a multitude of potential pathways through which EGb 761 might act. Studies of EGb 761 have been conducted using established cell lines, primary cell cultures, and animal models. Gargouri 2018 showed the anti‐neuro‐inflammatory effects of EGb 761 in LPS‐activated primary microglial cells by acting on the COX/PGE₂ pathway. The effects of EGb 761 on neurite growth have also been a subject of great interest as neuroplasticity is significantly reduced in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases. Lejri 2019a used SH‐SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line in a 2D and 3D surface culture and found that EGb 761 stimulated neurite outgrowth by acting on the Akt/mTOR pathway. In a recent study , the neurite outgrowth effects in PC12 cell line was attributed to the lactone moieties of bilobalide. Kuo 2019 conducted ex vivo mouse model studies comparing ginkgolide A to memantine, a low‐affinity antagonist of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor and a drug clinically used to treat the symptoms of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. They found that ginkgolide A inhibited NMDA receptors and prevented the neuronal A _ß_ ‐induced increase in c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, behavioral changes, locomotor activity, and memory retention were assessed using the Y and Morris Water Maze and the Open Field test. The results showed that the treatment improved the memory of the wild‐type mice. The authors suggested that ginkgolide A could be a phytomedicinal‐based drug acting similarly to memantine , but possibly with fewer side effects.\n\n【17】Rats with homocysteinemia‐induced amnesia that were treated with EGb 761 exhibited an improvement of their cognitive impairment and a reduction in the AD‐like Tau hyperphosphorylation, attributable to the anti‐oxidative activity of _Ginkgo biloba_ . Long‐term feeding (2 or 5 months) of Human P301S tau mutant‐transgenic mice with EGb 761 resulted in a switch of the microglia from pro‐ to anti‐inflammatory status, a decrease in the tau protein content, recovery of the CREB phosphorylation, inhibition of p38‐MAPK and GSK‐3ß, and an amelioration of the decline in cognitive function. EGb 761 and its purified compounds ginkgolide A and bilobalide but not ginkgolides B or C amplified autophagy and tau protein degradation in the neuronal lysosomes. This study demonstrated the molecular specificity of EGb 761 and its purified compounds targeting various pathways and the importance of the molecular synergy in herbal products .\n\n【18】Using systems medicine and computer modeling approaches, Li and colleagues have recently reported the top 30 putative Alzheimer's disease target proteins, which were seen to be associated with multiple pathways, including anti‐oxidation, anti‐inflammation, anti‐apoptosis, mitochondrial protection, ion homeostasis, hormone synthesis, and neuroprotection via effects on amyloidogenesis and tau protein phosphorylation, all of which may be mechanisms responsible for beneficial effects of Ginkgo . Interestingly, the authors identified six putative Alzheimer's‐disease‐related proteins for which research is currently lacking ( Li 2018 for details). Those newly discovered molecules represent additional potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases and could potentially be added to the panoply of existing conventional cholinergic and anti‐glutamatergic agents as a treatment option.\n\n【19】Despite being the most studied phytomedicinal extract, the molecular mechanisms underlying the potential positive health outcomes of EGb 761 remain elusive. Furthermore, although standardized EGb 761 is widely considered the 'gold standard' of Ginkgo preparations there are a wide number of other Ginkgo supplements or Ginkgo‐based medications on the market that involve the whole herb or other extracts (e.g. LI 137), and these preparations likely differ somewhat from EGb 761 in their pharmacological properties and mechanisms . The complex synergistic effects of the various Ginkgo compounds and the multifaceted disease processes in dementia make isolation of specific mechanisms difficult. Nevertheless, Ginkgo compounds are the topic of ongoing research as potentially effective therapeutic agents offering dementia treatment with fewer or less severe side effects than alternative medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors, and research continues into potential mechanisms.\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】As described above, dementias such as those due to Alzheimer's disease are an evolving public health issue and there are no established cures or effective treatments to slow or reverse disease progression. Despite the absence of clear evidence from early randomized controlled trials for the effect of Gingko in preventing or treating dementia it remains a popular herbal remedy for the mitigation of cognitive decline and neuroprotective effects are biologically plausible ‒ it has been shown to reduce Aβ aggregation and toxicity ; and may also modulate vascular endothelial repair through activation of heme oxygenase‐1 . The last Cochrane Review on this topic was in 2009 and did not find evidence for improvement in cognitive function compared with placebo . However there have since been studies showing a modest improvement in cognitive performance, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and global cognitive function . The Asian Clinical Expert Panel on Neurocognitive Disorders reached a consensus on the importance of EGb 761 use alone or as adjunctive therapy for mild cognition decline and dementia, especially in patients who show limited benefit from conventional drugs . In the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry Guidelines, Gingko has been assessed for the level of evidence as category B and grade 3, reflecting the growing confidence in the efficacy of this herbal extract . Given our evolving understanding of the complex disease process of dementia, a comprehensive review of the literature and a systematic assessment of all available studies for methodological rigor might allow clearer conclusions to be drawn about the potential effectiveness of a relatively cheap over‐the‐counter remedy. Given its ubiquity, ease of access and relatively benign side‐effect profile, even small improvements in cognitive function might result in improved quality of life for patients and carers and widespread cost savings if implemented at a large scale.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the efficacy and safety of Ginkgo for the treatment of people with diagnoses of cognitive impairment or dementia.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We will exclude quasi‐randomized trials, which we define as trials in which methods that are not strictly random (e.g. alternation, medical record number) are used to allocate participants to treatment groups. If the study report does not describe the method of randomization we will contact the authors to confirm that the trial was truly randomized. We will not restrict study eligibility by language or publication status.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】We will include trials in adults with existing cognitive impairment or dementia. To be inclusive of populations with cognitive impairment, we will accept both trials including participants with diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment according to specific diagnostic criteria (e.g. the criteria for mild cognitive impairment proposed by the First Key Symposium in 2004 ) and trials with participants characterized as cognitively impaired according to more general criteria (e.g. age‐related memory impairment, subjective memory impairment). To be inclusive of populations with dementia, we will accept both trials including participants meeting formal diagnostic criteria for dementia (e.g. the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ , Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) diagnosis of Major Neurocognitive Disorder) and trials with participants identified with probable dementia based only on cognitive test scores or other clinical criteria.\n\n【30】We will include studies which focus on both healthy participants and participants with cognitive impairment or dementia only if they separately report the outcome data for participants with cognitive impairment or dementia.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will include studies that evaluate Ginkgo as an intervention for cognitive impairment or dementia, including any preparation or extract, at any dose and by any route of administration (e.g. oral or intravenous).\n\n【33】The comparisons of interest will be:\n\n【34】*   Ginkgo versus placebo;\n\n【35】*   Ginkgo versus no treatment (e.g. wait list, or no other specified active intervention);\n\n【36】*   Ginkgo versus other active intervention;\n\n【37】*   Ginkgo + other active intervention versus placebo + the same active intervention; and\n\n【38】*   Ginkgo + other active intervention versus other active intervention alone.\n\n【39】For all comparisons involving active interventions, we will group similar active interventions together, and use subgroup analyses to evaluate similar but different interventions within that category (e.g. different types of medications or natural products (or both), with additional consideration of preparation method).\n\n【40】We will allow concomitant treatments, as long as they are given to both intervention groups.\n\n【41】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【42】Because dementia is a chronic and progressive condition, we will only include studies that follow participants for a minimum of three months. We will extract outcomes assessed at short‐term (3 to 4 months, and closest to 3 months), intermediate‐term (between 4 and 11 months, and closest to 6 months), and long‐term (at least 12 months and closest to 1 year) time points. We will consider the intermediate‐term outcomes (closest to 6 months) to be the outcomes of primary interest.\n\n【43】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【44】*   Global clinical status (e.g. as measured by tools such as the Clinician's Interview‐Based Impression of Change (CIBIC), the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), or the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS))\n\n【45】*   Global cognitive function (e.g. as measured by tools such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS‐Cog), among others)\n\n【46】*   Ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) (e.g. as measured by tools such as the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (Bristol ADL) or the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), among others)\n\n【47】*   Adverse events (both serious and not serious, and including ginkgo‐drug interactions when reported)\n\n【48】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【49】*   Memory‐specific cognitive measures (e.g. Logical Memory Test)\n\n【50】*   Executive‐function‐specific cognitive measures (e.g. Verbal Fluency Test)\n\n【51】*   Quality of life (e.g. as measured by disease‐specific tools such as the Cornell‐Brown Scale for Quality of Life in Dementia (CBS), the Dementia Quality of Life Instrument (DQoL), or the Psychological Well‐Being in Cognitively Impaired Persons (PWB‐CIP) tool, among others)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "aa67af29-86bf-4915-982e-857bc56c88d6", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of using email for the management of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, on outcomes for health professionals, patients and carers, and health services, including harms.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Related systematic reviews\n\n【6】This review will form part of an overview of reviews, incorporating four other reviews:\n\n【7】*   email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion ;\n\n【8】*   email for the clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals ;\n\n【9】*   email for the clinical communication between healthcare professionals ; and\n\n【10】*   email for communicating results of diagnostic medical investigations to patients .\n\n【11】### The use of email\n\n【12】The use of email as a medium for business and social communication is increasingly common . This is consistent with the global expansion of users on the internet, with 90% of internet users said to use email . While other industries such as insurance and banking have readily embraced such new technology in order to compete on the global stage , the healthcare sector has been more cautious in its acceptance of this new medium .\n\n【13】In 1998 a survey of American physicians showed that less than seven per cent had used email to contact their patients , however more recent surveys show this to be increasing. US surveys have revealed that the increase in use is variable, from 16% of physicians using email in a survey of primary care practitioners, to as many as 72% in a large outpatient department . Uptake may vary according to patient group. The majority (79%) of doctors at a student health centre in Finland reported using email with patients . This was a population with a high email and internet usage rate.\n\n【14】Despite increasing rates of use by healthcare professionals, the volume of email communication remains low, with surveys reporting averages between 7.7 emails per month and 8.6 emails per week in the Finnish student healthcare centre . Email communication was used for requesting prescriptions, booking appointments and for clinical consultation.\n\n【15】Several factors are likely to drive the trend of increasing email use including the following.\n\n【16】*   Increasing patient demand. A substantial amount of survey literature points to high levels of patient desire to contact doctors via email . Notably, this includes a recent poll in the US  showing that 62% of patients with the ability to choose their doctor are influenced in part when making this choice by whether the doctor is contactable via email.\n\n【17】*   The natural demographic shift toward an increasing proportion of doctors (and patients) comfortable with using technology‐driven care solutions.\n\n【18】*   Increasing per capita demand on healthcare resources  (for example with the advent of increased chronic care and demand for more preventive screening) resulting in a focus on working more efficiently.\n\n【19】*   Some evidence showing increased physician productivity associated with the adoption of email communication .\n\n【20】Guidelines on the use of email in a healthcare environment were developed in an American white paper over 10 years ago . These guidelines were developed to aid clinicians and healthcare delivery organisations in the use of electronic mail with patients, although there is evidence that physicians are not adhering to the recommendations . These guidelines have been heavily referred to in much of the related literature but have not been updated since their release.\n\n【21】The vast majority of literature on the use of email originates in North America and it is uncertain whether the results of such research will be applicable to other international healthcare environments, where email availability and technology can be very different.\n\n【22】### Forms of electronic mail\n\n【23】In the absence of a standardised email communication infrastructure in the healthcare sector, email has been adopted in an ad‐hoc fashion and this has included the use of unsecured and secured email communication.\n\n【24】Standard unsecured email is email which is sent unencrypted. Secured email is encrypted; encryption transforms the text into an un‐interpretable format as it is transferred across the internet. Encryption protects the confidentiality of the data, however both sender and recipient must have the appropriate software for encryption and decoding .\n\n【25】Secure email also includes various specifically developed applications such as patient portals which utilise web messaging. Such portals provide pro‐formas into which patients can enter their message. The message is sent to the recipient in the manner of an email .\n\n【26】Secure websites are distributed by secure web servers. Web servers store and disseminate web pages. Secure servers ensure data from an internet browser is encrypted before being uploaded to the relevant website. This makes it difficult for the data to be intercepted and deciphered .\n\n【27】There are significant differences in terms of the applications. Bespoke secure email programmes may incorporate special features such as standard forms guiding the use and content of the email sent, ability to show read receipts (in order to confirm the patient has received the correspondence) and, if necessary, facilities for receiving payment . However they are costly to set up and may require a greater degree of skill on the part of the user than standard unsecured email . For the purpose of the review all methods will be included although secured versus unsecured email will be considered in a subgroup analysis.\n\n【28】### Methods of accessing email\n\n【29】Methods of accessing the internet and thus an email account have changed with time; traditionally access would occur via a personal computer or laptop at home or work, connecting to the internet using a fixed line. There are now several methods of accessing the internet. Wireless networks (known colloquially as wifi) allow internet connection to a personal computer, laptop computer or other device wherever a network is available .\n\n【30】Internet connection is also possible via alternative networks using mobile devices. This includes access via mobile telephones to a wireless application protocol (WAP) network (rather than to the www) or to third generation (3G) network. Adaptors connecting to a universal serial bus (USB) port can be used to access the 3G network using a laptop computer . Therefore email can be accessed away from the office or home in a variety of ways.\n\n【31】### The 'Digital Divide'\n\n【32】The so‐called 'digital divide' describes the inequality created by the increasing level of digital technology. As new technologies replace old systems, it has been suggested that certain sectors of the population are being left behind with regard to access and use of these services, for instance the elderly, non‐English speakers and those in lower income groups . A divide has also been observed amongst healthcare professionals. A UK‐based survey showed that clinicians more recently‐qualified feel comfortable using the internet and consider it reliable ., This is unsurprising given the relatively recent introduction of such technologies, and illustrates a potential generational effect on their use.\n\n【33】### Email for the management of healthcare appointments and reminders for attendance\n\n【34】This review will consider the use of email for the management of healthcare appointments and reminders for attendance, particularly scheduling, rescheduling and cancelling healthcare appointments, and providing prompts/reminders for attendance at appointments.\n\n【35】The aim of using email interventions is to reduce healthcare inefficiencies caused by missed appointments, and to reduce unnecessary waiting times as well as providing continuous and effective healthcare to patients.\n\n【36】In the UK non‐attendance rates for general practice and hospital outpatient appointments are around 12% but range from 5% to 34% across different specialities and between regions . Non‐attendance can arise from problems associated with cancelling an appointment, such as through poor provision for cancelling or rearranging an appointment, or because a patient lacks access to a telephone at a suitable time.\n\n【37】Reasons given for missing an appointment are most commonly forgetting the appointment, and family or work commitments . For hospital appointments, however, inadequate communication is deemed to be the main factor . The problem of non‐attendance has long been recognised. A study of failed outpatient appointments in 1989 suggested that non‐attendance may be due to inadequate communication between the referring doctor and patient . Missed appointments are costly; in 1997 the estimated total cost to the NHS was £300 million annually, approximately £65 per lost appointment. Non‐attendance also creates long waiting lists .\n\n【38】#### Scheduling\n\n【39】It has been recommended that to reduce non‐attendance, the patient should be allowed to select a suitable appointment time and date. In the case of outpatient appointments this has been shown to reduce non‐attendance by between 30% and 50% . Traditionally, patients have appointments arranged for them by the secondary care health service, or they choose an appointment from those offered to them; this occurs via letter, telephone or in person. Patients often have difficulty contacting their general practitioner or equivalent by telephone, and using email instead may offer a viable alternative . Where email systems are in place there will usually be a specific email address for non‐urgent appointments which patients can use .\n\n【40】Booking appointments via email may involve the patient sending an email with suitable times for an appointment and their choice of clinician. Alternatively, a pro‐forma may be used. The University of Texas Medical Branch has an online appointment scheduling and rescheduling form, which asks patients to fill in patient information, contact information, and preferred appointment information including preferred physician and a time preference. A response is delivered by email or telephone within two days. The form includes a clear warning that it is not to be used in emergency or urgent situations .\n\n【41】In general, responses specify with whom the appointment has been made, the date and time. Standard responses can be created to save time. Patients have reported satisfaction with this method; stating that it is more convenient since it allows communication outside of office hours. A close alternative is a web‐based secure system, such as that used to purchase tickets online, which shows free appointments and therefore prevents the back and forth of emails .\n\n【42】Email for managing appointments and attendance has been found to be acceptable for healthcare professionals as well as patients. In a survey of US physicians, 75% considered scheduling appointments to be an appropriate use of email, regarding it as a simple, straightforward use of such technology .\n\n【43】#### Reminders\n\n【44】Reminders have been shown to reduce non‐attendance rates by 23%  and these are traditionally in the form of letters or telephone calls. Reductions in non‐attendance of 82% have been shown in a trial using confirmation by reply, whereby patients were required to post back a pre‐paid reply to their appointment confirmation, and any non‐responders were telephoned . The option for patient confirmation or re‐booking has also been shown to reduce non‐attendance rates .\n\n【45】Email is well suited to appointment reminders  and can be used to allow patients to confirm their attendance at an appointment. Email has many benefits since reminders can be automated and can contain extra information at no extra cost. It may also allow patients to reschedule or change an appointment at a convenient time, without having to wait to be connected to the receptionist or feeling obliged to explain the reasons for a cancellation .\n\n【46】### Advantages and disadvantages\n\n【47】The key advantages of email for managing healthcare appointments and reminders for attendance include the following .\n\n【48】*   Timely and low cost delivery of information (relative to conventional mail) .\n\n【49】*   Convenience; emails can be sent and subsequently read at an opportune time, outside of traditional office hours where convenient .\n\n【50】*   Read receipts can be used to confirm that communications have been received.\n\n【51】*   Relative to verbal communication, the written nature of the communication can be of value as reference for the patient, aiding recall and providing evidence of the exchange.\n\n【52】*   It is an easier communication method for patients with disabilities, and with patients who are temporarily overseas, such as seconded employees .\n\n【53】*   Email addresses usually stay constant when an address or telephone number changes  making this a reliable way of maintaining communication with transient patients.\n\n【54】There are, however, some potential downsides such as the following.\n\n【55】*   Evidence of patient and physician concerns regarding privacy, confidentiality and potential misuse of information .\n\n【56】*   Email may generate an increased workload for healthcare professionals and associated staff. More than one email exchange may be required if a suitable appointment cannot be found, so that a mutually suitable time can be established. This is a particular issue where potential appointment times are not available to view online .\n\n【57】*   Patients may find it difficult to obtain an appointment at short notice via email; since a timely reply cannot be guaranteed .\n\n【58】*   Email as a communication tool provides a different context for interaction. Face‐to‐face communication and telephone calls contain many layers of communication that are lost in an email; such as the emotive cues from vocal intonation or body language . This may lead to misunderstandings.\n\n【59】*   Recovery of implementation and other associated costs (especially in fee‐for‐service healthcare systems) .\n\n【60】*   Potential medico‐legal issues (such as use of non‐encrypted email) .\n\n【61】*   The potential to widen health inequalities via the digital divide .\n\n【62】*   Technological issues may occur, such as recipients having a full mailbox causing email to bounce back to the sender .\n\n【63】*   Systems may be at risk from communications failures, for instance a loss of the link to a central server (a computer which provides services used by other computers, such as email) . There may be several causes for technological system failure, from local power failure to natural disasters.\n\n【64】*   Potential for human error which can lead to unintentional content or incorrect recipients.\n\n【65】### Quality and safety issues\n\n【66】The main quality and safety issues around the use of email in healthcare have included: confidentiality; potential for errors and ensuing liability; identifying clinical situations where email communication is inefficient or inequitable; securing payment; incorporating email into existing work patterns; and achievable costs .\n\n【67】Privacy and confidentiality are a formidable challenge in the adoption of email communication . Patients are more likely to use this type of communication if they have access to the internet from home, rather than from work, because of privacy issues . Family email accounts can mean a lack of privacy .\n\n【68】Web messaging systems can address issues around security and liability that are associated with conventional email communication since they offer encryption capability and access controls . Such systems allow the structuring of communication; for example, messages can be triaged to the correct members of staff . However not all healthcare institutions are capable of providing such a facility and instead rely on standardised mail .\n\n【69】Suggestions for minimising the legal implications of using email in practice have included: adherence to the same strict data protection rules that must be followed in business and industry; adequate infrastructure to provide encrypted secure email transit and storage; and the use of informed consent to ensure that the patient is aware of the risks and benefits associated with communicating with their healthcare professional via email . Obtaining informed consent could include the provision of guidelines for patients about the use of email communication, and would provide an opportunity for authentication of identity. Authentication of patient identity can be achieved by routinely validating patient email addresses when email communication commences. Ongoing validation of identity has also been recommended .\n\n【70】Healthcare professionals should also exercise discretion about the patient's capability to use email communication. There may be patients who should be advised not to use this method of communication, and this should be at the discretion of the healthcare professional . There is a clear need for the use of guidelines when considering email communication, to prevent potential medico‐legal issues.\n\n【71】Introducing the option of email for making healthcare appointments may introduce inequity, and disempower those patients most in need, for example those with severe illness and those in deprived areas. Email systems may also discriminate against patients who speak a different language, and those with learning difficulties or sensory disabilities . Patients who are comfortable using email would be able to use new systems more easily and so may obtain optimum appointments, while those patients booking by telephone or in person may have to compete with this fast moving email system to find an appointment to suit them .\n\n【72】Securing reimbursement for having such a service available is an issue raised by healthcare professionals and their organisations when considering their use, especially where fee‐for‐service health systems are in operation. Securing payment is possible with certain systems. Web messaging systems allow clinicians to charge registered patients for reading their responses and patients can be pre‐warned about this facility .\n\n【73】Education and training result in capable and competent end‐users of any technology. This can be costly and time consuming, but enhances the chance of effective implementation of such systems and thus should be a priority. As well as the requirement for initial training, ongoing support is usually necessary to ensure continuing use and further development . As indicated earlier, clinicians more recently qualified have been shown to feel comfortable using the internet and email technologies . This may influence training needs and the types of demographic groups leading the use of this technology.\n\n【74】These issues are wide ranging and encompass both healthcare professional and patient perspectives. All issues of quality and safety arising will be identified and addressed in the review.\n\n【75】Objectives\n----------\n\n【76】To assess the effects of using email for the management of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders, on outcomes for health professionals, patients and carers, and health services, including harms.\n\n【77】Methods\n-------\n\n【78】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【79】#### Types of studies\n\n【80】Four protocols on the use of mobile phone messaging as a communication method in healthcare were published in 2008 .We will draw on key methodological aspects of these protocols to aid comparison of the effects of email as a new communication technology; this affects the selection criteria for types of studies, participants and interventions.\n\n【81】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised trials, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) with at least two intervention and two control sites, and interrupted time series (ITS) with at least three time points before and after intervention.\n\n【82】Due to the practicalities of organisational change in a healthcare environment, most studies are not randomised and therefore we will consider quasi‐randomised trials and CBAs. The inclusion of ITS is particularly valuable in assessing the ongoing merits of a new technology which may required a 'settling in' period. We will include trials with individual and cluster randomisation. Relevant trials with economic evaluations will also be evaluated.\n\n【83】#### Types of participants\n\n【84】We will consider all healthcare professionals, associated adminstrative staff, patients and caregivers regardless of age, gender and ethnicity. We will include studies in all settings i.e. primary care settings (services of primary health care), outpatients settings (outpatient clinics), community settings and hospital settings. We will not exclude studies according to the type of healthcare professional (e.g. surgeon, nurse, doctor, allied staff).\n\n【85】We will consider participants originating the email communication, receiving the email communication and copied into the email communication.\n\n【86】#### Types of interventions\n\n【87】We will assess the effects of email used for the management of patient healthcare appointments and attendance reminders. We will include interventions that use email for scheduling health appointments, for reminders for a scheduled health appointment and for ongoing management of health appointments.\n\n【88】We will include interventions that use email in any of the following three forms:\n\n【89】1.  Unsecured standard email to/from a standard email account.\n\n【90】2.  Secure email which is encrypted in transit and sent to/from a standard email account with the appropriate encryption decoding software.\n\n【91】3.  Web messaging; whereby the message is entered into a pro‐forma which is sent to a specific email account, the address of which is not available to the sender.\n\n【92】All methods of connection will be considered. Methods of accessing email include broadband via a fixed line, broadband via a wireless connection, connecting to the 3G network and connecting to the WAP network.\n\n【93】Studies in which email is part of a multifaceted intervention will be included where the effects are individually reported, even if they do not represent the primary outcome. However these will only be considered where they achieve the appropriate statistical power. Where this cannot be determined or where it is not possible to separate the effects they will not be included.\n\n【94】We will exclude studies in which invitations for routine preventive screening (such as cervical screening) are administered, or for appointments related solely to preventive healthcare. Invitations for such screening and health promotion activities, and any associated reminders and management, will be considered in the parallel review Atherton 2009a . However, where an appointment concerns both preventive and routine healthcare, studies may be included in both reviews where relevant.\n\n【95】We will exclude studies which consider the general use of email for healthcare professional‐patient contact, i.e. for multiple purposes where management of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders are included but not separately considered.\n\n【96】Included studies could compare email communication with no intervention, as well as with other modes of communication such as face‐to‐face, postal letters, calls to a landline or mobile telephone, text messaging using a mobile telephone, and if applicable, automated versus personal emails.\n\n【97】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【98】A number of processes and outcomes may be affected by interventions that aim to enhance and/or facilitate the use of email for the management of healthcare appointments and attendance reminders.\n\n【99】Primary outcomes of interest are whether the email has been understood and acted upon correctly by the recipient as intended by the sender, and secondary outcomes are whether email was an appropriate mode of communication.\n\n【100】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【101】_Patient_ outcomes associated with whether email has been understood and acted upon correctly by the recipient as intended by the sender, e.g. patient understanding, patient health status and well‐being, and patient behaviours or actions.\n\n【102】_Health service_ outcomes associated with whether email has been understood and acted upon correctly by the recipient as intended by the sender, e.g. appointments made, attendance rates.\n\n【103】_Harms_ e.g. effects on safety or quality of care such as missed diagnoses, breaches in privacy, technology failures.\n\n【104】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【105】_Professional, patient or carer_ outcomes associated with whether email was an appropriate mode of communication, e.g. knowledge and understanding, effects on professional‐patient or professional‐carer communication or relationship, evaluations of care (convenience, timeliness, acceptability, satisfaction).\n\n【106】_Health service_ outcomes associated with whether email was an appropriate mode of communication, e.g. use of resources or time, costs, use of medical services, referrals, admissions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the benefit and harms of different treatment modalities for the management of Paget's disease of the vulva.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Extra‐mammary Paget’s disease is a rare neoplastic disorder of the skin. The most common site of involvement is the vulva. It is seen mainly in postmenopausal Caucasian women. Paget’s disease of the vulva often spreads in an occult fashion, with margins extending beyond the apparent edges of the lesion. It is characterised by infiltration of the squamous mucosa or adenexa by mucin‐producing neoplastic cells. It is an intraepithelial adenocarcinoma that presents as white and red scaly plaques on the vulva which may be itchy and painful. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Paget’s disease can be associated with an underlying adnexal tumour or a contiguous adenocarcinoma of an adjacent organ. Sometimes there may be a more distant tumour. Searching for distant tumours is controversial because the association is uncommon, and any screening may involve lengthy and invasive investigations, and also delaying appropriate treatment of the Paget’s disease itself  A clinicopathological study  in 1977 reported a total of 13 cases of Paget’s disease of the vulva: four (31%) of the patients had underlying invasive carcinoma of the adnexal structures and three (23%) had adnexal carcinoma in situ. In four (31%) a second malignancy was found . A more recent case series  reviewed 10 women with vulval Paget's disease. 34% of patients recurred, at a median time interval of three years, with 12% having invasive Paget's disease of the vulva and 4% had a vulval adenocarcinoma.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Surgery can involve local excision, radical excision or vulvectomy. Margins often extend outside the clinically abnormal area, so some studies suggest frozen section or pre‐operative mapping biopsies to delineate the margins of excision. Other interventions include topical medication such as imiquimod, radiotherapy, chemotherapy photodynamic therapy and  laser therapy; or a combination of these approaches. The challenges of interventions are to remove or treat disease that may not be visible, without over treatment and with minimisation of morbidity from radical surgery.\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】Surgery removes the abnormal area. Disease tends to be multifocal, and complete eradication is not guaranteed. Surgical excision can also cause significant vulval mutilation, with consequent psychological morbidity . Photodynamic therapy works by the exposure of sensitised cells to a specific wavelength of light activates a cascade of photochemical and photobiological events causing irreversible damage to tumour tissue . Radiation therapy destroys tissues by DNA damage, affecting normal as well as abnormal tissues. Chemotherapy has been used alone or in conjunction with radiotherapy. Topical imiquimod, usually a 5% cream, is an immune response modifier that induces high levels of interferon, although the complete mechanism of action is complex, and not fully understood..\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】Paget's disease is a rare condition, and there is little consensus regarding treatment. Surgery, by default is the most common treatment, but it is challenging to adequately excise the disease, and recurrence is common, leading to repeated operations, and destruction of anatomy. Alternative treatments of photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, topical treatments or even chemotherapy have been mooted, and we feel it is important to highlight the available evidence.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To evaluate the benefit and harms of different treatment modalities for the management of Paget's disease of the vulva.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】The types of studies we would wish to include would be Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs).

There are no exclusion criteria in this group.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】We would like to search all interventions used in Paget's disease. The mainstay of treatment is surgery which is either conservative or radical.\n\n【29】Other interventions that are used include radiotherapy, topical treatments including steroids, photodynamic therapy, imiquimod and any intralesional therapy, systemic treatments including chemotherapeutic agents, and any treatment combinations. Comparisons of any two treatment modalities will be considered.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】Outcome measures are not being used as part of the selection criteria.\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】*   Overall survival. Survival will be assessed from the time when women are enrolled in the study.\n\n【34】*   Disease free survival.

These symptoms increase in frequency and intensity with progression of the disease). Speech and language therapy (SLT) aims to improve the intelligibility of speech with behavioural treatment techniques or instrumental aids.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the efficacy of speech and language therapy versus placebo or no intervention for speech and voice problems in patients with Parkinson's disease.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of numerous literature databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL, as well as handsearching of relevant conference abstracts and examination of reference lists in identified studies and other reviews. The literature search included trials published prior to 11 <sup>th </sup> April 2011.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) of speech and language therapy versus placebo or no intervention were included.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were abstracted independently by CH and CT and differences settled by discussion.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 63 participants were found comparing SLT with placebo for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Data were available from 41 participants in two trials. Vocal loudness for reading a passage increased by 6.3 dB (P = 0.0007) in one trial, and 11.0 dB (P = 0.0002) in another trial. An increase was also seen in both of these trials for monologue speaking of 5.4 dB (P = 0.002) and 11.0 dB (P = 0.0002), respectively. It is likely that these areclinically significant improvements. After six months, patients from the first trial were still showing a statistically significant increase of 4.5 dB (P = 0.0007) for reading and 3.5 dB for monologue speaking. Some measures of speech monotonicity and articulation were investigated; however, all these results were non‐significant.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Although improvements in speech impairments were noted in these studies, due to the small number of patients examined, methodological flaws, and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively support or refute the efficacy of SLT for speech problems in Parkinson's disease. A large well designed placebo‐controlled RCT is needed to demonstrate SLT's effectiveness in Parkinson's disease. The trial should conform to CONSORT guidelines. Outcome measures with particular relevance to patients with Parkinson’s disease should be chosen and patients followed for at least six months to determine the duration of any improvement.\n\n【14】### Speech and language therapy for speech problems in Parkinson's disease\n\n【15】Many people with Parkinson's disease suffer from disorders of speech. The most frequently reported speech problems are weak, hoarse, nasal or monotonous voice, imprecise articulation, slow or fast speech, difficulty starting speech, impaired stress or rhythm, stuttering and tremor. People with the condition also tend to give fewer non‐verbal cues, such as facial expressions and hand gestures. These disabilities tend to increase as the disease progresses and can lead to serious problems with communication.\n\n【16】This review compared the benefits of speech and language therapy versus placebo (sham therapy) or no treatment for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of 16 medical literature databases, various registers of clinical trials and an examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews.\n\n【17】Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. These were studies where two groups of patients were compared, one group had speech and language therapy, the other did not receive any therapy intended to improve speech. The patients were assigned to each of the groups in a random fashion so as to reduce the potential for bias.\n\n【18】Three trials with a total of 63 patients were found comparing speech and language therapy with an untreated group. The quality of the methods used in these trials was variable, with all studies failing in at least one critical area. All three of the controlled trials reported a positive effect of speech and language therapy for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Many of the outcome measures examined appeared to improve by a clinically significant amount after therapy. However, it should be noted that there were flaws in the methods used in these studies and only a small number of patients with Parkinson’s disease were examined. This means that there is insufficient evidence to absolutely prove or disprove the benefit of speech and language therapy for the treatment of speech disorders in Parkinson's disease patients, but lack of evidence does not mean lack of effect.\n\n【19】A large well designed placebo‐controlled randomised trial is needed to assess the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for speech disorders in Parkinson's disease. Outcome measures with particular relevance to people with Parkinson’s disease should be chosen and the patients followed for at least six months to determine the duration of any improvement.\n\n【20】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

An exogenous, inhaled form (iNO) exists that mimics this action without affecting systemic blood pressure. This therapy has been implemented in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. This review examines the efficacy of iNO in the postoperative management of infants and children with congenital heart disease (CHD).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the effects of postoperative iNO versus placebo or conventional management , or both, on infants and children with CHD. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay; neurodevelopmental disability; number of pulmonary hypertensive crises (PHTC); changes in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR); changes in oxygenation measured as the ratio of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2); and measurement of maximum methaemoglobin level as a marker of toxicity.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We originally searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2004 _,_ Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), and EMBASE (1980 to 2004). In this updated version we extended the CENTRAL search to 2007, Issue 4 of _The Cochrane Library_ , and MEDLINE and EMBASE through to November 1, 2007. We included abstracts and all languages.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing iNO with placebo or conventional management, or both. Trials included only children with CHD requiring surgery complicated by pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were collected on mortality; number of PHTC; changes in MPAP, MAP, HR, and PaO <sub>2 </sub> :FiO <sub>2 </sub> ; and maximum methaemoglobin level. Data on long‐term mortality, neurodevelopmental disability, and length of hospital stay were unavailable. We performed subgroup analysis by method of control (placebo or conventional management).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included four randomized trials and observed no differences in mortality (P = 0.50); PHTC (P = 0.79); changes in MPAP (P = 0.36), MAP (P = 0.40), HR (P = 1.00), or PaO <sub>2 </sub> :FiO <sub>2 </sub> (P = 0.46). There was a significant increase in the methaemoglobin level  in patients treated with iNO, although levels did not reach toxicity.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】We observed no differences with the use of iNO in the outcomes reviewed. No data were available for several clinical outcomes including long‐term mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome. We found it difficult to draw valid conclusions given concerns regarding methodologic quality, sample size, and heterogeneity.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Congenital Heart Disease\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Pulmonary Hypertension\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Nitric Oxide\n*   Inhaled\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n*   Nitrogen gas\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Death\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Inhaled nitric oxide for the management of pulmonary hypertension after surgery in infants and children with congenital heart disease\n\n【24】Although inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been studied as a postsurgical therapy in children with heart disease to assist recovery, this review showed no benefits with its use.  \nElevated pulmonary arterial pressure, or pulmonary hypertension, can affect various patient populations and cause significant morbidity and mortality. In particular, infants and children with congenital heart disease necessitating surgical repair can develop life‐threatening pulmonary hypertensive crises in the postoperative period. Inhaled nitric oxide is a therapy which causes a selective reduction in pulmonary arterial pressures and, therefore, may have a treatment benefit in this population. This review examined the results of four randomised controlled trials comparing iNO with placebo or conventional management in the postoperative treatment of infants and children with congenital heart disease. No clinical benefits were apparent with the use of iNO. In addition, no significant alterations in haemodynamics were observed comparing treatment and control groups.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999, and previously updated in 2004.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the effects of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of acute ankle sprains.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2010), EMBASE (1983 to September 2010), CINAHL (1982 to 2004), and PEDro ‐ the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (accessed 01/06/09). We also searched the Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field database, reference lists of articles, and contacted colleagues.The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was searched for ongoing trials.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials were included if the following conditions were met: at least one study group was treated with therapeutic ultrasound; participants had acute lateral ankle sprains; and outcome measures included general improvement, pain, swelling, functional disability, or range of motion.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently performed study selection, and assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Risk ratios and risk differences together with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences together with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcome measures. Limited pooling of data was undertaken where there was clinical homogeneity in terms of participants, treatments, outcomes, and follow‐up time points.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Six trials were included, involving 606 participants. Five trials included comparisons of ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound; and three trials included single comparisons of ultrasound with three other treatments. The assessment of risk of bias was hampered by poor reporting of trial methods and results. None of the five placebo‐controlled trials (sham ultrasound) demonstrated statistically significant differences between true and sham ultrasound therapy for any outcome measure at one to four weeks of follow‐up. The pooled risk ratio for general improvement at one week was 1.04 (random‐effects model, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.17) for active versus sham ultrasound. The differences between intervention groups were generally small, between zero and six per cent, for most dichotomous outcomes.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The evidence from the five small placebo‐controlled trials included in this review does not support the use of ultrasound in the treatment of acute ankle sprains. The potential treatment effects of ultrasound appear to be generally small and of probably of limited clinical importance, especially in the context of the usually short‐term recovery period for these injuries. However, the available evidence is insufficient to rule out the possibility that there is an optimal dosage schedule for ultrasound therapy that may be of benefit.\n\n【14】### Therapeutic ultrasound for acute ankle sprains\n\n【15】Ultrasound, or the use of high frequency sound pulses, is used for treating acute ankle sprains. It is thought that the increase in temperature caused by ultrasound helps soft tissue healing. The review aimed to look at the evidence from studies testing the use of ultrasound in clinical practice. Six trials were included in the review. Poor reporting of trial methods made it difficult to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The six trials involved a total of 606 participants with acute ankle sprains of relatively short duration. Five trials compared ultrasound therapy with sham ultrasound (machine turned off). Three of the six trials included single comparisons of ultrasound with three other treatments. The main results were from the review of the five placebo‐controlled trials (sham ultrasound). These found that ultrasound therapy does not seem to enhance recovery or help to reduce pain and swelling after an ankle sprain, or improve the ability to stand on the affected foot and ankle. Most ankle sprains heal quickly. While ultrasound may still improve recovery in a small way, this potential benefit is probably too small to be important.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A previous Cochrane Review  has shown that antibiotics provide only modest benefit when prescribed for the condition \"sore throat\". The effect of antibiotic treatment was increased in patients with positive throat swabs for group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci. The streptococci‐positive patients are only a small proportion of all patients with \"sore throat\". Nevertheless, in many countries antibiotics are prescribed for most people who have a \"sore throat\" . Given the over consumption of antibiotics for this condition a rational approach would be to reserve a treatment with antibiotics for patients with proven presence or a high likelihood of group A streptococci .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】If treatment with antibiotics is the preferred option, the physician needs to choose which antibiotic to prescribe. Many guidelines recommend the use of penicillin as first choice, with erythromycin preferred for penicillin‐allergic patients . The resistance to or tolerance of penicillin and erythromycin‐resistance rates are still low . Considering the growing problem of antibiotic‐resistance for other microbes, the responsiveness of group A streptococci should not be endangered . Penicillin and erythromycin are cheap and thus the most cost‐effective option. In spite of this physicians continue to prescribe broad‐spectrum antibiotics, including recently marketed ones. It is not clear if these antibiotics have any substantial clinical benefit over penicillin (and erythromycin). If there is insufficient evidence for advantages of other antibiotics over penicillin the guideline recommendations can be supported with the highest level of evidence from a meta‐analysis.\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】Many physicians argue that occurrence of penicillin‐allergy should be taken into account when making a choice for an antibiotic. This review will therefore also look for evidence of penicillin‐allergy in the available trials.  \nIn order to provide health care providers with sufficient information to make an evidence‐based choice, both treatment benefits and adverse events are compared.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】The objectives of this review concerning patients (adults and children) with a pharyngitis caused by group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci are:\n\n【15】1.  to assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis).\n\n【16】2.  to assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and hence the risk‐benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Randomised, double‐blind, controlled trials comparing at least two different (classes of) antibiotics.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat and with an infection caused by group A beta‐haemolytic streptococci confirmed by a throat culture and/or rapid test.

Multiple factors play a role in the type and severity of trauma experienced, including parity, delivery method, and local practices. There is ongoing debate about best midwifery practice to reduce perineal trauma. Once perineal trauma has occurred, treatment also varies greatly, depending on its degree and severity, local practice and customs, and personal preference. In order to optimise wound‐healing outcomes, it is important that wounds are assessed and managed in an appropriate and timely manner. A perineal wound may cause significant physical and/or psychological impact in the short or long term, however little evidence is available on this subject.\n\n【2】Antenatal education serves to prepare women and their partners for pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period. The delivery of this education varies widely in type, content, and nature. This review examined antenatal education which is specifically tailored towards perineal care and wound healing in the postnatal period via formal channels. Appropriate patient education positively impacts on wound‐healing rates and compliance with wound care. Risk factors that contribute to the breakdown of wounds and poor healing rates may be addressed antenatally in order to optimise postnatal wound healing. It is important to assess whether or not antenatal wound‐care education positively affects perineal healing, in order to empower women to incorporate best practice, evidence‐based treatment with this important aspect of self‐care in the immediate postnatal period.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To evaluate the effects of antenatal education on perineal wound healing in postnatal women who have birthed in a hospital setting, and who have experienced a break in the skin of the perineum as a result of a tear or episiotomy, or both.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (8th September 2017), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (8th September 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which referred to all formal methods of antenatal education and addressed care of a potential perineal wound as a result of a tear or episiotomy, which was experienced by pregnant women who planned to give birth within a hospital setting.\n\n【9】Trials using a cluster‐RCT and a quasi‐randomised design would have been eligible for inclusion in this review but none were identified. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Studies published in abstract form would have been eligible for inclusion in this review, but none were identified.\n\n【10】We planned to consider all formal methods of antenatal education which addressed care of a perineal wound. We also planned to consider all contact points where there was an opportunity for formal education, including midwifery appointments, antenatal education classes, obstetrician appointments, general practitioner appointments and physiotherapist appointments.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts of the studies identified by the search strategy for their eligibility.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. We excluded one study and one other study is ongoing.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】We set out to evaluate the RCT evidence pertaining to the impact of antenatal education on perineal wound healing in postnatal women who have birthed in a hospital setting, and who experienced a break in the skin of the perineum as a result of a tear or episiotomy, or both. However, no studies met the inclusion criteria. There is a lack of evidence concerning whether or not antenatal education relating to perineal wound healing in this cohort of women will change the outcome for these women in relation to wound healing, infection rate, re‐attendance or re‐admission to hospital, pain, health‐related quality of life, maternal bonding, and negative emotional experiences. Further study is warranted in this area given the significant physical, psychological and economic impact of perineal wounds, and the large proportion of childbearing women who have experienced a postnatal wound. The benefits of any future research in this field would be maximised by incorporating women in a range of socio‐economic groups, and with a range of healthcare options. This research could take both a qualitative and a quantitative approach and examine the outcomes identified in this review in order to assess fully the potential benefits of a tailored antenatal package, and to make recommendations for future practice. There is currently no evidence to inform practice in this regard.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Episiotomy\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Second Degree Perineal Tear During Delivery - Delivered\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Antenatal Education\n*   Hospital\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Antenatal Education\n*   Hospital\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Wound Healing\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【26】### The impact of antenatal education on wound‐healing rates for women who have given birth in a hospital\n\n【27】**What is the issue?**\n\n【28】In hospitals, a large majority of women who give birth vaginally suffer from an injury to their perineum, the area of skin and muscle between the anus and the vagina. This injury may be bruising or tearing, or occur as a result of a deliberate cut to assist with childbirth. As women are often discharged from hospital very shortly after childbirth, they may be left to care for this wound themselves, without healthcare supervision. The type and extent of the injury varies, as does the treatment for these wounds. They might have stitches, need cold packs and analgesics or anti‐inflammatories for pain relief; or salt baths, wound packing, and antibiotics to help with healing. Many women are not warned of the likelihood or prepared for a perineal wound. They do not know how to manage and care for the wound. This may result in complications such as increased pain and discomfort, distress, risk of infection, and difficulty with urination and having sexual intercourse. This review aimed to examine whether providing education to women before childbirth, about the expectation and management of a perineal wound, made a difference to wound healing after childbirth.\n\n【29】**Why is this important?**\n\n【30】Perineal wounds that do not heal well impact poorly on women's health, on the relationship between the mother and her baby, and on family relationships. Healthcare professionals are in the unique position of being able to provide up‐to‐date and accurate advice, and can play a key role in educating women in this important aspect of their personal care. Appropriate formal education provided before childbirth might lessen the shock and distress associated with a perineal wound, and empower the mother to manage the treatment of the wound, thereby reducing the risk of complications. This review aimed to examine whether providing education to women before childbirth, either as part of antenatal education or during visits to their healthcare provider, made a difference to wound healing after childbirth.\n\n【31】**What evidence did we find?**\n\n【32】We searched for evidence in September 2017 but did not find any randomised controlled studies relating to our area of interest. We excluded one study and one other study is not yet complete.\n\n【33】**What does this mean?**\n\n【34】We cannot say whether or not antenatal education has an effect on perineal wound healing after childbirth among women who have birthed in a hospital setting. We do not know from randomised controlled trials what the benefits and harms of this education might be. More research is this area is needed to determine the impact of education delivered before childbirth on perineal wound healing in women who have birthed in a hospital setting. Trials may also examine the outcome on related issues including infection rate, re‐attendance or re‐admission to hospital, pain, health‐related quality of life, maternal bonding, and negative emotional experiences relating to a perineal wound. A large proportion of childbearing women experience a perineal wound in childbirth, and these wounds are known to have a significant physical, psychological and economic impact. Future research could examine the potential benefits of a tailor‐made education package to be delivered to this cohort of women, as there is currently no evidence to support this.\n\n【35】--------------\n\n【36】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【37】### Implications for practice\n\n【38】There is, as yet, no data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of antenatal education on perineal wound healing in postnatal women who have birthed in a hospital setting, and who have experienced a break in the skin of the perineum as a result of a tear or episiotomy, or both.\n\n【39】### Implications for research\n\n【40】Perineal wounds are common in childbirth and can cause prolonged negative physical and psychological side‐effects. The effective and timely management of wounds can contribute to a positive healing experience, and a reduction in co‐morbidities. There may also be a reduction in associated healthcare costs resulting from physical, social and emotional needs. We did not identify any trials exploring the impact that antenatal education has on postnatal perineal wound healing. Further research is therefore justified in this area due to the large proportion of childbearing women who have experienced a postnatal wound, and its associated negative impact. Appropriate antenatal education empowers women to make positive choices based on best‐practice guidelines and may contribute to an overall better quality of life.\n\n【41】The benefits of future research in this area would be maximised by conducting large enough trials to incorporate women in a range of socio‐economic groups, and with a range of healthcare options. The research could examine both qualitative and quantitative outcomes of a tailor‐made antenatal care education package relating to perineal wounds.\n\n【42】Background\n----------\n\n【43】The female perineum is the area of tissue stretching from the anus to the fourchette of the vulva . In pregnancy, this area becomes suffused due to pressure exerted from the growing uterus and the increased blood flow to the region . During childbirth, the perineum is stretched, and may experience trauma through bruising, grazing, tearing, or arising as a result of a deliberate incision (episiotomy). Perineal wounds are commonly experienced during vaginal childbirth. It is claimed that 85% of women experience perineal trauma, with at least one third of women experiencing a spontaneous tear .\n\n【44】Perineal tears usually extend through the weakest part of the stretched perineum . The type and extent of perineal trauma experienced varies due to a number of factors, including delivery method and speed of childbirth, parity, fetal size and position , geographical location of the birth, and cultural and local practices. One UK study found that there was a higher incidence of perineal trauma during delivery within a hospital setting compared to delivery within a community care setting . Studies have also shown that continuous support in labour lessens the rate for assisted vaginal births, which subsequently lowers the rate of perineal trauma . There is some argument that women feel more comfortable and supported when labouring in a non‐medical setting, and that this accounts, in part, for the lower rate of perineal trauma outside the hospital environment .\n\n【45】### Description of the condition\n\n【46】Perineal trauma can be defined as being anterior or posterior. Anterior perineal trauma includes any injury to the labia, clitoris, anterior vagina or vulva, while posterior perineal trauma includes any injury to the posterior vaginal wall, perineal muscles, and anal sphincters . Posterior perineal trauma is classed on a gradient system which includes bruising, first‐degree lacerations, second‐degree lacerations, third‐degree lacerations, and fourth‐degree lacerations . Rates of perineal trauma are particularly high in women during a first vaginal birth , with multiparous women (having birthed more than one child) being approximately three times more likely to have an intact perineum (31.2%) when compared to nulliparous women (9.6%) . Perineal trauma is a big feature in vaginal childbirth with only 20.5% of women (nulliparous and multiparous combined) who birthed a baby vaginally in the New South Wales area of Australia in 2014 having an intact perineum postnatally .\n\n【47】A first‐degree laceration is one or more superficial lacerations involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue and/or vaginal mucosa. A second‐degree laceration may involve the superficial perineal muscles, the perineal body, and/or the deep perineal muscles . A second‐degree laceration can be further subcategorised into either an episiotomy (deliberate cut) or a natural tear. A third‐degree laceration is an extension of a second‐degree laceration through the perineal muscles into the anal sphincters. This may be subdivided into 3a (up to 50% of external anal sphincter torn), 3b (more than 50% of external anal sphincter torn), and 3c (external anal sphincter completely torn and internal anal sphincter also torn) . A fourth‐degree laceration involves the anorectal epithelium . In first world countries, second‐, third‐, and fourth‐degree tears are commonly closed using stitches.\n\n【48】Interventions applied in some areas of the world to attempt to reduce perineal trauma include warm compresses and perineal massage , and a hands‐on approach during delivery of the head . Women who had not birthed a baby vaginally before who performed digital perineal massage during the final four weeks of pregnancy experienced a reduction in perineal trauma requiring suturing , however, the authors note that other factors may also be involved in the reduction of perineal trauma and the evidence for this practice is not strong enough to recommend it universally. There is ongoing debate about best practice for midwives with regard to perineal care and the prevention of perineal trauma. The UK 'HOOP' trial in 1998 showed that women who gave birth using the 'hands on' method of delivery reported significantly lower levels of pain 10 days post delivery at 31.1% when compared to the 'hands poised' group who showed pain levels at 34.1% 10 days post delivery . Those in the 'hands poised' group had a significantly lower rate of episiotomy, but a significantly higher rate of manual removal of placenta .\n\n【49】Perineal trauma rates and types also vary depending on geographical location and local practice. In one hospital setting in Ireland, 18.05% of women who birthed a baby vaginally in 2014 had an episiotomy or extended episiotomy, 79.6% of which occurred in nulliparous women . In the same 12‐month period, 7.84% of women birthing a baby vaginally had a first‐degree tear, 21.08% had a second‐degree tear, 1.83% had a third‐degree tear, 0.06% had a fourth‐degree tear, and 8.24% had grazes or lacerations which were deemed not to require suturing. Indeed, of the 8665 nulliparous and multiparous women who birthed a baby vaginally in the hospital in 2014, 57.1% had a postnatal perineal wound .\n\n【50】In 2012 in the New South Wales area of Australia, of the 67,565 women who had given birth vaginally, 18.4% of women had an episiotomy or extended episiotomy; 29.1% of women experienced a first‐degree tear or graze, 27% experienced a second‐degree tear, and 2% experienced a third‐ or fourth‐degree tear . A 2005 US study found an overall rate of perineal trauma of 85% including episiotomies, perineal lacerations, and all degrees of perineal tears .\n\n【51】A cross‐sectional study in rural India carried out between 2004 and 2005 examined episiotomy rates in 442 vaginal births . Significant differences were found in the rates between private birth places (80.6%) and public birth places (64.7%), and between doctor‐led deliveries (77.4%), nurse‐led deliveries (53.1%) and trained birth attendant deliveries (5%). Essentially, the study concluded that the episiotomy rate increased with a corresponding increase in the standard of living. The rate decreased with parity (the number of times a woman has given birth to a fetus with a gestational age of 24 weeks or more), with a rate of 83.4% in primigravidas (pregnant for the first time), down to 30.8% in women experiencing a third or subsequent vaginal birth . This study also showed an increase in postnatal complications among women with episiotomies, the most common reported being perineal pain and wound infections, with 14.5% of women with episiotomies experiencing complications compared to 4.8% in women who did not have episiotomies .\n\n【52】Episiotomy rate can also change within a geographical area in response to changing practice and customs. For example, in England the rate of episiotomy fell from 51% in 1975 to 15% between 2010 and 2011 . There is some evidence to suggest that women of Asian ethnicity are at a higher risk of developing perineal complications from vaginal childbirth . This has been reinforced by a subsequent Norwegian study examining obstetric outcomes among immigrants and found that even in a low‐risk maternity unit, women of African and South Western Asian descent suffered higher rates of complications, thus suggesting more targeted antenatal and perinatal care and education . There has also been some conflicting evidence in the literature as to the type of episiotomy best performed with measured angles often significantly smaller than expected. There is a 50% relative risk reduction in third‐degree tears for every six degrees away from the perineal midline, and therefore it is advocated to create as large an angle as possible in a medio‐lateral incision .\n\n【53】Treatment for perineal trauma includes, but is not limited to, one or a combination of the following ‐ primary treatment such as sutures (stitches) in the immediate postnatal period, cold pack application, and analgesics and anti‐inflammatories for pain relief; and secondary treatment such as salt baths, wound packing to allow wounds to heal by secondary intention, pelvic floor exercises, and antibiotics . The choice of treatment used depends on the nature and severity of the trauma, and again, is often influenced by local practice and customs, and on the training and experiences of the person who is recommending the treatment. It is important that wounds are assessed and managed appropriately in order to optimise wound‐healing outcomes. Furthermore, there are well‐documented modifiable factors that contribute to the breakdown of wounds and poor healing rates, including obesity, malnutrition and poor hygiene . These risk factors are of significance in postnatal women and can potentially be positively influenced with education delivered to the pregnant woman before childbirth. When perineal wound healing is delayed, the associated economic costs can be considerable, including increased GP visits and hospital admissions, and increased use of antibiotics and analgesics .\n\n【54】There is also a significant physical and psychological impact on those affected by these perineal wounds. Short‐term problems include haemorrhage, the need for suturing, and pain , as well as incontinence, and sexual morbidity . These morbidities are further increased with a delay in wound healing and subsequent delay in the return of normal perineal function. Longer‐term problems may include continued perineal pain, which 22% of women in one study group experienced at eight weeks postnatal . Between 7% and 9% of women reported perineal pain at three months postpartum , and up to 40% of women in another study group reported dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse) at three months postpartum . Weakened pelvic floor muscles contribute to longer‐term effects on bowel, urinary and sexual function . Perineal trauma can lead to faecal incontinence, dyspareunia and urinary problems .\n\n【55】### Description of the intervention\n\n【56】The antenatal period is defined as the period of time in which a woman is pregnant ‐ typically 37 to 42 weeks in duration. The woman may seek antenatal care throughout this period, which in developed countries may include visits with a healthcare professional, including a doctor or midwife, in order to monitor the pregnancy itself, and to receive antenatal education . Women's education is the process whereby health professionals impact knowledge to a woman with the aim of improving their health behaviours or health condition .\n\n【57】Antenatal education was traditionally delivered in a group setting, focusing on labour and childbirth, with the primary aim to prepare women to safely birth a baby . Over time, this concept has shifted gradually to include more health promotion and the development of life skills in order to enable people to adopt better health practices , the enhancement of the birth experiences for mother and partner, while also improving antenatal and postnatal maternal and fetal well‐being , and the reduction in perinatal mortality and morbidity . One such morbidity sustained in childbirth is a perineal wound. Midwives and antenatal education providers have a key role to play in maternal education to prepare the mother for childbirth and also for perineal care after childbirth.\n\n【58】The education provided during the antenatal period ranges widely in type of delivery and content , and may include some or all of the following, among others: structured antenatal classes in a group or individual setting, written educational information, formal or informal advice and information from websites, publications or social media, and social contact with family or friends. As it comes from a wide variety of sources, the content varies hugely in its reliability and robustness . There is little evidence available on the effect of this education shift on clinical outcomes .\n\n【59】Appropriate education is of importance with regard to wound care, as this has the potential to minimise factors that delay wound healing, and to enhance health promotion opportunities. Indeed, evidence suggests that appropriate patient education positively impacts on wound‐healing rates and compliance with wound care . However, there tends to be a large variation in the practices used for perineal care, some of which may not be beneficial to promoting optimum wound healing . As women are often discharged from maternity hospitals within a few days of delivery, they are largely tending to their perineal care themselves, and varying degrees of problems are experienced, including dehiscence, infection, pain, interference with maternal bonding, and depression . In worse‐case scenarios, some women will need to be readmitted to hospital for further treatment or repair. The secondary effects arising from these difficulties in perineal repair may last for several months or even years .\n\n【60】The intervention to be examined in this review is antenatal education which is specifically tailored towards perineal care and wound healing in the postnatal period. For the purpose of this review, the delivery of this information via formal antenatal education classes will be included as well as that delivered during contacts with a qualified healthcare professional (including doctors and midwives). Information given informally via web sites, social media, social contact and informal publications will be excluded.\n\n【61】### How the intervention might work\n\n【62】The intervention will theoretically be aimed at explaining to women what a perineal injury involves, and that they may sustain such an injury during childbirth. Perineal trauma sustained during childbirth can have a significant detrimental effect on maternal physical and psychological well‐being postnatally . Studies have shown that psychological distress can cause a substantial delay in wound healing, both through physiological processes and as stressed individuals are more likely to display unhealthy habits, including erratic sleep patterns and poor nutrition . It is also established that postnatally, women focus their lives on their baby rather than themselves , which will also affect their lifestyle, sleep patterns and nutrition, and so it is imperative that information and advice delivered be concise and easy to follow.\n\n【63】There is currently a lack of evidence in the literature demonstrating that having prior knowledge of the possibility of a postnatal perineal wound may decrease the negative emotional impact of such a wound for the woman on her quality of life, however studies have shown that increased education related to wound care in general can significantly increase compliance with the suggested intervention . It is hoped that by introducing this intervention and by explaining the importance and implications of effective self‐care, women may adhere more strictly to best‐practice guidelines with regard to perineal wound care.\n\n【64】The intervention will also provide instructions on how to care for the perineum in order to maximise recovery and minimise the negative physical, psychological, social and economic effects of the injury itself, including pain, infection, hospital readmission, GP re‐attendance, antibiotic usage, fatigue, dyspareunia, delayed maternal/child bonding, and embarrassment.\n\n【65】There is conclusive research carried out on the prevention of perineal injury in a primigravida through perineal massage among other methods . The intervention of interest to this review will not include information given antenatally about potentially lessening or preventing a perineal wound, rather this review will purely focus on information given in the antenatal period relating to caring for a perineal wound after the event. Health promotion strategies have been shown to be effective in the management of chronic disease , however little is known about their effect on perineal care post childbirth.\n\n【66】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【67】Perineal trauma is a factor in a large number of vaginal births worldwide, which, if not cared for correctly, can contribute to prolonged negative experiences in the postnatal period . Short‐term problems can include haemorrhage, the need for suturing and associated complications, and pain . Longer‐term problems may include dyspareunia, pain, depression, and interference with maternal bonding .\n\n【68】Evidence from research in the area of chronic venous ulceration management suggests that appropriate patient education positively impacts on wound‐healing rates and compliance with wound care, with some recent seminal papers demonstrating the importance of patient education and self‐management in both primary and secondary prevention of this disease, with an impact on recurrences, quality of life and hospitalisation . It is important to assess if the same may be true for antenatal wound‐care education and perineal healing, in order to empower the women to incorporate best practice, evidence‐based treatment with this important aspect of self‐care in the immediate postnatal period. Healthcare professionals delivering antenatal care to women can play a key role in teaching the women about perineal care after childbirth.\n\n【69】Varying degrees of problems are experienced with regard to perineal wounds, which may result in women needing to be readmitted to hospital for further treatment or repair. The secondary effects of these difficulties may last for several months or even years, however, very little is known on this subject. The impact of antenatal maternal education on postnatal perineal healing rates in women who birthed within a hospital setting has not yet been evaluated in a systematic way, and it is important to evaluate this in order to inform policy and practice. This, therefore, was the leading motivation behind this review.\n\n【70】Objectives\n----------\n\n【71】To evaluate the effects of antenatal education on perineal wound healing in postnatal women who have birthed in a hospital setting, and who have experienced a break in the skin of the perineum as a result of a tear or episiotomy or both.\n\n【72】Methods\n-------\n\n【73】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【74】#### Types of studies\n\n【75】We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including those using a cluster‐randomised design and quasi‐randomised design.

It is not known whether the method of skin closure influences the infection rate.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the rates of SSI and wound dehiscence of staples and sutures for skin closure after saphenous vein graft harvesting for CABG.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】For this first update we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register ; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to October Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE ; Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2011 Week 43); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 28 October 2011).\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials comparing staples and sutures for closing leg wounds after vein graft harvesting in patients undergoing CABG were eligible for inclusion in this review.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of references identified by the search strategy against the selection criteria and extracted data from eligible trials. Included trials were assessed for the following risks of bias: generation of random allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and freedom from other biases. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included three prospective, randomised studies reporting on a total of 148 leg wounds closed with staples and 175 with sutures after vein graft harvesting in patients undergoing CABG. All trials were of sub‐optimal methodological quality and all trials were at risk of bias. Leg wound infection rate was 10.8% (16/148) after leg wound closure with staples compared with 8% (14/174) with sutures (risk ratio 1.20, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.39). Leg wound dehiscence occurred in 9.3% (10/108) of patients after leg wound closure with staples compared with 8.8% (12/137) with sutures (risk ratio 1.05, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.53).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】These results suggest that there is no evidence of a difference in the risk of SSI and wound dehiscence when staples rather than sutures are used to close leg wounds after vein graft harvesting during CABG, however more research is needed.\n\n【14】### Staples versus sutures for closing leg wounds after vein graft harvesting for coronary artery bypass surgery\n\n【15】Surgical wounds are usually closed by using either an interrupted or continuous suture using absorbable or non absorbable suture materials. Skin staples are an alternative to sutures and are usually used at the discretion of the surgeon. Skin wound closure with metallic clips is considered to be a fast and effective alternative to sutures. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that staples are less traumatic and may reduce wound complications. This makes the use of staples attractive as it may reduce the risk of postoperative wound complications.\n\n【16】Surgical site infection (SSI) after saphenous vein graft harvesting is a postoperative complication that may occur in up to 18% of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). We considered the effects of using either staples or sutures for closing the skin after saphenous vein graft harvesting for CABG on rates of wound infection and wound dehiscence. We included four studies reporting on a total of 148 leg wounds closed with staples and 174 with sutures after vein graft harvesting in patients undergoing isolated CABG.\n\n【17】There was no difference in leg wound infection rate or in leg wound dehiscence when wounds were closed with staples rather than with sutures.\n\n【18】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The modern oral contraceptive pill is widely used to treat pain occurring as a result of endometriosis, although the evidence for its efficacy is limited.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in comparison to other treatments for painful symptoms of endometriosis in women of reproductive age.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ; MEDLINE ; EMBASE (1980 to September 2006); National Research Register; and reference lists of articles.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All truly randomised controlled trials of the use of oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of women of reproductive age with symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis and made visually at surgical procedure were included.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. One of the assessors was an expert in the content matter. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Only one study met the inclusion criteria, in which a total of 57 women were allocated to two groups to compare an OCP to a GnRH analogue. Methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were unclear and the study was acknowledged by its authors to be underpowered. Women in the GnRH analogue group became amenorrhoeic during the treatment period of six months, whilst women in the OCP group reported a decrease in dysmenorrhoea. No evidence of a significant difference between the two groups was observed in terms of dysmenorrhoea at six months follow up after stopping treatment (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.90). Some evidence for a decrease in dyspareunia was found at the end of treatment in women in the GnRH analogue group, although no evidence of a significant difference in dyspareunia was observed at the end of the six months follow up (OR 4.87; 95% CI 0.96 to 24.65).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The limited data we found available suggests that this is no evidence of a difference in outcomes between the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) studied and GnRH analogue was as effective as a GnRH analogue in treating for endometriosis‐associated painful symptoms of endometriosis. However, the lack of studies with larger sample sizes, or focusing on other comparable treatments is concerning and further research is needed to fully evaluate fully the role of OCPs oral contraceptive pills in managing symptoms associated with endometriosis.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Endometriosis\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Progestogens And Estrogen Systemic Contraceptives, Fixed Combinations\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Laparoscopic Excision Of Pelvic Endometriosis\n*   Medical Therapy\n*   Presacral Sympathectomy\n*   Conservative Therapy\n*   Endometrial Laser Ablation\n*   Laparoscopic Uterosacral Nerve Ablation\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Dysmenorrhea\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Modern combined oral contraceptives for treatment of pain associated with endometriosis\n\n【24】Endometriosis is a common women's healthcare condition which is defined as the growth of endometrium (lining of the uterus) at sites outside the uterus, such as the ovaries. Endometriosis is commonly found in women with painful periods, pain with sexual intercourse, pelvic pain and infertility. Hormonal treatments, including the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are used to relieve the pain symptoms associated with endometriosis. There is some evidence to suggest that such treatments may also treat the actual deposits of endometriosis. However, many of the hormonal treatments have side effects which limit their acceptability and duration of use. Surgery may also be used to remove the deposits.\n\n【25】This review searched for studies which compared an OCP with other treatments. One small study (57 women) was found which compared an OCP to goserelin (a GnRH analogue) in two separate treatment groups. The study showed that the two treatments relieved endometriosis‐associated pain equally well. The goserelin treatment stopped women from having periods. Clearly, therefore, these women did not report having pain with their periods during treatment. Goserelin can also only be safely taken for six months.  \nMore women in the goserelin group had side effects of hot flushes, insomnia and vaginal dryness, whereas more women in the OCP group suffered headaches and weight gain. After six months follow up there were no differences between the groups. The methodology of the study was not rated highly by the review authors.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess whether the use of honey confers any benefit in wound healing.\n\n【3】The primary objectives are to determine whether honey:  \n‐ increases the rate of healing in acute wounds (burns, lacerations and other traumatic wounds);  \n‐ increases the rate of healing in chronic wounds (venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, infected surgical wounds).\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Honey is plant nectar and saccharine modified by the honey bee Apis mellifera. Honey contains approximately 35% glucose, 40% fructose, 5% sucrose, and 20% water, as well as many other substances, such as amino acids, vitamins, minerals and enzymes . Honey is an ancient treatment for wounds, with records of it being employed by early Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Greeks and Romans , as well as being recommended as a salve by early physicians such as Hippocrates . Over the past decade there has been a resurgent interest in honey as a wound treatment.\n\n【7】Honey can be applied directly to a wound surface, or more usually, applied via a dressing. The microscopic actions of honey on wounds may be multiple. Honey appears to draw fluid from the underlying circulation, providing both a moist environment and topical nutrition that may enhance tissue growth . Histologically, honey appears to stimulate tissue growth in animal and human controlled trials, with earlier tissue repair noted , fewer inflammatory changes , and improved epithelialisation . Macroscopically, reports have also noted the debriding action of honey .\n\n【8】Recent research has tended to concentrate on the antibacterial activity of the many different types of honey rather than its effect on wound healing . However, there is evidence from different animal models  as well as the human model that honey may accelerate wound healing . A previous systematic review was unable to conclude whether honey does confer extra benefit in wound healing, but there are no plans to update the review (personal communication RA Moore). Since that review's publication, one further trial has been published  and others not previously identified have been located . It is therefore timely to conduct a new review of honey as a topical agent in wound care.\n\n【9】Objectives\n----------\n\n【10】To assess whether the use of honey confers any benefit in wound healing.\n\n【11】The primary objectives are to determine whether honey:  \n‐ increases the rate of healing in acute wounds (burns, lacerations and other traumatic wounds);  \n‐ increases the rate of healing in chronic wounds (venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, infected surgical wounds).\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】We will include trials if they are described as randomised controlled trials.

Classically, TMD presents with pain, restriction of jaw movement, joint noises, and functional limitation . Pain may present locally, within the TMJ, MOM, or associated supporting structures, or can refer widely, presenting throughout the cervical and craniofacial regions . TMD diagnosis is informed by three international guidelines: the Research Diagnostic criteria for TMDs (RDC/TMD) , the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) , and the International Classification of Orofacial Pain, first edition . Table 1 documents the 12 most common TMD diagnostic subtypes , with clinical examination and specific findings for each TMD subtype outlined. Table 1 indicates how the 12 most common TMD subtypes fall into three broad groups: muscular, intra‐articular and other.\n\n【8】Table 1.

temporomandibular disorders; TMJ: temporomandibular joint\n\n【12】TMD affects 10% to 15% of the general population, with peak incidence in adults aged 20 to 40 years old . TMD is marginally more prevalent in females than males, and females have significantly higher propensity towards persistent TMD . TMD is a complex condition and a detailed understanding of the precise aetiology remains elusive. TMD is, therefore, best understood within a biopsychosocial framework . Consistent with other persistent pain conditions, it is likely that an individual's genotype may confer biological susceptibility to the condition, whilst psychological, environmental, and sociological influences on, and characteristics of, the individual will affect how pain is processed and experienced .\n\n【13】Pain is the most common presenting feature of TMD: 12% of people with the condition report a single painful episode, 65% report recurrent painful episodes and 19% report persistent pain, making persistent TMD the most common cause of chronic pain in the orofacial region . Acute, short‐lived TMD pain is protective, allowing damage to be repaired, pain in persistent TMD (present for ≥ 3 months)  is of no physiological benefit . Jaw rest, soft diet, and avoidance of parafunctional habits (e.g. nail biting) in acute TMD will support recovery. Acute, short‐lived TMD pain can be significant, and in such instances short‐term use of over‐the‐counter nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), e.g. ibuprofen, may be advised, though evidence about this is equivocal . Appropriate strategies such as individually tailored patient advice, consideration of concomitant paracetamol use to reduce NSAID dose and therefore reduce the risk of  NSAID side effects, and limited duration of treatment must be adhered to by prescribers .\n\n【14】Compared to pain from other areas of the body, increased biological relevance and central prioritisation of trigeminally‐mediated pain means that persistent orofacial pain produces greater pain intensity and a heightened emotional response . The resulting biopsychosocial consequences can have a profound effect on every aspect of patients' lives . Effective management of both objective pain and the psychosocial consequences of the persistent pain condition requires an individually‐tailored treatment regimen. Strategies for persistent pain management may include any combination of: education and reassurance, modification of comorbid factors (e.g. parafunctional activities, smoking cessation, sleep hygiene), splint therapy, physiotherapy, acupuncture, psychological management, pharmacological management, and surgical intervention.\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】Pharmacological management involves administration of a chemical substance (drug) to produce a beneficial biological effect . Biological targets for TMD pain management include: inflammatory mediators, neurotransmitters, neuronal cell membrane proteins or voltage‐gated ion channels. Most biological targets are involved in either stabilisation of peripheral neurons or activation of descending inhibitory fibres, resulting in attenuation of nociceptive signals either peripherally or at the level of the spinal cord, respectively . Multiple classes of drug have been proposed for the management of pain in TMD, as either primary or adjuvant therapies. These include simple analgesics, anti‐inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, opioids, neuromodulatory agents (antiepileptics, antidepressants, carboxamides, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NDMA) receptor agonist, cannabinoids), oral contraceptives, muscle relaxants (botulinum toxin, benzodiazepines), topical agents (local anaesthetics, capsaicin), and alternative oral herbal medicines.\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】Though similarities can be seen in the mechanism of action of pharmacological agents within the same class of drug, the pharmacological effects of each individual drug are different. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been suggested for the pharmacological management of TMD pain. Pharmacological agents can act on the peripheral nervous system, the central nervous system, or at both sites to modify pain. The perception of pain may be reduced by inhibition of ascending pain pathway or augmentation of descending inhibitory pain pathways .\n\n【19】Other secondary mechanisms of pain management include: reduction of inflammation, improved sleep, alleviation of increased muscle activity, and stabilisation of mood .\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】The evidence base for the use of pharmacological agents to manage pain in people with TMD is limited and empirical . Lack of specificity can be an issue; evidence for TMD pain management is often extrapolated from other chronic pain conditions . In 2010, a previous Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of pharmacological strategies for TMD pain management . In the Mujakperuo 2010 review, potential bias in included studies resulted in a high exclusion rate, and small sample sizes resulted in many included studies being under‐powered to detect group differences, even where these may have existed. Additionally, in 2010, List and Axelsson synthesised evidence from all published systematic reviews on TMD management, including pharmacological management strategies . As in the Cochrane review, poor primary study design, inappropriate follow‐up, and significant heterogeneity of the primary studies were reported as significant factors affecting the findings .\n\n【22】Variation in historical diagnostic terminology for TMD complicates the comparison of studies. Over the last decade, the International Network for Orofacial Pain and Related Disorders Methodology (INfORM) has developed standardised diagnostic criteria for TMD . In addition, consensus on the most appropriate outcome measures for use in TMD research and a general trend in research to standardise randomised controlled trials (RCTs) may have improved the quality of research in this field.  A culmination of such improvements and a search strategy including a broader range of pharmacological agents may allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Considering the intensity of TMD pain, the impact on patients' biopsychosocial functioning, and a period of at least 10 years since a similar review was conducted, this review is important to provide a summary of the most up to date and reliable evidence on which to base pharmacological pain management strategies .\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of pharmacological interventions for reducing pain and the impact of pain in people aged 18 years or older with painful persistent temporomandibular disorders (TMD).\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with prospective allocation of individuals to any pharmacological intervention for the management of any subtype of painful temporomandibular disorders (TMD). We do not consider cross‐over studies suitable for evaluating TMD and will exclude these.\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】We will include studies recruiting adults (≥ 18 years old) presenting with painful TMD of at least three months duration. We will note whether the TMD diagnosis is aligned with: the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) guidelines  ; the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) guidelines ; the International Classification of Orofacial Pain, first edition ; or it is possible to clearly map the diagnosis to these reference standards, using Table 1 . We will include participants with any combination of pain in the muscles of mastication, temporomandibular joint,  associated structures  (i.e. people with any subtype of painful persistent TMD). We will include studies with unilateral or bilateral TMD pain. We will include studies that involve participants with other pain conditions if participants with TMD constitute the majority of the trial population or if information about TMD is reported separately from other pain conditions. We will exclude trials focused on participants who have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of TMD but are not experiencing pain.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will include studies comparing any pharmacological intervention for the management of painful persistent TMD against placebo, no treatment, or other active intervention (e.g. splint therapy, physiotherapy) as a control group. Studies investigating topical, oral, intramuscular and intra‐articular injection of the pharmacological agent will be included.\n\n【33】The true action of the pharmacological agent would be impossible to ascertain in trials involving intra‐articular deposition of a pharmacological agent to the temporomandibular joint if other active interventions (e.g. arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, joint lavage) were also performed at the point of intra‐articular deposition of a pharmacological agent. To account for this, trials involving intra‐articular deposition of a pharmacological agent to the temporomandibular joint will only be included if all participants in the study had no other active intervention provided at the point of intra‐articular deposition, or the study includes a control arm of another active intervention e.g. arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, joint lavage without intra articular deposition of pharmacological agent.\n\n【34】We will include trials where pharmacological interventions are delivered in conjunction with non‐pharmacological co‐interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral, therapy, splint therapy). However, we will only include such trials if the same co‐intervention is delivered to both the intervention and comparator groups.\n\n【35】We will include trials that involve head‐to‐head comparisons of pharmacological interventions (e.g. analgesics versus opioids, corticosteroids versus muscle relaxants.) Psychological management of TMD has been recently considered in a recent Cochrane review . It was considered appropriate by the authors of this Cochrane Review to include studies directly comparing psychological therapies to pharmacological management for painful persistent TMD, to ensure recruitment of all appropriate evidence.\n\n【36】We will include studies that use multiple pharmacological interventions as a combined strategy.\n\n【37】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【38】At the time of writing, there is no agreed set of core outcome measures for TMD. The COMET initiative is working on the development of agreed core outcome sets for TMD ( Ferreira ongoing ), which will offer significant benefits through standardisation. In the absence of these agreed measures, we will include outcome measures routinely used in the literature for persistent pain conditions  and that are shared with other Cochrane Reviews of interventions for TMD .\n\n【39】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【40】*   Pain intensity: measured through validated numerical, categorical, or visual  scales; quantitative pain descriptors, for example the McGill pain questionnaire ; or characteristic pain intensity ratings \n\n【41】*   Pain impact: pain‐related disability/impact on daily function: measured by, for example, the Graded Chronic Pain Scale , Roland‐Morris disability questionnaire , Pain Self‐Efficacy questionnaire , Brief pain inventory  and West Haven‐Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory \n\n【42】*   Adverse events or side effects that may be related to the medication (as measured and reported in the included studies only)\n\n【43】We will consider outcomes at different timepoints: short‐term (0 to 3 months), medium‐term (>3 to 6 months) and long‐term (>6 to 12 months).\n\n【44】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【45】*   Psychological distress: measured by, for example, the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ‐4 , PHQ‐9 , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , General Health Questionnaire GHQ‐12 , Beck Depression Inventory‐II , Beck Anxiety Inventory , or Perceived Stress Scale \n\n【46】*   Quality of life: measured by, for example, EQ‐5D‐5L ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In summary, serious and non‐serious falls are still among the most common complications after stroke and their increasing incidence poses a challenge for rehabilitation.\n\n【7】Many stroke‐related impairments contribute to deficits of balance and falls e.g. muscle weakness, sensory loss, reduced attention, abnormalities of vision and spatial awareness. The consequences of a fall can be serious leading to fractures, hospital admission with reduced mobility, fear of falling and carer stress . A fall is a strong predictor of further falls among people with stroke living in the community; however, all people with residual difficulties following a stroke should be considered at increased risk. Predictors of falling in people in the acute post‐stroke stage in hospital include poor balance control, near falls and upper limb impairment .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Few researchers have examined fall prevention or management post‐stroke, but interventions recommended for the general elderly with falls have been utilised. Preliminary evidence shows that task‐specific exercise programs targeting balance and gait deficits can be beneficial, reduce fall frequency and are thought to drive neural plasticity . Technology advances in assistive devices such as ankle‐foot orthosis, walking aids  and functional electrical stimulation  have also been shown to produce evidence of improved mobility; although the benefits with respect to falls prevention in people with stroke still need to be evaluated in intervention studies .\n\n【10】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【11】We are unaware of any systematic reviews of specific interventions for preventing falls in people after stroke. A summary of the evidence is important for informing evidence‐based practice, and to identify gaps in research. There are existing reviews on the prevention of falls for older people . However, a stroke is a serious condition leading to physical, cognitive and psychological impairments specifically related to the problem of falls in this population. In addition, persistent impairments in the later stages after stroke can contribute to the increasing incidence of falls in people after stroke. Currently, it is very unclear how much research has been dedicated to examining the effect of interventions specific for falls in connection with stroke. Therefore, this review focuses specifically on interventions for preventing falls in people after stroke.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】To summarise the best evidence for effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing falls in people after stroke. Our primary objective is to determine the effect of interventions on rate of falls (number of falls divided by length of follow up) and number of falls in people after stroke. Our secondary objectives are to determine the effects of interventions aimed at preventing falls o number of fall‐related fractures number of fall‐related hospital admissions near‐fall events economic evaluation quality of life an adverse effects of the interventions in people after stroke.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】We will include controlled trials where participants or clusters have been truly randomly allocated (e.g. through computer‐generated random numbers or a random numbers table). Should any cross‐over trial meet our inclusion criteria, we will include the first phase if the order of assignment has been determined randomly.\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】We will include trials with adult participants (over 18 years of age) in the acute, sub‐acute or chronic stage following stroke with a diagnosis as confirmed by the authors. Diagnosis of stroke will comprise ischaemic as well as haemorrhagic events. People in the acute stage after stroke will be defined as people who are admitted to a dedicated stroke unit or acute hospital ward. People in the sub‐acute stage after stroke will be people who are admitted to a rehabilitation ward or clinic after being discharged from an acute ward or people who receive intensive treatment at home in cases of, for instance, early supported discharge. Finally, we will define people in the chronic stage after stroke as people who were discharged from rehabilitation and are living at home or admitted to institutional care.\n\n【20】We will include trials reporting an intervention carried out in a mixed sample of participants, including people after stroke, if data are provided separately (i.e. in a subgroup) for people after stroke.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】We will include any intervention where a stated primary or secondary aim is to prevent falls. We will classify the interventions according to the taxonomy developed by the Prevention of Falls Network Europe , which proposes the following categories.\n\n【23】*   Exercises (supervised/unsupervised): including gait, balance and functional training; strength/resistance exercises; flexibility exercises (e.g. yoga); 3D training (e.g. Tai Chi, Qi Gong); general physical activity; endurance training or others.\n\n【24】*   Medication (drug target): direct action targeted to specific classes of drugs; including antihypertensives, other cardiovascular agents, vitamin D, calcium, other bone health medication, drugs used in diabetes, anti‐Parkinson drugs, anti‐dementia drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotic/neuroleptic drugs, anxiolytics, hypnotics & sedatives, other central nervous system drugs, urinary antispasmodics or other specified drugs.\n\n【25】*   Surgery; including cataract extraction, pacemaker provision, podiatric surgery or intervention or others.\n\n【26】*   Management of urinary incontinence (e.g. assisted toileting, bladder retraining).\n\n【27】*   Fluid or nutrition therapy where the basic objective is to restore the volume and composition of the body fluids to normal with respect to water‐electrolyte balance (fluid therapy) or to improve health status of the individual by adjusting the quantities, qualities, and methods of nutrient intake (nutrition therapy).\n\n【28】*   Psychological intervention, either individual or in group, including cognitive (behavioural) intervention or others.\n\n【29】*   Environment/assistive technology, which includes technical aids for persons with disabilities.\n\n【30】*   Environment (furnishings and adaptations to homes and other premises): direct action including dwelling unit indoors including entrances, dwelling unit outdoors, public outdoor (e.g. pavement) or relocation.\n\n【31】*   Environment (aids for personal mobility such as walking aid, wheelchair).\n\n【32】*   Environment (aids for communication, information and signalling): including optical aids, hearing aids, aids for signalling and indicating or alarm systems.\n\n【33】*   Environment (body worn aids for personal care and protection): including body worn protective aids, clothes and shoes or others.\n\n【34】*   Environment (social environment): including staff ratio, staff training, service model change, telephone support, caregiver training, home care services or others.\n\n【35】*   Knowledge interventions: including written material, videos, lectures or others.\n\n【36】*   Other interventions/procedures.\n\n【37】We will structure the interventions into single interventions where one component is included in the intervention; multiple interventions where more than one component is included in the interventions but the intervention is consistent for all participants; and multifactorial interventions where more than one component is included in the intervention and the intervention is modified for every participant personally .\n\n【38】We will compare the intervention for preventing falls with no additional treatment (routine care) or another type of intervention.\n\n【39】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【40】We will include only trials that report an outcome measure related to rate or number of falls or fallers. We will include trials where falls are collected either prospectively or retrospectively.\n\n【41】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【42】*   Rate of falls.\n\n【43】*   Number of fallers.\n\n【44】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【45】*   Number of people sustaining fall‐related fractures.\n\n【46】*   Number of people with fall‐related hospital admissions.\n\n【47】*   Number of people with near‐fall events (a near fall is typically defined as an occasion on which an individual felt that they were about to fall, but did not actually fall ).\n\n【48】*   Economic evaluation.\n\n【49】*   Quality of life (including psychological aspects such as fear of falling).\n\n【50】*   Adverse events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) in order to disperse the cerumen and reduce the need for syringing, or to facilitate syringing should it prove necessary, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the wide variety of cerumenolytics in use.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and MEDLINE and EMBASE up to March 2003. Reference lists of all trials were also manually searched.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which a cerumenolytic was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with hard or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable . The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently. Any differences in opinion about which studies to include in the review were resolved by discussion.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other reviewer, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Meta‐analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, treatment amounts and durations, trial procedures, and scoring systems. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Eight trials satisfied the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were of poor quality. In all, 587 participants received one of nine different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, two trials compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all eight trials placed two or more active treatments in head‐to‐head comparisons. Seven trials included syringing as a secondary treatment where necessary.\n\n【13】Overall, results were inconclusive. One trial found a significant difference between one of three active agents (Cerumol®) in comparison to no treatment, but no statistically significant difference was found between these three agents (sodium bicarbonate ear drops; Cerumol®; sterile water). In two trials no statistical difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, Cerumol®, Cerumenex® or Colace® versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. Three trials (from the same source) found statistically significant differences in favour of the same active agent (Exterol®) in comparison to glycerol and Cerumol®. Three trials found no statistically significant difference between two or more cerumenolytics (Otocerol® versus Cerumol®; Audax® versus Earex®; sodium bicarbonate ear drops versus Cerumol®). Two trials comparing the same two cerumenolytics (Cerumenex® versus Colace®) also failed to show any significant benefit of one over the other. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Trials to date have been heterogeneous and of poor quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil‐based and water‐based solvents with placebo and/or no treatment.\n\n【16】----------------------\n\n【17】### Using ear drops to remove impacted ear wax is better than no treatment, but no particular sort of drops can be recommended over any other.\n\n【18】Impacted ear wax is one of the most common reasons that people visit their general practitioners (family doctors) with ear problems, as it can cause reduced hearing, discomfort, and sometimes pain and dizziness. Ear drops (either oil‐ or water‐based) are often prescribed to clear the wax or to aid subsequent ear syringing if necessary. The review of trials found that ear drops (of any sort) can help to remove ear wax, but that water and saline drops appear to be as good as more costly commercial products. The quality of the trials was generally low, however, and more research is needed.\n\n【19】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Anecdotal reports, which date back to ancient Egypt have suggested the use of castor oil to stimulate labour. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of initiating labour in midwifery practice. Its role in the initiation of labour is poorly understood and data examining its efficacy within a clinical trial are limited. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effects of castor oil or enemas for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with other methods of cervical ripening or induction of labour.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013) and bibliographies of relevant papers.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Clinical trials comparing castor oil, bath or enemas used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】A strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involved a two‐stage method of data extraction.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three trials, involving 233 women, are included. There was no evidence of differences in caesarean section rates between the two interventions in the two trials reporting this outcome (risk ratio (RR) 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 4.55). There were no data presented on neonatal or maternal mortality or morbidity.\n\n【12】There was no evidence of a difference between castor oil and placebo/no treatment for the rate of instrumental delivery, meconium‐stained liquor, or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes. The number of participants was too small to detect all but large differences in outcome. All women who ingested castor oil felt nauseous (RR 59.92, 95% CI 8.46 to 424.52).\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】The three trials included in the review contain small numbers of women. All three studies used single doses of castor oil. The results from these studies should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of bias introduced due to poor methodological quality. Further research is needed to attempt to quantify the efficacy of castor oil as an cervical priming and induction agent.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Labour Induction\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Third Trimester Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Castor Oil\n*   Enemas\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Placebo\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Cesarean Section\n*   Epidural Analgesia\n*   Hypertonic Uterine Dysfunction\n*   Oxytocin Increased\n*   Vaginal Delivery\n*   Uterine Rupture\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Castor oil, bath and/or enema for cervical priming and induction of labour\n\n【25】Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially. Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of inducing labour in midwifery practice. It can be taken by mouth or as an enema. The review of three trials, involving 233 women, found there has not been enough research done to show the effects of castor oil on ripening the cervix or inducing labour or compare it to other methods of induction. The review found that all women who took castor oil by mouth felt nauseous. More research is needed into the effects of castor oil to induce labour.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】There is still insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of castor oil, bath or enemas as induction agents.\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】Future trials examining the effect of castor oil or enemas as induction agents should aim to be of sufficient power to detect a meaningful reduction in clinically relevant outcomes. Future trials should aim to be of high methodological quality.\n\n【32】Background\n----------\n\n【33】Sometimes it is necessary to bring on labour artificially because of safety concerns for the mother or baby. This review is one of a series of reviews of methods of labour induction using a standardised protocol. For more detailed information on the rationale for this methodological approach, please refer to the currently published 'generic' protocol . The generic protocol describes how a number of standardised reviews will be combined to compare various methods of preparing the cervix of the uterus and inducing labour.\n\n【34】Castor oil, a potent cathartic, is derived from the bean of the castor plant. Anecdotal reports, which date back to ancient Egypt have suggested the use of castor oil to stimulate labour.\n\n【35】Castor oil has been widely used as a traditional method of initiating labour in midwifery practice.

Each review included comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 27) with only those methods above it on the list. Thus, this review of castor oil, bath, and/or enem could include comparisons with any of the following placebo/no treatment vaginal prostaglandins intracervical prostaglandins intravenous oxytocin amniotomy intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy vaginal misoprostol oral misoprostol mechanical methods including extra‐amniotic Foley catheter membrane sweeping extra‐amniotic prostaglandins intravenous prostaglandins oral prostaglandins mifepristone oestrogens with or without amniotomy corticosteroids relaxin; o hyaluronidase. Methods identified in the future will be added to the end of the list. The current list is as follows:\n\n【47】(1) placebo/no treatment;  \n(2) vaginal prostaglandins ;  \n(3) intracervical prostaglandins ;  \n(4) intravenous oxytocin ;  \n(5) amniotomy ;  \n(6) intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy ;  \n(7) vaginal misoprostol ;  \n(8) oral misoprostol ;  \n(9) mechanical methods including extra‐amniotic Foley catheter ;  \n(10) membrane sweeping ;  \n(11) extra‐amniotic prostaglandins ;  \n(12) intravenous prostaglandins ;  \n(13) oral prostaglandins ;  \n(14) mifepristone ;  \n(15) oestrogens with or without amniotomy ;  \n(16) corticosteroids ;  \n(17) relaxin ;  \n(18) hyaluronidase ;  \n(19) castor oil, bath, and/or enema (this review);  \n(20) acupuncture ;  \n(21) breast stimulation ;  \n(22) sexual intercourse ;  \n(23) homoeopathic methods ;  \n(24) nitric oxide ;  \n(25) buccal or sublingual misoprostol ;  \n(26) hypnosis;  \n(27) other methods for induction of labour.\n\n【48】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【49】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【50】Two authors of labour induction reviews (Justus Hofmeyr and Zarko Alfirevic) prespecified clinically relevant outcomes for trials of methods of cervical ripening/labour induction. They resolved differences by discussion.\n\n【51】Five primary outcomes were chosen as being most representative of the clinically important measures of effectiveness and complications:  \n(1) vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (or period specified by trial authors);  \n(2) uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes;  \n(3) caesarean section;  \n(4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (e.g. seizures, birth asphyxia defined by trialists, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood);  \n(5) serious maternal morbidity or death (e.g. uterine rupture, admission to intensive care unit, septicaemia).\n\n【52】Perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality are composite outcomes. This is not an ideal solution because some components are clearly less severe than others. It is possible for one intervention to cause more deaths but less severe morbidity. However, in the context of labour induction at term this is unlikely. All these events will be rare, and a modest change in their incidence will be easier to detect if composite outcomes are presented. The incidence of individual components are explored as secondary outcomes .\n\n【53】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【54】Secondary outcomes relate to measures of effectiveness, complications and satisfaction.\n\n【55】###### Measures of effectiveness\n\n【56】(6) Cervix unfavourable/unchanged after 12 to 24 hours;  \n(7) oxytocin augmentation.\n\n【57】###### Complications\n\n【58】(8) Uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes;  \n(9) uterine rupture;  \n(10) epidural analgesia;  \n(11) instrumental vaginal delivery;  \n(12) meconium‐stained liquor;  \n(13) Apgar score less than seven at five minutes;  \n(14) neonatal intensive care unit admission;  \n(15) neonatal encephalopathy;  \n(16) perinatal death;  \n(17) disability in childhood;  \n(18) maternal side effects (all);  \n(19) maternal nausea;  \n(20) maternal vomiting;  \n(21) maternal diarrhoea;  \n(22) other maternal side‐effects;  \n(23) postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by the trial authors);  \n(24) serious maternal complications (e.g. intensive care unit admission, septicaemia but excluding uterine rupture);  \n(25) maternal death.\n\n【59】###### Measures of satisfaction\n\n【60】(26) Woman not satisfied;  \n(27) caregiver not satisfied.\n\n【61】'Uterine rupture' includes all clinically significant ruptures of unscarred or scarred uteri. Trivial scar dehiscence noted incidentally at the time of surgery is excluded.\n\n【62】Additional outcomes may appear in individual reviews.\n\n【63】While all the above outcomes were sought, only those with data appear in the analysis tables.\n\n【64】The terminology of uterine hyperstimulation is problematic . In the reviews we will use the term 'uterine hyperstimulation without FHR changes' to include uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes) and uterine hypersystole/hypertonus (a contraction lasting at least two minutes) and 'uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes' to denote uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (tachysystole or hypersystole with fetal heart rate changes such as persistent decelerations, tachycardia or decreased short‐term variability). However, due to varied reporting there is the possibility of subjective bias in the interpretation of these outcomes. Also, it is not always clear from trials if these outcomes are reported in a mutually exclusive manner.\n\n【65】Outcomes were included in the analysis: if reasonable measures were taken to minimise observer bias; and data were available for analysis according to original allocation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This consists of a metal rod, which may be inserted from the upper or lower end of the femur into the inner cavity of the femur bone and held in place with screws. This review compares different designs of these nails and found not enough evidence to confirm or discount any important differences between the various nails and their modifications tested within randomised trials.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effects of lifestyle interventions in treating women with gestational diabetes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】The original review on _Treatments for gestational diabetes_  has been split into three new reviews due to the complexity of the included interventions. The following new review protocols are underway.\n\n【6】_Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes_ (this review)\n\n【7】_Oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapies for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes_\n\n【8】_Insulin for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes_\n\n【9】There will be similarities in the background, methods and outcomes between these three systematic reviews. Portions of the methods section of this protocol are based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group.\n\n【10】### Description of the condition\n\n【11】Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), often referred to as gestational diabetes can be defined as 'glucose intolerance or hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose concentration) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy' . GDM occurs when the body is unable to make enough insulin to meet the extra needs in pregnancy. The high blood sugars associated with GDM will usually return to normal after the birth of the baby. However, there is currently no universally accepted diagnostic criteria . GDM may include previously undetected type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes or diabetes presenting only during pregnancy and not identified through early (first trimester) pregnancy screening . Women meeting diagnostic criteria for overt diabetes would not be considered to have GDM, however until recently, confirmation of overt diabetes was only possible in the postpartum period. With the uptake of early screening in the first trimester with glycated or glycosylated haemoglobin ‐ HbA1C (glycated or glycosylated haemoglobin is a form of haemoglobin measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a period of time), more women with overt diabetes will be diagnosed and treated appropriately ( Ministry of Health 2014 ‐ New Zealand).\n\n【12】GDM is one of the most common pregnancy complications and the prevalence is rising worldwide with 1% to 36% of pregnancies being affected . The prevalence of GDM is likely to continue to increase along with the increasing prevalence of maternal obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus .\n\n【13】#### Screening and diagnosis of GDM\n\n【14】Regardless of whether universal or selective (risk‐factor) screening with a 50 gram (g) oral glucose challenge test is used, diagnosis of GDM is usually based on either a 75 g two‐hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a 100 g three‐hour OGTT . Recommendations regarding diagnostic criteria vary nationally and internationally , and these diagnostic criteria have changed over time, sometimes due to changing understanding about the effects of hyperglycaemia on pregnancy and infant outcomes , but also because of a lack of evidence clearly demonstrating the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of one criterion over another.\n\n【15】Table 1.

The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommended diagnostic criteria using data from the HAPO study . Applying the IADPSG criteria in most health environments will increase the number of women diagnosed with GDM. A study conducted in Vietnam showed that depending on the criteria used, the diagnosis of GDM varied between 5.9% (American Diabetes Association ‐ ADA), 20.4% (International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups ‐ IADPSG), 20.8% (Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society ‐ ADIPS), and up to 24.3% (World Health Organization ‐ WHO) . A Bulgarian study also reported differences in prevalence based on the diagnostic criteria ranging from 10.8% (European Association for the Study of Diabetes ‐ EASD), 13.5% (ADA), 16.2% (New Zealand Society for the Study of Diabetes ‐ NZSSD), 17.1% (WHO), 21.2% (ADIPS), 31.6% (IADPSG) .\n\n【25】#### Pathophysiology of GDM\n\n【26】Normal pregnancy is associated with significant changes in maternal metabolism . In early pregnancy, oestrogen and progesterone stimulate maternal beta‐cell hyperplasia and insulin secretion, which promotes maternal nutrient storage (adipose and hepatic glycogen) to support later fetal growth. At this stage, insulin sensitivity is maintained or may even increase. However, as pregnancy progresses, whole‐body insulin sensitivity steadily decreases, such that by the third trimester it is reduced by almost half . Several factors contribute to this, including placental hormones (human placental lactogen and placental growth hormone), cytokines released from adipocytes (IL‐6, TNF‐alpha), increased free fatty acids and lower adiponectin concentrations . This results in decreased post‐prandial peripheral glucose disposal by up to 40% to 60% . Because glucose is transported to the fetus by facilitated diffusion, this state of physiological insulin resistance promotes fetal glucose uptake, a principal oxidative fuel and carbon source for the growing fetus. In normal pregnancy, maternal glycaemia is maintained by a significant increase in insulin secretion of up to 200% to 250% .\n\n【27】Regulation of fetal glucose metabolism require the maintenance of maternal glucose concentration through increasing maternal glucose production, and at the same time, developing maternal glucose intolerance and insulin resistance transfer of glucose to the fetus across the placenta, an production of fetal insulin and uptake of glucose into adipose tissue and skeletal muscle .\n\n【28】Women with GDM have further reductions in insulin signalling, and glucose uptake is decreased beyond that of normal pregnancy . This results in glucose intolerance, though glycaemia in pregnancy represents a continuum. In GDM, the steeper maternal‐fetal glucose gradient, especially post‐prandial, leads to increased fetal glucose uptake which stimulates fetal insulin secretion. Insulin is a key fetal anabolic hormone and hyperinsulinaemia promotes fetal overgrowth leading to large‐for‐gestational age (LGA) infants, macrosomia, and possible organ damage .\n\n【29】Women with GDM also have increased circulating inflammatory cytokines and lower adiponectin concentrations leading to increased lipolysis and fatty acid concentrations. Placental transfer of free fatty acids contributes to increased fetal adiposity, independent of glucose uptake . Thus, even women with well‐controlled GDM still have an increased risk of fetal macrosomia .\n\n【30】#### Risk factors associated with GDM\n\n【31】A variety of factors have been associated with an increased risk of developing GDM. Non‐modifiable risk factors include advanced maternal age , high parity, non‐Caucasian race or ethnicity (in particular South Asian, Middle Eastern), family history of diabetes mellitus, maternal high or low birthweight, polycystic ovarian syndrome , a history of having a previous macrosomic infant (birthweight 4000 g or more) and previous history of GDM .\n\n【32】Modifiable risk factors include physical inactivity , having a low‐fibre and high‐glycaemic load diet , maternal overweight (body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25 kg/m²) or obesity (equal to or greater than 30 kg/m²) , and excessive weight gain during pregnancy, especially for those who are already overweight or obese .\n\n【33】#### Clinical outcomes for women with pregnancy hyperglycaemia\n\n【34】Adverse outcomes have been consistently reported at higher rates in women diagnosed with GDM and their infants compared with women without GDM .\n\n【35】Women with GDM have an increased risk of developing pre‐eclampsia, are more likely to have their labour induced , and giving birth by caesarean section . The incidence of uterine rupture, shoulder dystocia and perineal lacerations is increased in women with GDM due to the increased likelihood of having a LGA or macrosomic baby . Women who have experienced GDM are at a greater risk of metabolic dysfunction in later life , with a crude cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes of 10% to 20% within 10 years , but up to 50% when adjusted for retention and length of follow‐up .\n\n【36】#### Neonatal, infant and later outcomes related to pregnancy hyperglycaemia\n\n【37】A significant adverse health outcome for babies born to mothers with GDM is being born LGA or macrosomic , which increases the risk of birth injury, including shoulder dystocia, perinatal asphyxia, bone fractures and nerve palsies . Other adverse outcomes which are increased for babies born to women with GDM include respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia (which if prolonged can cause brain injury), hyperbilirubinaemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, polycythaemia and admission to the neonatal nursery .\n\n【38】Babies born to women with GDM, compared with babies born to women without GDM, have significantly greater skinfold measures and fat mass , have greater adiposity , and are more likely to develop early overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes , or metabolic syndrome (a cluster of risk factors defined by the occurrence of three of the following: obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridaemia and low concentration of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) in childhood, adolescence or adulthood .\n\n【39】The development of the metabolic syndrome during childhood is a risk factor for the development of adult type 2 diabetes at 25 to 30 years of age . These health problems repeat across generations  and are important from a public health perspective, because with each generation the prevalence of diabetes increases. For longer‐term outcomes there is some evidence to suggest a link between maternal gestational diabetes and developmental delay  and increased risk of Attention Deficit Hyperacticivity Disorder .\n\n【40】### Description of the intervention\n\n【41】GDM management aims to optimise glycaemic control and consequently improve pregnancy outcomes . Providing dietary and lifestyle advice is usually recommended as the primary therapeutic strategy for women with GDM . If diet and lifestyle management alone are insufficient to achieve targets for maternal glycaemic control, insulin therapy or oral anti‐diabetic pharmacological therapies such as glibenclamide and metformin can be added . As part of GDM management, maternal glucose monitoring and ultrasonography are advised to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to guide care for birth . However, treatment recommendations differ across countries, for example, serial ultrasonography is not recommended to guide treatment management in the New Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines .\n\n【42】#### Dietary intervention for managing GDM\n\n【43】Diet therapy is the primary strategy for managing GDM. Elevated blood glucose concentrations, in particular elevations in post‐prandial glucose are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM . The role of head‐to‐head dietary interventions for treatment of women with GDM has been described in the Cochrane systematic review by Han 2013 and will not be included in this systematic review.\n\n【44】Carbohydrate‐containing foods are important sources of energy, vitamins, minerals and fibre and are the main nutrient affecting blood glucose concentrations . Blood glucose concentrations are affected by both total amount and type of carbohydrates consumed . Glycaemic index (GI) is a ranking of the effects of carbohydrates on blood glucose concentrations . Foods with a low GI (less than 55) produce a lower post‐prandial glucose elevation and area under the glucose curve; foods with a high GI (more than 70) produce a rapid increase in post‐prandial blood glucose concentrations . Outside of pregnancy, consumption of low‐GI diets by people with diabetes seems to help lower glycated or glycosylated haemoglobin ‐ HbA1C . Use of low‐GI diets in GDM management seems to be beneficial in reducing the need for insulin, though the evidence is limited . Polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against impaired glucose tolerance, while saturated fatty acids can increase glucose and insulin concentrations in women with GDM . Reducing blood lipid concentrations may improve glycaemic control and pregnancy outcomes in GDM . However, the specific amount and sources of fat that are beneficial for GDM management are not clear . Therefore, recommendations on the fat intake for women with GDM have not yet been promulgated ( ACOG 2013 ; Hoffman 1998 ; Metzger 2007 ; (New Zealand) Ministry of Health 2014 ; NICE 2015 ). Recommendations on the intake of other nutrients for women with GDM are usually based on the general recommendations for people with diabetes mellitus outside pregnancy .\n\n【45】#### Physical activity during pregnancy for managing GDM\n\n【46】The role of supplementary physical activity interventions with no additional physical activity for the management of glycaemic control in women with diabetes in pregnancy (including GDM) was one of the comparisons described in the Cochrane review by Ceysens 2006 . In non‐pregnant women with type 2 diabetes, physical activity (in addition to diet and insulin) helped to normalise blood glucose levels . Caution is required when generalising this evidence to pregnant women but it potentially suggests that during pregnancy mild exercise could reduce the risk of complications related to high blood glucose and high insulin levels, including macrosomia, birth trauma, respiratory distress, neonatal hypoglycaemia and hypocalcaemia. Exercise interventions alone for treating women with gestational diabetes will not be included in this systematic review.\n\n【47】#### Appropriate weight gain during pregnancy\n\n【48】Interventions for preventing excessive weight gain in pregnancy (diet or exercise or both) have been described in the Cochrane systematic review by Muktabhant 2015 , which included 65 randomised controlled trials of which seven recruited women who were at high risk of gestational diabetes. Given the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in women with GDM, dietary interventions for appropriate pregnancy weight gain are routinely included as a part of nutritional management of GDM . Small reductions in weight improve glycaemic control , but the implications in pregnancy for the mother and fetus are unclear.\n\n【49】In 2009, the American Institute of Medicine updated its' guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy. Guidance is stratified by pre‐pregnancy BMI, i.e. women with a pre‐pregnancy BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m² should aim for 6.8 to 11.4 kg weight gain and those with pre‐pregnancy BMI of 30 kg/m² or more should aim for 5 to 9 kg weight gain . However, the degree of energy restriction for pre‐pregnancy overweight and obese women to achieve these weight gain goals is unknown and is based on observational data .\n\n【50】Dietary interventions provided for women with GDM should ensure adequate nutrients for normal fetal growth and maternal health, but not induce weight loss or excessive weight gain during pregnancy; the main aim however is to promote optimal glycaemic control .\n\n【51】#### Combined dietary intervention and physical activity during pregnancy for managing GDM\n\n【52】Some interventions may involve a combination of dietary and physical activity modalities. Regular physical activity may help normalise maternal blood glucose for pregnant women with gestational diabetes and in combination with dietary interventions may reduce the need for oral anti‐diabetic agents or insulin. As women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future, regular physical activity may also help reduce the risk of this long‐term complication .\n\n【53】#### Other interventions during pregnancy for managing GDM\n\n【54】There may be other interventions, including psychological approaches that may be used independently or alongside physical activity or dietary modalities such as mindfulness eating, yoga or spiritual support.\n\n【55】### How the intervention might work\n\n【56】#### Role of diet\n\n【57】A carbohydrate‐controlled diet (with carbohydrates distributed evenly throughout the day) that provides adequate nutrition, alongside glycaemic control and avoids ketonuria (ketones are produced when stored fat is utilised to produce energy in the absence of glucose) is thought to be optimal to reduce complications associated with gestational diabetes . Other elements of diet such as fat and fibre are also thought to influence maternal blood glucose concentrations . Excess fetal growth is most effectively limited by low post‐prandial maternal glucose levels . Dietary advice in the second trimester, as insulin resistance is developing may help reduce the risk of adverse outcomes associated with GDM .\n\n【58】#### Role of physical activity\n\n【59】Insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle is related to the degree of physical activity, and therefore, physical activity interventions may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control in individuals with diabetes .\n\n【60】Glucose enters skeletal muscle cells via facilitated diffusion through a glucose transporter (GLUT4). Peripheral clearance of glucose in skeletal muscle depends on blood flow to muscle, expression of GLUT4 transporters and intracellular utilisation of glucose through glycolysis and glycogenesis. Translocation of the GLUT4 transporter is induced by insulin and insulin‐independent mechanisms . Exercise increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle , and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Exercise potentiates most of the insulin‐mediated post‐receptor events that lead to an increased expression of GLUT4, and GLUT4 translocation from intracellular stores to the muscle membrane. These exercise‐induced improvements in glucose uptake, however, are not limited to changes in GLUT4 expression. The improvements in insulin sensitivity after regular exercise may be related to changes in expression and/or activity of proteins involved in insulin signal transduction in skeletal muscle. As such, the enhanced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle attributed to exercise might be related to an increased expression and activity of key proteins for insulin signalling such as insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase . Physical activity improves blood supply to the active skeletal muscles , counteracts the ability of lipids to induce insulin resistance , and modifies the hormonal regulation of hepatic glucose output. These exercise‐induced alterations in muscle glucose handling explain most of the insulin‐sensitising and diabetes‐preventing effects of exercise, and partly explain why the many defects of insulin action observed in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are reversed by the effects of exercise .\n\n【61】#### Self‐monitoring of blood glucose\n\n【62】Self‐monitoring of blood glucose is performed by most women with GDM. Evidence has suggested that self‐monitoring between four and seven times per day (including fasting and post‐prandial measurements) can contribute to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes  and is likely to be most effective when combined with effective treatment.\n\n【63】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【64】GDM affects a significant proportion of pregnant women and the prevalence is increasing worldwide . GDM is associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes and these adverse health outcomes repeat across generations , which has important implications for the future. Providing dietary and lifestyle advice is usually recommended as the primary therapeutic strategy for women with GDM ( ACOG 2013 ; Hoffman 1998 ; (New Zealand) Ministry of Health 2014 ; NICE 2015 ).\n\n【65】' _Different types of dietary advice for women with gestational diabetes mellitus_ ' . This review examined the effects of two or more forms of the same type of dietary interventions compared with each other for treating women with GDM, i.e. standard dietary advice compared with individualised dietary advice, individual dietary education sessions compared with group dietary education sessions, single dietary counselling session compared with multiple dietary counselling sessions.\n\n【66】' _Exercise for diabetic pregnant women_ ' .

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of CBT (e.g. cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy, prolonged grief CBT) compared with non‐CBT therapies (e.g. psychodynamic, humanistic, family or systemic therapies) for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of CBT compared with usual care or waiting list for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【4】To assess the effectiveness of CBT compared with pharmacological interventions (e.g. antidepressant medications and other drug therapies used explicitly for treating depressive disorders ) for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Grief is a normal reaction following the death of someone close, and most bereaved individuals adequately adjust through healthy grieving. However some of the bereaved population will develop a debilitating clinical condition as a result of the loss, such as Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) or bereavement‐related Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Several psychological therapies have been proposed to treat MDD and PGD, and there is a growing evidence base demonstrating their effectiveness; the goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for bereavement‐related MDD and PGD.\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】There is evidence that bereaved individuals may develop a range of mental health problems, including depression , anxiety disorders , Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) , or prolonged grief . This review will examine bereavement‐related Major Depresive Disorder and Prolonged Grief Disorder, which are described below.\n\n【10】#### Major Depressive Disorder (bereavement‐related)\n\n【11】According to the World Health Organization (WHO), MDD is a common mental disorder affecting 322 million people worldwide, and is a major contributor to global disability and to deaths by suicide . Evidence suggests that bereavement‐related MDD is often recurrent, genetically influenced, impairing, and treatment‐responsive . Adverse life events such as unemployment, bereavement, being a victim of a physical assault or major disaster, or experiencing psychological trauma can precipitate MDD, which is more common in women . The most widely‐used criteria for diagnosing MDD are APA's _Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM) and the World Health Organization's _International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems_ (ICD). There are a number of similarities between the definitions of depression and the symptoms identified in the ICD‐10  and DSM‐5 criteria , which are used to diagnose if someone has mild, moderate or severe depression. For example, both refer to changes in weight, sleep, activity or concentration, and both highlight suicidality. However, the ICD‐10 also refers to self‐esteem and guilt. The 5th edition of the DSM  categorises MDD as depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for more than two weeks, which represents a change from the person's baseline mood, and impaired function: social, occupational and educational . The key symptoms for depression in the ICD‐10  are persistent sadness or low mood, loss of interests or pleasure, and fatigue or low energy.\n\n【12】The DSM‐IV‐TR  definition of mental disorder excludes grief as a disorder on the grounds that it was \"an expectable and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event\". Clinicians using the DSM‐IV were advised to refrain from diagnosing MDD within the first two months following a bereavement, which became known as the 'bereavement exclusion'. The DSM‐5  subsequently removed the 'bereavement exclusion' from the recommended criteria for MDD , which led to some criticism  and further research to support its removal . According to DSM‐5 guidance , individuals should be screened for conditions that mimic or co‐exist alongside MDD such as bereavement, and symptoms should persist for more than two months into bereavement or the individual should show marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. Given the unique differences between ordinary or uncomplicated grief and MDD, as well as the differences between bereavement‐related MDD and PGD, it has been suggested that removing the bereavement exclusion should help avoid MDD being overlooked and should promote sound clinical judgement, taking into account the individual's previous history and cultural norms , before the appropriate treatment is offered.\n\n【13】Population‐based studies have explored the validity of bereavement‐related MDD. One study conducted in the USA  compared bereavement‐related MDD and depressive episodes related to other stressors (e.g. separation/divorce, illness or job loss). It reported some differences in the demographic characteristics of the participants with bereavement‐related MDD (i.e. older and female), lower levels of treatment‐seeking, neuroticism and guilt, but higher levels of fatigue and loss of interest. However, the conclusion was that similarities overshadowed the differences, which echoed findings from another study exploring bereavement‐related MDD . A study conducted in Lebanon  failed to find any significant differences in duration, impairment, and bereavement exclusion symptoms between bereavement‐related and bereavement‐unrelated MDD episodes. Mojtabai 2011 reported that participants with bereavement‐related, single, brief depressive episodes were more likely to experience later onset, but were less likely to have had impairment in role functioning, comorbid anxiety disorders, or a treatment history at baseline. He also found that those participants with bereavement‐related, single, brief episodes were less likely than those with bereavement‐unrelated, single, brief episodes to experience fatigue, increased sleep, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal ideations. The risk of new MDD episodes during the follow‐up period among participants with bereavement‐related, single, brief episodes was similar to people from the general population with no baseline history of MDD.\n\n【14】#### Prolonged Grief Disorder\n\n【15】Grief is a normal reaction to bereavement following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other close person and most bereaved individuals will adequately adjust through healthy grieving, which typically involves completion of loss‐focused and restoration‐focused tasks . These tasks enable the bereaved to come to accept their changed circumstances and reconnect with society or re‐engage in normal, pleasurable activities . However, it has been reported that some bereaved people will experience a bereavement‐related disorder, commonly known as abnormal, pathological, complicated or traumatic grief and Prolonged Grief Disorder . It has also been suggested that the prevalence rates may vary depending on the nature of the loss (i.e. non‐violent or non‐traumatic loss, violent death, or those who experienced a disaster), the variation of instruments and cut‐off scores used for assessment measures  and the lack of consensus on the diagnostic criteria .\n\n【16】In response to increasing evidence for the specificity of a Prolonged or Complex Grief Disorder, and as a compromise between the two proposed diagnostic criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder  and complicated grief , a new diagnostic category, Persistent Complex Bereavement‐Related Disorder (PCBD) was included in the DSM‐5 as requiring further study . In terms of PGD, a new diagnostic category was recommended for inclusion in the 11th edition of the ICD . Despite the ongoing debate surrounding terminology and definitions, we have selected for this review the term 'Prolonged Grief Disorder' (PGD) to reflect the ICD‐11 terminology and the extended period of time beyond the acute phase of grief .\n\n【17】PGD is a debilitating clinical condition . According to the ICD‐11 diagnostic criteria , PGD is characterised by a daily or disabling yearning for the deceased following the death of a significant other, which is accompanied by five or more of the following: confusion about one’s role in life or a diminished sense of self; difficulty accepting the loss; avoidance of reminders of the reality of the loss; inability to trust others since the loss; bitterness or anger related to the loss; difficulty moving on with life; emotional numbness since the loss; feeling that life is unfulfilling, empty or meaningless since the loss; feeling stunned, dazed or shocked by the loss. According to ICD‐11 criteria , at least six months should have passed since the death. In addition, the disturbance should cause significant social, occupational or functional impairment and should not be better accounted for by Major Depressive Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder or Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is suggested that diagnosis can only be made by clinical assessment after six months, to differentiate between maladaptive reactions and normal distress . This is in contrast to DSM‐5 criteria, which stipulate that diagnosis of PCBD cannot be made until 12 months after the death .\n\n【18】PCBD is characterised by unshakeable grief that does not follow the general pattern of improvement over time, but individuals continue to experience persistent and intense emotions or moods and unusual, severe symptoms that impair major areas of functioning, or that cause extreme distress . In addition to the presence of persistent yearning for the deceased, intense sorrow and emotional pain in response to the death, preoccupation with the deceased for at least 12 months following the death of a close other, there should be clinically significant difficulty accepting the death; disbelief or emotional numbness over the loss; difficulty with positive reminiscing about the deceased; bitterness or anger related to the loss; maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death; excessive avoidance of reminders about the loss; a desire to die to be with the deceased; difficulty trusting other people since the death; feeling detached from other people or alone since the death; feeling that life is meaningless or empty without the deceased or the belief that one cannot function without the deceased; confusion about one’s role in life or a diminished sense of one’s identity; or difficulty or reluctance to pursue interests or to plan for the future since the loss. In addition, the disturbance should be causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, and the bereavement reaction must be out of proportion or inconsistent with cultural or religious norms .\n\n【19】#### Differences between MDD and PGD\n\n【20】According to published sources, normal grief, MDD and PGD differ in a number of ways. In normal grief, painful feelings are often mixed with positive memories of the deceased, and self‐esteem is normally preserved, whereas in MDD, mood and ideation are almost constantly negative, and feelings of worthlessness and self‐loathing are common . According to Jordan 2014 , PGD differs in how the symptoms relate to the loss of the deceased, such as rumination presenting as a preoccupation with the deceased, despair and depressed mood linked to separation from the deceased, and guilt relating to self‐blame associated with the individual’s death . Furthermore, yearning and being overwhelmed by the loss were specific to PGD but not to MDD . Diagnosing MDD in the context of bereavement would therefore incorrectly label a normal process as a disorder.\n\n【21】A growing body of evidence suggests that PGD has distinct characteristics when compared to bereavement‐related MDD . However, diagnostic criteria for MDD were not available until the DSM‐III , and diagnostic criteria for PGD were not available until DSM‐IV . Furthermore, Prigerson and colleagues  did not confirm the distinction between traumatic grief and bereavement‐related depression until the mid‐1990s, which means that earlier studies may have misclassified people with MDD, rather than PGD. Randomised trials comparing treatments for PGD  clearly support the efficacy of PGD‐specific treatments, highlighting the importance of an accurate diagnosis . Given the scope of this review, we will report interventions and outcomes for MDD and PGD separately and will acknowledge if the included trials were conducted prior to the diagnostic criteria and distinction being confirmed in the published literature and DSM guidance.\n\n【22】### Description of the intervention\n\n【23】#### Interventions for MDD\n\n【24】Although antidepressants are the mainstay treatment for MDD in primary health care , and have a proven efficacy for treating acute depression , adherence rates are very low  and many people prematurely discontinue antidepressant therapy  due to fears about possible dependency and adverse effects , to uncertainty about the treatment effects , to sociocultural beliefs around taking medication for depression and stigma around depression , and due to lack of patient education and to poor follow‐up .\n\n【25】The 2009 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines for depression , recommend a collaborative care model . A Cochrane Review demonstrated significantly greater improvement in a range of depression outcomes for adults treated using the collaborative care model . Updated NICE guidelines for the assessment and treatment of depression (CG90) promote a stepped‐care model which provides a framework for pharmacological and psychological interventions based on the severity of the depression and preferences of the patient .\n\n【26】Psychological interventions are broadly categorised into four different theoretical or philosophical schools: cognitive, behavioural, psychodynamic and humanistic. For the purposes of this review, cognitive therapy  and behaviour therapy  approaches have been merged to form CBT. Although the acronym ‘CBT’ suggests a unitary therapy , it is now regarded as a family of allied therapies  that draw on a common base of behavioural and cognitive models of psychological disorders and use a set of overlapping techniques . The following cognitive behavioural approaches (e.g. cognitive therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy and prolonged grief‐CBT) will be the main experimental intervention, which will be compared to the non‐CBT interventions outlined below.\n\n【27】According to a meta‐analysis of studies involving psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy , combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was more effective than pharmacotherapy alone in attaining remission and preventing relapse in people with MDD. In another meta‐analysis of randomised trials of behaviour treatment of depression, the authors concluded that behaviour therapy is an effective treatment for depression . Studies have shown that CBT is as effective as antidepressant medication for treating depression, and seems to reduce the risk of relapse even after its discontinuation . The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination  conducted a systematic review on interventions for people bereaved by suicide (e.g. active outreach, bereavement groups, writing exercises, CBT, first talk through, and psychological debriefing). Although the findings revealed methodological flaws and resulted in the authors concluding that there was a lack of robust evidence to be able to offer clear guidance for clinical interventions, they did suggest that the following interventions may be beneficial: psychologist‐led group therapy for children who lost a parent; combined health professional‐ and volunteer‐led group therapy for adults who lost a family member; and family cognitive behavioural therapy with a trained psychiatric nurse .\n\n【28】#### Interventions for PGD\n\n【29】It is now accepted that PGD requires a specific diagnosis and intervention to enable bereaved individuals to overcome the barriers to loss‐orientation and restoration‐orientation tasks . Despite how PGD has been classified and how concepts and diagnostic criteria for grief have evolved over time, core symptoms overlap, such as intense yearning and preoccupation with the loss, reactive distress symptoms and social/identity disruption . PGD is also associated with significant morbidity and suicide risk, and it has been suggested that grief support groups may be helpful for some bereaved people . It has been reported that psychotherapies using cognitive and behavioural principles to directly target PGD are effective .\n\n【30】The following cognitive behavioural approaches (e.g. cognitive therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy and prolonged grief‐CBT) will be the main experimental intervention, which will be compared to the non‐CBT interventions outlined below.\n\n【31】### How the intervention might work\n\n【32】In CBT, therapists and patients work collaboratively to understand the link between thoughts, feelings and behaviours. They identify and modify unhelpful thinking patterns, underlying assumptions and idiosyncratic cognitive schemata (e.g. core beliefs, underlying assumptions or associated strategies) about the self, others and the world . Cognitive change methods for depression target the automatic thought level in the first instance and include thought catching, reality testing and task assigning as well as generating alternative strategies . Behavioural experiments are then used to re‐evaluate underlying beliefs and assumptions . According to NICE Guidelines , treatment is normally delivered over 15 to 20 sessions, depending on the severity of depression.\n\n【33】CBT‐based models have been developed to treat PGD. For example, rational emotive behaviour therapy  is used to target ‘irrational beliefs’ and teaches the bereaved to practice more adaptive thinking and to re‐organise their life to maintain bonds with the deceased . Similarly, CBT techniques such as imaginal exposure  are useful in treating individuals with PGD, where the moment of death is a distressing experience . Prolonged Grief CBT (PG‐CBT) offers 25 sessions (five of which are optional) which focus on stabilising and motivating the patient, exploration of the grief situation, teaching relaxation, focusing on confrontation and reinterpretation of the cognitions and perceptions of themselves, and on future prospects while maintaining a healthy bond to the deceased . Results suggest that PG‐CBT is highly effective in reducing grief severity and compares well to other treatments for PGD . Further research is planned to test PG‐CBT against Present‐Centred Therapy (PCT) .\n\n【34】CBT interventions which combine exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring  have been demonstrated to be effective in alleviating symptoms of PGD . Boelen 2007 compared CBT and supportive treatment for bereaved individuals with PGD who each received 12 weeks of treatment (cognitive restructuring, exposure, and social support). Findings indicated that those who had CBT improved more than the social support group, and that exposure which included behavioural and emotional elements was more effective than cognitive construction . Wagner and Maercker tested the longer‐term effects of an Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioural intervention and reported that the reduction in symptoms of complicated grief observed at post‐treatment was maintained at 18 month follow‐up .\n\n【35】#### Non‐CBT approaches\n\n【36】a) Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT) was developed for PGD . It is based on attachment theory, and integrates the use of interpersonal therapy, CBT and motivational interviewing over 16 weekly sessions . Shear 2014 reported that CGT had a significantly greater effect and higher tolerability, when compared with grief‐focused Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) among older adults who had experienced a loss.\n\n【37】b) Psychodynamic or psychoanalytic approaches (e.g. brief psychotherapy, countertransference, transference, Freudian, Jungian, Kleinian, person‐centred therapy, interpersonal therapy) . Grounded in psychoanalytic theory , psychodynamic approaches use the therapeutic relationship to explore and resolve unconscious conflict through transference and interpretation . A number of randomised trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of both Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) and CGT for treating PGD, with significantly better outcomes reported with CGT . A systematic review of interventions for depression indicated that IPT was more effective than CBT .\n\n【38】c) Humanistic approaches (e.g. existential therapy, gestalt therapy, transactional analysis). Whilst contemporary models differ in their clinical approach, all focus on the therapeutic relationship , within which the ‘core conditions’  are cornerstones for facilitating recipient insight and change.\n\n【39】d) Family or systemic therapy focuses on the family and aims to enhance the ability of family members to support each other, or to develop coping skills for various life situations, including long‐term illness . Family therapy has been used to support relatives of people with cancer during the palliative phase and into bereavement, and has been reported to reduce the severity and development of PGD .\n\n【40】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【41】There is evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of different psychological therapies for treating MDD and PGD. These are based on randomised trials using a range of measures and instruments for MDD and PGD.\n\n【42】There are already some published systematic reviews exploring bereavement and PGD. One assessed interventions linked to bereavement following suicide , but the included studies varied in the type of intervention, participants, and how the intervention was delivered, with the authors concluding that evidence for interventions was not robust. Another review explored the prevalence of PGD in an adult bereaved population , but excluded violent deaths and intervention‐based studies. We are aware of two published reviews focusing on the effects of psychological therapies for PGD. One examined interventions following perinatal deaths , and the other explored preventative and treatment interventions, which had very limited inclusion criteria and did not search the grey literature .\n\n【43】In view of bereavement‐related depression and PGD being classified as distinct disorders, and the need to base treatment decisions on reliable, up‐to‐date evidence, it is important to compare the effectiveness of psychological therapies for individuals with bereavement‐related MDD or with PGD, which we will do in this review. Our findings may inform treatment decision‐making by trained healthcare professionals, therapists, counsellors or policy makers and may inform the development of guidelines for routine treatment for bereavement‐related MDD and PGD.\n\n【44】Objectives\n----------\n\n【45】To assess the effectiveness of CBT (e.g. cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy, prolonged grief CBT) compared with non‐CBT therapies (e.g. psychodynamic, humanistic, family or systemic therapies) for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【46】To assess the effectiveness of CBT compared with usual care or waiting list for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【47】To assess the effectiveness of CBT compared with pharmacological interventions (e.g. antidepressant medications and other drug therapies used explicitly for treating depressive disorders ) for treating people with bereavement‐related MDD or PGD.\n\n【48】Methods\n-------\n\n【49】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【50】#### Types of studies\n\n【51】We have prepared this Methods section using the template text provided by the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group.\n\n【52】We will include individually‐randomised trials and cluster‐randomised trials, regardless of setting, sample size, or duration. We will not include cross‐over trials, as this is a design rarely used in psychological therapy trials.\n\n【53】We will include studies regardless of language of publication. If necessary, we will seek resources to translate studies not published in English, because this will allow us to present a more global picture.\n\n【54】We will include studies if a structured or semi‐structured diagnostic clinical interview was conducted by a mental health professional or a trained researcher using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 , or where other appropriate psychometric data were assessed and reported (e.g. acceptable inter‐rater reliability).\n\n【55】#### Types of participants\n\n【56】##### Participant characteristics\n\n【57】We will include studies with bereaved individuals who were diagnosed and treated for a MDD or for PGD. We will only include MDD‐related studies if they clearly identify that the study population were diagnosed with MDD following a bereavement, and only if half or more of the study population meet the agreed inclusion criteria.\n\n【58】We will set no restrictions on gender or ethnicity. With regard to age, we will only include studies involving bereaved adults, or where most of the study population includes adults. We define adults as individuals aged 18 or over, which is based on the groups covered in the NICE Guideline on depression in adults , and UK child protection law , which defines individuals under the age of 18 as children.\n\n【59】Based on our understanding of how the nature of the relationship between the deceased and the bereaved impacts on bereavement outcome , we will include individuals who are related to or were in a relationship with the deceased (e.g. spouse, partner, adult child, parent, sibling). We will only include studies relating to a live‐born person, and will exclude termination of pregnancy, miscarriage and stillbirth.\n\n【60】As the prevalence of PGD differs according to cause of death , we will include any health condition, accident, homicide, suicide, road traffic crash, act of terrorism or natural disaster.\n\n【61】Given the lack of consensus between diagnostic criteria for PGD , the potential for misclassifying MDD prior to the clear distinction between MDD and PGD being confirmed in the literature , as well as the debate about the 'bereavement exclusion' in DSM  and the ICD‐11 criteria that at least six months should have passed since the death , we will not place any restrictions on when the individual was bereaved. To avoid compromising generalisation from the systematic review, we will include all studies, but will use sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of the PGD studies that include individuals bereaved for less than six months.\n\n【62】##### Diagnosis\n\n【63】We will include studies where the participants were included on the basis of a MDD diagnosis, which was determined by standardised diagnostic criteria including the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM versions III, IV  and 5 ), the NICE Guidance  for classifying depression, the _Inventory International Statistical Classification of Diseases_ ICD‐10  and ICD‐11 . We will include studies if a structured or semi‐structured diagnostic clinical interview was conducted by a mental health professional or by a trained researcher using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 . We will also include studies where participants were selected based on reaching a predefined cut‐off point on a validated depression measure tool such as the Beck Depression Inventory ; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ; Centre for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale ; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ; or Montgomery Depression Scale .\n\n【64】We will include studies where participants were included following a diagnosis of PGD, identified using standardised diagnostic criteria outlined in DSM‐IV , DSM‐5  and ICD‐11. In addition, we will include studies where participants were recruited based on reaching the predefined cut‐off score on any validated measures, such as the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) ; Inventory of Complicated Grief‐Revised (ICG‐R) ; Prolonged Grief Interview‐13 item version (PG‐13) ; Traumatic Grief Inventory Self‐Report version (TGI‐SR) ; Brief Grief Questionnaire  or any other validated measure. We will include validated measures administered through self‐report, structured clinical interview or informant report, where the informant is a member of staff or relative.\n\n【65】##### Comorbidities\n\n【66】We will include studies where participants have other health conditions (e.g. physical or mental), as long as the comorbidity is not the main focus of the study.\n\n【67】##### Setting\n\n【68】All types of setting will be eligible for inclusion: inpatient (psychiatric setting), outpatient, and primary care.\n\n【69】#### Types of interventions\n\n【70】##### Experimental Intervention\n\n【71】*   The principal psychological intervention will be CBT (e.g. cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy, PG‐CBT) delivered to individuals or groups as treatment for bereavement‐related MDD or PGD. We will include face‐to‐face and online‐based CBT programmes. There will be no restrictions on the duration or frequency of treatment interventions. We will explore training levels, qualifications and supervision of individuals delivering the intervention when comparing any differences in outcome scores.\n\n【72】##### Comparator intervention\n\n【73】Studies with the following comparisons will be included in the review.\n\n【74】*   CBT versus non‐cognitive behaviour therapies (e.g. psychodynamic, humanistic or integrative therapies, family therapy or systemic therapies).\n\n【75】*   CBT versus selected pharmacological interventions (e.g. antidepressant medications and other drug therapies used explicitly for treating depressive disorders ).\n\n【76】*   CBT versus usual care (e.g. participants could receive appropriate medical care during the course of the study on a naturalistic basis, deemed necessary by the clinician).\n\n【77】*   CBT versus waiting list (e.g. delayed delivery of the intervention to the control group until after participants in the intervention group have completed treatment).\n\n【78】We will include any mode of delivery, such as face‐to‐face contact, telephone or online interventions, and we will include individual, group and family therapy. Due to the wide range of treatments being examined, we will place no restrictions on the duration or frequency of treatment interventions.\n\n【79】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【80】We will include all eligible studies in the review, but will only be able to include those that provide the necessary outcome data in the relevant meta‐analyses.\n\n【81】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【82】*   Treatment response: the number of participants showing an improvement in MDD or PGD symptoms measured separately or clinically significant changes (treatment response/endpoint functioning) versus no significant change in the severity of MDD or PGD symptoms measured separately, captured using the standardised DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria, or NICE Guidance . Where treatment scores are captured using validated measures, the authors will highlight clinically significant changes. For example, people who have been clinically diagnosed using the BDI  where scores from 0 to 9 represent minimal depressive symptoms, scores of 10 to 16 indicate mild depression, scores of 17 to 29 indicate moderate depression, and scores of 30 to 63 indicate severe depression. The authors will do likewise with other validated measures for MDD or PGD.\n\n【83】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【84】*   Adverse events outcome: dropout for any reason.\n\n【85】*   Occurrence of bereaved relatives attempting or completing suicide (if incidence reported in selected studies). We will summarise in narrative form adverse effect outcomes such as dropout due to completed suicide.\n\n【86】*   Reduction in MDD or PGD scores, measured using a validated continuous scale as outlined above in diagnosis.\n\n【87】*   Changes in the use of routinely‐prescribed antidepressant medication or other interventions (e.g. bereavement support groups).\n\n【88】###### Timing of outcome assessment\n\n【89】Where available, we will assess outcomes at short term (end of treatment), medium term (six months after treatment), and long term (more than six months after treatment).\n\n【90】Our primary time point will be medium term, because this will demonstrate if there were sustained benefits from the intervention. Where data are available, other time points will help to demonstrate if there were immediate and longer term benefits.\n\n【91】###### Hierarchy of outcome measures\n\n【92】We will include any validated measures for depression or complicated or prolonged grief. We will prioritise clinician‐administered scales over informant‐rated scales and self‐reported scales. If multiple outcome measures of the same type are used (e.g. two self‐report measures for PGD), we will choose the outcome measure that is most frequently used across the included studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Controversy exists over whether LCPUFA are essential nutrients for preterm infants who may not be able to synthesise sufficient amounts of LCPUFA to satisfy the needs of the developing brain and retina.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The aim of this review is to assess whether supplementation of formula with LCPUFA is safe and of benefit to preterm infants.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】Trials were identified by MEDLINE , Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  and by checking reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】All randomised trials of formula supplemented with LCPUFA and with clinical endpoints were reviewed.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Eleven randomised trials assessing the clinical effects of feeding formula supplemented with LCPUFA were included in the review.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Of the eleven randomised trials included in the review, two of these were not classified as of high quality despite blinded assessment and complete follow‐up, due to problems with assessment methodology.  \n\n【13】**Visual acuity**  \nVisual acuity over the first year was measured by Teller acuity cards in six studies, by VEP in four studies and by ERG in two studies. Most studies found no significant differences in any visual assessment between supplemented and control infants.\n\n【14】**Development**  \nMost of the trials have used Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 12 to 24 months postterm and shown no significant effect following supplementation. Meta‐analysis of BSID of three studies  shows no significant effect of supplementation on development. Carlson 1993 and Carlson 1996 demonstrated lower novelty preferences (possibly predictive of lower intelligence) in the supplemented compared with the control group. The investigators however concluded that supplemented infants may have more rapid visual information processing given that they had more looks and each look was of shorter duration.\n\n【15】**Growth**  \nMost trials have reported no significant effect of LCPUFA supplementation on growth of preterm infants. Two trials  suggest that LCPUFA supplemented infants grow less well than controls, possibly due to a reduction in AA levels which occurs when n‐3 supplements are used without n‐6 supplements. Recent trials with addition of AA to the supplement have reported no significant effect on growth. Fewtrell 2002 reported mild reductions in length and weight z scores at 18 months. Contrary to these results, the meta‐analysis of five studies  showed increased weight and length at two months post‐term in supplemented infants.  \n\n【16】**Side effects**  \nUauy 1992 reported no significant effect of LCPUFA supplementation on bleeding time and red cell membrane fragility.\n\n【17】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【18】Infants enrolled in the trials were relatively mature and healthy preterm infants. Assessment schedule and methodology, dose and source of supplementation and fatty acid composition of the control formula varied between trials. No long‐term benefits were demonstrated for infants receiving formula supplemented with LCPUFA. There was no evidence that supplementation of formula with n‐3 and n‐6 LCPUFA impaired the growth of preterm infants.\n### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Populatio\n\n【20】*   Enteral Feeding\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【21】###### Interventio\n\n【22】*   Infant Formula\n*   Polyunsaturated Fat Supplementation\n\n【23】###### Compariso\n\n【24】*   Infant Formula\n\n【25】###### Outcom\n\n【26】*   Eyes and vision\n*   Visual Acuity\n*   Growth\n*   Body weight\n*   Head Circumference\n*   Height and growth measurements\n*   Neurodevelopmental Delay\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【28】----------------------\n\n【29】### Not enough evidence to show the effect of supplementing baby formulas for preterm babies with fat supplements to improve early sight development and intelligence.\n\n【30】Babies fed with breast milk are believed to have more mature sight skills and a higher IQ (Intelligence Quota) than babies fed with formula. It has been suggested that low levels of longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) found in formula, may contribute to the lower IQ levels and sight skills. Some formulas are available with added LCPUFA. The review of trials found the evidence does not support the claim that preterm infants have improved visual and intellectual development if their formula is supplemented with LCPUFA. LCPUFA supplementation does not significantly influence the growth of preterm infants.\n\n【31】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

These systems are based on the assumption that externally promoted adherence to evidence‐based standards (through inspection/assessment) will result in higher quality of health care. However, the benefits of external inspection in terms of organisational, provider and patient level outcomes are not clear.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the effectiveness of external inspection of compliance with standards in improving healthcare organisation behaviour, healthcare professional behaviour and patient outcomes.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the following electronic databases for studies: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Scopus, HMIC, Index to Theses and Intute from their inception dates up to May 2011. There was no language restriction and studies were included regardless of publication status. We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of relevant papers, accreditation bodies and the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO), regarding any further published or unpublished work.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time‐series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) evaluating the effect of external inspection against external standards on healthcare organisation change, healthcare professional behaviour or patient outcomes in hospitals, primary healthcare organisations and other community‐based healthcare organisations.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. Since meta‐analysis was not possible, we produced a narrative results summary.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We identified one cluster‐RCT involving 20 South African public hospitals  and one ITS involving all acute trusts in England  for inclusion in this review.\n\n【12】Salmon and colleagues  showed mixed effects of a hospital accreditation system on the compliance with COHSASA (the Council for Health Services Accreditation for South Africa) accreditation standards and eight indicators of hospital quality. Significantly improved total mean compliance score with COHSASA accreditation standards was found for 21/28 service elements: mean intervention effect (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 30% (23% to 57%) (P < 0.001). The score increased from 48% to 78% in intervention hospitals, while remaining the same in control hospitals (43%). A sub‐analysis of 424 a priori identified critical criteria (19 service elements) showed significantly improved compliance with the critical standards (P < 0.001). The score increased from 41% (21% to 46%) to 75% (55% to 96%) in intervention hospitals, but was unchanged in control hospitals (37%). Only one of the nine intervention hospitals gained full accreditation status at the end of the study period, with two others reached pre‐accreditation status.The median intervention effect (range) for the indicators of hospital quality of care was 2.4 (‐1.9 to +11.8) and only one of the eight indicators: 'nurses perception of clinical quality, participation and teamwork' was significantly improved (mean intervention effect 5.7, P = 0.03).\n\n【13】Re‐analysis of the MRSA (methicillin‐resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ ) data showed statistically non‐significant effects of the Healthcare Commissions Infection Inspection programme.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】We only identified two studies for inclusion in this review, which highlights the paucity of high‐quality controlled evaluations of the effectiveness of external inspection systems. No firm conclusions could therefore be drawn about the effectiveness of external inspection on compliance with standards.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Healthcare Professional\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   External inspection\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Prescribing rate\n*   Costs and Cost Analysis\n*   Referral rate\n*   Death\n*   Determination Of Outcome, Satisfactory To Patient\n*   Organizational performance\n*   Inpatient Care\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Waiting time\n*   Quality of care\n*   Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Can third party inspections of whether or not healthcare organisations are fulfilling mandatory standards improve care processes, professional practice and patient recovery?\n\n【25】Third party (external) review systems are used within health care settings as a way to increase the compliance with evidence‐based standards, but very little is known of their benefits in terms of organisational, provider and patient level outcomes, or their cost‐effectiveness.\n\n【26】We searched the literature for evaluations of the effectiveness of external inspection of compliance with standards including; randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time‐series (ITSs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs). We found only two relevant studies: one RCT involving 20 hospitals in the Republic of South Africa and one uncontrolled before and after study (that required re‐analysis as an ITS) involving all acute trusts in England.\n\n【27】The RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a hospital accreditation system showed improved compliance with COHSASA (the Council for Health Services Accreditation for South Africa) accreditation standards (involving 28 service elements), but little effect on eight indicators of hospital quality. Significantly improved compliance score with COHSASA accreditation standards was reported for 21/28 service elements: mean intervention effect (95% confidence interval (CI)) 30% (23% to 57%, P < 0.001). The score increased from 48% to 78% in intervention hospitals, while remaining the same in control hospitals (43%). A sub‐analysis of 424 critical criteria, showed significantly improved mean compliance with the critical standards (P < 0.001). The score increased from 41% (21% to 46%) to 75% (55% to 96%) in hospitals with the accreditation programme, but was unchanged in control hospitals. However, only one of the nine intervention hospitals gained full accreditation status at the end of the study period, and with two others reached pre‐accreditation status. Only one of eight indicators of hospital quality: 'nurses perception of clinical quality, participation and teamwork' was significantly improved (mean intervention effect 5.7%, P = 0.03).\n\n【28】Re‐analysis of the patient MRSA (methicillin‐resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ ) infection data showed statistically non‐significant effects of the Healthcare Commissions Infection Inspection programme.\n\n【29】Too few studies were identified for inclusion in this review to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of external review of compliance with standards in improving healthcare organisation behaviour, healthcare professional behaviour or patient outcomes. Instead, this review highlights the lack of high‐quality studies evaluating the effectiveness of external inspections on compliance with standards in healthcare organisations.\n\n【30】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of outreach strategies for expanding insurance coverage of children who are eligible for health insurance schemes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Health insurance has the potential to enhance access to health care and improve the quality of life for the insured population while protecting them from financially burdensome healthcare expenses. However, for most developing countries and some developed countries (for example the United States) which have not achieved universal coverage of health insurance by a tax‐based system or social health insurance, lack of health insurance coverage is still both a social concern and a policy issue. In these countries, the particular groups at risk are children, elderly, women, low‐income populations, rural populations, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants. In this review, we will limit our focus to children, one of the groups most likely to lack health insurance.\n\n【7】In the United States, for example, the figures indicate that the proportion of children without health insurance rose from 10.8% in 2004 to 11.2% in 2005 . For children in low‐income families or children of immigrants, the situation is worse. There were 20.3% of U.S. children in low‐income families (income less than 200% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)) without health insurance in 2004, compared with only 3.2% in more wealthy families (400% of FPL and above) . Latino children have the highest risk of being uninsured of any racial/ethnic group among US children, with 21% of Latino children being uninsured, compared with 7% of non‐Latino white children in 2003 . A survey in Shanghai, China found that the uninsured rate of migrant children was 65.6% in 2006 compared to 21.2% in permanent‐residence children, and for both groups, children in lower income families were more likely to be uninsured .\n\n【8】Many studies have demonstrated that uninsured children have less access to health care than insured children. For example, one study found that uninsured children in the US were less likely to have a regular source of primary health care, and that they used medical and dental care less often . Studies in Guangxi and Gansu, China and Wisconsin, US revealed that immunization of children was positively associated with coverage of health insurance schemes . A consequence of low access to, and use of, health care is the poor health status of uninsured children compared with insured children .\n\n【9】According to the scoping review we conducted in 2008, there are many strategies to expand health insurance coverage . The strategies can be divided into two main categories: strategies applied in the design stage and strategies applied in the implementation stage.\n\n【10】Table 1. Strategies to expand health insurance\n\n| **Strategies**  | **Contents**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Improving design of health insurance schemes  | Modifying the eligibility criteria Making the premium affordable Improving healthcare delivery  |\n| Improving implementation of insurance schemes (outreach strategies)  | Increasing awareness of schemes and benefits Modifying enrollment Improving the management and organization of insurance schemes  |\n\n【12】The purpose of the first type of strategy is to improve the design of health insurance schemes, by measures such as modifying eligibility criteria to include more children; setting an appropriate premium level or providing subsidies; improving the content, price, and quality of healthcare package. For example, in June 1998, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in California expanded eligibility for public health insurance from 200% of FPL up to 250% for children under 19 years . In the School Health Insurance Program of Egypt, school children need pay only a part of the premium, with a matching contribution by government to lower the burden on low‐income families . The SCHIP in New York State increases its benefits to include emergency, preventive and some routine dental care to attract more children .\n\n【13】The other type of strategy is to improve implementation of existing insurance schemes so as to enroll more eligible populations, by measures such as increasing awareness about insurance or making the application process easier and more user‐friendly. For example, California’s advertising campaign via television, radio, and print in 48 counties was implemented in both English and Spanish to inform more eligible children about insurance schemes . Georgia State shortened its application form in 1993, and saw a 42% increase in enrollment among pregnant women and children .\n\n【14】In this review, we will focus on evaluating the second category of interventions. This is because even if a health insurance scheme is well designed, that still cannot ensure that all eligible children will join it. Nearly 8.3 million children in the US without health insurance were already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP in 2005 . Some researchers have explored the reasons for this low enrollment of eligible children. An interview about children’s enrollment in SCHIP in the US found that some members of indigenous groups did not know about SCHIP or, if they did know, were not aware of their eligibility to enroll or exemption from premiums and cost‐sharing requirement . Besides lack of awareness of insurance, the complexity of the application process can also be a significant barrier. A survey of parents indicated that although 93.5% had heard of the insurance programs for their children, only 48.1% thought the application processes were easy .\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】Outreach strategies in this review are measures to improve the implementation of existing health insurance to cover its eligible population, which aim to maximize the enrollment rate of health insurance without changing the content of insurance (eligible population, premium, benefit package). These strategies can be mainly grouped into the following categories.\n\n【17】*   **Increasing awareness of schemes:** this includes television, radio advertisements, hotline or information distribution through schools or other specific places for raising awareness of insurance programs. For example, many states in the US distributed information about SCHIP in venues where target parents and children tend to congregate, including early childhood centers, schools, hospitals, and religious institutions .\n\n【18】*   **Modifying enrollment:** this refers to any methods of improving or simplifying the enrollment procedures, including programs that help families with the paperwork and other aspects of application; outstationing of eligibility workers; authorizing more entities to interview applicants; shared eligibility with other insurance or public programs. For example, the state government of California worked with community‐based organizations to provide application assistance to families who were potentially eligible for Healthy Families (California SCHIP) or Medicaid ; Florida’s Healthy Start Program has linked eligibility for Medicaid through the school lunch program, in which children eligible for the school lunch program are automatically eligible for health insurance .\n\n【19】*   **Improving the management and organization of insurance schemes:** this refers to interventions to improve the capacity of insurers to manage the insurance schemes, including improving information systems and training staff for better and more effective outreach and management. For example, in order to enroll Latino children, many states in the US have supported staff development and training in cultural competency to include appropriate family members .\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】Many outreach strategies having been implemented and evaluated. A critical evaluation and systematic summary of the effectiveness of these interventions would help to inform decisions by policymakers regarding interventions to expand health insurance coverage.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the effectiveness of outreach strategies for expanding insurance coverage of children who are eligible for health insurance schemes.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】*   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster randomized trials\n\n【28】*   Controlled clinical trials (CCTs)\n\n【29】*   Controlled before‐after (CBA) studies provided that:\n\n【30】*   1.  pre‐ and post‐intervention periods for study and control groups are the same;\n\n【31】    2.  the choice of the control site is appropriate, e.g. no major baseline differences between study and control groups;\n\n【32】    3.  there are at least two intervention sites and two control sites.\n\n【33】*   Interrupted time series (ITS) studies provided that:\n\n【34】*   1.  there is a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred;\n\n【35】    2.  there are at least three data points before and three after the intervention.\n\n【36】#### Types of participants\n\n【37】The participants we will include in this review are children and young people who are eligible for any kind of health insurance scheme, but have not been enrolled. The age bracket of children will depend on the eligibility criteria of the health insurance programs. For example, Medicaid covers children aged six through 18 living in poverty ; SCHIP targets children under 19 years old with family incomes of less than 200% of FPL ; Egypt’s School Health Insurance Program aims to cover all school age children .\n\n【38】#### Types of interventions\n\n【39】We will include any outreach intervention for improving implementation of existing health insurance and enrolling more eligible children into health insurance programs. They may be one or a mixture of the following measures.\n\n【40】*   **Increasing awareness of schemes:** television or radio advertisements, or information distribution through specific places, etc.\n\n【41】*   **Modifying enrollment:** helping families with the paperwork and the other procedures necessary to apply for health insurance; outstationing of eligibility workers; authorizing more entities to interview applicants; shared eligibility with other insurance or public programs; and other methods for improving application procedures.\n\n【42】*   **Improving the management and organization of insurance schemes:** improving information system, training staff for better management, and other methods for improving management.\n\n【43】If a study evaluated interventions which included both changing the design of health insurance and outreach interventions, we will include it only if it differentiated the effectiveness of changing design from the effectiveness of outreach interventions.\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【46】The enrollment of eligible children into health insurance programs. We will include only studies reporting this outcome.\n\n【47】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【48】*   Any measures of health service utilization by insured children.\n\n【49】*   Any measures of health status of insured children.\n\n【50】*   Any measures of attitude or satisfaction of children and their parents.\n\n【51】*   Any measures of costs of the interventions.\n\n【52】*   Any adverse effects of interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although adjuvant chemotherapy benefits patients with stage III disease, there is uncertainty of such benefit in stage II colon cancer. A systematic review of the literature was performed to better define the potential benefits of adjuvant therapy for patients with stage II colon cancer.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】: To determine the effects of adjuvant therapy on overall survival and disease‐free survival in patients with stage II colon cancer.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】: Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1986‐2007), EMBASE (1980‐2007), and EBM Reviews ‐ Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  were searched using the medical headings \"colonic neoplasms\", \"colorectal neoplasms\", \"adjuvant chemotherapy\", \"adjuvant radiotherapy\" and \"immunotherapy\", and the text words \"colon cancer\" and \"colonic neoplasms\". In addition, proceedings from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology (1996 to 2004) as well as personal files were searched for additional information.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】: Randomized trials or meta‐analyses containing data on stage II colon cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy versus surgery alone.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】: Three reviewers summarized the results of selected studies. The main outcomes of interest were overall and disease‐free survival, however, data on toxicity and treatment delivery were also recorded.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】: With regards to the effect of adjuvant therapy on stage II colon cancer, the pooled relative risk ratio for overall survival was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.88, 1.05). With regards to disease‐free survival, the pooled relative risk ratio was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.75, 0.92).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】: Although there was no improvement in overall survival in the pooled analysis, we did find that disease‐free survival in patients with stage II colon cancer was signficantly better with the use of adjuvant therapy. It seems reasonable to discuss the benefits of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with those stage II patients who have high risk features, including obstruction, perforation, inadequate lymph node sampling or T4 disease. The co‐morbidities and likelihood of tolerating adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should be considered as well. There exists a need to further define which high‐risk features in stage II colon cancer patients should be used to select patients for adjuvant therapy. Also, researchers must continue to search for other therapies which might be more effective, shorter in duration and less toxic than those available today.\n\n【14】### Adjuvant therapy for completely resected stage II colon cancer\n\n【15】Colon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the Western world. A large proportion of colon cancer patients can be cured by surgical resection alone. For those patients with lymph node positive (stage III) disease, the recurrence rate can exceed 50% and adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. In patients without lymph node involvement (stage I and II), the prognosis is quite good with surgery alone, with survival rates of 75% to 95% at 5 years. However, some patients with high risk stage II disease have a relapse rate approaching that of stage III colon cancer patients. Due to the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy in stage III disease, a similar approach has been considered for patients with stage II disease. We performed a systematic review looking at all randomized clinical trials evaluating stage II colon cancer patients and adjuvant therapy versus surgery alone. Our review found that adjuvant therapy ‐either systemic or regional chemotherapy or immunotherapy‐ can improve the outcomes of stage II patients. In counselling individual patients, the advice given should be conditioned by the patient's age and comorbidities. In addition, the high risk features of the tumour should also be considered when contemplating the benefits of systemic therapy in patients with stage II colon cancer. Further investigation is needed to elucidate which patient and tumour factors can be used to select stage II colon cancer patients for adjuvant therapy. There also exists a need to continue to search for other adjuvant therapies which might be more effective, shorter in duration and less toxic than those available today.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "92d708ae-2b79-44b6-8583-60fc8afc6c6f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of telephone interventions, delivered by healthcare professionals, when compared to usual care or non‐telephone‐based support interventions for educating and psychosocially supporting informal carers of people with acute and chronic diagnosed illnesses, on these carers' quality of life, psychosocial and physical well‐being. We aim, additionally, to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of telephone interventions.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Many people with diagnosed medical conditions are dependent upon family members and informal caregivers (that is a caregiver who is not paid ), to provide support and care, usually in the home of the person needing care . While the care provided varies according to individuals' needs, with care categories defined as low, medium (instrumental care such as cooking and shopping), medium with personal assistance (such as washing and dressing) and high , in many instances informal carers find themselves in a caring role for which they are ill prepared . Providing care may impact negatively on the caregiver from an emotional, physical, social and financial perspective . Internationally, the focus of health care is to have people cared for in the community for as long as is possible. The aim is to shift to community‐based and patient‐centred paradigms of care for the treatment of chronic diseases ; and, where possible, prevent admission to secondary healthcare facilities. Unpaid or informal caregivers have been described as the backbone of the healthcare system ; and worldwide they play a key role in the provision of care, saving billions in healthcare expenditure .\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】The international literature suggests that caregiving impacts similarly on caregivers irrespective of geographical location or of the illness being experienced by the care recipient. In a UK study, Golics 2013 reported that caregivers caring for family members with a range of illnesses experienced worry, frustration, anger and guilt. For some, adjustment to the role is difficult and requires significant emotional and life changes. This is reflected across the world with national studies from Japan , South Korea  and Canada  highlighting the negative effects of caregiving on specific groups of informal caregivers.\n\n【8】Family members providing unpaid care have been described “…as a hidden \"patient\" group…” ( Golics 2013 , p795). The need for professional support for caregivers has been reported and highlighted across a range of acute (i.e. time‐bound and responsive to treatment) and chronic (i.e. not time‐bound, non‐curable and susceptible to remission and exacerbation) conditions . This includes support for caregivers of people surviving complex illness , patients with cancers , chronic and terminal illnesses , mental health problems , stroke , Parkinson’s disease , dementia , multiple sclerosis , and family caregivers who are new to the role . Golics 2013 argues that having access to people with the knowledge and skill to provide support, in particular emotional support, may ease the burden of caring.\n\n【9】Although the impact of caregiving may be similar, how it is experienced by caregivers differs. Within caregiver groups such as caregivers of older persons  and people with schizophrenia , researchers have noted that gender, relationship to patient, level of contact with the patient , solo caregiver status, younger age  and unemployment  all influence how caregivers experience burden. McCabe 2009 further reports lower mood and quality of life in caregivers of people with motor neurone disease and Huntington’s disease compared to caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Adjusting to the role of caregiver has been described as a non–linear or oscillating process  that is continual , gradual and occurs over time . The process of adjustment differs for caregivers within and across conditions ; and results in significant emotional and life changes, particularly in the first year . For some, burden and anxiety levels decrease over time , with significant reductions found within a year , though decreases are less likely if caregivers have poor health .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Healthcare professionals commonly communicate with care recipients and their family members by telephone. A number of research studies have evaluated use of the telephone only , or the telephone as a component of an intervention . Some of the interventions are delivered by healthcare professionals and others are delivered by peers , or co‐facilitated by befriending volunteers . In this review, the focus will be on evaluating the telephone only, as a support intervention, delivered by healthcare professionals for caregivers of people with acute and chronic conditions. In this review, a telephone intervention is defined as an intervention that enables healthcare professionals to verbally communicate remotely with caregivers. A healthcare professional is a trained healthcare person who has received specific healthcare education and training in the management and care of people with diagnosed conditions, their family members, significant others or caregivers (e.g. nurses, medical doctors, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, counsellors/psychologists and dieticians/nutritionists).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】#### Professional support\n\n【14】Healthcare professionals provide services to patients and families/caregivers within the scope of their professional practice . This includes direct care to people with diagnosed illnesses and indirect care, in the form of supportive advice, professional information and psychosocial/educational support to carers of people with diagnosed illnesses. In general, the benefits of professional support are likely to be dependent on the issues being addressed , and the readiness and receptivity of the person receiving the support . Reinhard 2008 demonstrated that professional support selectively reduces caregiver burden for those caring for people with mental health problems. Specific types of professional support such as practical advice in managing behaviours were found to be helpful in reducing objective burden (family arguments, missing days at work, household disruptions) . Deek 2016 also reported favourably on family‐centred self‐care interventions, delivered by trained personnel, for adults living with chronic conditions and concluded that appropriate education and support should be provided by healthcare professionals . Professionals have the education and training to provide emotional support to caregivers, helping ease the social isolation and emotional demands of caregiving . A number of strategies, as described below, that aim to improve caregiver outcomes are within the scope of the 'support' role of healthcare professionals.\n\n【15】#### Strategies to improve caregiver outcomes\n\n【16】Caregiver support programmes help promote caregiver health by providing psychological support, information and education to caregivers, while taking cognisance of caregivers’ limited time and resources . These psychoeducational programmes help carers develop skills in identifying signs of distress, managing symptoms, coping strategies/skills, and provide help with finding and accessing social support services . The telephone has been described as a good means of exchanging information, providing health education and advice, managing symptoms, recognising complications early, giving reassurance and providing quality service .\n\n【17】Strategies to improve caregiver outcomes include providing education or information, assisting carers with problem solving, learning coping skills/behaviours, effective use of resources, seeking out social support and identification of signs of distress . Coping strategies have been effective in improving the psychological health of caregivers of people with dementia . Likewise preparedness to care was found to reduce caregiver burden for caregivers of older persons , and those with cancer . It was also found to ameliorate some aspects of role strain , and was the strongest predictor for lowering caregiver stress in stroke caregivers . Failure to help caregivers master the skills and ability to manage their own health and well‐being during the early phases of caregiving may lead to greater difficulty integrating strategies, such as coping strategies, into daily life in later stages of the caregiving process . All of these strategies are amenable to delivery/initiation via the telephone. Reinhard 2008 contends that \"...even a simple one‐to‐one telephone call may be effective in helping the caregiver...\" (p345). In this review, any strategy involving educational and psychosocial support strategies, or a combination of these, that focus on caregiver quality of life, burden, skill acquisition, psychological health, knowledge and understanding, health status and well‐being, family functioning and satisfaction will be considered .\n\n【18】#### Barriers to supporting caregivers\n\n【19】Many factors mitigate against the implementation of strategies to provide support for caregivers. Professional support services in the community often lack funding and availability; and when available, may be insufficient to meet the needs of people with chronic illnesses . The large numbers of caregivers means that face‐to‐face interventions are unlikely to be feasible , because of distance  or cost, time and inconvenience .\n\n【20】#### Factors that help overcome barriers to supporting caregivers\n\n【21】When distance, inconvenience, being homebound or reluctance to leave the care recipient hinder face‐to‐face interventions , telecommunications and other media can be used . Wilz 2016 concludes that the telephone is highly acceptable to family carers and reports on two qualitative studies which indicate that such interventions may meet carers' needs in respect of information, guidance, professional and emotional support. Badr 2016 also suggests that telecommunications and other media interventions will enable carers to manage their own feelings and promote their ability to care. These findings support earlier qualitative research which reported that telephone support was a convenient and trouble‐free means of providing support to caregivers of people with dementia .\n\n【22】#### Reported benefits of telephone support interventions for caregivers\n\n【23】Previous research indicates that caregiver telephone interventions lead to positive outcomes . In a systematic review of telehealth tools and interventions to support caregivers, 20 of the 65 included studies reported on telephone‐based interventions . Detailed results from individual telephone‐based studies are not reported in the review. Collective summary findings of all technology‐based interventions, such as videoconferencing, telemetry and remote monitoring are presented, with the authors of the review stating that 62 of the 65 included studies (95%) reported that caregivers had significantly improved outcomes . Dam 2016 reported mixed findings from telephone interventions for caregivers of people with dementia, but further analysis of the included studies revealed that various research designs — including the 'pre‐test post‐test' design — were used, and in some instances the telephone was only a component of the intervention upon which the conclusions were formed.\n\n【24】The benefits of any intervention is dependent on timing, readiness of recipient and the nature of the issues that need to be addressed. Research indicates that support may only be effective when the recipient perceives a need for the support . In this sense, the appropriateness of professional support is likely to be dependent on the required effects. Although we could not find any studies that explicitly explored the differences between the effectiveness of professional and peer support for caregivers, a study by Rosland 2008 found that support from family and friends impacted on different self‐management behaviours for people with diabetes to those impacted upon by professionals. This suggests that for some self‐management behaviours family support may be required; but professional support is more appropriate for others and that the type of support offered should be guided by the desired outcomes. In general professionals are more likely than non‐professionals to affect outcomes that require therapeutic intervention (e.g. psychological functioning and personal change), while non‐professionals are more likely to positively change participation in informal social support networks .\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】There is a lack of international information and evidence on carers . The number of caregivers varies according to overall population with figures varying from 60,000 in Finland to 43.5 million in the USA . It is estimated that across the Organisation for Economic Co‐Operation and Development (OECD) countries more than 1 in 10 adults provide informal care. Across the European Union (EU) 19 million people provide care of which 9.6 million provide at least 35 hours' care a week . This number is expected to grow by 2030 . While the financial contribution of informal caregivers to international reduction in healthcare expenditure is unknown, it is estimated that informal caregivers contribute an annual estimated national reduction in healthcare expenditure varying from EUR 20 billion in Sweden to USD 470 billion in the USA . This is likely to reflect the contribution of estimated care hours provided by informal carers.\n\n【27】The contribution of family members is being increasingly recognised as important to the provision and management of care in chronic illness , and across the spectrum of illnesses . However, uptake of the support provided may not be feasible for caregivers due to geographical location, time and cost. A report on a survey of eight European countries highlights that, while the availability of support for carers of people with dementia was high, uptake was low, and utilisation may depend on the degree of accessibility of the support and caregivers' ability to perceive, seek, reach out, pay and engage with the services . The telephone provides a mode of intervention delivery that has the potential to increase accessibility and affordability of support programmes.\n\n【28】#### Distribution of caregivers and telephone availability\n\n【29】As caregivers live in the community, are regionally and nationally dispersed, and are often in paid employment in addition to their unpaid caregiving role , face‐to‐face contact with people who can provide emotional support and advice is not always feasible. Attendance‐based interventions can be time‐consuming and expensive for the caregiver . Telephone communication is widely available, internationally, with almost everyone having some form of access to a telephone including individuals living in remote settings . Pew Research Centre 2015 reported a median of 84% mobile phone ownership in emerging and developing countries with mobile phone ownership rates ranging from 47% to 97% in Pakistan and China, respectively. In 2011, of the 5.3 billion users of mobile phones worldwide, 3.5 billion were from developing countries , and it is projected that 70% of the world population will use smartphones by 2020 , which will equate to more than 6.1 billion users . However, 10% of the world's population do not have access to mobile phones, with the majority of these from the rural areas of Asia and sub‐Saharan Africa . Seventeen percent of people in sub‐Saharan Africa do not own a mobile phone but more than half of those people have, at times, access to a fixed line phone . Despite this, the mobile market growth rate in sub‐Saharan Africa is one of the highest worldwide ; and the growth in mobile phone networks has transformed communications in sub‐Saharan Africa, an area with the highest disease burden .\n\n【30】#### Feasibility of technology‐based interventions\n\n【31】Research studies, in particular studies in stroke, dementia, and human immunodeficiency virus, indicate that technology‐based interventions can be feasibly implemented for caregivers of people with many different conditions . Integrating telephone/mobile technology into current healthcare strategies provides a potential means for new ways for healthcare professionals to deliver care to patients and their caregivers . Finkel 2007 argues that \"...technology offers a cost effective and practical method for delivering interventions to caregivers” (p443). Despite this assertion, there is little evidence currently of economic advantage (an aspect that we will explore in the review) other than the suggestion that the need for healthcare professionals and caregivers to travel is eliminated, and caregiver access to existing resources and programmes is enhanced .\n\n【32】#### Factors that mitigate against implementation of findings to date\n\n【33】A number of factors mitigate against the usefulness of the findings from existing literature reviews and individual studies that included a telephone component. These include failure to present findings for different components of the interventions, failure to explore the benefits or otherwise of group over individual telephone interventions or to examine the essential characteristics of the interventionists. For example, in a literature review on technology studies to meet the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers, in which 15 of the included papers focused on caregiver interventions , most of the interventions were complex interventions with the telephone as one component. As outcomes from the specific components of the intervention were not isolated or presented individually, the benefit of the telephone alone was difficult to determine. Failure to isolate/present findings from individual components of a multi‐component intervention can limit the application of such interventions. This may occur due to limited resources, including funds, if all elements of the intervention are essential to effect outcomes. If the benefits from a multi‐component intervention could be realised with the application of any one component of the intervention, this needs to be highlighted so that healthcare resources are applied in an efficient and effective manner. Likewise the potential benefits of telephone‐only support interventions, delivered by healthcare professionals to individuals or groups, needs to be established. There is little empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of group interventions over interventions delivered to participants individually . While studies evaluate the effects of different modes of delivering interventions to groups, e.g. telephone versus face‐to‐face, we were unable to find any studies that tested the effects of a telephone group versus telephone one‐to‐one approach to intervention delivery, although these may be conducted in the future.\n\n【34】No Cochrane review was found that focused on telephone interventions for informal caregivers across a range of medical conditions. We found one Cochrane review that used the telephone for delivering a counselling intervention by healthcare professionals to caregivers of people with dementia only . In a meta‐analysis of three trials in this review, depressive symptoms from telephone counselling alone were reduced and potential positive effects of other outcomes including distress, burden, anxiety, quality of life, self‐efficacy, satisfaction and social support, were also suggested. While the studies included in Lins 2014 are likely to be included in this review, they will be analysed along with telephone support interventions for a range of conditions, so improving our knowledge on the telephone's effectiveness as a means of delivering psychosocial support or education to caregivers of people across a broad spectrum of conditions. This Cochrane review differs from other Cochrane reviews on caregiver interventions , as, unlike these reviews, the main objective of our review is to determine whether or not the telephone alone as a mode of delivering a support intervention to caregivers of diagnosed illnesses is effective. Other Cochrane reviews that differ from our review include those by Candy 2011 and Lavender 2013 . Candy 2011 , who evaluated peer‐support interventions for caregivers, did not report any findings specific to the telephone. Lavender 2013 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine telephone support for women accessing maternity services.\n\n【35】A number of the reviews on caregiver interventions that included telephone interventions did not differentiate between telephone‐only interventions and interventions that included the telephone as a component of the intervention. For example, Forster 2012 included one study that targeted patients and another that was a hybrid intervention that included two home visits and two telephone contacts. Similarly only one included study in the Legg 2011 review was telephone only; the other included study consisted of a combination of face‐to‐face and telephone intervention delivery. In the review by Candy 2011 , none of the three included studies used the telephone as the only method of intervention delivery. One telephone‐only intervention was included in the review by Vernooij‐Dassen 2011 but the telephone was used as the comparator intervention for two of the other included studies.\n\n【36】Two Cochrane protocols where telephone interventions are likely to be included as part of the review were identified . González‐Fraile 2015 focuses on the provision of information, support and training for informal caregivers of people with dementia and indicates that the telephone is a potential format for administering the intervention. Santin 2012 focuses on psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers of people living with cancer, stating that interventions that include telephone counselling will be included. Although there may be some overlap between these two reviews and our review, the overall scope of this review is broader and has a specific focus on the telephone only as the mode of intervention delivery across a range of conditions.\n\n【37】In summary, the need for professional support for caregivers across a range of conditions is well established. As difficulties for caregivers attending face‐to‐face interventions have been highlighted , telephone‐based interventions across caregiver groups provide a potentially important alternative. To date, there is no Cochrane review on the effectiveness of telephone‐support interventions alone, delivered by healthcare professionals, for caregivers across a range of conditions. It is therefore important to determine whether or not support interventions delivered by telephone are effective so that healthcare professionals can make informed decisions about whether or how to use the telephone in providing support to caregivers, should it be shown to be effective. Consequently, this review sets out to determine the effectiveness of educational or psychosocial support interventions, or both, delivered exclusively by telephone and by healthcare professionals, for informal caregivers of people with acute and chronic illness. The results of this review have the potential to inform strategy on the use of the telephone as an easily accessible, low‐cost method to provide high‐quality care with the potential to benefit hundreds of thousands of informal caregivers worldwide. It can also contribute to the primary care agenda by delivering healthcare to caregivers and patients in remote and rural areas. In addition, the findings will assist with research, resource allocation and future planning for the promotion and optimisation of the health and well‐being of informal caregivers.\n\n【38】Objectives\n----------\n\n【39】To evaluate the effectiveness of telephone interventions, delivered by healthcare professionals, when compared to usual care or non‐telephone‐based support interventions for educating and psychosocially supporting informal carers of people with acute and chronic diagnosed illnesses, on these carers' quality of life, psychosocial and physical well‐being. We aim, additionally, to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of telephone interventions.\n\n【40】Methods\n-------\n\n【41】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【42】#### Types of studies\n\n【43】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. We will include multi‐arm studies that include a pair‐wise comparison of intervention groups that otherwise meet the inclusion criteria for this review , and where data specific to the telephone component of the intervention can be extracted in isolation. We will exclude cross‐over trials as there is a high risk of carry‐over effects from one intervention to another .\n\n【44】#### Types of participants\n\n【45】We will include informal adult caregivers, defined as persons aged 18 years or over, caring for adult individuals with a diagnosed illness and in receipt of telephone intervention support from a healthcare professional. For the purpose of this review a caregiver is defined as a person (family member, friend or significant other) who provides personal help (support or care) for a person with an acute or chronic illness, and is not a paid healthcare provider. An acute illness is defined as a diagnosed condition lasting less than six months and a chronic illness is defined as a diagnosed condition lasting for six months or more.\n\n【46】We will include telephone interventions delivered by healthcare professionals to caregivers of people with a range of diagnosed illnesses who are living in a hospital, residential care or in the community. The following provides an indicative list of examples, based on author familiarity with the subject area and referenced sources, as available. The examples within the condition categories are also intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.\n\n【47】*   Complex critical illness survivors (i.e. people who need caregivers on the path to recover from the intensive care unit to the home environment).\n\n【48】*   Mental health: severe mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, bipolar affective disorders) .\n\n【49】*   Neurological conditions (e.g. dementia, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injuries, Huntington's disease, headache disorders, neuro infections, pain associated with neurological disorders) .\n\n【50】*   Respiratory conditions (e.g. asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease).\n\n【51】*   Cardiac conditions (e.g. congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction).\n\n【52】*   Renal conditions (e.g. renal failure).\n\n【53】*   Orthopaedic conditions (e.g. hip fractures, spinal injuries).\n\n【54】*   Musculoskeletal (e.g. degenerative osteoarthritis).\n\n【55】*   Infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS).\n\n【56】*   Haematological conditions (e.g. post bone marrow transplant).\n\n【57】*   Endocrine: (e.g. diabetes 1 and 2).\n\n【58】*   Alcohol, drug or substances issues/misuse.\n\n【59】*   Cancer: any category.\n\n【60】*   Terminal illness: due to any of the above conditions.\n\n【61】*   Older persons: frail older persons or older persons with any of the above conditions.\n\n【62】*   People with comorbidity or multimorbidity.\n\n【63】#### Types of interventions\n\n【64】We will include all telephone interventions delivered by healthcare professionals that provide education or psychosocial support or a combination of these for informal caregivers. Telephone interventions where the first session is an introductory session either delivered by telephone or face to face and where all remaining sessions are delivered by telephone will be included. Accordingly, we will exclude all caregiver interventions that are not telephone based, telephone interventions delivered by non‐healthcare professionals and telephone interventions targeted towards paid caregivers, patients, people living in the community who are not informal caregivers and healthcare professionals. Neither will we include interventions that include the telephone as a component of a multi‐component intervention where the findings for the telephone component of the interventions cannot be isolated. Telephone interventions with more than one face‐to‐face session or where the first face‐to‐face session follows an overall introductory session to the intervention will also be excluded.\n\n【65】We will include trials that compare a telephone support intervention delivered by a healthcare professional with either ‘usual’ care (as defined by the study's authors), or a support intervention delivered by a healthcare professional that is not telephone based, analysing these comparisons separately. The included intervention will be categorised as either an educational or psychosocial intervention, or a combination of both. Psychosocial interventions refers to the cognitive, behavioural and/or social mechanisms of action, e.g. counselling, psycho‐education, behavioural and cognitive intervention and social support, that aim to improve the psychosocial and physical well‐being of carers of people with chronic conditions. Psychosocial intervention will therefore be further categorised as counselling interventions, psycho‐educational, social support, behavioural or cognitive training interventions.\n\n【66】Educational interventions, which often include information provision, are often more difficult to pin down and define. For the purposes of this review, we will categorise an educational intervention as one in which information is provided for the purpose of increasing the carer's factual knowledge, as well as interventions that include a component that ensures that the carer understands the information given and can put it into action , and/or where the intervention has been defined/described as an educational intervention by the trial/study authors. The following operational definitions will be used to identify papers for inclusion in our review:\n\n【67】*   For the purposes of the review, a healthcare professional is defined as a registered healthcare practitioner, who may or may not be a member of the wider clinical team, who has received an education/training qualification and who provides telephone education and psychosocial support to caregivers. This includes nurses, social workers, medical doctors, counsellors, psychologists and other related allied healthcare professionals.\n\n【68】*   For the purposes of the review, a telephone intervention refers to any intervention, delivered via the telephone, with an education or psychosocial (mental, emotional, social or spiritual) focus that is designed to provide knowledge, advice, or help to caregivers in order to enable them manage their own well‐being or that of the person they care for. This support can be provided individually or in group format. For the purpose of this review, telephone interventions include calls from any device that enables audio communication between healthcare professionals and caregivers, including calls made using landlines, mobile phone devices and devices that enable the use of Skype or other applications that facilitate verbal communication between healthcare professionals and caregivers. Telehealth interventions that provide online education or interventions other than telephone calls between healthcare professionals and caregivers will be excluded.\n\n【69】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【70】The following outcomes will be assessed at several time points, reflecting the possible changes in caregiver outcomes over time. All outcomes will be assessed at the end of intervention delivery and at short‐term (≤ 3 months), medium‐term (> 3 to ≤ 6 months) and longer‐term time points (> 6 to 12 months) following intervention delivery.\n\n【71】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【72】*   Caregiver quality of life (QoL) as measured by the trial/study authors or using a measurement instrument (e.g. SF 36, WHOQoL or caregiver QoL index).\n\n【73】*   Caregiver burden as measured by the trial/study authors or using a measurement instrument (e.g. caregiver reaction assessment, carer burden inventory or caregiver strain index).\n\n【74】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【75】The following secondary outcomes will be measured.\n\n【76】*   Skill acquisition (preparedness to care; caregiver competence, problem solving, social activity).\n\n【77】*   Psychological health (depression, anxiety, stress, coping).\n\n【78】*   Knowledge and understanding (knowledge).\n\n【79】*   Health status and well‐being (physical health, self‐efficacy).\n\n【80】*   Family functioning.\n\n【81】*   Satisfaction: (satisfaction with the intervention, perceived satisfaction with practical or other supports).\n\n【82】*   Economic outcome data as reported from cost benefit analysis, cost‐effectiveness analysis, cost utility analysis.\n\n【83】Unintended outcomes that could be attributed to the intervention will be considered adverse events. These include any worsening of the above outcomes in the intervention group, as reported by the study authors or as evident in worsening of end of treatment from baseline (pre‐intervention) measurement, where provided in the included studies, in particular anxiety and depression _._ Reported incidents of suicide ideation and suicide will also be considered adverse events.\n\n【84】Outcomes reported in included studies will be categorised to the groupings above by two authors working independently, with any differences in categorisation resolved by involvement of a third author.\n\n【85】We plan to report results for the following outcomes in 'Summary of findings' tables in the review.\n\n【86】*   Caregiver quality of life.\n\n【87】*   Caregiver burden.\n\n【88】*   Psychological health (depression, anxiety, stress, coping).\n\n【89】*   Satisfaction (satisfaction with the intervention).\n\n【90】*   Suicide ideation and suicide.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Primary objective\n\n【3】*   To assess the effects of nutrition interventions in the perioperative period for women with ovarian cancer on clinical, nutritional or QoL outcomes.\n\n【4】Secondary objectives\n\n【5】*   To evaluate whether the effects are modified by nutritional status at baseline or by type of nutrition intervention.\n\n【6】--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Based on worldwide statistics, ovarian cancer is the seventh most frequent cancer for both incidence and mortality with age standardised rates (ASR) respectively of 6.3 and 3.8 per 100,000 women. Within these rates is significant geographical variation with an ASR of 11.8 per 100,000 in Northern Europe and 3.8 per 100,000 in Southern and Western Africa . Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers originate in the epithelial layer of the ovary, other categories are sex cord‐stromal and germ cell tumours.\n\n【10】The presenting symptoms of ovarian cancer are often of a non‐specific nature so patients may often be found to have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer are indicated by the staging of the disease classified using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system. Staging may be evaluated from ultrasound, computerised tomography (CT) or other scanning techniques or from the finding of malignant cells in ascites (abnormal fluid collection in the abdomen); staging is confirmed when surgery occurs. The surgical treatment of ovarian cancer diagnosed at an early stage entails the removal of one or both ovaries and the uterus, depending on the extent of the disease and the need to preserve fertility. Where abnormal tissue is more widespread, for example in other pelvic organs, cytoreductive surgery is used with the aim of surgically removing all visible tumour tissue (optimal cytoreduction). If surgery cannot be undertaken as a primary treatment due to the disease severity, chemotherapy may be commenced (neoadjuvant chemotherapy), prior to subsequent surgical reduction of the tumour (interval debulking). Surgical intervention may also be indicated where intestinal obstruction occurs as a complication of the disease.\n\n【11】Causes of malnutrition and weight loss in people with cancer have been described and may include an inadequate dietary intake due to tumour‐induced anorexia, catabolic effects of the tumour, abnormal metabolism of nutrients, physical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract by a tumour, reduced food intake secondary to side effects of radiotherapy or chemotherapy and diminished intake due to pain, anxiety or depression . Specifically in ovarian cancer, common presenting symptoms include abdominal discomfort or pain, abdominal distension, nausea, dyspepsia, early satiety and constipation . In a UK study, more than 50% of 35 women recruited were reported to have a visibly distended abdomen due to ascites or ovarian mass .These factors are liable to influence food intake and consequent nutrition status within this patient group. Malnutrition in association with ovarian cancer has been identified as a problem for many years particularly in women with advanced cancer (FIGO stages III and IV) . Within a group of 33 women with ovarian cancer requiring operation for resulting bowel obstruction, 75% were identified as having severe nutritional deprivation .\n\n【12】A variety of methods have been used to identify malnutrition. Subjective global assessment (SGA) is a method of evaluating nutrition status combining weight change, diet history and physical examination. In a Brazilian study of women with gynaecological cancers, SGA identified malnutrition in four out of 14 (28%) women with ovarian cancer , while the same method found 50% of 132 women with ovarian cancer in a US study were malnourished . In Australia, a modification of this method, the patient‐generated SGA (PG‐SGA) used on women with gynaecological cancers, identified malnutrition in two‐thirds of 48 women with ovarian cancer in comparison with 12% of women with other gynaecological cancers. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the malnourished women (27.4 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) indicated that some women were overweight although their mean BMI was significantly lower than the mean BMI of well‐nourished patients, therefore it was noted that the use of BMI and weight alone would not be sufficient to detect malnutrition in this patient group .\n\n【13】Evidence of malnutrition in women with ovarian cancer has been related to outcomes from surgery. Where surgery has been required for intestinal obstruction, poor nutritional status (identified either by weight loss, low serum albumin or low lymphocyte count) was a factor that significantly correlated with poor surgical outcome , poor postoperative survival Clarke‐Pearson 1988 ) and an increased incidence of postoperative infectious complications . In a study of older women (age75 years or over) with ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer, serum albumin was used as a surrogate measure of nutritional status and was significantly associated with lower rates of optimal cytoreduction. Women with suboptimal cytoreductive surgery had a lower median survival time in comparison with the women who underwent optimal cytoreduction (17 months versus 62 months) . Although serum albumin may reflect chronic protein deficiency it is also an indicator of acute clinical stress, hydration status, liver dysfunction and inflammation, so therefore requires careful evaluation. In a study where prealbumin was used as a nutrition assessment marker, a significant relationship was shown between low serum prealbumin and the risk of complications after primary radical cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer, with significantly greater risk of blood loss, morbidity and mortality where serum prealbumin was lower than 10 mg/dL .\n\n【14】Current guidelines recommend the use of nutritional screening for people in hospital settings for the purpose of identifying those at risk of malnutrition. The identification of people found to be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should be linked to further nutrition assessment and the implementation of an appropriate nutrition care plan, which may include nutrition support . Women with ovarian cancer may have co‐existing overweight or obesity with or without ascites, therefore appropriate screening and assessment methods are required, which will ensure that malnutrition is identified and treated.\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】In this context, nutrition interventions include nutrition screening, nutrition assessment or nutrition advice, which may be combined with nutrition support (which is the supply of nutrients other than the standard provision of nourishment), with the intention to improve or maintain nutrient intake. Nutrition support may be provided as supplementary foods or drinks, fortified foods, oral nutrition supplements, nutrition formulations given by tube into the gastrointestinal tract (enteral feeds) administered either by nasogastric tube, or directly into the stomach or jejunum; or parenteral feeds which are given by infusion directly into a vein (parenteral nutrition (PN)) via a peripheral cannula or into a central vein. Nutrition support may compensate in part or in full for inadequate food consumption. In this review, nutrition interventions do not include the use of nutrition formulations given routinely in 'Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS)' programmes, which have been recently reviewed in the context of gynaecological oncology . Nutrition interventions may occur at any stage in the perioperative period with the intention to identify, prevent or treat malnutrition. It is important that the risk of adverse effects associated with the provision of nutrition support are considered; risks associated with nutrition support interventions may range from minor effects such as taste dislike or nausea to life‐threatening effects such as PN catheter‐related sepsis.\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】Nutrition screening and assessment may identify women at risk of malnutrition and enable nutrition support to be implemented. Nutrition support may improve the nutrient intake of women undergoing surgical intervention for the investigation or treatment of ovarian cancer or associated complications. The intervention may prevent further nutritional losses at a time of increased metabolic requirements due to the stresses of surgery and the requirement for postoperative wound healing.\n\n【19】The intervention may promote weight gain where undesirable weight loss has been identified and may improve quality of life (QoL) as perceived by the patient. In other patient groups undergoing radiotherapy for cancer treatment, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that nutritional counselling improved nutrition intake, nutrition status and QoL .\n\n【20】The intervention may reduce the length of hospital stay. Malnutrition has been identified as a factor contributing to prolonged length of stay among surgical women with gynaecological cancer .\n\n【21】The intervention may affect clinical outcome by reducing postoperative complications. PN has been successfully used to raise prealbumin levels above 10 mg/dL in women with ovarian cancer, this reduced the incidence of surgical complications, which occurred in women when prealbumin levels were lower than 10 mg/dL. Prealbumin levels were subsequently used to determine the prescription of nutritional support and the timing of surgical intervention .\n\n【22】Women who are unable to eat due to ovarian cancer‐related intestinal obstruction can be given nutrients by an alternative route (PN) either pre‐ or perioperatively . Nutrition support techniques may be used as an alternative to normal food intake where gastroparesis has occurred as a side effect of cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer .\n\n【23】The identification of malnutrition may provide useful prognostic information. Mean survival time has been shown to be longer in well‐nourished women than in malnourished women with similar cancer staging . Nutritional status can improve, women identified as being malnourished at diagnosis and who were subsequently noted to have become nourished three months later, had a median survival time similar to that of women who were identified as well nourished both at diagnosis and at three months; nutritional interventions may have contributed to improved nutritional status .\n\n【24】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【25】Malnutrition has been shown to be a significant risk in women with ovarian cancer and therefore requires purposeful identification and treatment. Nutrition interventions may positively improve clinical outcomes, nutritional status or QoL measures in women with ovarian cancer. There is a need to develop practical guidance on the use of nutrition interventions derived from a systematic review of highquality studies undertaken in this patient group.\n\n【26】Objectives\n----------\n\n【27】### Primary objective\n\n【28】*   To assess the effects of nutrition interventions in the perioperative period for women with ovarian cancer on clinical, nutritional or QoL outcomes.\n\n【29】### Secondary objectives\n\n【30】*   To evaluate whether the effects are modified by nutritional status at baseline or by type of nutrition intervention.\n\n【31】Methods\n-------\n\n【32】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【33】#### Types of studies\n\n【34】RCTs.\n\n【35】#### Types of participants\n\n【36】Adult women in the perioperative phase of surgical treatment for ovarian cancer. Although the perioperative period may be considered to extend from the time when the patient is admitted to hospital for surgery until they are discharged, the term can also cover the period of time that a patient is prepared physically (and psychologically) for surgery (i.e. from the time that surgery is planned as a treatment for ovarian cancer). We will include the latter broader time period.\n\n【37】It may be that studies on this population group could also include people with other types of cancer, in this instance, we will only include studies where all the people are being surgically treated for cancer, and where at least 75% of the people in the trial are women with ovarian cancer.\n\n【38】#### Types of interventions\n\n【39】Nutrition interventions may be provided at any stage in the perioperative period when there is an intention to undertake surgery as a treatment for ovarian cancer until postoperative discharge from hospital. Nutrition interventions may be one or more of the following: nutrition screening/assessment, nutrition counselling/advice, supplementary foods or drinks, fortified foods, oral nutrition supplements, enteral or parenteral feeds. Where nutrition support is provided this would include a mixture of nitrogen and non‐nitrogen energy with vitamins and minerals. The nutrition support may be supplementary to the usual food and drink provision or be the sole source of nourishment. Trials may examine nutrition interventions in comparison with no nutrition intervention or may be comparisons of alternative types of nutrition intervention.\n\n【40】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【41】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【42】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures in adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The femur or thigh bone is the largest bone of the body. The femoral shaft or diaphysis is the long straight middle section of the femur. Femoral shaft fractures are usually the result of high‐energy trauma, such as road traffic accidents.The annual incidence of femoral shaft fractures is approximately 10 per 100,000 people .The ratio of males and females who suffered femoral shaft fractures was reported to be 174:100 in Salminen 2000 . Salminen 2000 found that males have a peak age‐related incidence of femoral shaft fracture between the ages of 15 and 24 years, and females have a peak incidence of these fractures at 85 years and above.\n\n【7】Femoral shaft fractures may be closed, where the overlying tissues are intact, or open, where the bone is exposed placing the person at great risk of wound infection and contamination. These fractures are generally classified according to the morphological character of fracture line. Common descriptors are transverse (short and horizontal), oblique (straight but not horizontal), spiral (shape of a coil) and comminuted (more than three fragments). The AO/OTA system is an advanced and complex classification scheme which is commonly used. Based on the fracture pattern and location, femoral shaft fractures are coded as 32 and divided into three categories (A, B, C) and ultimately 27 different patterns according to the AO/OTA system .\n\n【8】Femoral shaft fractures are sometimes associated with polytrauma (multiple injuries in three or more parts of the body), which can be life‐threatening. These fractures can result in severe and permanent disability, such as from limb shortening and rotational deformity of the leg. Other common complications of these fractures include infection, residual pain, delayed union and nonunion.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Most femoral shaft fractures are treated surgically. Several studies have indicated that early surgical stabilisation is associated with a reduction of complications and mortality . An intramedullary nail is a metal rod that is inserted into the medullary cavity of a bone and across the fracture in order to provide a solid support for the fractured bone. Intramedullary nailing is currently considered the \"gold standard\" for treatment of femoral shaft fractures . Proposed advantages of intramedullary nailing include short hospital‐stay, rapid union of the fracture and early functional use of the limb .\n\n【11】There are numerous different types of intramedullary nail and associated surgical techniques in use. One key controversy is whether the nail should be inserted into the canal at the knee and pushed up the canal (retrograde nailing) or at the hip and pushed down the canal (antegrade nailing). The entry point for antegrade nailing (piriformis fossa versus greater trochanteric entry) is also in dispute. Another issue is whether intramedullary nails should be inserted with reaming (where the medullary cavity is expanded before nail insertion) or without reaming. Likewise, there has been no agreement about the effects of different types of nails, such as interlocking nails (with locking bolts placed across the bone at the ends of the nail to secure it in position) or Ender nails, where two or more nails are placed within the medullary cavity in a specific way to hold them in place.\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】Intramedullary nailing aims to preserve the anatomical structure of fracture sites and to provide a proper environment for fracture healing. This in turn should improve function and reduce long‐term complications such as pain from arthritis. Furthermore, nailing helps to limit the damage to the soft tissues in the vicinity of bone during surgery and thereby helps preserve the blood supply to allow fracture healing and obtain a good functional recovery.\n\n【14】The reported advantages of antegrade nailing of the femur include a high rate of union and a low risk of malunion. However, due to its entry point and route, antegrade nailing is associated with a high risk of hip complications, such as heterotopic ossification about the hip, injury of the pudendal nerve and residual pain . Retrograde nailing is often applied for more complex cases such as the treatment of ipsilateral femoral shaft and femoral neck fractures, ipsilateral femoral shaft and pelvic or acetabular fractures, polytrauma and pregnant women . There is some evidence suggesting that retrograde nail insertion is easier, with less blood loss and without the expected increase in knee‐related pain and complications .\n\n【15】The classic approach of inserting a straight nail through the greater trochanter has been reported to be prone to severe heterotopic ossification, fracture comminution and varus deformity. The management of femoral shaft fractures with nails implanted through the piriformis fossa may reduce the risk of these complications and be quicker to perform .\n\n【16】Postulated advantages for reamed nailing include improved fit within the medullary cavity and thus a stronger fixation for the fractured bone, and accelerated healing resulting from the bone debris created during reaming. Hypothetically, unreamed nailing should be quicker and easier to do with less disruption to the blood supply, which should help healing and reduce the risk of infection.\n\n【17】Easier insertion, combined with minimal damage to the endosteum, makes Ender nailing an attractive choice for treating femoral shaft fractures. However, although Ender nails could produce micromovement that may facilitate callus formation at the fracture sites, they are unlikely to provide a strong preservation of length, alignment and rotation. Indeed, Ender nailing may increase the frequency of delayed union and malunion. Although a more complex operation, securing the ends of the nails in the bone as in interlocking nails should provide absolute stability for unstable fractures .\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Femoral shaft fractures are serious injuries that generally result in short‐term disability and pain but also have a high risk of longer‐term deformity and disability. However, these complications are not inevitable and may be reduced by a good treatment programme. There are several types of intramedullary nails and associated techniques available for the management of femoral shaft fractures. To make an informed decision, it is important to systematically review the available evidence to find the best methods of intramedullary nailing for optimising outcome.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods of intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures in adults.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】We will include randomised and quasi‐randomised (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random: e.g. by hospital number) controlled clinical trials evaluating intramedullary nailing for femoral shaft fractures in adults.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】We will include adults (> 16 years old) undergoing primary surgery of open or closed femoral shaft fractures.

Donor arm skin is one potential source of blood contamination, so it is usual to cleanse the skin with an antiseptic before blood donation. One‐step and two‐step alcohol based antiseptic regimens are both commonly advocated but there is uncertainty as to which is most effective.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of cleansing the skin of blood donors with alcohol in a one‐step compared with alcohol in a two‐step procedure to prevent contamination of collected blood or bacteraemia in the recipient.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】In December 2014, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), _The Cochrane Library_ ; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised trials (RCTs) comparing alcohol based donor skin cleansing in a one‐step versus a two‐step process that includes alcohol and any other antiseptic for pre‐venepuncture skin cleansing were considered. Quasi randomised trials were to have been considered in the absence of RCTs.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】No studies (RCTs or quasi RCTs) met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】We did not identify any eligible studies for inclusion in this review. It is therefore unclear whether a two‐step, alcohol followed by antiseptic skin cleansing process prior to blood donation confers any reduction in the risk of blood contamination or bacteraemia in blood recipients, or conversely whether a one‐step process increases risk above that associated with a two‐step process.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Venipuncture\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Skin Cleansing Procedure\n*   Isopropanol\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Antiseptics And Disinfectants\n*   Antiseptics\n*   Skin Cleansing Procedure\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Bacteraemia\n*   Sample Contaminated\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Alcohol, with or without antiseptic, for preparing the skin before blood collection to prevent bacteraemia or contamination of blood for transfusion.\n\n【24】When blood is collected from blood donors for transfusion it may become contaminated during collection, storage or transfusion. Blood contamination can cause bacteraemia (the presence of bacteria in the blood), severe illness or even death in the blood recipient. When blood is being taken from donors, the skin on the arm of the donor is one potential source of contamination, so it is usual to cleanse the arm with an antiseptic first, and both one‐step and two‐step alcohol based regimens are commonly used, however there is uncertainty about which regimen is the most effective for reducing the microbial load (the number of microscopic bacterial organisms) on the donor arm. We looked for studies that compared the use of alcohol alone versus the use of alcohol followed by another antiseptic to clean the arm before the needle is inserted to draw blood, but we did not find any relevant studies. It is currently unclear whether donor skin cleansing with a one‐step alcohol based regimen reduces the risk of blood contamination compared with a two‐step alcohol based regimen during blood donation.\n\n【25】--------------\n\n【26】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【27】### Implications for practice\n\n【28】We did not find any eligible randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials. Until further research emerges, decisions about which mode of pre‐blood donation skin cleansing to use are likely to be driven by convenience and cost. It is also important to note that arm cleansing is only one of the points at which blood contamination may occur.\n\n【29】### Implications for research\n\n【30】Cleansing the donor skin before taking blood for transfusion is important, but conducting a trial to compare the effects of using specific antiseptics on bacteraemia rates would be logistically difficult given the relatively rare event rate. It may be possible to estimate the effects of disinfecting with alcohol alone versus alcohol plus other antiseptics on blood contamination rates but this would still require very large sample sizes to detect clinically important differences. Alternatively, high quality observational studies may provide additional information to guide practice. A future comprehensive evidence synthesis that summarised the evidence for all competing alternative approaches to pre‐blood donation skin cleansing would be worthwhile.\n\n【31】Background\n----------\n\n【32】Complications associated with the infusion of blood and blood‐related products have reduced in recent years, due to considerable advances in detecting transfusion‐related viral pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C and B virus (HCV and HBV). In contrast, bacteraemia, resulting from bacterial contamination of blood products continues to be an ongoing problem . Exogenous contamination of donor blood may occur at any point during collection, storage and transfusion . One of the sources of contamination is thought to be the donor's skin, as a result of inadequate skin cleansing .\n\n【33】### Description of the condition\n\n【34】Bacteraemia, or the presence of bacteria in the blood, is a potentially fatal condition. It is associated with high rates of morbidity . Microorganisms may enter the blood stream through almost any organ (for example the lungs following pneumonia), through a surgical site, or via an implanted device such as an intravenous catheter. Prognosis is related to the virulence of the infective organism, severity of the sepsis at diagnosis, age and the underlying health of the patient . Although the aetiology of bacteraemia is often difficult to identify, transfusion‐transmitted infection is a rare cause. The incidence of bacterial transmission through donated blood is estimated at between 1 per 100,000 and 1 per 1,000,000 units for packed red blood cells, and between 1 per 900 and 1 per 100,000 units for platelets . Fatalities are associated with 1 in 8,000,000 red cell units and 1 in 50,000 to 500,000 white cell units . The reason for higher rates in platelet transfusion is thought to be because frozen platelets are thawed and stored at room temperature before infusion and if they are not used immediately there is an opportunity for any organisms that may be present to multiply before the product is transfused. Further reduction of infection rates depends on ensuring that blood for transfusion is free of contaminants. One way of achieving this is through careful preparation and cleansing of the donor's skin at the collection site.\n\n【35】### Description of the intervention\n\n【36】There is no standard method for cleansing the site on the blood donor's skin from which the blood will be taken (generally the cubital fossa, or the inner aspect of the elbow). However, alcohol, followed by an application of povidone iodine has been traditionally used . Consequently, the interventions of interest for this review are skin cleansing with alcohol (usually 70% isopropyl alcohol) for skin preparation in a one‐step process, compared with a two‐step process involving alcohol followed by povidone iodine or other antiseptic solution. Antiseptics are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue or skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis or putrefaction. They should generally be distinguished from antibiotics that destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non‐living objects. Alcohol is widely used prior to venepuncture and is available from a number of manufacturers as easy‐to‐use disinfection wipes.\n\n【37】### How the intervention might work\n\n【38】Alcohol kills most bacteria and fungi by acting on lipid and protein components of the cell. It is less effective against viruses . Isopropyl alcohol has some advantages over other products because it requires a shorter contact time to achieve antisepsis. For example some two‐step procedures take up to two minutes to perform, which is considered too long for some blood bank services . Antiseptics are toxic to living tissues as well as bacterial cells, some antiseptics are true germicides, capable of destroying microbes (bacteriocidal), whilst others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth .\n\n【39】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【40】Although a range of antiseptics has been used to cleanse the skin of the donor arm, a two‐step process, including alcohol and iodine is widely used . The effectiveness of this regimen, and other forms of cleansing has been evaluated in a number of studies by measuring the microbial load on the donor arm  and any contamination of platelet concentrates  however it remains unclear whether isopropyl alcohol alone is as effective as alcohol plus povidone iodine (or any other antiseptic) in preventing the clinical consequences of contaminated blood. This review question was brought to us by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a scoping search did not identify any existing systematic review which had previously addressed this question.\n\n【41】Objectives\n----------\n\n【42】To assess the effects of cleansing the donor arm with alcohol in a one‐step regimen compared with a two‐step regimen including alcohol followed by any other antiseptic to prevent donor blood contamination or recipient bacteraemia.\n\n【43】Methods\n-------\n\n【44】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【45】#### Types of studies\n\n【46】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a one‐step alcohol regimen with any two‐step regimen that includes alcohol followed by another antiseptic for pre‐venepuncture skin cleansing were considered. Cluster randomised trials and crossover trials were also eligible for inclusion. Quasi randomised trials were to have been considered in the absence of RCTs.\n\n【47】#### Types of participants\n\n【48】Studies enrolling people of any age and in any setting, having venepuncture and blood collection were eligible, irrespective of whether the venepuncture was for the purpose of blood donation. Studies should also include follow up from the recipients of the donated blood in order to measure outcomes occurring in the recipient.\n\n【49】#### Types of interventions\n\n【50】Studies which compared one‐step donor skin cleansing with alcohol (any concentration or application method) with a two‐step method which involved alcohol (any strength or application method) followed by any other antiseptic (any concentration or application method) were eligible.\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】At least one of the primary or secondary outcomes was to have been reported for the study to be considered for inclusion in the review.\n\n【53】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【54】*   Bacteraemia in the blood recipient (the presence of bacteria in the blood stream) as measured by blood culture.\n\n【55】*   Blood product contamination (blood products include whole blood, platelets, red blood cells or any other product derived from the blood collection) at any time between collection and transfusion as detected most commonly by blood culture.\n\n【56】Proxy outcome measures, such as skin contamination or skin colonisation, were not considered for several reasons. Namely, any antiseptic will reduce levels of microflora on the skin and swabbing skin for bacteria is really a 'sampling procedure' which is subject to inconsistencies in sampling. In addition, a positive skin culture does not automatically mean that the blood collected for transfusion will be positive for bacteria (in the same way that a positive skin culture before surgery does not mean the person will develop a surgical site infection).\n\n【57】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【58】*   Death of the blood recipient, attributed to the transfusion.\n\n【59】*   Any adverse effects in the blood recipient associated with the transfusion.

There is a low strength of evidence that acupuncture/acupressure is helpful and no evidence for the use of music.

Overall shortness of breath towards the end of life is still difficult to treat. Appropriate treatment of this distressing symptom requires both drug and non‐drug methods. We aimed to determine which non‐drug methods relieve shortness of breath and which are the most effective. We found 47 studies that were first categorised in to two groups: methods with one clear described component and methods with a mixture of components. The two groups were then divided in to 12 subgroups. The following studies showed that these interventions can help to relieve shortness of breath: vibration of patient's chest wall, electrical stimulation of leg muscles, walking aids and breathing training. There are mixed results for the use of acupuncture/acupressure. Further interventions identified were counselling and support, either alone or in combination with relaxation‐breathing training, music, relaxation, a hand‐held fan directed at a patient's face, case management and psychotherapy. There are several non‐drug methods available to relieve shortness of breath in incurable stages of cancer and other illnesses. There is currently not enough data to judge the evidence for these interventions. Most studies were conducted in participants with chronic lung disease.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of probiotics to prevent the occurrence and reduce the severity of acute otitis media in children.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood diseases. It is characterised by effusion of the middle ear and rapid onset of symptoms such as ear pain, otorrhoea (discharge from the ear), fever, and malaise . Although AOM has low mortality, it has high morbidity ; by two years of age, 70% of children have had at least one episode of AOM, and 20% to 30% of children have experienced three or more episodes . Globally, the incidence rate of AOM is estimated at 10.85% (the equivalent of 709 million cases of AOM each year); the incidence rate varies, from a low of 3.64% in Central Europe to 43.37% in central sub‐Saharan Africa .\n\n【7】Clinical care guidelines for treatment of AOM vary internationally. For mild‐moderate cases, 'watchful waiting' has now been adopted in many high‐income countries, although this remains infrequent in low‐income countries . Most guidelines recommend amoxicillin as first‐line treatment, with some exceptions: amoxicillin‐clavulanate in some high‐income countries, penicillin V in Scandinavian countries, and other first‐line treatments in low‐income countries include trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, cloxacillin, and others . Although AOM is one of the main reasons for antibiotic prescription in children , the rates of antibiotic prescription for AOM vary internationally, from 56% of consultations for AOM in the Netherlands, Akkerman 2005 , to 95% in North America . However, using antibiotics in prophylaxis and treatment of AOM leads to the development of antibiotic resistance, and identification of alternatives to antibiotics for prevention or treatment of AOM is becoming urgent .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】The World Health Organization (WHO) defines probiotics as live micro‐organisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered in adequate amounts . Micro‐organisms used as probiotics include: _Lactobacillus_ (e.g. _L acidophilus_ , _L fermentum_ ), _Bifidobacterium_ (e.g. _B bifidum_ , _B lactis_ ), _Streptococcus_ (e.g. _S thermophiles_ ) species, and _Saccharomyces_ (e.g. _S boulardii_ ) species . Probiotics are available in multiple forms: as tablets or powders (regulated as dietary supplements), as a food ingredient (e.g. yogurts or kefirs) , or directly applied by spray to the throat . Probiotics are not currently part of clinical practice. Probiotics can be used by adults and children . In people with unimpaired immune systems, probiotics do not have any known harmful effects .\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】Since otitis media is associated with colonisation by pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx, and disruption of the balance of the normal microbiota , probiotics may act by restoring the normal microbiota (i.e. by overwhelming the pathogens with healthy commensals), rather than by attempting to kill pathogens with antibiotics, although the mechanisms of any probiotics benefit are unclear . They may act by stabilising gut microbiota; modulating immune function; competing with pathogens for essential nutrients and adhesion sites on epithelial surfaces; producing bacteriocins or other inhibitory substances .\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Because antibiotic use leads to increased antibiotic resistance, , other options (including probiotics) are attracting greater interest . The most recent Cochrane Review on the use of probiotics for preventing acute respiratory tract infections did not include studies with AOM as an outcome on the grounds that otitis‐prone children may have immunodeficiencies .

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the benefits and harms of liver resection versus other treatments in patients with resectable liver metastases from gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Neuroendocrine tumours are tumours of cells which possess secretory granules and originate from the neuroectoderm, ie, cells of the ectoblast or epiblast that program the neuroendocrine system . These cells commonly produce ectopic hormones (via amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD cells) . Some of the gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours include carcinoid tumours, insulinomas, gastrinomas, glucagonomas, somastatinomas, and vipomas . They can occur alone or may occur as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN type I) syndrome .\n\n【6】Carcinoids account for about one fifth of the malignancies of the small intestine . Ninety per cent of carcinoid tumours arise from the appendix . They secrete the hormones serotonins (5 hydroxytryptamine or 5HT), 5 hydroxytryptophan or 5HTP, bradykinin, tachykinin, histamine, substance P, and several other peptides . Patients develop the malignant carcinoid syndrome (severe flushing of skin, diarrheal watery stools, bronchoconstriction, sudden drops in blood pressure, edema, and ascites)  when there are metastases .\n\n【7】The main hormones secreted by other gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours include insulin (insulinoma) , gastrin (gastrinomas) , glucagon (glucagonoma) , somatostatin (somatostatinomas) , and vasoactive intestinal peptide (vipomas) . The main symptoms of these tumours include hypoglycaemia (insulinomas) , diabetes mellitus (glucagonoma) , somatostatinoma , erythema (glucagonoma) , stomatitis (glucagonoma) , glossitis (glucagonoma) , weight loss (glucagonoma) , severe peptic ulcer (gastrinoma) , gallstones (somatostatinoma) , steatorrhoea (somatostatinoma) , watery diarrhoea (vipomas) , hypochlorhydria (somatostatinomas) , and hypokalemia (vipoma) .\n\n【8】Radical surgery including resection of the primary tumour and resection of liver metastases has been the main treatment for potentially resectable disease for advanced neuroendocrine tumours with five‐year and ten‐year survival rates of 61% to 70%  and 35%, respectively . However, many patients are offered only palliative treatment for liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumours possibly because of misconceptions about the curative potential of liver resection. Various palliative treatment options available to the patient include palliative cytoreductive surgery , chemotherapy  , liver transplantation , embolization using gelfoam , transarterial chemoembolization or TACE , radionuclide therapy using 111 indium‐pentetreotide  or meta‐iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) , immunotherapy (alone  or in combination with octreotide ), and medical treatment using octreotide  or lantreotide  are available to patients with unresectable liver metastases . Ablative therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation, are now considered potentially curative treatments for liver metastases from different primary tumours including neuroendocrine tumours .\n\n【9】There has been no meta‐analyses or systematic reviews comparing liver resection with other treatments in resectable liver metastases from gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To determine the benefits and harms of liver resection versus other treatments in patients with resectable liver metastases from gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】We will consider all randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, publication status, or sample size) for inclusion.\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】Patients with liver metastases from gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (irrespective of the type of gastro‐entero‐pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour), who are amenable to potentially curative liver resections.\n\n【18】#### Types of interventions\n\n【19】We will include trials comparing liver resection versus radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation.

Despite this, the use of pain relieving interventions has been limited due to the misconception that neonates do not feel pain. This belief has now been refuted as there has been evidence published in the literature that fetal neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine systems are sufficiently mature at the time of viability for transmission and perception of painful stimuli ( Anand 1987 ; Fitzgerald 1989 ; Fitzgerald 1993 ; Giannakoulopoulos 94 ).\n\n【19】The International Association for the Study of Pain Committee defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage\" . The Committee states further that pain is a subjective phenomenon. Because neonates cannot communicate or express this phenomenon, the detection and quantification of pain in a neonate is a challenging task. Several validated pain scales/tools are available for use in both preterm and term neonates to assess procedure related pain. They are uni‐ or multi‐dimensional and measure behavioral, physiological and hormonal responses to pain .\n\n【20】Endotracheal intubation is a common procedure performed in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It involves placing an endotracheal tube into the trachea via the nares or the mouth using a laryngoscope. Intubations are performed either as an emergency procedure at birth as part of resuscitation or, later, in the NICU in response to worsening respiratory status, failed nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), apnea secondary to preterm birth, seizures, prostaglandin infusion, blocked tubes or accidental extubations. Intubations may also be performed electively prior to surgical, diagnostic (e.g. MRI) or interventional procedures (e.g. percutaneously inserted central venous catheters).\n\n【21】It has been shown that adults and children who undergo \"awake intubation\"(intubation without premedication) exhibit pain and physiologic responses such as hypertension, tachycardia, increase in the common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, and reduction in the femoral blood flow velocity . In neonates similar changes in the physiological responses have been documented including bradycardia, hypoxemia, increase in systolic blood pressure, and raised intracranial pressure secondary to the stimulation of vagal and mechanical pressure reflexes by insertion of the laryngoscope blade and the tube .\n\n【22】Within the last two decades, the concept of premedication for intubation in adults and in the pediatric population has been well documented. These medications can alleviate anxiety, and reduce the overall anesthetic requirements and time for intubation. Intubation is an unpleasant and irritating procedure when it is performed in an awake and struggling state. Intubation without premedication may increase the risk of trauma to the airways and, in neonates, of subsequent subglottic stenosis. The major putative advantages of the use of premedications are better visualization of the glottis due to reduced secretions, less trauma and less change in physiological parameters.\n\n【23】Drugs that may be administered as premedication before endotracheal intubation include anxiolytics, analgesics, neuromuscular blockers, and anticholinergics either in isolation or in combination. Morphine and fentanyl are routinely used as sedatives although their main properties are analgesic in nature. These drugs are also helpful to lessen the rise in intracranial pressure, reduce stress during intubation and minimize spikes in blood pressure. Neuromuscular blocking agents, or chemical paralytics, are categorized as depolarizing (succinylcholine) or nondepolarizing (vecuronium, pancuronium) and as short, medium, or long acting agents. Neuromuscular blockers block transmission of the nerve impulse at the neuromuscular junction. The only short acting neuromuscular blocker currently in use is succinylcholine . Atropine is used to reduce respiratory tract secretions. The overall objectives of use of premedication are to provide an optimal condition for intubation and to have a safe, smooth and rapid intubation with minimum adverse effects and hemodynamic stability. The major potential side effects due to premedication are fluctuations in systemic blood pressure and heart rate, increased intracranial pressure, chest wall and skeletal muscle rigidity, hyperkalemia, seizures, and respiratory depression. The important contraindications to the use of muscle relaxants are airway obstruction due to anatomical malformations (especially with severe micrognathia with or without cleft palate or other dysmorphic airways), open eye injury, CNS or neuromuscular diseases and acute bronchospasm .\n\n【24】Many infants that are being intubated in the NICU already have vascular access. Even in emergencies, as long as effective ventilation with bag and mask can be provided, there is the opportunity to administer premedication drugs. In the absence of vascular access, clinical judgment will guide the healthcare provider whether to secure vascular access for premedications or to intubate immediately without premedications.\n\n【25】The majority of NICUs worldwide do not have any policy for the use of premedication for intubation. In the United States, a survey was conducted in 101 NICUs to determine the prevailing method of intubating newborns. Most respondents denied routine use of atropine before intubation. Eighty two percent of respondents indicated that use of atropine was unnecessary and 22% indicated that atropine was not thought to be beneficial. Amongst responders, 84% never, 13% sometimes and 97% rarely used sedatives or muscle relaxants to facilitate intubation. Of those who used sedatives, 76% limited their use to full‐term newborns who were difficult to intubate. Narcotics were the agents of choice. Awake intubation was the preferred method in most neonatal units in the USA . A recent study from the UK reported that 37% of the NICUs used any sedation prior to intubation, that 14% of the NICUs had a formal protocol for premedication and that 8% of the NICUs used drugs for elective or emergent reintubations . Similarly, a Canadian survey showed that the use of premedication for intubation was limited. Physicians were more likely to use premedication for neonates with higher gestational age but only for elective intubations. The preferred anxiolytics, analgesics and neuromuscular blockers were midazolam (38‐44%), fentanyl (66‐68%), morphine (53‐57%) and succinylcholine (45‐51%). The main reasons given for not using premedication were \"inadequate evidence\", \"no need\" and \"discomfort in the use of drugs\" .\n\n【26】The efficacy of premedication to prevent pain in neonates undergoing intubation has recently been systematically reviewed  and the authors concluded that \"awake intubation\" is probably inappropriate in most newborn infants. It is likely that additional studies have been published since that review, justifying this Cochrane review.\n\n【27】The aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of premedication in decreasing the stress/pain responses in neonates undergoing intubation.\n\n【28】Objectives\n----------\n\n【29】The overall objective is to assess the effectiveness and safety of premedications in reducing stress/pain in neonates undergoing endotracheal intubation.\n\n【30】In separate comparisons we will assess the effectiveness and potential harmful effects of premedications in reducing stress/pain when used in isolation or in combination, as compared to placebo or nothing, or other premedication.

Long term alcohol consumption has harmful effects on almost all organs of the body, particularly the brain and gastro‐intestinal system. Healthcare professionals have the opportunity to ask people about how much alcohol they drink and offer brief interventions to heavy drinkers. These brief interventions involve a time limited intervention focusing on changing behaviour. They range from a single session providing information and advice to one to three sessions of motivational interviewing or skills‐based counselling involving feedback and discussion on responsibility and self efficacy. Different health professionals who do not require to be alcohol specialists may give the intervention. Admission to hospital as an inpatient, in general medical wards and trauma centres, provides an opportunity whereby heavy alcohol users are accessible, have time for an intervention, and may be made aware of any links between their hospitalisation and alcohol. The review authors identified 14 randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials involving 4041 mainly male adults (16 years or older) identified as heavy drinkers in hospital, mainly in the UK and USA.\n\n【23】The main results of this review indicate that there are benefits to delivering brief interventions to heavy alcohol users in general hospital. Our results demonstrate that patients receiving brief interventions have a greater reduction in alcohol consumption compared to those in control groups at six month and nine month follow up but this is not maintained at one year. In addition there were significantly fewer deaths in the groups receiving brief interventions than in control groups at 6 months and one year.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We aim to assess the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke.  \n(1) For the question of primary prevention, we aim to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in patients who have had a stroke but have not had a seizure.  \n(2) For the question of secondary prevention, we aim to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in patients who have had a stroke and at least one post‐stroke seizure.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Stroke is a major health problem in both the developed and developing world. In industrialised countries, it is the third most common cause of death after ischaemic heart disease and cancers, and almost half of all stroke survivors are left with a permanent handicap . Stroke mainly affects the older generation, although about 25% of all strokes occur under the age of 65, and about 1% under the age of 30.\n\n【6】Cerebrovascular disease is the most commonly identified cause of acquired epilepsy. Post‐stroke seizures account for 11% of all epilepsy, 22% of all cases of status epilepticus, and 55% of newly diagnosed seizures amongst older patients . The reported incidence of post‐stroke seizures varies widely between epidemiological studies, ranging from 2% to 33% for early seizures and 3% to 67% for late seizures . This is mainly due to the varying methods of case ascertainment and definitions used in relationship to the timing of post‐stroke seizures. According to epidemiological guidelines developed by the International League Against Epilepsy  seizures occurring within the first week of stroke are defined as 'early seizures', and those occurring after the first week are defined as 'late seizures'. Using this definition, approximately 2% to 6% of stroke patients suffer early seizures , and 3% to 5% suffer late seizures . In the longer term, one community‐based study found that the cumulative actuarial risk of having a post‐stroke seizure was 4.2% at one year and 11.5% at five years .\n\n【7】Development of late seizures is more common in patients who have experienced early seizures (risk is about 30% ). Moreover, development of post‐stroke epilepsy (that is, recurrent seizures) is more common in patients who have experienced late seizures, with a risk of about 50% , than for patients with early seizures where the risk is about 30% . Possible risk factors for post‐stroke seizures  include the following:\n\n【8】(1) stroke subtype: cerebral haemorrhage (especially subarachnoid haemorrhage);  \n(2) location of the lesion: cortical involvement, stroke occurring within the carotid artery territory;  \n(3) stroke severity (but correlation may be weaker after adjusting for stroke subtype and location).\n\n【9】The pathophysiology of early and late post‐stroke seizures is believed to be different. In the first few days following an ischaemic brain lesion, cellular biochemical dysfunction can lead to cortical excitability and seizure activity . Acute ischaemia leads to a massive release of glutamate, causing excessive activation of glutamate receptors. This process is believed to be responsible for secondary neuronal injury and epileptogenesis in ischaemic stroke . Within the ischaemic penumbra, a mixed population of dead, dying, and surviving neurones can become the underlying substrate for ischaemia‐induced epileptogenesis . In contrast, late seizures may be caused by development of gliosis and meningocerebral cicatrices, with changes in membrane properties, deafferentation, selective neuronal loss, and collateral sprouting . This can result in cortical hyperexcitability and neuronal synchrony sufficient to cause seizures .\n\n【10】The relationship between post‐stroke seizures and outcome remains unclear. Several studies have found that post‐stroke seizures may predict worse functional outcome, but many of these studies have not adjusted for important covariates such as stroke severity . One large study  showed that, before adjusting for stroke severity, occurrence of early post‐stroke seizures increased the risk of 30‐day mortality (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 12.5). However, after adjusting for stroke severity using the NIH Stroke Score, this association was not statistically significant (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.6 to 7.1). In another large community‐based study, early post‐stroke seizures actually predicted a better neurological outcome . There is also some evidence that post‐stroke seizures may significantly affect health‐related quality of life  but a large prospective study did not find any adverse effect on rehabilitation outcome as measured by the Barthel Index or the Rivermead Mobility Index .\n\n【11】The management of post‐stroke seizures is controversial. One observational study reported that, during a four‐year follow‐up period, half of all patients who received antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) after a first post‐stroke seizure had at least one seizure relapse . European guidelines recommend the use of AEDs to prevent recurrent seizures after stroke but prophylactic administration to patients who have not experienced a seizure is not recommended . American guidelines are less precise, simply stating that: \"there are no data about the utility of prophylactic administration of AEDs after stroke. There are few data concerning the efficacy of AEDs in the treatment of stroke patients who have experienced seizures; thus recommendations are based on the established management of seizures that may complicate any acute neurological illness\" . Some other experts go further and recommend that _early and late_ post‐stroke seizures should be treated with _long‐term_ prophylactic treatment with AEDs . However, many clinicians remain unclear whether isolated post‐stroke seizure requires treatment and, if so, which drug(s) should be initiated, at what dosage, and for how long. Furthermore, there are potential risks associated with using this class of pharmacological agents. For example, there are concerns that the use of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines in the post‐stroke period may adversely affect motor recovery . Our systematic review aims to assess the potential benefits and risks of AEDs for the prevention of seizures after stroke.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】We aim to assess the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke.  \n(1) For the question of primary prevention, we aim to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of seizures in patients who have had a stroke but have not had a seizure.  \n(2) For the question of secondary prevention, we aim to examine whether AEDs reduce the likelihood of further seizures in patients who have had a stroke and at least one post‐stroke seizure.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】We will consider all randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials in which patients were assigned to 'treatment' or 'control' group (that is, placebo or no drug).\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】We will use the World Health Organisation definition of stroke for this review . We will consider all studies that recruited patients with a new neurological deficit consistent with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. We will consider studies that included patients with either ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, but we will exclude studies that only recruited patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, extradural haemorrhage, or other non‐stroke diagnoses such as tumour‐ or infection‐related infarction or haemorrhage. We will also exclude studies that recruited only patients who had undergone any type of neurosurgery. The management of these excluded patient groups is likely to be substantially different to the generality of stroke patients. For studies which have reported the results for a mixture of patient groups, attempts will be made to separate them and identify those which are relevant to the patient groups of interest. If this is not possible, the studies will be excluded. Children or adults, partial or generalised onset seizures, will be included.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】AEDs were any of those listed on the Cochrane Epilepsy Group information page, including carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lamotrigine levetiracetam, lorazepam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, primidone, sodium valproate, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide. We will consider all trials in which the intervention was compared with a placebo or with no drug. Studies comparing two AEDs will be excluded.\n\n【22】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【23】**_Primary outcome measures_**  \nProportion of patients who experienced seizures in the scheduled follow‐up period. In cases where seizures have occurred, their nature (generalised or focal) and timings will be noted if reported. As described in the Background, seizures occurring within the first week of stroke will be defined as 'early seizures' and those occurring after the first week will be defined as 'late seizures' . Occurrence of recurrent late seizures will then be defined as 'post‐stroke epilepsy'.\n\n【24】**_Secondary outcome measures_**  \n(1) Proportion of patients who achieved remission for a pre‐defined period of time (e.g. 12 or 24 months).  \n(2) Proportion of patients who withdrew from the allocated treatment within the scheduled follow‐up period. This is a composite outcome which takes into account several factors including adverse events, compliance, and effectiveness of treatment. We are particularly interested in the occurrence of side effects for the different AEDs, which may be physical or neurobehavioural (e.g. problems with memory, attention and performance skills).  \n(3) Proportion of patients who were dead or dependent at the end of the scheduled follow‐up period. 'Independent' individuals will be defined as those who did not require regular physical assistance from another person for activities of daily living, such as mobility, dressing, transfers, and feeding. 'Dependent' individuals will be those who failed to meet one or more of these criteria.\n\n【25】**_Other outcomes of interest_**  \n(1) Quality of life (e.g. using a recognised scoring system such as SF36 and EuroQol).  \n(2) Duration of stay for the acute phase of stroke recovery.  \n(3) 'Optimal' duration of treatment (i.e. length of time that the intervention should be continued).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effects of oral antivirals in reducing the frequency of recurrence of HSV keratitis. Our main objective is to evaluate the prophylactic effect of oral antivirals on HSV deeper corneal involvement (i.e., necrotizing and non‐necrotizing stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and iritis) because of its implications for visual impairment.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are ever‐present human pathogens with the capability to cause asymptomatic infection or active disease at different end‐organs. Two types are known: type 1 (HSV‐1), which primarily affects the oropharynx, and type 2 (HSV‐2), which primarily affects the genital area. Although HSV‐1 typically causes ocular disease, both types can affect the eye . HSV has a broad spectrum of ocular manifestations. All structures of the ocular surface including lid margins, conjunctiva and cornea can be affected; but it is herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) that is of utmost importance because of its deleterious effects on vision.\n\n【7】Primary infection manifests clinically in only 1% to 6% of occasions. It is recurrence of the disease from primary infection, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, that causes significant visual morbidity. Therefore, recurrence physiopathology has drawn the attention of virologists and scientists for a long time. It is well known that recrudescent disease results from HSV reactivation from latency in trigeminal ganglion neurons . However, it has been shown that the cornea can be a reservoir for HSV viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) , that the virus can become latent or can persist in an infectious state within the cornea, and that anterograde spread from the trigeminal ganglion is not necessary for recurrent HSK . Furthermore, superinfection with a different strain of HSV may occur .\n\n【8】Latency allows for spontaneous and recurrent reactivation of disease, with clinical sequelae caused by the immunologic response associated with each episode. Stromal keratitis (inflammation of the stromal layer of the cornea), a common ocular manifestation of HSV infection, usually occurs at the ocular site with the highest recurrence risk and is strongly associated with previous HSV infectious episodes .\n\n【9】#### Epidemiology\n\n【10】The epidemiology of HSV ocular involvement has been studied extensively . The incidence of ocular HSV per 100,000 people per year has been estimated at 5.9 to 12 in Denmark , compared with 20.7 in Rochester, Minnesota , and 31.5 in France . The incidence of HSV epithelial keratitis is six times (120 per 100,000 people per year) higher in patients who have undergone corneal transplantation (for non‐herpetic corneal disease) . It is estimated that 10% to 12% of people with ocular HSV have bilateral disease .\n\n【11】The main focus of this review will be herpetic stromal keratitis, which is the most important clinical manifestation in recurrent disease. An estimate of the recurrence rate of HSV keratitis is approximately 10% per year . Herpetic stromal disease accounts for 2% of initial presentations and 20% to 48% of cases of recurrent herpetic disease. Corneal scarring is seen in 18% to 28%, with a corresponding reduction in visual acuity to less than 20/100 in 3% to 12% of cases and to less than 20/40 in 10% to 25% . Different stimuli have been associated with recurrent disease, such as fever, psychological stress, hormonal changes, and minor ocular trauma, among others . Study results on the association between participant age, gender or race, and risk of recurrence have been conflicting; some investigators have reported no association, and others have described increased risk among male participants  and members of the younger population .\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】Herpes simplex viruses (HSV‐1 and HSV‐2) belong to the α‐herpesvirus family subgroup. Adequate oral treatments available for this viral family include acyclovir and its oral prodrug valacyclovir, penciclovir and its oral prodrug famciclovir, ganciclovir and its oral prodrug valganciclovir, and brivudine. As acyclic nucleoside analogues, these drugs require phosphorylation by the virus‐encoded thymidine kinase to exert their antiviral activity; they do not inhibit the thymidine kinase－deficient HSV strains. When this occurs, other types of antivirals such as foscarnet can be used . It has been shown that oral antivirals in a prophylactic schema are safe and efficient in avoiding recurrence of HSV labialis  and HSV genitalis .\n\n【14】Oral acyclovir has become the standard prophylactic therapy for recurrent HSV stromal keratitis. Some interventional case series  and randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs)  have reported that prophylactic doses of acyclovir reduce the recurrence rate of HSV keratitis. Usually, the prophylactic dose of acyclovir is 800 mg a day in divided doses, 400 mg twice a day, or 200 mg four times daily, over varying periods of time (ranging from 1 month to 62 months). Oral valacyclovir, the acyclovir prodrug, is known to increase the bioavailability of acyclovir three to five times. The reported prophylactic dose of valacyclovir is 500 mg once a day, which provides a benefit regarding patient compliance and convenience when compared with multiple daily doses.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Although further knowledge of the pathogenesis of HSV stromal keratitis is needed, two main factors have been implicated: host immune response and viral replication. Antiviral therapy addresses viral replication by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis in virally infected cells.\n\n【17】Nucleoside analogues, such as acyclovir, have in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against HSV‐1 and HSV‐2, as well as against varicella‐zoster virus (VZV). Acyclovir is highly selective against herpes simplex viruses in that it binds to enzymes encoded by these viruses, specifically thymidine kinase (TK) . This viral enzyme, TK, converts acyclovir to acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted to diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and to triphosphate by various cellular enzymes. In vitro, acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA in three ways through competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase by incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain; an via inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. The greater antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is due to its more efficient phosphorylation by the viral TK . In the treatment of epithelial HSV keratitis, purine nucleoside analogues have shown superiority over pyrimidine analogues, specifically, acyclovir and trifluridine were shown to be more effective in a systematic review of treatments for epithelial HSV keratitis .\n\n【18】It has been reported that nucleoside analogues have no effect in latent HSV, but reactivation is necessary for completion of the HSV viral cycle; targeting reactivation prevents spread of the virus and disease recurrence. Studies reported that reactivation is an isolated event that is limited to a few neurons in sensory ganglia. The frequency with which an individual experiences reactivation ranges from 0 to 12 episodes per year and is positively correlated with the number of trigeminal ganglia latently infected . Also, a high proportion of human subjects have asymptomatic shedding of HSV‐1 DNA, and approximately 90% of human trigeminal ganglia contain HSV‐1 DNA . Suppression of asymptomatic shedding is one way that transmission of the virus might be blocked.\n\n【19】In vitro studies have shown that acyclovir preferentially affects cells that have been infected by HSV, and, unlike other antivirals, acyclovir has relatively little effect on normal, uninfected cells. Therefore, its toxicity is minimal. An important toxic effect of acyclovir is its potential to cause obstructive nephropathy. The drug is excreted primarily by the kidney; therefore, smaller doses may be required in patients with decreased kidney function . Valacyclovir has been reported to produce mild adverse effects. However, neurotoxicity has been reported among elderly and renally impaired patients .\n\n【20】It is important to note that a relatively high prevalence of acyclovir‐resistant corneal HSV‐1 has been reported in immunocompetent patients with HSV keratitis .\n\n【21】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【22】This review is needed so the reader can better understand the potential benefits and harms of using oral antivirals for the prevention of recurrent HSV stromal keratitis.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】To evaluate the effects of oral antivirals in reducing the frequency of recurrence of HSV keratitis. Our main objective is to evaluate the prophylactic effect of oral antivirals on HSV deeper corneal involvement (i.e., necrotizing and non‐necrotizing stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and iritis) because of its implications for visual impairment.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】We will include studies in which the eligibility criteria for enrollment included participant age of at least 12 years, active HSV stromal keratitis in the previous 12 months that was inactive at the time of enrollment and untreated for at least 30 days, and immune competence. We will not include studies of people with corneal grafts as they will be included in another Cochrane review .\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will include studies in which prophylactic long‐term treatment (at least 6 months) with oral antivirals was compared with placebo, different dose and/or treatment period of the same oral antiviral, treatment with other topically or orally administered antivirals, or no treatment.\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【35】The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants experiencing at least one recurrence of active HSV keratitis, defined as epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and/or iritis, one year after completion of the treatment period.\n\n【36】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【37】We also will consider recurrences during the prophylactic treatment period and the proportion of participants experiencing more than one recurrence of active HSV keratitis one year after completion of the treatment period. Other secondary outcomes will include the following:\n\n【38】1.  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA): the mean change in BCVA (transformed to logMAR scale) from baseline to the end of the treatment period and one year after completion of the treatment period.\n\n【39】2.  Ocular hypertension: the proportion of participants developing ocular hypertension, defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to 21 mm Hg, or as defined by the study, during the treatment period and one year after completion of the treatment period.\n\n【40】3.  Recurrence of nonocular HSV disease: the proportion of participants experiencing at least one episode of nonocular HSV disease (orofacial or genital) during the treatment period and one year after completion of the treatment period.\n\n【41】4.  Resistance to treatment: the proportion of participants developing resistance to antiviral therapy during the treatment period and one year after completion of the treatment period.\n\n【42】Follow‐up times longer than one year after completion of the treatment period will also be considered.\n\n【43】###### Adverse events\n\n【44】We will document adverse events reported by included studies.

GOR is a very common presentation in infancy in both primary and secondary care settings. GOR can affect approximately 50% of infants younger than three months old. The natural history of GOR in infancy is generally that of a functional, self‐limiting condition that improves with age; < 5% of children with vomiting or regurgitation continue to have symptoms after infancy. Older children and children with co‐existing medical conditions can have a more protracted course. The definition of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and its precise distinction from GOR are debated, but consensus guidelines from the North American Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition define GORD as 'troublesome symptoms or complications of GOR.'\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】This Cochrane review aims to provide a robust analysis of currently available pharmacological interventions used to treat children with GOR by assessing all outcomes indicating benefit or harm.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We sought to identify relevant published trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to 2014), the Centralised Information Service for Complementary Medicine (CISCOM), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Science Citation Index (on BIDS—UK General Science Index) and the ISI Web of Science. We also searched for ongoing trials in the _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT).\n\n【6】Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were handsearched for relevant paediatric studies on medical treatment of children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux, as were published abstracts from conference proceedings (published in _Gut_ and _Gastroenterology_ ) and reviews published over the past five years.No language restrictions were applied.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Abstracts were reviewed by two review authors, and relevant RCTs on study participants (birth to 16 years) with GOR receiving a pharmacological treatment were selected. Subgroup analysis was considered for children up to 12 months of age, and for children 12 months to 16 years of age, and for those with neurological impairment.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Trials were critically appraised and data collected by two review authors. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta‐analysis data were independently extracted by two review authors, and suitable outcome data were analysed using RevMan.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】A total of 24 studies (1201 participants) contributed data to the review. The review authors had several concerns regarding the studies. Pharmaceutical company support for manuscript preparation was a common feature; also, because common endpoints were lacking, study populations were heterogenous and variations in study design were noted, individual drug meta‐analysis was not possible.\n\n【13】Moderate‐quality evidence from individual studies suggests that **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** can reduce GOR symptoms in children with confirmed erosive oesophagitis. It was not possible to demonstrate statistical superiority of one PPI agent over another.\n\n【14】Some evidence indicates that **H** ₂ **antagonists** are effective in treating children with GORD. Methodological differences precluded performance of meta‐analysis on individual agents or on these agents as a class, in comparison with placebo or head‐to‐head versus PPIs, and additional studies are required.\n\n【15】RCT evidence is insufficient to permit assessment of the efficacy of **prokinetics** . Given the diversity of study designs and the heterogeneity of outcomes, it was not possible to perform a meta‐analysis of the efficacy of domperidone.\n\n【16】In younger children, the largest RCT of 80 children (one to 18 months of age) with GOR showed no evidence of improvement in symptoms and 24‐hour pH probe, but improvement in symptoms and reflux index was noted in a subgroup treated with domperidone and co‐magaldrox _(_ Maalox <sup><i>® </i></sup> _)_ . In another RCT of 17 children, after eight weeks of therapy. 33% of participants treated with domperidone noted an improvement in symptoms (P value was not significant). In neonates, the evidence is even weaker; one RCT of 26 neonates treated with domperidone over 24 hours showed that although reflux frequency was significantly increased, reflux duration was significantly improved.\n\n【17】Diversity of RCT evidence was found regarding efficacy of compound alginate preparations _(_ Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> _)_ in infants, although as a result of these studies, Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> was changed to become aluminium‐free and has been assessed in its current form in only two studies since 1999. Given the diversity of study designs and the heterogeneity of outcomes, as well as the evolution in formulation, it was not possible to perform a meta‐analysis on the efficacy of Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> . Moderate evidence indicates that Gaviscon Infant <sup>® </sup> improves symptoms in infants, including those with functional reflux; the largest study of the current formulation showed improvement in symptom control but was limited by length of follow‐up.\n\n【18】No serious side effects were reported.\n\n【19】No RCTs on pharmacological treatments for children with neurodisability were identified.\n\n【20】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【21】Moderate evidence was found to support the use of PPIs, along with some evidence to support the use of H₂ antagonists in older children with GORD, based on improvement in symptom scores, pH indices and endoscopic/histological appearances. However, lack of independent placebo‐controlled and head‐to‐head trials makes conclusions as to relative efficacy difficult to determine. Further RCTs are recommended. No robust RCT evidence is available to support the use of domperidone, and further studies on prokinetics are recommended, including assessments of erythromycin.\n\n【22】Pharmacological treatment of infants with reflux symptoms is problematic, as many infants have GOR, and little correlation has been noted between reported symptoms and endoscopic and pH findings. Better evidence has been found to support the use of PPIs in infants with GORD, but heterogeneity in outcomes and in study design impairs interpretation of placebo‐controlled data regarding efficacy. Some evidence is available to support the use of Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> , but further studies with longer follow‐up times are recommended. Studies of omeprazole and lansoprazole in infants with functional GOR have demonstrated variable benefit, probably because of differences in inclusion criteria.\n\n【23】No robust RCT evidence has been found regarding treatment of preterm babies with GOR/GORD or children with neurodisabilities. Initiation of RCTs with common endpoints is recommended, given the frequency of treatment and the use of multiple antireflux agents in these children.\n### PICOs\n\n【24】###### Populatio\n\n【25】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【26】###### Interventio\n\n【27】###### Compariso\n\n【28】*   Placebo\n\n【29】###### Outcom\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【31】### Medicines for children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux\n\n【32】**Review question**\n\n【33】Most babies grow out of their symptoms of reflux as they eat more solid food and spend more time upright, and as the length of the oesophagus grows, but do medicines help to make them more comfortable while this is happening? Older children can have heartburn, just like adults. Which treatment works best for them?\n\n【34】**Background**\n\n【35】Gastro‐oesophageal reflux happens when stomach contents come back up into the food pipe (oesophagus). This can be a normal event ('functional reflux'), but in some children, and in many babies, it can happen a lot, or it can cause symptoms such as pain, weight loss or other problems (e.g. ear infection, cough, even pauses in breathing). If this happens, the condition can be labelled as gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Sometimes the oesophagus becomes inflamed—a condition known as 'oesophagitis.'\n\n【36】Current medicines (e.g. Gaviscon Infant <sup>® </sup> ) aim to thicken stomach contents, neutralise stomach acid (ranitidine, omeprazole, lansoprazole) or help the stomach to empty faster (domperidone). We looked at all available studies to try to find out whether any of the medicines currently used for reflux can help babies and children. We wanted to know whether these medicines make babies and children feel better, or whether test results (such as healing of the lining of the oesophagus, assessed through endoscopy (a small camera passed down the food pipe), or lowering of the amount of acidity in the oesophagus, assessed using a pH probe over 24 hours) get better when these medicines are given.\n\n【37】**Study characteristics**\n\n【38】We included all studies (randomised controlled trials) comparing one type of medicine against another, or against an inactive medicine (placebo). We carefully looked at study results and tried to assess those that would be important to doctors, nurses and parents. We found a lot of differences between studies, and the small numbers of children included in the studies, the short follow‐up provided and differing outcomes made combining the data (meta‐analysis) in a meaningful way difficult.\n\n【39】**Key results**\n\n【40】Overall as a result of the small numbers of children recruited to these studies, we could not be certain whether medicines improve symptoms. We found little evidence to suggest that medicines for babies younger than one year work, especially for functional reflux; mixed evidence has been found on whether Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> helps, and for infants with reflux disease (changes on pH studies or on endoscopy), medicines like omeprazole and lansoprazole are likely to help. In older children, proton pump inhibitors and histamine antagonists work better to improve symptoms, endoscopy appearances and pH probe findings, but we were unable to perform a meta‐analysis, or to assess further whether one medicine was superior to another.\n\n【41】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【42】Overall available evidence was of moderate to low quality, depending on the medicine in question. We have made suggestions as to how future studies could be designed to provide better answers regarding which treatments are best for babies and children with reflux or reflux disease.\n\n【43】--------------\n\n【44】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【45】### Implications for practice\n\n【46】The evidence base of therapies for infants is mixed. In terms of pharmacological strategies, a clear distinction should be drawn between the treatment of infants with functional reflux and those with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (those with sequelae of GOR, or failure to thrive). In the subgroup of infants with functional reflux, the main problem appears to be caused by the milk bolus, although acid reflux undoubtedly occurs. Underlying transient gut dysmotility, with dysfunction of the lower oesophageal sphincter, a short oesophagus, high volumes of liquid feeds and a significant proportion of time lying flat are important predisposing factors that improve with time. In such a large group, the evidence also highlights significant discrepancies between reported symptom severity scores and endoscopic/histological findings, which are potentially affected by the numbers of children with distressing symptoms but functional reflux.\n\n【47】In terms of efficacious treatments, the best evidence for treatment of functional reflux appears to relate to Gaviscon Infant <sup>® </sup> , but these are short‐term studies with small numbers of participants. Orenstein demonstrated lack of symptomatic benefit from PPIs in infants with functional reflux. Evidence for strategies such as reassurance, positioning and use of thickened formula milk in appropriate volumes and frequencies is covered elsewhere. For infants with evidence of GORD on investigation (endoscopic changes or abnormal reflux index on pH probe), evidence of benefit from any medical treatment is weak. Further studies are needed to confirm whether PPIs or H₂ antagonists are superior in the group, and whether individual drugs offer superior efficacy. Weak evidence has been found for acid suppression (PPIs/H2‐receptor antagonists), with consequent decreased gastric enzyme activity, allowing for healing of oesophagitis, and symptomatic improvement. As a result of the factors previously discussed, we are unable to comment as to whether H₂ antagonists are superior to PPIs, but no evidence supports concurrent use. No consistent evidence for prokinetics (such as domperidone) has been found. It is currently difficult to justify continuing prescriptions of domperidone in infants for whom no benefit from empirical use has been reported. The current MHRA (Centre of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) alert recommends restricting empirical prescriptions to two weeks and avoiding them in children with co‐existing cardiac disease and in those receiving treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors .\n\n【48】Among older children with GORD, moderate evidence of benefit from PPIs has been found, along with weak evidence of benefit from H₂ antagonists, in providing symptomatic relief and in improving endoscopic/histological appearances and pH indices. No consistent evidence has been found for prokinetics (such as domperidone). It is currently difficult to justify prescriptions for domperidone among children for whom no benefit from empirical use is apparent. The current MHRA alert recommends restricting empirical prescriptions to two weeks and avoiding them in children with co‐existing cardiac disease and in those receiving treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors .\n\n【49】### Implications for research\n\n【50】Undoubtedly the burden of functional reflux and GORD on primary and secondary care is large, and further research is essential to clarify the role of medications in treating particular aspects of GOR. This review demonstrates the benefit of the Pediatric Written Request (PWR) made by the FDA in improving our knowledge of a class of medications that are widely prescribed (PPIs). This review would call for this to continue with extension to the remainder of the medications used to treat GOR (e.g. H₂ antagonists/Gaviscon Infant <sup>® </sup> ). We would also call for comparisons that include a placebo or different drug arm, as well as/rather than comparisons between same‐drug different dosing. It was evident that significant confounding interventions that would be likely to provide significant improvements as interventions in their own right (e.g. thickened or hydrolysed feeds to infants) were often given within trials to participants. Separate funding to support these calls would be a major step forward, and at least separating more clearly industry funding for the trial from manuscript preparation would be an improvement. Several of the recent PPI trials carried out under the PWR have declared support in manuscript writing from pharmaceutical manufacturers, and this carries inherent risks.\n\n【51】We would also highlight the need for specific RCTs into children with underlying oesophageal dysmotility (e.g. children with cerebral palsy), who often have difficult and protracted reflux, as most of these trials specifically excluded this subgroup. They often examine maximal medical therapies, including prokinetics, given for prolonged time periods, and treatment regimes for these groups are often extrapolated from those for other groups of children. Premature babies are often also treated empirically for gastro‐oesophageal reflux, for example, causing apnoea; further RCTs in this age group, using consistent outcomes, are also recommended.\n\n【52】Background\n----------\n\n【53】### Description of the condition\n\n【54】Gastro‐oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common problem, characterised by passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus . GOR is a very common presentation in both primary care and secondary care settings. GOR can affect approximately 50% of infants younger than three months of age . The natural history of GOR generally includes improvement with age, with < 5% of children with vomiting or regurgitation in infancy continuing to have symptoms after the age of 14 months . This occurs because of a combination of growth in length of the oesophagus, more upright posture, increased tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter and a more solid diet.\n\n【55】Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is defined as 'GOR associated with troublesome symptoms or complications' , although the review authors caution that this definition is complicated by unreliable reporting of symptoms in children younger than eight years of age. Gastrointestinal sequelae include oesophagitis, haematemesis, oesophageal stricture formation and Barrett's oesophagitis. Extra‐intestinal sequelae can include acute life‐threatening events and apnoea, chronic otitis media, sinusitis, secondary anaemia and chronic respiratory disease (chronic wheezing/coughing or aspiration), as well as failure to thrive.\n\n【56】A recent study of 210 children with GOR in infancy diagnosed by Rome II criteria and followed up for 24 months showed that 88% were symptom‐free by 12 months . However the presence of severe oesophagitis has been shown historically to predict the need for surgical reconstruction .\n\n【57】Children with certain predisposing conditions are more prone to severe GORD and include those with neurological impairment (e.g. cerebral palsy), repaired oesophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia or chronic lung disease.\n\n【58】Diagnosis of functional GOR is usually made on the basis of symptoms alone, avoiding the need for expensive and possibly harmful investigations. Investigations conducted to assess the severity of GORD or in cases where GOR cannot be diagnosed on clinical grounds include 24‐hour oesophageal pH monitoring, which can be combined with impedance monitoring, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, oesophageal manometry, scintigraphy or sonography. All have been shown to correlate poorly with symptomatology and may not accurately predict the degree of improvement that can be attained with treatment .\n\n【59】### Description of the intervention\n\n【60】The main aims of treatment of children with GOR are to alleviate symptoms, promote normal growth and prevent complications.\n\n【61】Pharmacological treatments include those discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\n【62】#### Treatments that alter gastric pH\n\n【63】These medications improve symptoms not by reducing reflux but by reducing the acidity of refluxate, in theory reducing oesophageal irritation and providing symptomatic relief.\n\n【64】##### Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\n\n【65】PPIs such as omeprazole and lansoprazole constitute a group of drugs that irreversibly inactivate H+/K+‐ATPase—the parietal cell membrane transporter. This action increases the pH of gastric contents and decreases the total volume of gastric secretion, thus facilitating emptying. Five PPIs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in adults: omeprazole , lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole (the pure S‐isomer of omeprazole). Omeprazole is licenced in children over one year of age in the UK, and lansoprazole is recommended by the British National Formulary only for children for whom treatment with available formulations of omeprazole is unsuitable . All are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system within 60 minutes in adults, and all are relatively safe, with few reported side effects. PPIs are also safe in children with renal impairment, but hepatic metabolism of PPIs may be impaired. The efficacy of PPIs may be affected by immature parietal cells, which are less responsive, and by hypochlorhydria in the first 20 months. Gastric pH does provide some protection, as evidence suggests that potentiating hypochlorhydria in neonates further with omeprazole can result in bacterial overgrowth . Consequent increases in respiratory infections among critically ill patients have been identified, but in infants and children who are otherwise well, no clear ill effects have been demonstrated with this overgrowth. An MHRA (Centre of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) alert in 2012 highlights that PPIs used for longer than three months may be associated with hypomagnesaemia and increased risk of fracture in the elderly .\n\n【66】##### H₂‐receptor antagonists (H2RAs)\n\n【67】Several studies have suggested that H₂ antagonists are efficacious in children. Ranitidine is well tolerated and has a low incidence of side effects (common side effects include fatigue, dizziness and diarrhoea) . Ranitidine is the H₂ antagonist used most commonly to reduce the acidity of gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Cimetidine is rarely used clinically, as concerns surround its effects on cytochrome P450, leading to multiple drug interactions and interfering with vitamin D metabolism and endocrine function. Famotidine is a recently developed H₂ antagonist that is not commonly used in children. Tachyphylaxis from H2 antagonists has been reported .\n\n【68】##### Antacids\n\n【69】###### Magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide (MHAH)\n\n【70】This agent reduces gastric pH and is commercially available as Maalox <sup><i>® </i></sup> . However, aluminium should be avoided in long‐term use in infants and children with chronic renal failure because of the risk of aluminium accumulation.\n\n【71】#### Treatments that alter the motility of the gut (prokinetics)\n\n【72】These are considered when GOR fails to improve with conservative measures. Several classes of drugs have been designed to increase gastrointestinal motility.\n\n【73】**Domperidone** is a dopamine‐receptor (D‐2) blocker that is associated with relatively fewer side effects, but case reports have described extrapyramidal side effects . Domperidone acts to increase motility and gastric emptying and to decrease postprandial reflux time. Domperidone is commonly used in clinical practise as part of empirical medical therapy for gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease or for individuals with delayed gastric emptying demonstrated on a barium swallow or milk scan. Concern is now emerging  regarding the risk of cardiac side effects, and current advice states that domperidone should not be used in children with co‐existing cardiac disease and in those taking CYP3A4 inhibitors, and that a daily dose of 30 mg should not be exceeded in children over 12 years of age; in younger children, no more than 250 micrograms/kg three times a day should be given. Domperidone should not be used to treat children with nausea and vomiting for longer than 1 week.\n\n【74】**Erythomycin** is a macrolide antibiotic that binds to the motilin receptor to promote peristalsis and gastric emptying, to decrease postprandial reflux time. Its use as a prokinetic is as an unlicenced indication.\n\n【75】**Metoclopramide** has alpha‐sympathomimetic activity and blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors. Several adverse effects have been associated with metoclopramide in 11% to 34% of children. Adverse effects can include drowsiness or restlessness and the rarer extrapyramidal reaction (neck pain, rigidity, trismus and oculogyric crisis), which may be more likely with higher doses . Metoclopramide has been the subject of an FDA 'black box' warning , and in August 2013, the European Medicines Agency released a statement indicating that the risk of neurological adverse events (such as short‐term extrapyramidal disorders and tardive dyskinesia) associated with metoclopramide outweighed the benefit, when it is taken for a prolonged time at a high dose . Metoclopramide has been assessed in a separate Cochrane review ; therefore we do not propose to review the literature regarding metoclopramide, as metoclopramide is rarely used to treat reflux in children because of its side effect profile.\n\n【76】**Cisapride** is a gastro‐oesophageal prokinetic agent that stimulates motility in the lower oesophagus, stomach and small intestine by increasing acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus and thereby controlling smooth muscle. At its peak, cisapride had been prescribed to more than 36 million children worldwide  and was recommended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. However concerns about the effects of cisapride in prolonging the QT interval led to its removal from general paediatric use . A Cochrane review found no clear evidence that cisapride reduces symptoms of GOR . However evidence of substantial publication bias favoured studies showing positive effects of cisapride. The only study known to compare cisapride with another treatment (Gaviscon <sup><i>® </i></sup> with or without Carobel) failed to show superior efficacy . Given the known risks of toxicity and suspension of its manufacture, further trials of cisapride are unlikely. As Cisapride has been the subject of a separate Cochrane review and is now no longer manufactured, we did not review the literature regarding cisapride.\n\n【77】#### Treatments that alter the viscosity of gastric contents\n\n【78】##### Alginates (e.g. Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> )\n\n【79】Compound alginate preparations (hereinafter described as Gaviscon Infant <sup>® </sup> ) contain sodium and magnesium alginate and mannitol; this preparation prevents reflux by increasing the viscosity of gastric contents  and is differentiated from other Gaviscon <sup><i>® </i></sup> preparations, which can also contain sodium bicarbonate/potassium bicarbonate that, in the presence of gastric acid, forms a gel in which carbon dioxide (derived from the breakdown of bicarbonate) is trapped. This 'foam raft' floats on top of the gastric contents and is designed to neutralise gastric acid (providing symptomatic relief), thicken the feed (to reduce reflux) and reduce oesophageal irritation .\n\n【80】Caution should be used when alginates that contain aluminium are used  in children with vomiting or diarrhoea or at risk of intestinal obstruction . In children whose feeds are already thickened (e.g. Enfamil AR/SMA Staydown), co‐administered Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> could potentially cause intestinal obstruction . Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> contains 0.92 mmol Na <sup>+ </sup> /dose, which should be considered if a child’s sodium intake needs to be monitored with caution (e.g. renal impairment, congestive cardiac failure, preterm delivery, diarrhoea and vomiting) . Gaviscon Infant <sup><i>® </i></sup> was changed to become aluminium‐free, with different proportions of alginate, and has been assessed in its current form in only two studies since 1999.\n\n【81】##### Antispasmodics\n\n【82】**Baclofen** is primarily an antispasmodic acting on GABA receptors and is commonly used in children with neurodisability such as cerebral palsy. It has been used to treat co‐existing reflux by aiming to improve the inco‐ordination of the lower oesophageal sphincter, thereby reducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs).\n\n【83】#### Conservative options\n\n【84】Such options include reassuring parents and positioning the baby to reduce gastro‐oesophageal reflux, through the effects of gravity on gastric contents. Approaches include elevating the head of the cot or basket in which the baby is placed to sleep and keeping the baby in an upright sitting position after a feed.\n\n【85】Altering the consistency of the feed can be achieved by using feed thickeners (e.g. Carobel) and by reducing the reflux of gastric contents with increased viscosity. Some feeds are manufactured with a thickening agent added (e.g. SMA Staydown/Infamil AR). Weaning has a similar effect by increasing the viscosity of gastric contents, and gastro‐oesophageal reflux is known to improve with weaning. In this review, we have considered compound alginates but not feed thickeners, as these have been covered by a previous Cochrane review .\n\n【86】Changes in milk can also improve GOR. Some evidence suggests that using a partially hydrolysed formula (e.g. Peptijunior) or a completely hydrolysed formula (e.g. Neocate) may ameliorate gastro‐oesophageal reflux resulting from food protein intolerance. Hill and Hoskings looked at \"a group of infants with distressed behaviour attributed to GOR who have failed to respond to H₂‐receptor antagonists, prokinetic agents and multiple formula changes. Symptoms resolved on commencement of an elemental amino acid‐based formula. In two‐thirds of the patients, symptoms relapsed when challenged with low‐allergen soy formula or extensively hydrolysed formula\" .\n\n【87】#### Surgical options\n\n【88】Such approaches are used to limit GORD. The most common strategy consists of a Nissen fundoplication involving a 360‐degree wrap . This intervention aims to combine antireflux factors: reduction of hiatal hernia, creation of a valve/high‐pressure zone at the distal oesophagus, placement of the distal oesophageal segment into the abdominal cavity with exposure to intra‐abdominal positive pressure, re‐creation of the diaphragmatic crural mechanism and re‐creation of an acute angle. However when underlying dysmotility occurs, this will persist, and retching will continue as a prominent feature.\n\n【89】Conservative and surgical strategies are not addressed by this Cochrane review, which seeks to assess medical treatments for which various validated studies (e.g. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) have been carried out and more formal evidence‐based statements can be made to better inform medical practitioners (general practitioners (GPs)/paediatricians). Surgery is performed for a small minority of children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux, and inclusion of this treatment would divert from the main focus of this review.\n\n【90】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【91】Gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children is a common condition often presenting to general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians. No systematic review has yet assessed the medical evidence for commonly prescribed treatments. This systematic review aims to critically appraise the existing paediatric literature by assessing all relevant RCTs.\n\n【92】Pharmacological treatment of children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux is commonly provided by medical professionals for symptomatic relief. Medical prescribing for this condition is common; this Cochrane review aimed to assess the best available evidence for these commonly used treatments and to provide evidence‐based recommendations for best medical practice.\n\n【93】Objectives\n----------\n\n【94】This Cochrane review aims to provide a robust analysis of currently available pharmacological interventions used to treat children with GOR by assessing all outcomes indicating benefit or harm.\n\n【95】Methods\n-------\n\n【96】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【97】#### Types of studies\n\n【98】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were considered and evaluated. Exclusions of randomised studies are justified below individually.\n\n【99】#### Types of participants\n\n【100】All children (birth to 16 years) with 'GOR associated with troublesome symptoms or complications.' Consideration was given to participant selection and the potential for selection bias. This involved assessing the strategy of recruitment and discussion of the processes of randomisation (this should be performed independent of and remote to the investigators) and blinding (up to and after the point of treatment allocation).\n\n【101】We analysed data on all children younger than 16 years of age. Subgroup analysis was undertaken in two groups: infants younger than 12 months of age, and children between 12 months and 16 years of age. These subgroups have different GOR characteristics, and consensus indicates that symptoms of GORD differ with age , for example, infants with symptomatic gastro‐oesophageal reflux have different symptoms when compared with older children (who generally are consuming a more solid diet and are upright). In infants, differences in the prevalence of regurgitation, food refusal and crying have been highlighted between a healthy cohort and infants with abnormal oesophageal pH studies and/or abnormal biopsy findings. Heterogeneity in the quantification of 'regurgitation' among infants has been noted. Among children over 12 months of age, the older the child, the more heartburn and waterbrash become predominant presenting symptoms, with younger children more likely to present with posseting, irritability and back arching. Some sections of the review assess treatments such as alginates, which would be used mainly in the infant population.\n\n【102】We also avoided studies assessing pharmacological treatments for children with GORD with co‐existent conditions such as tracheo‐oesophageal fistula (TEF) or asthma that predispose to GORD. These studies should be excluded from this review to avoid heterogeneity between participants.\n\n【103】#### Types of interventions\n\n【104】All currently available medical treatments for gastro‐oesophageal reflux in children were included in this review.\n\n【105】We considered all randomised controlled trials—those that compare the medication in question versus placebo or versus other medications; both types of studies will be of interest. No restrictions on dose, frequency or duration were applied. We have not assessed differences between generic preparations and branded antireflux medications in this review.\n\n【106】We attempted comparisons of all active treatments versus placebo, with respect to treatment class (i.e. compound alginate preparations vs placebo, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole) vs placebo, H₂ antagonists (ranitidine, famotidine, cimetidine) vs placebo, prokinetics (domperidone, erythromycin, bethanechol) vs placebo and sucralfate vs placebo). We noted that metoclopramide and thickened feeds had already been assessed in 2007, as was discussed above .\n\n【107】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【108】We included all reported outcomes that were likely to be meaningful to clinicians (such as general practitioners and paediatricians) in making a medical decision about treating children with gastro‐oesophageal reflux. Useful discriminators for assessing improvement include clinical symptoms and thoroughness of the investigation.\n\n【109】Clinical symptoms include the following.\n\n【110】*   Number of vomiting episodes, back arching, regurgitation, failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, or abdominal pain in infants.\n\n【111】*   Heartburn, epigastric pain or regurgitation symptoms in older children.\n\n【112】'Regurgitation' is defined according to the Montreal criteria as occurring when relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) allows retrograde movement of gastric contents into the oesophagus and beyond; it can include ejection of refluxate from the mouth. Regurgitation is distinguished from vomiting physiologically by the absence of:\n\n【113】*   a central nervous system emetic reflex;\n\n【114】*   retrograde upper intestinal contractions;\n\n【115】*   nausea; and\n\n【116】*   retching.\n\n【117】Regurgitation is generally characterized as effortless and non‐projectile, although it may be forceful in infants .\n\n【118】Investigative tools include the following.\n\n【119】*   24‐Hour pH probe and/or impedance studies.\n\n【120】    *   Reflux index on pH probe = percentage of time with oesophageal pH < 4.\n\n【121】    *   Number of reflux episodes.\n\n【122】*   Macroscopic appearance of oesophagus on endoscopy.\n\n【123】Consensus indicates that insufficient data are available for histology to be recommended as a tool to diagnose or exclude GORD in children, but that histology is useful to rule out other conditions, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, Crohn's disease, infection and graft‐versus‐host disease . However, description of histological changes was considered, and, when relevant in helping clinicians, useful findings have been described below. No studies were excluded on the basis of outcome, but studies purely assessing pharmacokinetic outcomes or taste were not included, as they did not fulfil the original protocol for inclusion; corresponding authors were contacted to ensure that no relevant participant data were not published, to exclude outcome bias. In cases of uncertainty, corresponding authors were contacted for clarification.\n\n【124】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【125】Primary outcomes considered included improvement in clinical symptoms. These were usually assessed through questionnaires completed by parents and child care providers and include the following: number of vomiting episodes (continuous data), episodes of back arching (continuous data), number of episodes of regurgitation (continuous), failure to thrive (binary outcome), feeding difficulties (binary outcome) and abdominal pain in infants (continuous data). In older children, the numbers of episodes of heartburn, epigastric pain or regurgitation (continuous data) were again assessed through questionnaires completed by patients, parents and healthcare professionals. These included, for example, the GOR‐Q questionnaire, which was completed daily by parents and healthcare professionals and provides quantitative data through validated symptom scores. Also included are any serious reported side effects associated with individual medical treatments (these are currently classified as serious suspected adverse reactions (SSARs) or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)), as defined by the Medicines Health Regulation Authority (\"All adverse events judged either by the investigator or sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship to an Investigational Medicinal Product\").\n\n【126】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【127】Secondary outcomes included improvement in the reflux index (continuous data) or in the number of reflux episodes on 24‐hour pH probe (continuous data), results of impedance studies (continuous) and improvement of oesophagitis on endoscopy (visual appearance—binary outcome). Different grading scales are currently used to classify macroscopic appearances of the oesophagus; currently no single grading scale has been demonstrated to show superior validity to existing alternatives. The number of children within a study population who failed to improve and required fundoplication was a secondary outcome (binary outcome).\n\n【128】These endpoints yielded both continuous and dichotomous data. Clinical symptoms produced continuous data (e.g. number of vomiting episodes), describing outcomes in terms of mean differences and standardised mean differences. Dichotomous data such as improvement/non‐improvement in endoscopic appearance produced outcomes presented as risk ratios, from which 'numbers needed to treat' data were derived.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Oxygen has the potential for both beneficial and deleterious effects . At birth many preterm infants, particularly the very premature infants, have lung pathology that often needs respiratory assistance and supplemental oxygen during resuscitation. Acute asphyxia can lead to brain hypoxia and ischaemia due to systemic hypoxaemia, reduced cerebral blood flow, or both. These physiological processes can lead to death and morbidity . For example, intraventricular haemorrhage is now thought to be caused by capillary bleeding because of an abrupt alteration in cerebral blood flow and pressure. Conversely, hyperoxia has also been found to slow cerebral blood flow in term and preterm infants . In addition, the antioxidant defence system is immature in preterm infants and they are more susceptible to the effects of free oxygen radical damage . Oxidative stress caused by free oxygen radicals is associated with significant injury to the brain, lungs, heart and eyes  and neonatal bowel . It is also during the recovery or reperfusion period when oxygen free radicals are released and excessive oxidative stress can lead to further tissue damage in preterm infants, such as that seen in hypoxic‐ischaemic brain injury , retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), chronic lung disease (CLD)  and cerebral palsy (CP) . CLD is a serious condition that results in chronic inflammation and fibrosis in the infant lung with recurring cycles of lung damage and repair that may impair alveolarization and vascularization in the developing lungs . ROP is characterised by abnormal retinal vascular development and remains a major cause of blindness and visual impairment despite continuous improvements in neonatal care .\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】The aim of resuscitation is to prevent death and adverse long‐term neurodevelopmental sequelae . Accumulating evidence over the last decade has challenged clinicians to reconsider the optimal oxygen concentration for resuscitation of the newborn term infant . A number of studies have compared varying levels of oxygen at resuscitation without targeting a predetermined oxygen saturation range in term infants (for example Saugstad 1998 , 21% versus 100%; Vento 2001 , 21% versus 100%; Harling 2005 , 50% versus 100%).\n\n【17】Several systematic reviews have compared the use of 100% and 21% oxygen during resuscitation . A Cochrane review  found a reduction in mortality in infants resuscitated with room air and no evidence of adverse effects. However, more than a quarter of the infants randomised to 21% oxygen (room air) required supplemental oxygen. A planned subgroup analysis based on gestational age was not possible as the results of individual studies were not stratified for gestational age. Saugstad 2008 similarly reported that the relative risk of mortality was less when 21% oxygen rather than 100% oxygen was used as the resuscitation gas.\n\n【18】Recently there has been an increased interest in titrating oxygen concentrations according to a targeted oxygen saturation range. A randomised controlled trial  studied oxidative stress in preterm infants who were resuscitated with 100% oxygen throughout the resuscitation (without oxygen saturation targeting) versus preterm infants who were initially given 100% oxygen and titrated according to a predetermined target oxygen saturation (90 to 95%). These authors concluded that oxidative stress may be reduced by titrating oxygen concentrations according to targeted oxygen saturations during resuscitation. An observational study by Dawson 2009 compared preterm infants receiving 100% oxygen throughout the entire resuscitation and those that initially received 21% oxygen and then were titrated according to a predetermined target oxygen saturation (80% to 90%). The authors similarly concluded that it is possible to adjust the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO <sub>2 </sub> ) to keep peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO <sub>2 </sub> ) measurements within a targeted range during resuscitation. However, 92% of infants resuscitated with 21% oxygen required supplemental oxygen. Thus, the interest of this review is to assess trials that have compared higher versus lower oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation for preterm infants at birth.\n\n【19】### How the intervention might work\n\n【20】The immediate period of transition from fetal to neonatal life requires a unique adjustment from lower to higher environmental oxygen exposure. Oxygen saturations are lower in utero than ex utero, and the rate of change from fetal to neonatal values has been shown to be a more gradual process than we previously believed. The natural history of the transition from fetal to neonatal blood oxygen levels has been documented to be a slow but steady increase in the first five to 10 minutes of life . Fetal oxygen partial pressure (PaO <sub>2 </sub> ) levels are in the 15 to 30 mmHg range, resulting in fetal SpO <sub>2 </sub> levels of 45% to 55%. After delivery, these pressure levels will normally rise over the next few minutes to between 50 mmHg and 80 mmHg  depending on the status of the lungs, the pulmonary circulation, and the presence of other stressors at delivery. It has been shown that the oxygen saturation of healthy premature infants rises gradually after birth and only reaches 90% saturation readings by a median of seven minutes of life . It is postulated that resuscitation with oxygen titrated on the basis of targeted saturation levels can mimic the saturation oxygen levels of transitioning premature infants not needing resuscitation, with a resultant physiological rise of oxygen saturation. Thus, the goal of oxygen saturation targeting is to reduce total oxygen load while 'normal and adequate' oxygen saturation and tissue oxygenation is maintained. Pulse oximetry allows clinicians to continuously monitor and target oxygen saturation levels within a defined range . Thus, rather than resuscitating infants with a predetermined oxygen concentration such as 100% or 21% throughout the resuscitation, it has been proposed that titrating oxygen concentrations, for example increasing the initial concentration from 21% oxygen or decreasing initial concentration from 100% according to a predetermined oxygen saturation range, helps prevent hypoxia or hyperoxia or oxidative stress in premature infants .\n\n【21】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【22】The use of oxygen during the resuscitation of preterm infants has become an increasingly controversial issue . There is a growing body of evidence that room air resuscitation is well tolerated in most term infants . However, the optimal oxygen concentration levels for preterm infants, who often have some element of pulmonary disease and usually require more intensive resuscitation, are less clear . The question as to whether higher or lower initial oxygen concentrations that are titrated according to oxygen saturation targeting during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth would lead to improved short and long term mortality and morbidity remains unanswered. Therefore, it is difficult for clinicians to make informed decisions regarding the use of oxygen in preterm infants.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】To determine whether higher or lower initial oxygen concentrations then titrated according to oxygen saturation targeting during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth lead to improved short and long term mortality and morbidity.\n\n【25】### Primary comparison\n\n【26】*   Any of the lower concentrations of oxygen (21%, air, > 21% to 29% (very low); ≥ 30% to 39% (low)) versus any of the higher concentrations of oxygen (≥ 40% to 59% (high); ≥ 60% to 100% (very high)).\n\n【27】The primary comparison will be analysed in subgroups within the same analysis. We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【28】*   targeted oxygen saturation (low or high upper target limit for titration, < 85%; 85% to 90%; 91% to 95%; > 95%);\n\n【29】*   type of oxygen saturation monitor (fractional or functional oxygen saturation);\n\n【30】*   gestation (< 28 weeks; 28 weeks to 32 weeks; 33 weeks to 36 weeks).\n\n【31】### Secondary analyses\n\n【32】Studies that compare two oxygen concentrations that may considered to be either in the lower or the higher ranges will not be included in the primary analyses.

We will not include trials that compare O <sub>2 </sub> saturation targets.\n\n【42】Both groups must have the same targeted oxygen saturation.\n\n【43】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【44】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【45】*   Mortality, near term corrected or at discharge (latest reported).\n\n【46】*   Neurodevelopmental disability (after at least 18 months postnatal age):\n\n【47】*   *   neurological abnormality including cerebral palsy on clinical examination, developmental delay more than 2 SD below population mean on any standard test of development;\n\n【48】    *   blindness (visual acuity < 6/60);\n\n【49】    *   deafness (any hearing impairment requiring amplification).\n\n【50】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【51】###### Response to resuscitation\n\n【52】Need for:\n\n【53】*   intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in the delivery room;\n\n【54】*   intubation in the delivery room;\n\n【55】*   time to reach desired oxygen saturation target (seconds or minutes).\n\n【56】###### Neonatal outcomes\n\n【57】*   Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (any; severe (stage 3 or greater)).\n\n【58】*   Duration of respiratory support (mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) (days from birth).\n\n【59】*   Duration of supplemental oxygen administration (days from birth).\n\n【60】*   Intraventricular haemorrhage  (IVH) (any; severe, = stage ≥ 3) according to Papile classification .\n\n【61】*   Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (cystic).\n\n【62】*   Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) Grade 1 to 3 .\n\n【63】*   Necrotising enterocolitis (proven, = Bell stage ≥ 2) .\n\n【64】*   Chronic lung disease (need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life; need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age for infants born at or before 32 weeks gestation)\n\n【65】Late mortality (after at least 18 months postnatal age):\n\n【66】*   postnatal growth failure (weight < 10th percentile at discharge);\n\n【67】*   duration of hospitalisation (days from birth).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】The primary objective is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), chest X‐ray and ultrasound) in the evaluation of people suspected to have COVID‐19. This may also refer to specific signs, such as a particular CT finding.\n\n【4】#### Secondary objectives\n\n【5】1.  To evaluate whether these imaging tests are sufficiently accurate to rule out COVID‐19 (main measure of interest will be the negative predictive value)\n\n【6】2.  To evaluate the rate of positive imaging in patients with initial RT‐PCR negative results who have a positive result on a follow‐up RT‐PCR test\n\n【7】3.  To determine if there is an association between number of days after symptom onset, symptom severity and the findings on chest imaging for patients with COVID‐19\n\n【8】4.  To determine the rate of discrepancy or agreement between CT, chest X‐ray and ultrasound findings\n\n【9】5.  To evaluate for ‘threshold’ effects of imaging findings of COVID‐19 and accuracy measures\n\n【10】6.  To determine the rate of alternative diagnoses identified by chest imaging\n\n【11】--------------\n\n【12】Background\n----------\n\n【13】At the end of December 2019, Chinese public health authorities reported several cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei province, due to a novel coronavirus. On 30 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global health emergency, on 11 March 2020, a pandemic . The basic reproduction number (R0) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), as a metric for transmissibility, ranges from 2.8 to 5.5 . Globally, there have been more than 5,000,000 confirmed cases of COVID‐19, including more than 300,000 deaths, reported to WHO . The majority (81%) of symptomatic COVID‐19 patients develop a mild form of the disease with dry cough, fever, or unspecific symptoms, such as headache, myalgias, or fatigue . The SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic presents important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These include understanding the value of signs and symptoms in diagnosing possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and those needing critical care, and evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing, either to identify or rule out current infection, identify those in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immunity.\n\n【14】Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and outbreaks in different settings. They will change over time, if and when accurate tests, effective treatments, and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform medical decisions.\n\n【15】Therefore, it is essential to understand the accuracy of tests and diagnostic features to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways for different settings. We are producing a suite of Cochrane ‘living systematic reviews’, which will summarise evidence on the accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to the research questions and settings that we are aware of. Estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.\n\n【16】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) Review of computed tomography (CT), chest X‐ray, and ultrasound for COVID‐19. We have included an explanation of terminology and acronyms in Appendix 1 .\n\n【17】### Target condition being diagnosed\n\n【18】The target condition being evaluated is COVID‐19, the disease caused by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. People infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 can be asymptomatic; these people are not considered to have COVID‐19 and are not considered to be within the scope of this review. People with the target condition of COVID‐19 can have a wide variety of symptoms, varying from fever, cough, aches and lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest, to shortness of breath and increased respiratory rate, potentially requiring supplemental oxygen, and in severe cases even requiring mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure.\n\n【19】We will focus on people suspected to have COVID‐19 who had chest imaging as part of their evaluation or care.\n\n【20】### Index test(s)\n\n【21】#### Chest computed tomography (CT)\n\n【22】Chest CT refers to the acquisition of images of the chest using computed tomography. Typical imaging protocols would not use intravenous (IV) contrast; however, we will consider all variations of imaging protocols for this review with the exception of studies specifically targeted at evaluating the coronary arteries or the heart, which do not include the entire lungs in the field of view. This would include, but is not limited to, non‐contrast CT thorax, low‐dose CT thorax (with or without contrast), high‐resolution CT thorax, CT thorax with IV contrast (routine or pulmonary angiogram).\n\n【23】#### Chest radiographs/chest X‐rays\n\n【24】Chest radiography refers to evaluation of the lungs using X‐rays. This often involves two orthogonal views, posterior‐anterior (PA) and lateral, but may be done by portable machine and only acquire an anterior‐posterior (AP) view. In this review, we will consider any and all variations of chest radiography protocols that evaluate the lungs. We will not include protocols that do not include the entire thorax, and are done for reasons other than for assessment of pulmonary status (e.g. assessment of feeding tube position, which typically only includes the lower thorax, or dedicated evaluation of the ribs).\n\n【25】#### Ultrasound of the lungs\n\n【26】Ultrasound of the lungs refers to any ultrasound of the thorax done with the intention of evaluating the status of the lungs. This includes, but is not limited to point‐of‐care ultrasound (POCUS), done at the bedside by a physician, as well as what is often termed ‘consultative’ ultrasound, which is done by a technologist and subsequently interpreted by a physician (typically a radiologist). We will consider all possible technical parameters (e.g. type of probe, transducer frequency, use of contrast). This would not include ultrasound done with the intended purpose of evaluating only the heart or vessels of the chest.\n\n【27】#### Definitions of imaging test positivity\n\n【28】Since COVID‐19 is such a new disease, and the imaging findings were unknown until four months ago, there is considerable heterogeneity and change in the thresholds used for positivity. Some groups have used constellations of specific findings (such as multiple peripheral ground glass opacities on CT), while others have used an approach in which they consider the combined effect of specific findings (a ‘gestalt’ approach). As such, we will not limit ourselves to a pre‐defined threshold for, or definition of positivity. Instead, we will extract the definition for positivity used in each study, and the constellation of imaging features used to inform this definition. This will offer an opportunity to determine if the definition of positivity contributes to variability in accuracy.\n\n【29】### Clinical pathway\n\n【30】At present, the optimal diagnostic pathway and the role of chest imaging for identifying people with COVID‐19 is unclear. Compared to conventional reverse transcripterase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) testing, a potential major advantage of chest imaging is that results are available faster and that it provides a better insight into the status of the lungs. However, availability of imaging devices may vary across settings and centres.\n\n【31】#### Potential roles of imaging tests\n\n【32】1.  Chest imaging may play an integral role in ‘ruling out’ COVID‐19 pneumonia when RT‐PCR is unavailable or results are pending, clinical suspicion is 'low' based on other signs, symptoms and routine laboratory tests. Role of test: triage for RT‐PCR, where chest imaging is used in combination with clinical evaluation of patients with suspected COVID‐19\n\n【33】2.  Chest imaging may play an integral role in ‘ruling in’ COVID‐19 if clinical suspicion is 'high' but initial RT‐PCR is negative. The patient would remain in isolation until repeat RT‐PCR is done, or patients are selected to have an additional RT‐PCR test when they normally would not. Role of test: add‐on to first RT‐PCR, but used in combination with other test.\n\n【34】3.  Chest imaging can be used to provide alternative explanations for pulmonary symptoms, instead or on top of COVID‐19, such as bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax. Role of test: assist with diagnosis.\n\n【35】Several diagnostic pathways have been proposed that provide guidance for physicians to identify people with COVID‐19. The order and components of these pathways differ with varying dependence on pre‐test probability, physical exam, laboratory tests and findings on RT‐PCR results and availability. However, some professional organisations recommend imaging for patients with moderate or severe features of COVID‐19 . In some hospitals, the results of low‐dose chest CT are one of the many parameters (among molecular test results, routine laboratory results and clinical signs and symptoms) to categorise patients into low risk, moderate to high risk and proven COVID‐19 categories.\n\n【36】Given the rapid progression of COVID‐19 and the constantly evolving evidence base, the diagnostic accuracy to inform the utility of chest imaging in these pathways is difficult to estimate. We propose to conduct a ‘living’ systematic review to identify data regarding the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging in people with suspected COVID‐19. We will update this ‘living’ systematic review on a regular basis (weekly) and will disseminate it via the Cochrane Library.\n\n【37】#### Alternative test(s)\n\n【38】Other Cochrane DTA Reviews are planned to address other tests.\n\n【39】1.  Signs and symptoms, which will be mainly used in primary care, including when presenting at the emergency department\n\n【40】2.  Routine laboratory testing, such as for C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT)\n\n【41】3.  Immunological tests\n\n【42】4.  Point‐of‐care tests\n\n【43】5.  Molecular laboratory tests\n\n【44】Objectives\n----------\n\n【45】The primary objective is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), chest X‐ray and ultrasound) in the evaluation of people suspected to have COVID‐19. This may also refer to specific signs, such as a particular CT finding.\n\n【46】### Secondary objectives\n\n【47】1.  To evaluate whether these imaging tests are sufficiently accurate to rule out COVID‐19 (main measure of interest will be the negative predictive value)\n\n【48】2.  To evaluate the rate of positive imaging in patients with initial RT‐PCR negative results who have a positive result on a follow‐up RT‐PCR test\n\n【49】3.  To determine if there is an association between number of days after symptom onset, symptom severity and the findings on chest imaging for patients with COVID‐19\n\n【50】4.  To determine the rate of discrepancy or agreement between CT, chest X‐ray and ultrasound findings\n\n【51】5.  To evaluate for ‘threshold’ effects of imaging findings of COVID‐19 and accuracy measures\n\n【52】6.  To determine the rate of alternative diagnoses identified by chest imaging\n\n【53】Methods\n-------\n\n【54】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【55】#### Types of studies\n\n【56】We will keep the eligibility criteria broad to include all patient groups and all variations of a test. If the patient population is unclear, we will include the study.\n\n【57】We will include studies of all designs that produce estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates can be computed, for any of the primary and secondary objectives.\n\n【58】We will include both types of cross‐sectional designs.\n\n【59】1.  Where all patients suspected of the target condition enter the study through the same route and where it is not clear up front who has and who does not have the target condition.\n\n【60】2.  Where the patients with the target condition are recruited in a different way or from a different population from the patients without the target condition.\n\n【61】Unlike standard DTA reviews, in initial versions of this review we will not only include studies focusing on patients with suspected COVID‐19, but also include studies that include either patients proven to have the target condition (i.e. only sensitivity is estimated) or not to have the target condition (i.e. only specificity is estimated). We will present and analyse the findings from such studies separately.\n\n【62】We will carefully consider the limitations of different study designs in the quality assessment, the analysis, and the interpretation of findings.\n\n【63】##### Inclusion criteria\n\n【64】1.  Study must include patients with or suspected of COVID‐19 as outlined in the ‘ Target conditions ’ section. No age or gender restrictions.\n\n【65】2.  Index test must be X‐ray, computed tomography or ultrasound of the chest meeting the criteria described in the ‘ Index tests ’ section.\n\n【66】3.  Index test must be interpreted by humans, and not an algorithm (machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI)).\n\n【67】4.  A reference standard for positive and negative classification of target condition status must be applied (as outlined in the ' Reference standards ' section).\n\n【68】5.  Data must be available to extract 2 x 2 data (true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), false negative (FN)). Alternatively, in studies with only target condition positive patients (TP, FN), or target condition negative patients (FP, TN), 2 x 1 data must be available. If data is not available, we will contact study authors for additional data if the study meets the primary objective only (2 x 2 data).\n\n【69】6.  Only studies including 10 or more patients who had index test and reference standard will be included.\n\n【70】#### Participants\n\n【71】Our primary focus will be on people presenting at the hospital with suspected COVID‐19. However, for the initial version of these reviews, studies that recruit participants either known to have COVID‐19 or known not to have COVID‐19 will be eligible. We will include all age groups.\n\n【72】#### Index tests\n\n【73】CT of the thorax, or chest X‐ray, or ultrasound of the lungs.\n\n【74】The roles of the test can be replacement of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) or to assist with diagnosis, used in combination with other (laboratory) tests.\n\n【75】#### Target conditions\n\n【76】As explained above, our focus target condition is COVID‐19. However, we will include all studies reporting data on COVID‐19, COVID‐19 pneumonia, or other target conditions caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infections that might provide data relevant to our primary or secondary objectives.\n\n【77】#### Reference standards\n\n【78】A positive diagnosis for COVID‐19 by:\n\n【79】1.  A positive RT‐PCR test for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, from any manufacturer in any country, from any source, including nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates, oropharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), sputum, saliva, serum, urine, rectal or faecal samples.\n\n【80】2.  Positive on WHO criteria for COVID‐19 which includes some testing RT‐PCR negative.\n\n【81】3.  Positive on China CDC criteria for COVID‐19 which includes some testing RT‐PCR negative.\n\n【82】4.  Positive serology in addition to consistent symptomatology.\n\n【83】5.  Positive on study specific list of criteria for COVID‐19 which includes some testing RT‐PCR negative.\n\n【84】6.  Other criteria (symptoms, imaging findings, other tests).\n\n【85】A negative diagnosis for COVID‐19 by:\n\n【86】1.  COVID suspects with at least one negative RT‐PCR.\n\n【87】2.  Pre‐pandemic controls (healthy or diseased).\n\n【88】3.  Current healthy or with another disease (no RT‐PCR test).\n\n【89】This list is not exhaustive, as we anticipate that studies will use a variety of reference standards and we plan to include all of them, at least for the earlier versions of the review. Although RT‐PCR is considered the best available test, it is suspected of missing a substantial proportion of cases, and thus may not be the ideal reference standard if used as a standalone test . Therefore, we are likely to use alternative reference standards, such as a combination of RT‐PCR, and symptoms or imaging findings, or both.\n\n【90】We will judge how likely each reference standard definition is to correctly classify individuals in the assessment of methodological quality. All reference standards are likely to be imperfect in some way; details of reference standard evaluation are provided in the 'Risk of bias' tool below. We will use a consensus process to agree the classification of the reference standard as to what we regard as good, moderate and poor. 'Good' reference standards need to have very little change of misclassification, 'moderate', a small but acceptable risk, 'poor', a larger and probably unacceptable risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Asenapine is a recently developed atypical antipsychotic that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the clinical effects of asenapine for adults with schizophrenia or other schizophrenia‐like disorders by comparing it with placebo.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register  which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PubMed, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitation for inclusion of records into the register. We inspected references of all included studies for further relevant studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Our review includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing asenapine with placebo in adults (however defined) with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We inspected citations from the searches and identified relevant abstracts, and extracted data from all included studies. For binary data we calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and for continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD). We used the GRADE approach to produce a 'Summary of findings' table which included our outcomes of interest, where possible. We used a fixed‐effect model for our analyses.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We obtained and scrutinised 41 potentially relevant records, and from these we could include only six trials (n = 1835). Five of the six trials had high risk of attrition bias and all trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Results showed a clinically important change in global state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97, low‐quality evidence) and mental state (1 RCT, n = 336, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term amongst people receiving asenapine. People receiving asenapine demonstrated significant reductions in negative symptoms (1 RCT, n = 336, MD ‐1.10, 95% CI ‐2.29 to 0.09, very low‐quality evidence) at short‐term. Individuals receiving asenapine demonstrated significantly fewer incidents of serious adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 386, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.63, very low‐quality evidence) at medium‐term. There was no clear difference in people discontinuing the study for any reason between asenapine and placebo at short‐term (5 RCTs, n = 1046, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04, very low‐quality evidence). No trial reported data for extrapyramidal symptoms or costs.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is some, albeit preliminary, evidence that asenapine provides an improvement in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms, whilst minimising the risk of adverse effects. However due to the low‐quality and limited quantity of evidence, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for people with schizophrenia.

The review looks at the effects of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared with placebo.\n\n【26】**Background**\n\n【27】People with schizophrenia often have 'positive symptoms', such as hearing voices, seeing things (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). People also have 'negative symptoms', including loss of emotions, apathy, social withdrawal, lack of pleasure and difficulty speaking and communicating. Disorder of thoughts, anxiety and depression are common. The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs, which are divided into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). These drugs often have severe side effects, such as weight gain, muscle stiffness, involuntary shaking and tiredness. Asenapine is a newer antipsychotic drug developed in the 1990s. At present there are no systematic reviews assessing the effects of this drug.\n\n【28】**Study characteristics**\n\n【29】The review includes six trials with 1835 people. The trials randomised people with schizophrenia to receive either asenapine or placebo. Five of these trials had high rates of people leaving early and were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.\n\n【30】**Key results**\n\n【31】There is some evidence that asenapine, when compared to placebo, improves the positive, negative and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia while having less risk of debilitating side effects.\n\n【32】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【33】However, due to the low quantity and limited quality of evidence currently available, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for schizophrenia. There is a need for large‐scale, longer‐term follow up, and bias‐free randomised controlled trials investigating the effects and safety of asenapine.\n\n【34】Ben Gray, Senior Peer Researcher, McPin Foundation\n\n【35】--------------\n\n【36】Authors' conclusions\n### Implications for practice\n\n【37】##### 1\\. For people with schizophrenia\n\n【38】Asenapine appears to be a promising atypical antipsychotic. There is some, albeit preliminary, evidence of improvement in positive symptoms (delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (which may include reduced affect, and reduced motivation), and depressive symptoms. However due to the limited quality and quantity of evidence, it remains difficult to recommend the use of asenapine for schizophrenia. There are missing trials which may add to the argument about which the study authors have not been forthcoming.\n\n【39】##### 2\\. For clinicians\n\n【40】The dosage used by five of the included studies adhered to the FDA recommendations (5 ‐ 10 mg BID) , suggesting clinical applicability of the findings. At present it is not possible to be fully confident that asenapine is really suitable for the treatment of people with schizophrenia, as ongoing trials are not complete or data are missing from important studies that are completed. It is certainly impossible to make conclusive judgements on the long‐term effects of asenapine.\n\n【41】##### 3\\. For managers/policy makers\n\n【42】The availability of asenapine is still relatively limited. We have no real service data or economics to work with. For such a drug to enter clinical practice, we suggest that such information should be routinely produced as part of the output of evaluative studies.\n\n【43】### Implications for research\n\n【44】##### 1\\. General\n\n【45】Future studies investigating the clinical effects of asenapine need to be well reported, and adhere to the CONSORT statement . All outcomes from all trials must be easily accessible and all data should be reported as numbers.\n\n【46】##### 2\\. Specific\n\n【47】###### 2.1 Reviews\n\n【48】This review will require updates in the future as, at present, there are two studies awaiting classification, and one ongoing trial.\n\n【49】Five of our included studies involved an additional active treatment arm. As detailed elsewhere, these data were excluded from this review but could be used elsewhere . However it is important to identify the comparative effects of asenapine to other antipsychotic agents. There are two Cochrane Systematic Reviews currently underway comparing asenapine to typical antipsychotics  and other atypical antipsychotics Preda 2010 ).\n\n【50】Table 1.

Future long‐term clinical trials should clearly describe the random sequence generation and concealment of allocation, as well as the thoroughly‐tested double‐blinding procedures, whilst recruiting a sample size that provides high statistical power. Outcome measures that should additionally be investigated include relapse, functioning, service utilisation, quality of life/satisfaction with care, and economic costs. There are, however, studies underway or completed that may add enough to this review to allow more firm conclusions to be drawn .\n\n【54】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【55】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

condition\n\n【59】Schizophrenia affects approximately 0.3% to 0.7% of people during their lifetime, with an estimated 24 million individuals experiencing the disorder worldwide . With similar prevalence and incidence rates globally, it is widely accepted that schizophrenia is associated with significant global burden . The prevalence rates of schizophrenia are similar for men and women . With a considerably variable age of onset, schizophrenia can present for the first time from adolescence, through middle age (late‐onset schizophrenia), and up to old age (very late‐onset schizophrenia‐like psychosis) . It has been established that an interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors are involved in the aetiology of schizophrenia . Such heterogeneous aetiology may contribute to the diverse illness course and symptomatology seen in the disease .\n\n【60】Schizophrenia is typically considered in relation to the dichotomy of positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, which are characterised by their atypical presence; and negative symptoms, such as poverty of speech, flattened affect, lack of pleasure (anhedonia), and lack of motivation (avolition) . Moreover, patients with schizophrenia can express a disorganised state primarily marked by disorganised thought and speech, known as formal thought disorder . Mood symptoms such as depression and anxiety are also very common in schizophrenia yet are heterogeneous in nature and so require thorough investigation . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that people with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in several domains of cognitive functioning including memory, language, executive functioning and attention .\n\n【61】### Description of the intervention\n\n【62】Antipsychotic drugs are used as first‐line medication for schizophrenia. Typical (or first‐generation) antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, have been available since the 1950s, whilst atypical (or second‐generation) antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, have been introduced from the late 1980s . Atypical antipsychotics have been marked as producing greater reductions in negative and mood symptoms, whilst minimising adverse effects usually observed during typical antipsychotic treatment, such as extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinaemia . However, atypical antipsychotics are not without their own adverse effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems .\n\n【63】Asenapine is a novel second‐generation antipsychotic originally developed by Organon in the early‐to‐mid 1990s, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 for the acute treatment of adults with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder . However, in the European Union and the UK it is currently approved for the acute treatment of bipolar I disorder only and not for schizophrenia .\n\n【64】Initial investigation of the properties and clinical effects of asenapine has begun , although the use of placebo‐controlled clinical trials can be difficult to justify, particularly when evidence‐based pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia already exist . However, aside from investigating the comparative effects of novel antipsychotic drugs with others that are currently available, it is important to consider the absolute effects of medication purported to be antipsychotic .\n\n【65】### How the intervention might work\n\n【66】Asenapine is predominantly administered sublingually (5 mg to 10 mg twice daily) due to previous reports of low bioavailability when administered orally, and typically reaches peak plasma levels within 30 to 90 minutes following absorption via the oral mucosa .\n\n【67】Asenapine is a novel second‐generation antipsychotic drug . It has a somewhat unique pharmacological profile compared to alternative atypical antipsychotic medication and has a greater affinity for a range of serotonergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and histamine receptors, acting through the antagonism of most of these receptor subtypes, whilst expressing low affinity to muscarinic receptors . It has been proposed that antagonism of dopamine and noradrenergic receptors contributes substantially to the alleviation of positive symptoms in schizophrenia . Additionally, the antagonism of serotonergic receptors may improve negative, cognitive and mood symptoms of schizophrenia .\n\n【68】Chemical structure of asenapine\n\n【69】With its low affinity to muscarinic receptors, asenapine may minimise the risk of anticholinergic adverse effects reported following the use of some antipsychotic drugs . However, histamine antagonism is known to produce sedation , which is one of several adverse effects that have been identified following the use of asenapine, in addition to anxiety, extrapyramidal symptoms, nausea/vomiting, oral hypoesthesia, and weight gain .\n\n【70】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【71】It is well known that both typical and atypical antipsychotics can be costly and have an assorted adverse event profile, yet they still do not fully meet the treatment needs of people with schizophrenia . As asenapine is one of the more recently developed second‐generation antipsychotic drugs with multi‐targeted pharmacological action, it has been suggested that it may have the potential to produce clinical improvements in negative and cognitive symptoms, as well as positive symptoms of schizophrenia, whilst minimising the incidence of adverse effects .\n\n【72】At present there are no systematic reviews assessing the clinical effects of asenapine, although there are two currently underway comparing asenapine to typical antipsychotics and other atypical antipsychotics . Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the clinical effects and safety of asenapine to placebo amongst adults with schizophrenia and other schizophrenia‐like disorders.\n\n【73】Objectives\nTo determine the clinical effects of asenapine for adults with schizophrenia or other schizophrenia‐like disorders by comparing it with placebo.\n\n【74】Methods\n### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【75】#### Types of studies\n\n【76】All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If a trial had been described as 'double‐blind' and implied that randomisation occurred but did not state it overtly, we intended to include it in a sensitivity analysis . If inclusion of such trials did not result in a substantive difference, they were to remain in the analyses. If their inclusion resulted in important clinically significant (but not necessarily clear differences), we would not add the data from these lower quality studies to the results of the better trials, but present such data within a subcategory. We excluded quasi‐randomised studies, such as those that allocate to treatment groups by alternate days of the week. Where people are given additional treatments within asenapine, we only included the data if the adjunct treatment was evenly distributed between groups and only asenapine was randomised.\n\n【77】#### Types of participants\n\n【78】Adults with schizophrenia or related disorders, however defined, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis. Where trials included participants with a range of disorders we only included trials where over 50% of the participants have schizophrenia.\n\n【79】We are interested in making sure that information is as relevant to the current care of people with schizophrenia as possible, so where information was available we highlighted clearly the current clinical state of participants (acute, early post‐acute, partial remission, remission) as well as the stage (prodromal, first episode, early illness, persistent) and whether the studies primarily focused on people with particular problems (for example, negative symptoms, treatment‐resistant illnesses).\n\n【80】#### Types of interventions\n\n【81】##### 1\\.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of exercise after bariatric surgery for obese adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk factors for global deaths, and at least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese . Obesity is an abnormal or excessive body fat accumulation, normally due to energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. It can be considered a multifactorial complex disorder with causes related to genetic, social, economical and environmental factors. Globally, more than 1.4 billion adults 20 years old or older, were overweight in 2008. From those, over 200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese, accounting for more than 10% of the world populations being obese . An individual is classified as overweight when the body mass index (BMI) is ≥ 25 and as obese when the BMI is ≥30 . The BMI reflects someone's weight measured in kilograms divided by the square of his weight in metres (kg/m²). Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI ≥ 40 and medically defined as an individual whose weight is twice or more the ideal body weight, 100 pounds or more overweight, or both . This condition is associated with reduced functional capacity, multiple comorbidities, and higher overall mortality .\n\n【7】Bariatric surgery is an invasive strategy, usually performed in extreme situations of morbid obesity . It is an option for individuals who have not obtained success with other treatments. This type of procedure has also been recognised as a metabolic surgery, as it can induce complete remission or significant improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other metabolic abnormalities . The surgical options available are characterised by malabsorptive, restrictive techniques or a combination of both components . Bariatric surgery is a cost‐effective treatment for morbid obesity , and during the past two decades, the number of procedures performed worldwide has increased . Regarding the safety of bariatric surgery, a Cochrane systematic review from 2014 showed that across all studies, adverse event rates and reoperation rates were poorly reported. . A narrative review reported a mortality rate of 0.3% .\n\n【8】It is difficult to predict the exact success rate of a surgery to maintain weight loss as this depends on the individual's lifestyle. A successful procedure consists of an excess weight loss (EWL) greater than 50% (EWL = (weight loss/excess weight) x 100), and the excess weight equals the total preoperative weight minus the ideal weight .The majority of adults increase their physical activity levels after bariatric surgery, but most remain insufficiently active, and some become even less active .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Physical activity and exercise are constructs with different meanings but closely related. Both consist of intentional movements. Exercise is characterised by a structured routine and normally has its intensity, volume and duration intentionally determined to achieve physical fitness, performance, health benefits and leisure. Total physical activity has a broad meaning, consisting of daily routine movements such as activities related to transportation, household tasks and gardening. Therefore, exercise is an intentional form of physical activity with a clear goal. Routine and consistency are important characteristics to achieve those goals previously set. Exercise promotes physical fitness. Maintenance or improvement of physical fitness are associated with reductions in death from all causes and from cardiovascular disease . Exercise programmes offer a range of benefits for participants, for example, a routine of recreational football  or interval training  in sedentary men can effectively stimulate musculoskeletal, metabolic and cardiovascular adaptations of importance for health. Exercise routines can also increase the energy expenditure after the exercise was performed . The exercise intensity seems to have a dose‐response effect, that is, higher intensity sessions will induce more energy expenditure .\n\n【11】For obese and overweight individuals, exercise can promote important benefits, especially when combined with energy deficit promoted by a low calorie diet . Besides a significant weight loss, exercise may lead to improvements in metabolic fitness, including increased aerobic fitness, decreased diastolic blood pressure, increase in insulin sensitivity and improvement in LDL‐cholesterol . In people with type 2 diabetes, exercise promotes restoration of in vivo mitochondrial function, therefore improves the insulin‐mediated glucose disposal and metabolic flexibility . Apparently, the insulin‐sensitising effect caused by exercise occurs in the absence of major changes in body mass and it is not restricted to the improvement in the muscle insulin sensitivity but extends to improvements in hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity after only 12 weeks of a given intervention . After one year of exercise intervention where exercise and diet are combined, improvements occur in peripheral insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose and free fatty acids, along with changes in weight, adipose tissue mass and distribution .\n\n【12】#### Adverse effects of the intervention\n\n【13】The possible adverse effects of exercise for this population are an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury and adverse coronary heart disease (CHD) events .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Evidence from obese persons who did not undergo a surgical procedure shows that exercise reduces the risk for metabolic diseases through numerous mechanisms. Exercise may lead to substantial decreases in body weight, total body fat and visceral fat. There is also a dose‐response relationship between exercise and cardiometabolic risk factors and moderate intensity may promote better gains than vigorous intensity exercise . We believe that those benefits are also applicable to obese individuals after bariatric surgery.\n\n【16】Observational studies that assessed physical activity or exercise behaviours in obese adults after bariatric surgery suggested that engagement in an active lifestyle could be an effective strategy to achieve optimal weight loss and maintenance . Those individuals may also benefit from physical activity through an increase, maintenance, or both, of lean body mass , which promotes a higher energy expenditure.\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】In 2011, 340,768 bariatric procedures were performed worldwide by 6705 surgeons . There has been no significant change in the total number of procedures for the past three years, although there has been a change in the types of procedures conducted over time . Considering the vast number of procedures performed, it is relevant to understand all aspects related to the patient care post surgery including exercise for this population. The available reviews regarding our topic investigated the effectiveness of exercise and increased total physical activity in obese adults after bariatric surgery. The authors concluded that an increase in total physical activity and participation in exercise may be beneficial to maintain the weight loss achieved by surgery and to enjoy the metabolic benefits of an active lifestyle . Although the results seem to favour exercise, the studies included were mostly observational and non‐randomised trials. Therefore, it is difficult to demonstrate causal relationships between exercise and metabolic benefits.\n\n【19】We propose a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to achieve minimisation of risk of bias and to adequately address this scientific question. In addition, there are currently no specific guidelines for exercise for the targeted population, thus, we hope to address this gap of knowledge.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To assess the effects of exercise after bariatric surgery for obese adults.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】We will include

The therapeutical responses to colchicine in randomised clinical trials were inconsistent.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We identified trials through electronic searches of _The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register_ , _The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials_ on _The Cochrane Library_ , _MEDLINE, EMBASE _ , and manual searches of bibliographies. We contacted authors of trials and pharmaceutical companies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised clinical trials comparing colchicine with any kind of control therapy were included irrespective of language, year of publication, and publication status.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】The primary outcomes were the number of deaths and the number of death and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined intervention effects by using both a fixed effect model and a random effects model. Heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eleven randomised clinical trials involving 716 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were detected between colchicine and placebo/no intervention on the number of deaths (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.06), the number of deaths and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.49), liver complications, liver biochemical variables, liver histological measurements, and adverse events. Trial methodology was generally low and some trials had high drop‐out rate. A best‐worst‐case‐scenario analysis showed no significant effect of colchicine on mortality (RR 0.59, 95%CI 0.30 to 1.15), while a worst‐best‐case‐scenario analysis showed a significant detrimental effect of colchicine on mortality (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.44). Colchicine significantly decreased the number of patients without improvement of pruritus (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87). However, this estimate was based on only 156 patients from three trials. The effect of the combined treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was not significantly different from that of colchicine alone.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】We did not find evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. As we are not able to exclude a detrimental effect of colchicine, we suggest that it is only used in randomised clinical trials.\n\n【14】### No convincing evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis\n\n【15】Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare, chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. Colchicine, a plant alkaloid, has been used to treat patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and was tested in randomised clinical trials. When all identified trials were combined, colchicine appeared to be not significantly different from placebo/no intervention in respect to mortality, mortality and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation, liver complications, liver biochemistry, liver histology, and the occurrences of adverse events. Colchicine may reduce pruritus, but this finding may be due to bias. The addition of ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly influence the effect of colchicine.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of yoga for treating chronic non‐specific low‐back pain, compared to no specific treatment, a minimal intervention (e.g., education), or another active treatment, with a focus on both pain and function.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Low‐back pain, defined as pain or discomfort in the area between the lower rib and the gluteal folds, is a common, potentially disabling condition . The 3‐month prevalence of low‐back pain is estimated at 25%, and lifetime prevalence has been estimated to be as high as 84% . Low‐back pain is associated with loss of work productivity, poor quality of life, and high medical expenses, and is a substantial economic burden on society .\n\n【7】Back pain is sometimes associated with a likely etiology (e.g., radiculopathy or spinal stenosis), but the vast majority of low‐back pain cases are of unknown origin and are classified as non‐specific . Low‐back pain may also be classified according to the duration of pain as acute (less than 4 weeks), subacute (between 4 weeks and 3 months), or chronic (3 months or greater) . Most episodes of low back pain are mild  and activity limitations are rare . Symptoms often improve during the first six weeks . A small subset of chronic and severe cases is responsible for much of the disability and related medical costs due to low‐back pain . Low‐back pain is an intermittent and recurring condition. Among individuals with a resolved episode of low‐back pain, it is estimated that between 24% and 74% will have a recurrent episode within one year .\n\n【8】The usual treatment for low‐back pain is self‐care and over‐the‐counter medication such as acetaminophen or non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. For chronic low‐back pain, current guidelines list exercise therapy and massage among the therapies that may be beneficial . However, the current evidence does not provide guidance on selecting one treatment approach over another, or when specific treatments are warranted, and the best treatment approaches remain unclear , while many treatments are costly and of unclear effectiveness .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Yoga is a mind‐body practice originating from ancient India which has also become popular in the West over the last century . There are many branches and styles of yoga practice, with varying philosophies and practices, but all may be characterized by the integration of physical poses (asanas) and controlled breathing (pranayama), and frequently also the incorporation of meditation (dhyana) . According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, the use of yoga in the United States increased between 2002 and 2007, and in 2007 over 13 million adults had used yoga during the previous year .\n\n【11】Therapeutic yoga is the use of yoga to help people with health problems manage their condition and reduce their symptoms . Yoga has been suggested as being useful in managing pain and associated disability across a range of conditions, including back pain . In the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement survey over 10 million U.S. adults described using yoga for health reasons; 10.5% of yoga users said that their use was for musculoskeletal conditions and 76% of these users reported that the yoga was helpful .\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】A range of potential benefits has been proposed in relation to the practice of yoga in persistent pain conditions, which include changes in physiological, behavioral and psychological factors . Potential mechanisms for these changes include improved flexibility and muscular strength derived from practicing the physical poses of yoga, increased mental and physical relaxation derived from practicing controlled breathing or meditation exercises, and improved body awareness gained through both the physical and mental aspects of yoga .\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Yoga is one of several complementary therapies often used to treat low‐back pain, and in surveys patients frequently report that it is helpful . Several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested the effectiveness of yoga in relieving the symptoms of low‐back pain. Since yoga is a commonly used therapy for a highly prevalent, recurrent and bothersome health problem for which there are no clearly satisfactory treatments, and recent large RCTs are available, it is important to critically evaluate the current evidence for yoga as a treatment for low‐back pain.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To assess the effects of yoga for treating chronic non‐specific low‐back pain, compared to no specific treatment, a minimal intervention (e.g., education), or another active treatment, with a focus on both pain and function.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with clearly reported and appropriate randomization. If the study report does not include a clear description of the method of randomization, we will contact the authors for information on the method of randomization to confirm that the trial was adequately randomized. We will exclude quasi‐randomized trials. We will not restrict study eligibility by language or publication status.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】We will include trials in adults (aged 18 years or greater) with current chronic non‐specific low‐back pain. In our description of population and setting, we will specify whether the participants were recruited from populations seeking medical care or from the community.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】We will include studies of yoga as an intervention for low‐back pain. The study must specify that the intervention was 'yoga'. We will exclude interventions based upon yoga (e.g., stretching exercises based upon yoga) but not characterized as yoga. We will not restrict studies according to the yoga tradition used, or according to the dose, frequency or duration of the yoga intervention. However, we will exclude studies examining meditation or a yoga lifestyle without a physical practice component.\n\n【26】We will include studies comparing yoga to any other intervention or to no intervention. We will also include any studies comparing yoga as an adjunct to other therapies, versus those other therapies alone. The comparisons of interest will be:\n\n【27】1.  Yoga versus no treatment or a waiting list;\n\n【28】2.  Yoga versus a minimal intervention (e.g., booklets);\n\n【29】3.  Yoga versus usual care;\n\n【30】4.  Yoga versus another active intervention, for which different types of active interventions are considered separately (e.g., yoga versus drugs, (and for which different types of conservative active control interventions will also be considered separately (e.g., yoga versus stretching, yoga versus manipulation)); and\n\n【31】5.  Yoga plus any intervention versus that intervention alone, for which different types of co‐intervention are considered separately (e.g., yoga plus drugs versus drugs alone).\n\n【32】Co‐interventions will be allowed, but must be comparable between intervention groups (e.g., both groups allowed the use of pain medications).\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】We will use outcome measures that are considered to be important in assessment of low‐back pain, so that this review may produce results that are easily compared to or combined with those of other systematic reviews of treatment for low‐back pain. All outcomes will be assessed at short‐term (closest to four weeks), intermediate‐term (closest to six months), and long‐term (closest to one year) time points.\n\n【35】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【36】The primary outcomes will be pain (e.g., the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain) and back‐specific functional status (e.g., the Roland Disability Questionnaire).\n\n【37】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【38】The secondary outcomes will be overall measures of clinical improvement, measures of well‐being (e.g., quality of life measured on the SF‐36), measures of work disability, and adverse outcomes reported in the original trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness and safety of vitamin A for preventing acute LRTIs in children up to seven years of age.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) refer to the infection of the major passages and structures below the level of the larynx. These include acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, unspecified acute LRTIs, and infection of the lung parenchyma, including pneumonia and influenza . Globally, these infections are frequently seen in primary care settings. Although acute LRTIs can be hospital acquired, they are usually community acquired, and mainly affect the paediatric population. Clinical features of LRTIs in children include age‐related fast‐breathing, chest indrawing, grunting, nasal flaring, cough, and fever .\n\n【8】In 2015, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) estimated that LRTIs were the fifth‐leading cause of death. Similarly, LRTIs were the third‐leading cause of deaths in children under the age of five, following preterm birth and neonatal brain injury due to the lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain . A study involving 195 countries, which estimated the morbidity, mortality of LRTIs at the global, regional, and national level, showed that LRTIs largely affect children up to the age of five years . Low‐income countries are most affected in terms of the number of infections and mortality. Mortality due to LRTIs is highest in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia, with about 200 and 130 deaths per 100,000 children under the age of five, respectively .\n\n【9】The pathogenesis of LRTIs involves transmission of disease‐causing viruses and bacteria into the upper respiratory tract, where they multiply and subsequently spread into the lower respiratory tract . _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is the most common organism responsible for LRTIs followed by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b. Amongst these organisms, pneumococcal pneumonia is the leading cause of LRTIs morbidity and mortality . Antibiotics are indicated to treat bacterial LRTIs . Viral LRTIs do not require treatment with antibiotics, and are managed conservatively with adequate rehydration and oxygen supplementation .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Vitamin A is a group of fat‐soluble compounds that includes retinol and provitamin A carotenoids, which are found in animal and plant products, respectively. Vitamin A is one of the essential micronutrients, and is necessary for normal metabolism in humans . Retinoic acid produced from vitamin A is required for lower respiratory tract development . It regulates the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune system . Its supplementation can decrease susceptibility to disease‐causing micro‐organisms in the intestine . Supplementation of even one dose of vitamin A in preschool children can increase the ingestion of micro‐organisms by white blood cells . Furthermore, vitamin A promotes resistance to skin infection. It increases the expression of an antimicrobial protein known as resistin‐like molecule alpha on the surface of skin cells, whose function is to kill bacteria in the skin . Supplementation of vitamin A alone has been shown to reduce the risk of anaemia .\n\n【12】Vitamin A deficiency is defined as serum concentration of retinol below 0.70 µmol/L. It is common in preschool children in Africa and South‐East Asia, and weakens their resistance to infection, resulting in increased susceptibility to acute infectious diseases . Studies show that vitamin A supplementation can reduce the risk and severity of infections in preschool children . Vitamin A deficiency is more common in low‐income countries. Animal products such as milk and eggs, and plant products such as green vegetables, are good sources of vitamin A. However, food prices influence vitamin A deficiency risk in preschool children from poor families, because a large part of their household food budget is spent on cereals, which contain less vitamin A .\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Poor micronutrient status is a risk factor for infection‐related diseases in young children. Micronutrient deficiency decreases the function of the immune system, and thus increases children's predisposition to infection. It also delays full recovery in those infected, and increases the risk of severe illness . Vitamin A plays a significant role in regulating the immune system . It influences replication of genetic material and cell division in the intestinal epithelium, leading to increased resistance to some disease causing micro‐organisms . The relationship between vitamin A and inflammation is well established. Inflammation increases vitamin A metabolism, leading to its deficiency . Vitamin A deficiency in mice causes fluid hyposecretion from the submucosal glands in the airway, suggesting that deficiency of vitamin A may be associated with respiratory disease .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】The incidence of LRTIs is highest in areas with low socio‐economic status, people who use solid fuels as a source of energy, and in undernourished and immune‐compromised populations . Severe acute LRTIs impose a significant burden on health care globally. They lead to increased inpatient admission of children , and impose an illness burden comparable to influenza in primary care adult patients .\n\n【17】The main drugs currently used to treat acute LRTIs are antibiotics. Most antibiotics used for treating LRTIs are prescribed . However, antibiotic abuse is a serious problem. Studies have shown inappropriate use of antibiotics in multiple settings. Antibiotics have been prescribed contrary to the guidelines, and in situations where there is strong evidence that they do not reduce symptoms, duration, and severity. For example, between 2009 and 2011 about 65% to 75% of patients were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics . Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest challenges to modern public health . In terms of treating LRTIs, there is the risk of adverse events with both broad‐ and narrow‐spectrum antibiotics . Consequently, there is a need to find interventions to prevent acute LRTIs.\n\n【18】Acute LRTIs are one of the main causes of death in children . They seriously affect the growth of children and carry a huge economic burden . Early intervention could help decrease mortality and disease severity, and reduce the economic burden, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries .\n\n【19】Previous Cochrane Reviews seem to indicate that vitamin A does not have a positive effect on existing respiratory diseases. Even though vitamin A is proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in children up to five years of age, it seems to have no significant effect on the specific mortality of respiratory disease . Also, adjunctive vitamin A has shown no significant reduction in mortality, morbidity, and clinical course of non‐measles pneumonia for children . Similarly, a meta‐analysis revealed that vitamin A supplementation somewhat increases the incidence of respiratory tract infections, and that high‐dose vitamin A should not be recommended for preschool children except in the case of vitamin A deficiency . Furthermore, vitamin A supplements can even increase the incidence of lung cancer and mortality in smokers and people exposed to asbestos .\n\n【20】However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using vitamin A to support the rapid growth of children and to help fight infections . WHO guidelines even encourage vitamin A supplements for infants and children from 6 to 59 months of age . One study has shown that vitamin A supplementation could decrease the incidence of infections of the respiratory tract and their symptoms of runny nose, cough, and fever amongst preschool children . Moreover, vitamin A deficiency leads to a decrease in resistance to infection . This suggests vitamin A may prevent LRTIs by maintaining immune function for preschool children.\n\n【21】We will therefore conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vitamin A for preventing acute LRTIs in children up to seven years of age.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the effectiveness and safety of vitamin A for preventing acute LRTIs in children up to seven years of age.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross‐over studies.  We will also consider cluster‐RCTs where participants are randomised at the cluster level and outcomes are measured at the individual level. We will include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】We will include all children up to seven years old without a diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). We will assess whether vitamin A is helpful in preventing LRTIs for both healthy preschool‐aged children and those with conditions other than LRTIs. Early childhood usually ranges from infancy to the age of six years, and different countries have different definitions of preschool children (some countries until six years old). We will therefore consider children up to seven years of age.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】We will include trials comparing vitamin A with placebo or no supplementation. We will include the following co‐interventions, provided they are not part of the randomised treatment: combining with micronutrients such as folic acid, zinc, or other vitamins in both the intervention and control group. There will be no restrictions on the formulations, dose, and duration of interventions.\n\n【32】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【33】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【34】1.  Incidence of acute LRTIs (expressed as a proportion of children who experience acute LRTIs or the number of acute LRTIs over a period of time, or both).\n\n【35】2.

We will group outcomes according to follow‐up period: 0 to 12 months; 13 to 60 months; and over 60 months.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Study authors were contacted for additional information.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Eight eligible trials were identified. We excluded a biased trial and included 600,000 women in the analyses. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87).  \n\n【13】We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all‐cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03).\n\n【14】Numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.42) for the two adequately randomised trials that measured this outcome; the use of radiotherapy was similarly increased.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Screening is likely to reduce breast cancer mortality. As the effect was lowest in the adequately randomised trials, a reasonable estimate is a 15% reduction corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. Screening led to 30% overdiagnosis and overtreatment, or an absolute risk increase of 0.5%. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings. It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm.

The goal is to treat cancer early, when a cure is more likely. The review includes seven trials that involved 600,000 women who were randomly assigned to receive screening mammograms or not. The review found that screening for breast cancer likely reduces breast cancer mortality, but the magnitude of the effect is uncertain. Screening will also result in some women getting a cancer diagnosis even though their cancer would not have led to death or sickness. Currently, it is not possible to tell which women these are, and they are therefore likely to have breasts or lumps removed and to receive radiotherapy unnecessarily. The review estimated that screening leads to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of 15% and to 30% overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will have her life prolonged. In addition, 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be diagnosed as breast cancer patients and will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings.\n\n【28】It is thus not clear whether screening does more good than harm. Women invited to screening should be fully informed of both the benefits and harms.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Primary objective: to assess the effects of vitamin E for preventing recurrent stroke.\n\n【3】Secondary objectives:\n\n【4】1.  to evaluate the adverse effects of vitamin E in people with stroke; and\n\n【5】2.  to examine the effects of vitamin E in different stroke types.\n\n【6】--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Stroke is a cerebrovascular accident resulting in focal neurological deficit. It can be broadly classified as either ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Diagnosis is based on the presence of acute onset of focal neurological deficit (i.e. hemiparesis or hemiplegia; hemisensory loss; homonymous hemianopia; loss of higher cortical functions such as dysphagia, visuospatial disturbances or reduced consciousness; and cerebellar dysfunction). Diagnosis is further confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.\n\n【10】Globally, approximately 5.54 million deaths are caused by stroke annually , with 30% of stroke events being recurrent strokes .\n\n【11】Stroke does not represent a well‐defined entity. This is because the mechanisms underlying haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke are different . As a result, the standard treatments for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke are different. Medical treatment for ischaemic stroke emphasises the roles of antiplatelets to reduce prothrombotic events in cerebral circulation, intensive blood pressure control with antihypertensives, and statins. However, some components of standard treatments in ischaemic stroke might increase the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke, especially in the use of antiplatelets and statins.\n\n【12】Vitamin E has some unique properties that could be beneficial for stroke prevention, in particular ischaemic stroke. As vitamin E supplement is widely used and readily available, it is important to identify and assess the evidence, favourable or otherwise, for its use in people with stroke.\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】Vitamin E is an essential nutrient for the body. It is made up of four tocopherols and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma and delta respectively) . After ingestion of naturally occurring vitamin E in food, the various forms are absorbed in the small intestine. They are transported to the liver for metabolism. Only alpha‐tocopherol is preferentially resecreted by the liver via hepatic alpha‐tocopherol transfer protein . Other forms of vitamin E are metabolised and excreted by the liver . Therefore, the concentration of alpha‐tocopherol in the blood and cellular levels is higher than that of other forms of vitamin E . As a result, more research is conducted on alpha‐tocopherols, although recently tocotrienols have received some scientific recognition, especially in many peer‐reviewed research articles from 2009 to 2010.\n\n【15】Vitamin E is an antioxidant. Antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals. Vitamin E is a fat soluble antioxidant that is believed to reduce the production of oxygen free radicals generated during cellular metabolism. In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin E is also involved in some metabolic processes such as cell signalling and regulation of expression of genes . It has also been shown that vitamin E can inhibit the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme that plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation of smooth muscles, platelets and monocytes . Endothelial cells lining the interior surface of the blood vessels, if replete with vitamin E, can resist blood cell components adhering to this surface. In addition, vitamin E is involved in the dilatation of blood vessels and inhibition of platelet aggregation by increasing the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium lining .\n\n【16】Due to the above unique properties, it is believed that Vitamin E could play a role in preventing stroke.\n\n【17】Numerous foods contain vitamin E. Vegetable oils, nuts and seeds contain ample amounts of alpha‐tocopherol. It is also found in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals. Gamma‐tocopherol can be found in soy beans, canola, corn and some vegetable oils. Tocotrienols are found in some vegetable oils (for instance palm oil), wheat germs, barley, saw palmetto, and some nuts and grains. Tocotrienols typically occur at very low levels in nature. They are found with the highest level in crude palm oil and rice bran oil.\n\n【18】The subtypes of vitamin E, namely tocopherols and tocotrienols, are quite different. Tocotrienols have additional three double bonds to their side chains. This enables tocotrienols to have better tissue penetration, especially in brain cells. For further details of the difference between tocopherols and tocotrienols, please refer to Table 1 .\n\n【19】Table 1.

Natural vitamin E α‐tocotrienol protects against ischaemic stroke by induction of MRP1. MRP1 is a key mediator in intracellular oxidised glutathione efflux from neural cells. This is because elevation of intracellular oxidised glutathione can trigger neural cell death. Besides, α‐tocotrienol can confer neuroprotection by regulating microRNA expression in stroke‐affected brain tissue.\n\n【24】In Leppala 2000 , vitamin E was shown to be beneficial in ischaemic stroke but it increased the risk of subarachnoid haemorrhage. The exact mechanism for these findings is still unknown.\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】Globally, stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability .\n\n【27】Supplementation with vitamins has become popular, and they are relatively inexpensive compared with prescription medication. Research shows that 12.7% of the adult population taking supplements in the United States are taking vitamin E . Therefore, it can be said that the beneficial effects of this supplement may have a large‐scale impact on a population. However, limited studies have been conducted on the effects of vitamin E in preventing stroke. These studies have produced mixed results. Vitamin E has been shown to be beneficial in people with ischaemic stroke but it increases the risk of subarachnoid haemorrhage .\n\n【28】We will systematically review trial data for vitamin E in preventing recurrent stroke, and its potential public health implications. At the same time, we hope that this review can help to clarify the effects of vitamin E in preventing ischaemic stroke and whether its use is associated with increased haemorrhagic stroke. Because a large number of people are taking vitamin E supplements, it is important to review the range of evidence for vitamin E in ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke.\n\n【29】In addition, the findings in mice studies of the role of α‐tocotrienol in preventing ischaemic stroke by inducing MRP1  also contribute to the importance of this systematic review. If these findings could be translated into clinical benefits for adults, the benefits of vitamin E could be huge.\n\n【30】Objectives\n----------\n\n【31】Primary objective: to assess the effects of vitamin E for preventing recurrent stroke.\n\n【32】Secondary objectives:\n\n【33】1.  to evaluate the adverse effects of vitamin E in people with stroke; and\n\n【34】2.  to examine the effects of vitamin E in different stroke types.\n\n【35】Methods\n-------\n\n【36】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【37】#### Types of studies\n\n【38】All randomised controlled clinical trials.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of different gingival retraction methods used with any type of abutment (teeth and implants) in fixed prosthodontic treatment, with regard to the outcomes of gingivitis, periodontitis, aesthetics, and tooth sensitivity.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Prosthodontics is the branch of dentistry which concerns the replacement of missing or damaged teeth with artificial substitutes (prostheses) such as crowns, implants, bridges and dentures. Fixed prosthodontics is defined by the Academy of Prosthodontics as a branch of prosthodontics concerned with the replacement and/or restoration of teeth by artificial substitutes that are not removable from the mouth, including routinely used inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns and bridges. For the construction of prostheses to repair teeth damaged by caries, both functional and aesthetic considerations mean that the cervical margins of these restorations are often placed close to the gingival margin or in the gingival sulcus . In these situations, it is imperative that clinicians obtain an accurate impression which records accurately the location of the prepared finishing line to ensure optimal fit .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】In the mouth the finishing line is enveloped by the free gingiva, so in order to obtain an accurate impression with a clear finishing line, the gingiva of the affected tooth must be retracted. Effective gingival retraction is one of the key procedures in the creation of a successful restoration. Gingival displacement is deﬁned as \"the deﬂection of the marginal gingiva away from a tooth\" , and can be induced by various retraction techniques and materials. The aim of gingival retraction is to clearly expose the finishing lines, make the operational field free of saliva, haemorrhage or debris, and create space for the injection of impression materials into the expanded gingival crevice .\n\n【9】Common gingival retraction methods include mechanical techniques and chemomechanical techniques . Chemomechanical methods, the earliest and most widely used technique, refer to the application of one or two retraction cords together with one or more medicaments such as epinephrine or aluminium sulphate, aluminium chloride, zinc chloride, ferric sulphate and sympathomimetic amines ; medicaments may cause temporary constriction of the gingival tissues and control bleeding .\n\n【10】Mechanical techniques involve the displacement of gingival tissue in a physical way by placing a retraction cord, copper band, rubber‐dam clamp or other device into the gingival sulcus. Mechanical gingival retraction can also be divided into single‐cord and two‐cord techniques. Two‐cord techniques are reported as more predictable and effective for adequate impression in specific cases , and may offer better control of gingival haemorrhage and exudates when used in conjunction with chemicals . Recently, cordless techniques have been introduced and advocated . Expa‐syl is a paste‐like injectable agent with 15% aluminium chloride in a kaolin matrix, providing mechanical retraction and haemostatic action . A new polyvinyl siloxane material called Magic Foam Cord is also available .\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Gingival tissues are inclined to return to their original position under the action of numerous forces . Gingival tissues are supported during the retraction by the fibre‐rich, highly organized periodontal complex surrounding the teeth, which attenuates the collapse of gingiva to ensure precision of impression .\n\n【13】Gingival retraction before taking an impression makes it easier for the operator to record the emergence profile and facilitates the making of an accurate impression. Gingival retraction is also used when the finishing line is close to the gingiva. Effective gingival retraction is therefore an essential step in the fabrication of well‐fitting prostheses. The excellent marginal adaptation of protheses is considered important for the long‐term success of restorations , since poor marginal fit usually allows more plaque accumulation, crevicular fluid flow, and periodontal bone loss, associated with the development of gingivitis and periodontal diseases . In addition, poor quality margins between the prosthesis and the tooth causes microleakage and increases the chance for secondary caries and tooth sensitivity . Also, most aesthetic failures of prosthodontic restorations are closely related to soft‐tissue management. Inadequate gingival retraction may compromise the aesthetic outcome due to irreversible gingival trauma. Where restoration margins are placed in the gingival sulcus, the key to aesthetic success is to maintain the health of surrounding tissues while preventing gingival coloration, gingival recession and subsequent exposure of the restorative margin .\n\n【14】Gingival retraction can also be used before crown cementation. This results in the operator having an unobstructed view of the marginal area, which makes it easier to completely remove the excess cement, an essential step to prevent the subsequent development of gingivitis .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】There is a wide range of materials and methods for gingival retraction available in clinical practice.  While there are randomised trials which evaluate these methods, until now there has not been a systematic review  to evaluate gingival retraction methods and provide evidence to guide clinical practice.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the effects of different gingival retraction methods used with any type of abutment (teeth and implants) in fixed prosthodontic treatment, with regard to the outcomes of gingivitis, periodontitis, aesthetics, and tooth sensitivity.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including split‐mouth RCTs will be considered for inclusion in this review. Cross‐over studies will not be included.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Patients undergoing fixed prosthodontic treatment, who are randomly allocated to receive different methods of gingival retraction, regardless of the gender, race, social and economic status will be included. Trials where participants have clinical evidence of severe periodontitis (periodontal pocket depth ≥ 5 mm) on the treated teeth at baseline, will be excluded.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】Mechanical or chemomechanical gingival retraction techniques or materials used in the intervention group will be compared with either no gingival retraction or an alternative gingival retraction technique or material. Trials of gingival retraction techniques used in conjunction with any type of abutment (teeth and implants) will be included.\n\n【27】Studies evaluating retraction products that are no longer produced will also be considered.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】All the primary outcomes will be the main outcomes for the Summary of findings table.\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】1.

It may be performed using general or local anaesthesia encompassing regional or topical anaesthesia depending on a number of factors, including patient suitability, and patient, surgeon or anaesthetist preference. There have so far been no evidence‐based recommendations on the best form of anaesthesia for this intervention. There is no clear collated evidence base as to the best type of anaesthesia to reduce harm, and provide best surgical conditions and optimal outcome for patients.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare local with general anaesthesia for adults undergoing pars plana vitrectomy.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library and the reference lists of updated studies on the 25th of July 2016; MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1972 to July 2016) and Embase via Ovid SP (1972 to July 2016). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) in July 2016. We searched the proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) up to July 2016 for information about other relevant studies.\n\n【6】We also searched appropriate databases for ongoing reviews. We did not apply any language restriction. We assessed the search as up‐to‐date on the 25th of July 2016.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We planned to include all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving comparison of different modalities of local anaesthesia with general anaesthesia for pars plana vitrectomy. We considered the following different modalities of local anaesthesia: sub‐Tenon's anaesthesia, retrobulbar anaesthesia, topical anaesthesia, peribulbar anaesthesia. We planned to include cluster‐randomized controlled trials. We excluded quasi‐RCT trials.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two review authors conducted independent searches and assessed identified studies for inclusion according to the prespecified selection criteria. Two review authors assessed trial quality and planned to extract the data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We found no eligible studies that met our inclusion criteria and were therefore unable to perform a meta‐analysis or conduct a methodological quality assessment.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】This systematic review failed to locate relevant clinical evidence to support or refute a pars plana vitrectomy performed with various modalities of local anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. Good‐quality clinical trials are needed to define the role of local versus general anaesthesia for pars plana vitrectomy.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Local Anesthesia\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pars Plana Virectomy\n*   General Anesthesia\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   General Anesthetics\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Local Anesthetics\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Ocular Perforation\n*   Retinal Haemorrhage\n*   Complication Of Anesthesia\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

It is an approach used to treat disease of the retina including diabetic retinopathy as well as retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a process where the retina peels off the back of the eye. With the ageing global population as well as an increased frequency of diabetes, vitrectomy is becoming a more commonly performed procedure. Traditionally, this procedure has been performed with general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is a drug (given as a gas or inhaled) to bring about a reversible loss of consciousness. Local anaesthesia involves the administration of local anaesthetic to the desired area to cause a loss of sensation in a specific part of the body. There is a perception in the medical community that local anaesthesia may be slightly safer than general anaesthesia. There have so far been no good‐quality reviews addressing this issue.\n\n【30】**Study characteristics**\n\n【31】We searched the databases until July 2016 but found no suitable studies.\n\n【32】**Key results**\n\n【33】This review did not find any relevant clinical evidence in the form of prospective randomized trials to determine which type of anaesthesia may be better for adults undergoing this procedure.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effects of established homocysteine lowering therapy on cardiovascular mortality in patients with functioning kidney transplants.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), bringing a life changing improvement in quality of life and a 10‐year increase in life expectancy to patients with ESKD, on the transplant waiting list . Despite the many developments in kidney transplantation in the last 50 years, recipients of kidney transplants continue to have an excess mortality and morbidity compared with the general population . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death and late graft loss in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) . An observational cohort study reported the cumulative incidence of CVD 15 years after transplantation to be 23% for coronary artery disease, 15% for cerebrovascular disease and 15% for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) . The overall risk of CVD following kidney transplantation is five times higher than the general population .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】In classical homocysteinuria, a homozygous genetic disorder of C677T MTHFR resulting in very high levels of homocysteine (100 to 400 μmol/L), untreated patients die at a young age from venous thromboembolism and malignant arterial disease. Long‐term treatment aimed at lowering homocysteine levels have been extremely effective in reducing the potentially life threatening vascular risk in these patients . In addition, homocysteine has been shown to be an independent risk factor for CVD including stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), atherosclerosis, arterial and venous thrombosis and cardiovascular death in the general population  and in KTRs . Every 1 μmol/L increase in total homocysteine in KTRs is associated with a 6% increase in the risk of developing CVD, including MI, stroke, PVD and death . In addition, hyperhomocysteinaemia has also been correlated to allograft loss in KTRs . Thus the striking benefit obtained in patients with homocysteinuria created the hope that the high risk marked by elevated homocysteine levels in the general, CKD and KTR populations could be modified. However interventions that lowered homocysteine levels have so far been unable to reduce cardiovascular risk in either the CKD population  or in the general population .\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】The role of homocysteine lowering in KTRs has not been established. The Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction In Transplantation (FAVORIT) trial is a randomised clinical trial of folic acid for the prevention of CVD and renal progression in transplant patients Bostom 2006 . This trial is underway and yet to be completed. The KTR group may be the ideal group to test the homocysteine hypothesis as they have a high cardiovascular event rate  and unlike the ESKD population, homocysteine can be normalised with folic acid, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , and vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> treatment .\n\n【11】The harms of homocysteine lowering interventions have also not been established. Whilst it is believed that folic acid, vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> and B <sub>12 </sub> supplementation are safe, there are concerns that high folic acid levels may lead to increased cancer risk . This is of particular concern in the KTR group as they have higher absolute rates of malignancy than the general population and thus even a small increase in relative risk of cancer may outweigh any potential benefits.\n\n【12】Efforts to reduce cardiovascular risk in RTR are attractive because of the large potential benefit of treatment. The European clinical guidelines  state the need for more research to be conducted as there is no evidence that reduction of homocysteine levels decreases the incidence of CVD in KTRs.\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】In light of the large burden of CVD in KTRs the effectiveness of homocysteine lowering therapy needs to be clearly established. This meta‐analysis aims to assess the benefits and harms of homocysteine lowering therapy in KTRs in order to guide decision making and improve outcomes for this population group.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To evaluate the effects of established homocysteine lowering therapy on cardiovascular mortality in patients with functioning kidney transplants.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】1.

This advice is based on the observation that hard work and hard physical activity during pregnancy could be associated with preterm birth and with the idea that bed rest could reduce uterine activity. However, bed rest may have some adverse effects on other outcomes.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the effect of prescription of bed rest in hospital or at home for preventing preterm birth in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 December 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( _The Cochrane Library,_ 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE , EMBASE , LILACS , and bibliographies of relevant papers.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomized, cluster‐randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials with reported data that assess clinical outcomes in women at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth who were prescribed bed rest in hospital or at home for preventing preterm birth, and their babies.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Two studies met the inclusion criteria. One study was not considered for the meta‐analysis, since data combined singleton and multiple pregnancies. No differences in any maternal and perinatal outcomes were reported by the authors. This study was at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. Only data from one study were included in the meta‐analysis (1266 women). This study was at unclear risk of bias for most domains due to lack of reporting. Four hundred and thirty‐two women were prescribed bed rest at home and a total of 834 women received a placeb or no interventio. Preterm birth before 37 weeks was similar in both groups (7.9% in the intervention group versus 8.5% in the control group; risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.37). No other results were reported for any of the other primary or secondary outcomes.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is no evidence, either supporting or refuting the use of bed rest at home or in hospital, to prevent preterm birth. Although bed rest in hospital or at home is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence that this practice could be beneficial. Due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, clinicians should discuss the pros and cons of bed rest to prevent preterm birth. Potential benefits and harms should be discussed with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth. Appropriate research is mandatory. Future trials should evaluate both the effectiveness of bed rest, and the effectiveness of the prescription of bed rest, to prevent preterm birth.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Bed rest recommendation\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n*   Usual Care\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Premature Delivery\n*   Death\n*   Low Birth Weight Infant\n*   Intensive Care\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The current practice has been based on observational studies that found an association between hard work or hard physical activity and preterm birth. Due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, the pros and cons of bed rest for preventing preterm birth should be discussed fully.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】Although bed rest is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence either supporting or refuting its use at home or in hospital to prevent preterm birth. Due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, the pros and cons of bed rest for preventing preterm birth should be discussed fully. Health providers should discuss the potential benefits and harms of bed rest with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth, and allow them to decide if they should do it or not. Also, if they decide to opt for bed rest then they should also decide how often and for how long. A similar finding regarding hospitalization for bed rest in twin pregnancies at high risk of preterm birth is reported in another review .\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】Bed rest is one of the most commonly prescribed interventions for women with high‐risk pregnancies, but is one of the less evaluated. Appropriate research is mandatory for those who believe that bed rest may result in a worthwhile reduction in preterm birth and neonatal morbidity. The trials should evaluate both the efficacy of bed rest and the effectiveness of prescribing bed rest to prevent preterm birth.\n\n【32】Background\n----------\n\n【33】### Description of the condition\n\n【34】Preterm birth, defined as birth occurring prior to 37 weeks of gestation occurs in around 5% to 10% of all pregnancies. In this group, newborns born before 32 weeks account for most neonatal deaths and disorders , contributing to at least 75% of neonatal deaths that are not due to congenital malformations . Although there are many different therapies available for preventing preterm birth or its neonatal associated morbidity and mortality, very few are proven to be effective and recommended for clinical use .\n\n【35】### Description of the intervention\n\n【36】Bed rest has traditionally been recommended for preventing preterm birth as the first step in treatment and is cited in many obstetrics text books .\n\n【37】### How the intervention might work\n\n【38】This advice is based on the observation that hard work and hard physical activity during pregnancy could be associated with preterm birth , and with the idea that bed rest could reduce uterine activity .\n\n【39】On the other hand, bed rest may have some adverse effects on other outcomes. It may increase the likelihood of venous thrombosis , muscle atrophy and symptoms of musculoskeletal  and cardiovascular deconditioning  and maternal weight loss . It may be stressful for women  and their families,  inducing ambivalent feelings about the pregnancy, or self‐blame feelings in case of failure to comply with the prescription ; it may increase costs for the families, directly because of the expenses for the care of other children, or indirectly through job absenteeism . Finally, it may also increase healthcare costs .\n\n【40】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【41】It is, therefore, important to assess the effectiveness and safety of bed rest by reviewing the evidence from randomized controlled trials.\n\n【42】Objectives\n----------\n\n【43】To evaluate the effect of prescription of bed rest in hospital or at home for preventing preterm birth in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth.\n\n【44】Methods\n-------\n\n【45】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【46】#### Types of studies\n\n【47】All published, unpublished and ongoing randomized trials with reported data that assess clinical outcomes in women and their babies who where prescribed bed rest in hospital or at home for preventing preterm birth. Randomized, cluster‐randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials were all eligible for inclusion.\n\n【48】#### Types of participants\n\n【49】Pregnant women at high risk of spontaneous preterm birth.\n\n【50】High risk of spontaneous preterm birth can be defined according to:\n\n【51】1.  previous history of preterm birth or second trimester miscarriage;\n\n【52】2.  threatened preterm labour;\n\n【53】3.  positive screening test results, e.g. fetal fibronectin or ultrasound assessment of cervical length;\n\n【54】4.  maternal anthropometric measurements (e.g. attained weight at 24 to 28 weeks, pre‐pregnancy body mass index);\n\n【55】5.  scoring systems based on a combination of different categories of risk factors, including those previously mentioned.\n\n【56】Trials assessing bed rest in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes or multiple pregnancies were not considered .\n\n【57】#### Types of interventions\n\n【58】As bed rest is an accepted standard initial therapy for women at high risk of preterm birth, it has usually been used as a control intervention in trials evaluating alternative forms of care for preventing preterm birth. However, our intention in this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of bed rest compared with no intervention. Therefore, we considered trials comparing prescription of bed rest at home or in hospital with no intervention. Trials with arms including more than one intervention would also be eligible if arms differed only in the prescription of bed rest (i.e. bed rest and drug versus drug alone). For trials comparing drugs, placebo and bed rest, placebo was considered as no intervention.\n\n【59】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【60】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【61】*   Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks)\n\n【62】*   Perinatal mortality\n\n【63】*   Low birthweight (less than 2500 g)\n\n【64】*   Neonatal intensive care\n\n【65】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【66】###### Perinatal\n\n【67】*   Stillbirth\n\n【68】*   Use of corticosteroids (including incomplete courses of corticosteroids)\n\n【69】*   Preterm birth less than 32 weeks\n\n【70】*   Preterm birth less than 28 weeks\n\n【71】*   Delivery within 24 hours of treatment\n\n【72】*   Delivery within 48 hours of treatment\n\n【73】*   Delivery within seven days of treatment\n\n【74】*   Mean gestational age at birth (in weeks)\n\n【75】*   Very low birthweight\n\n【76】*   Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【77】*   Intraventricular hemorrhage\n\n【78】*   Necrotizing enterocolitis\n\n【79】*   Bronchopulmonary dysplasia\n\n【80】*   Surfactant administration\n\n【81】*   Neonatal care more than 48 hours\n\n【82】*   Duration of neonatal care\n\n【83】*   Use of mechanical ventilation\n\n【84】*   Need of oxygen therapy\n\n【85】###### Maternal\n\n【86】*   Maternal mortality\n\n【87】*   Caesarean section\n\n【88】*   Thromboembolic events\n\n【89】*   Maternal infection\n\n【90】*   Antenatal maternal infection (chorioamnionitis)\n\n【91】*   Postpartum maternal infection (endometritis)\n\n【92】*   Dissatisfaction with care\n\n【93】###### Women views (experience and feeling)\n\n【94】###### Cost‐effectiveness", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It can be very itchy but most people recover within 2 to 12 weeks.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of interventions for pityriasis rosea.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), EMBASE (1976 to January 2005), LILACS (1982 to January 2005), BIOSIS Preview (1980 to June 2002), and ongoing trials databases.

We contacted study authors to retrieve missing data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three trials involving 148 people were included. One poor quality trial (23 people), compared intravenous glycyrrhizin and intravenous procaine. It found no significant difference between the two interventions for treating symptoms and rash.\n\n【12】One fair quality trial (85 people), compared the oral antihistamine dexchlorpheniramine (4 mg), the oral steroid betamethasone (500 mcg), and a combination of betamethasone (250 mcg) and dexchlorpheniramine (2 mg). It found no significant difference in itch resolution at two weeks, as rated by the participants, between dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone, and the combination of dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone. However, both dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone alone seem to be better at clearing rash than the combination of dexchlorpheniramine and betamethasone. These interventions were not compared with placebo.\n\n【13】The small good quality trial (40 people) that compared oral erythromycin and placebo found that erythromycin was more effective than placebo in terms of rash improvement, as rated by the trialists, after two weeks (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.91 to 88.64). It was also more effective in decreasing the itch score (difference of 3.95 points, 95% CI 3.37 to 4.53).  \n\n【14】No serious adverse effects were reported for the interventions. Two out of 17 people on oral erythromycin and 1 out of 17 on placebo reported minor gastrointestinal upset.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】We found inadequate evidence for efficacy for most treatments for pityriasis rosea. Oral erythromycin may be effective in treating the rash and decreasing the itch. However, this result should be treated with caution since it comes from only one small RCT. More research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of erythromycin and other treatments.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Pityriasis Rosea\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Intravenous\n*   Topical\n*   Oral\n*   Antibacterials For Systemic Use\n*   Corticosteroids - Otological\n*   Sun Exposure\n*   Corticosteroids - Opthamological and Otological\n*   Antihistamines For Systemic Use\n*   Antihistamine\n*   Ultraviolet Light Therapy\n*   Antiviral agent\n*   Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy\n*   Emollient\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Vehicle\n*   Placebo\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Rash\n*   Clinical Resolution\n*   Clinical Improvement\n*   Itching\n*   Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

It is relatively common and affects about 170 out of every 100,000 people in the community each year. The first sign is a patch of scales, usually on the trunk. A generalised eruption then follows and all lesions disappear within 2 to 12 weeks. This review is important because about 50% of people with pityriasis rosea experience moderate to severe itch. It is not known whether the current treatments, which include tablets, creams, and ultra‐violet radiation, are useful and whether the benefits outweigh the risk of adverse effects.\n\n【28】We found three randomised controlled trials involving 148 participants. One small poor quality trial compared liquorice root with an anaesthetic injected intravenously (23 people), a fair quality trial compared an antihistamine with a steroid taken orally (85 people), and a good quality trial that compared an antibiotic with placebo tablets (40 people).\n\n【29】The poor quality trial found no significant difference between liquorice root and anaesthetic for resolving symptoms or rash. The fair quality trial found no significant difference in itch resolution between the antihistamine and the steroid. However the antihistamine and the steroid on their own were both found to be better at clearing rash than a combination of antihistamine and steroid. The small good quality trial found that the oral antibiotic erythromycin was better than placebo in improving the rash and decreasing the amount of itching.\n\n【30】No serious adverse effects were reported for any intervention. Two out of 17 people on oral erythromycin and 1 out of 17 people on oral placebo reported minor gastrointestinal upset.\n\n【31】We conclude that there is inadequate evidence of efficacy for most treatments but oral erythromycin may be effective in treating the rash and relieving the itch.\n\n【32】Limitations of this review include the small number of trials identified, the small number of participants involved, the inadequate methodology of two of the studies, and finding only one small study that reported the clinical benefits of oral erythromycin.\n\n【33】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effect of pacifier use versus no pacifier use in healthy full‐term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】The superiority of breast milk in providing balanced nutrition, protection against allergy and infection in newborns is well documented . Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Consultation recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed (infant receives only breast milk with no other liquids including water or solids) up to the first six months of life and as a dietary supplement thereafter. In order to successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for longer duration, and avoid supplementary feeding, the WHO's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. The use of a pacifier, a non‐nutritive sucking device to calm an infant, is relatively widespread and has become a cultural norm in many parts of the world . Pacifiers are often believed to be harmless or even necessary and beneficial for infants' development . However, the use of pacifiers for breastfeeding infants remain controversial.\n\n【6】Breastmilk production and supply are maintained by frequent suckling of the breast and nipple stimulation . In order to breastfeed successfully, infants must learn to attach and suckle properly at the breast during the first few days of life. Effective breast sucking technique requires the infant to have a wide open mouth, with the tongue under the areola. Expression of milk from the breast is by slow and deep sucks, while sucking on a pacifier is basically superficial sucking  where the infant is sucking on a teat with short and fast sucks using minimal effort. The mechanical differences between sucking at the breast and sucking on a pacifier may result in 'nipple confusion' , incorrect latching onto the breasts and superficial sucking on the mother's nipples . Improper technique of sucking on the breasts may lead to cracked nipples and mastitis, which may further impede breastfeeding. Evidence from a cohort study reported that breastfeeding difficulties during the first week postpartum were significantly associated with termination of breastfeeding by week 10 of life . There are beliefs, based on observational evidence, that early exposure of infants to the pacifier is associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding by 3 to 6 months , and overall breastfeeding by 12 months . Offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding. This in turn may reduce breast milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding in the long term . Furthermore, infants may get used to the pacifier, and develop a preference for an artificial teat instead of the mother's nipple.  \n\n【7】On the other hand, it remains unclear whether breastfeeding cessation and a maternal intention to wean the infant from exclusive breastfeeding precedes the use of a pacifier or vice versa. It is possible that a mother may have experienced breastfeeding difficulties early and intended to stop breastfeeding, by introducing the pacifier to the infant in preparation to take on bottlefeeding. Interestingly, evidence also shows that pacifiers can have a positive effect on breastfeeding, as they may help to take the infant off the breast and thereby increase the interval between feedings and possibly breast milk intake by the infant . Observational evidence also indicates that occasional use of the pacifier has no effect on breastfeeding duration compared to daily pacifier use  and thus it remains unclear whether pacifiers are an independent causal factor for reducing breastfeeding duration. In addition, the use of pacifiers might be protective against sudden infant death syndrome , although its mechanism is unknown. However, prolonged non‐nutritive sucking on the pacifier is associated with an increased risk of recurrent acute otitis media , oral candidiasis  and dental malocclusion .\n\n【8】Therefore, the aim of this review is to study the effect of pacifier exposure versus no pacifier exposure in healthy infants whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding and infant health.\n\n【9】Objectives\n----------\n\n【10】To assess the effect of pacifier use versus no pacifier use in healthy full‐term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes and infant health.\n\n【11】Methods\n-------\n\n【12】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【13】#### Types of studies\n\n【14】All randomised controlled trials including quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【15】#### Types of participants\n\n【16】Healthy full‐term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding regardless of whether they were born at home or in the hospital.

We will exclude studies which evaluate occasional pacifier use in the clinical setting to provide analgesia for procedural pain.\n\n【19】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【20】##### Definition\n\n【21】Labbok 1990 defines full breastfeeding as a situation where infants receive breast milk either exclusively (ie, no other solid or liquid, including water, is offered) or almost exclusively (ie, supplemental liquids, other than milk formula, are offered infrequently).

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of different initiation regimens of warfarin in terms of time in‐range, time to INR in‐range and effect on serious adverse events\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Oral anticoagulants are used in a number of clinical conditions to prevent blood clotting inappropriately. They are effective for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events  and in other conditions, including deep vein thromboses (DVT), pulmonary emboli (PE) , mitral and aortic valve replacements (MVR/AVR)  and atrial fibrillation (AF)  together with occasional use in patients with heart failure and those with peripheral and cerebral vascular disease. Appropriate use of oral anticoagulants can substantially reduce the burden of disease associated with these conditions. For example, analysis of pooled data from five clinical trials showed a reduction in annual stroke rate from 4.5% to 1.4% for patients assigned to adjusted‐dose warfarin. The absolute risk difference means 31 ischemic strokes will be prevented each year for every 1000 patients treated .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Although warfarin is an effective antithrombotic agent the therapeutic range is narrow due to the need to balance reducing thrombotic events without increasing the risk of bleeding . Some conditions (e.g. deep vein thrombosis) require the establishment of effective anticoagulation quickly to reduce harms, whilst reducing concomitant treatments such as heparin. In other conditions, such as outpatient diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the time to establish the therapeutic range is not as crucial . Safe and effective monitoring of therapy is undertaken using the International Normalized Ratio (INR), developed to reduce problems caused by variability in the sensitivity of different commercial sources of thromboplastin to the blood coagulation factor VII. . An International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0 is generally accepted with the exception of valve replacements where a higher INR between 2.5 and 3.5 is usually recommended. \n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】There is a wide variation in the individual dose response to warfarin. Many factors influence this individual response, these include: increasing age, genetic factors and environmental factors such as drugs, diet and various disease states . Because of this individual variation, careful monitoring is required especially in the initiation phase of treatment. It is particularly important to optimise time in therapeutic range as this has been shown to predict adverse events in patients Wan 2008 . Different methods of initiating warfarin have been tried in clinical practice, with the aim of establishing the therapeutic window efficiently without causing adverse effects. Initial doses of warfarin include 10 mg , 5 mg , 2.5 mg  and, in the elderly, lower doses such as 1 mg .\n\n【11】In addition, initiation dosing can be done using protocols such as Fennerty’s, which relies on consecutive daily INRs over the first four days to predict the next day’s warfarin dose . There has also been considerable interest in genotype guided warfarin initiation . In particular, polymorphisms in the gene coding of the enzyme CYP2C9 significantly alter the metabolism of warfarin, such that carriers of alleles CYP2C9\\*2 and CYP2C9\\*3 may have slower metabolisation of warfarin, and potentially a greater risk of bleeding, particularly  during initiation and subsequently require lower maintenance doses of warfarin .\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】The use of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin has increased substantially over the last decade,  particularly within the context of an ageing population . In 2001 it was estimated that 470,000 patients in the UK were taking anticoagulation treatment . NICE currently estimates a benchmark rate of 1.4% of the UK population (approximately 840,000 people) requiring long‐term anticoagulation treatment. This is based on epidemiological data which estimated the prevalence of the three main conditions requiring anticoagulation therapy as: atrial fibrillation 1%, DVT 0.2% and heart valve replacements 0.2% . Balancing the need for effective anticoagulation with reduced time to therapeutic INR and without concomitant increases in adverse events is important. Selection of the right warfarin dose at the outset is not straightforward, and a systematic review of evidence is needed to determine the optimal strategy.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To assess the effectiveness of different initiation regimens of warfarin in terms of time in‐range, time to INR in‐range and effect on serious adverse events\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】All randomized controlled trials of different loading dose or different regimens in patients aged 18 years and over commencing anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Adult patients commencing anticoagulation with warfarin irrespective of condition e.g. atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE, heart valve replacement, post‐operative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and any other conditions.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】Comparisons of the initiation of different warfarin regimens e.g. 5 mg, 10 mg, age adjusted regimens, genotype adjusted regimens, 2.5 mg and any other regimens.\n\n【24】If feasible, comparison of different dose adjusting interventions e.g. Fennerty's, fixed dose and any other dose adjusting interventions\n\n【25】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【26】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【27】1.

Adenotonsillectomy is the most commonly used intervention to treat sleep apnoea in children.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register was searched with pre‐specified terms.

This study addressed the relative merits of two surgical techniques in treating OSA in children (temperature controlled radiofrequency tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, and complete tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy). No significant difference was apparent for either symptoms or respiratory disturbance index. More children in the TCFR&A group were able to return to normal diet at seven days compared with complete T&A. No significant complications were observed in the study.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】One small study failed to find a difference between two surgical techniques, although return to normal diet was more frequent in the group treated by temperature controlled radiofrequency tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. At present there is still debate as to the criteria required to diagnose significant obstructive sleep apnoea in children. Also the natural history of the condition has not been fully delineated. There is an absence of randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of treatment of confirmed obstructive sleep apnoea with adenotonsillectomy in children. Research is required before recommendations for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children can be formulated. The quality of research in this area could be improved with the use of sleep studies at baseline to determine the extent of severity of sleep apnoea in children who are recruited to studies in this area. Long‐term follow up is also required in order to explore the effect of adenotonsillectomy on paediatric sleep apnoea.\n\n【14】### Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea in children\n\n【15】The current treatment of choice for surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (reduction of airflow at the nose and mouth during sleep) in children is adenotonsillectomy (the removal of the adenoids and tonsils), due to its perceived efficacy, cost effectiveness and the relative size of adenoid and tonsil tissue in children. There is a lack of strong evidence to support the use of adenotonsillectomy in children with sleep apnoea, although there are some data to indicate that a procedure which removes part of the tonsils (temperature controlled radiofrequency tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy) leads to quicker return to normal diet in the post‐surgery phase than complete tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. There is some debate as to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea in children and further research would need to undertake extensive diagnostic tests to make an appropriate diagnosis.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The aim of this study is to determine the effect of experience on outcomes of surgery in ulcerative colitis.  Experience in the literature may be defined as hospital volume – thereby comparing outcomes in high volume versus low volume centres – or surgeon specific volume.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Ulcerative colitis is an illness characterized by inflammation confined to the mucosal and submucosal layer of the colon and rectum. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are collectively classified as inflammatory bowel disease. There are several variations in the extent of disease; ulcerative colitis may be limited to the rectum, may be predominantly left‐sided, or may involve the entire colon – a condition known as pancolitis . The severity of disease is varied; Truelove and Witt have previously grouped ulcerative colitis into three major categories as mild, moderate and severe based on several laboratory and clinical measures .  The current standard of care for ulcerative colitis requires either long‐term pharmacotherapy or surgery, depending on the severity of illness and response to medical therapy.\n\n【7】The incidence of the disease in North America has been reported to range from 2.2 to 14.3 cases per 100 000 person‐years , with prevalence rates reported as being from 37 to 246 per 100 000 . Many patients with ulcerative colitis are managed well on oral medications as long term therapy.  However, despite this, approximately 15% of patients will develop acute severe colitis requiring hospitalization .  Approximately 10% of patients with ulcerative colitis present with fulminant or intractable severe disease, and will therefore proceed to surgery on an urgent basis, or within one year of diagnosis .\n\n【8】There are a variety of medications used to treat, including aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, olsalazine, mesalamine), corticosteroids, cyclosporine and immuno modulators (azathioprine and mercaptopurine). In the last 5‐10 years, advancements have also been made toward the successful usage of biologic agents – specifically, anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents . Two randomised, double blind, placebo controlled studies – the Active Ulcerative Control Trials 1 and 2  were conducted in 2005. These investigations monitored the use of anti‐TNF alpha agents – specifically Infliximab – in the management of ulcerative colitis in the outpatient setting for those individuals considered to be refractory to other treatment regimens, including corticosteroids. These trials demonstrated a successful and significant clinical response rate of over 60% when compared to response rates of 30‐40% in the placebo groups. As such, the use of biologic agents has been implemented as an acceptable alternative to cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of ulcerative colitis .\n\n【9】Despite advances in medical treatment, surgical intervention is still necessary in the management of some patients with ulcerative colitis. Surgery offers a curative result, and involves removal of the colon and rectum (proctocolectomy). While the exact risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis is somewhat controversial, there is a general agreement in the literature that individuals with extensive disease of long duration have the highest risk .  Increased risk for colorectal cancer in patients with pancolitis begins eight to ten years following onset of symptoms. Cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer has been reported to be as high as 5‐10 percent after 20 years of disease, and 12‐20% after 40 years of disease .\n\n【10】In addition to eradicating the risk of potential cancer in patients with long term ulcerative colitis, surgical treatment can afford a cure for the disease itself, thereby reducing the need for patients to take anti‐inflammatory medications. In the natural history of the disease, many patients will require surgical treatment. According to an American population‐level study, the 5‐, 10‐ and 20‐year colectomy rates are as high as 24.2%, 34% and 43.7% regardless of severity of disease . The indications for surgical therapy are generally broken down into emergency and elective clinical scenarios. Indications in the emergency situation include fulminant colitis (as described by Truelove and Witt's criteria), toxic megacolon, haemorrhage and refractoriness to pharmacotherapy. In the elective category, indications for surgery also include refractoriness to medication, but also include complications resulting from medical therapy, mucosal dysplasia, malignancy or the presence of stricture . In the emergency setting, the goal of therapy is to treat fulminant colitis in order to stabilize the patient; more definitive therapy is reserved for when the patient is well.\n\n【11】There are several options in the surgical management of ulcerative colitis, and the exact procedure performed depends on the surgeon's expertise, the type of hospital where the surgery is performed, the patient's co‐morbidities, and the clinical indication for operative treatment. The main options include proctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy, proctocolectomy with continent ileostomy, total colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis, or colectomy, proctectomy and ileal‐pouch anal anastomosis. Certainly in an emergency situation, the main goal of therapy is to remove the colon via a colectomy with ileostomy. This is thought to be a relatively straightforward procedure avoiding complications associated with anastomosis creation . A staged procedure with reversal of ileostomy is an especially important consideration in a population such as this, who may have had recent steroid treatment, and may be malnourished.\n\n【12】On an elective basis, the procedure of choice remains to be the restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch‐anal anastomosis (IPAA); this has been touted as the standard of care for elective surgery in ulcerative colitis . First described by Parks and Nichols in 1978, the procedure entails removal of the colon and rectum, followed by construction of a fecal reservoir from ileum – known as the J‐pouch – and then by the creation of an anastomosis between the ileal pouch and the anal canal . There have been a number of different pouch constructions described in addition to the J pouch (including the S, W, and H pouches), the main difference being the configuration of the ileum to form the pouch prior to anastomosis to the anal canal. The majority of surgeons currently favour the construction of the J pouch . The surgery itself may be performed in one operation, or it may be performed in a staged manner, whereby the patient returns to the operating room on 2 or 3 separate occasions. While surgery affords a cure, there have been a number of documented complications associated with the pouch procedure, as is the case with any surgical intervention. Complications in the early post‐operative period include but are not limited to anastomotic leak, wound dehiscence, pelvic sepsis, perianal fistula or abscess, and anastomotic stricture. Complications in the later post‐operative period include pouch dysfunction, inflammation of the pouch or pouchitis, anastomotic strictures .\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】This study aims to investigate the effect of hospital volume or surgeon experience on the success and outcomes of the pouch procedure in the ulcerative colitis population. Therefore, the intervention itself is somewhat theoretical, and specifically, is surgeon experience or hospital volume. The terms ‘hospital volume’ or ‘surgeon experience’ reflect the volume of cases done in any particular hospital or by a particular surgeon.  Hospital volume may reflect a high volume centre – such as an urban or academic hospital – or a low volume centre – which may reflect either a community or rural hospital. We take surgeon experience to mean just that – the experience a particular surgeon has with a particular operation, in this case, the ileo‐anal pouch procedure. Surgeon experience may imply an academic or sub‐specialist trained surgeon, compared to a community or rural surgeon, or a general surgeon without sub‐specialty training in colorectal surgery. We recognize that there will be many alternative terms present in the literature which will reflect hospital or surgeon volume, and we intend to account for this in our search strategy.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】The effect of case volume, hospital volume and surgeon experience on outcomes in surgery has been raised in other domains, such as cardiac surgery, where it has been suggested that minimum‐volume standards need to be considered before coronary‐artery bypass grafting can be offered as therapy .\n\n【17】With respect to cancer surgery, it is clear that there has been a push to evaluate the effects of hospital volume or surgeon experience on outcomes. Many population‐level studies have been conducted in the area of breast cancer, studying the survival benefit and outcomes in high versus low caseload centres. One population level Finnish study of 12 500 patients concluded that in fact, the overall 5‐year survival following breast cancer resection is better in hospitals with high caseloads compared to those with low caseloads , and this effect has been supported by other earlier studies . Authors have concluded that there are many contributing factors to this discrepancy in outcomes, including surgeon technique, use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies, and assistance from multidisciplinary cancer committees in patient management .  Differences in outcomes have also been observed in other types of cancers. For instance, in the surgical treatment of oesophageal cancer, while the impact of caseload on overall survival is unclear, 30‐day mortality rates have been shown to be lower in high volume centres compared to low volume centres . On the other hand, a recent population level study investigating colon cancer resection has suggested that no conclusions can be drawn between high and low volume centres because no significant differences were found in overall survival .\n\n【18】Regardless of what results have been found in such volume analysis studies, it is clear that investigating the effects of caseload is a timely consideration in surgical outcomes.  If such inconsistencies exist secondary to hospital volume, is this because of discrepancy in surgeon training, access to resources, or contribution of multidisciplinary committees in large volume centres? Evidently there are many possible explanations, but it is clear that if regional variations exist, volume analyses are necessary to identify them.\n\n【19】While technically within the domain of general surgery, it is recognized that in patients with ulcerative colitis who require surgical intervention, there is unfortunately often an elevated baseline level of difficulty because of the nature of the illness and its biology. While it is possible for this procedure to be done at any hospital providing surgical care, it is postulated that differences in pre‐operative management, post‐operative management, availability of resources, surgeon training and the presence of multidisciplinary committees may result in different outcomes following the pouch procedure.  If similar studies are used as a model, it is possible that the intervention (i.e. a high volume surgical centre), may result in improved outcomes secondary to one or all of the aforementioned possibilities.\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】There is no question that if differences in outcomes exist based on the case volume and exposure of surgeons, it is important to identify these discrepancies. However, aside from surgeon experience, we recognize there may or may not be entire teams of allied healthcare professionals associated with each practicing surgeon. Because of this, we feel there are many factors at play when conclusions are drawn between outcomes in surgery and case volume, and not only is this because of the previous experience of the surgeon, but also because of the experience of the nursing staff who may or may not have expertise in taking care of patients with ulcerative colitis on a surgical ward. Allied healthcare professionals who have this extra experience by working with more experienced surgeons, for instance, understand the nuances of stoma management, of identifying concerning signs and symptoms of failed anastomoses, and appreciate the medical issues of patients with ulcerative colitis. Therefore, in the event that better outcomes are identified in high volume centres, it may be directly attributable to the surgeon performing the procedure, attributable to allied healthcare workers who care for the patients, or attributable to access to additional or specialized resources. It is necessary to perform volume analysis studies such as this one to determine if disparities exist in the treatments offered, and further identify what deficiencies are in place to cause for such disparities.\n\n【22】It is understood that because of the anticipated differences in how case volume is defined, that this review may be limited to performing a descriptive analysis. However, there may be regional differences in the delivery of surgical care in ulcerative colitis. If inequalities exist because of regionalization of services based on hospital or surgeon volume, it is necessary to document this, if even in a qualitative fashion.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】The aim of this study is to determine the effect of experience on outcomes of surgery in ulcerative colitis.  Experience in the literature may be defined as hospital volume – thereby comparing outcomes in high volume versus low volume centres – or surgeon specific volume.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】Given the nature of the research question, we do not anticipate finding any randomised studies. Thus, we will include retrospective or prospective cohort studies recruiting women or men that have had a colectomy or restorative proctocolectomy as treatment for ulcerative colitis.  Included studies will directly compare outcomes of surgery between either of the following:\n\n【29】*   High volume and low volume hospitals\n\n【30】*   Community/rural and urban/academic hospitals\n\n【31】*   Surgeons with increased experience versus decreased experience\n\n【32】*   Surgeons who have had additional fellowship training in this particular area of surgery versus those who have not\n\n【33】We will exclude studies that examine only part of an intervention – that is, those that investigate colectomy or proctocolectomy in only a high or low volume centre. Studies that investigate a co‐intervention such as combined treatment of medical and surgical therapy will not be included. Studies investigating quality of life post‐operatively, patient‐reported outcomes, caregiver burden/restrictions on patient lifestyle and economic outcomes will be excluded.\n\n【34】#### Types of participants\n\n【35】Participants to be considered will include all adults over the age of 18 who have received a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and have received a total abdominal colectomy or restorative proctocolectomy for the treatment of this disease.  Patients in the paediatric population or patients who have received a proctocolectomy procedure for the treatment of illnesses other than ulcerative colitis (such as familial adenomatous polyposis or infectious colitis) will be excluded. Ulcerative colitis will be diagnosed by either a gastroenterologist or general or colorectal surgeon based on clinical presentation.\n\n【36】#### Types of interventions\n\n【37】Surgical intervention for the treatment of ulcerative colitis may vary depending on the surgeon performing the operation, the resources available to the surgeon, the clinical presentation of the patient (i.e. whether the surgery was done on an emergency or elective basis), and the degree of illness of the patient pre‐operatively. The greatest difference in the type of operation performed is whether or not it was done as a staged procedure or not, and this may be dependent on one or all of the aforementioned variables. Therefore, all of the following types of surgical interventions will be considered in the treatment for ulcerative colitis:\n\n【38】*   Colectomy – total abdominal or subtotal\n\n【39】*   (Restorative) Proctocolectomy\n\n【40】*   Ileal anal‐pouch anastomosis\n\n【41】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【42】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【43】1.       30 day mortality\n\n【44】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【45】1.

In developing countries, the median incidence of the disease is 68.7 per 100,000 population which is higher than that in developed countries (43.4 per 100,000 population) . It is estimated that about 30% of patients have epilepsy that is refractory to one or more agents and they are considered drug‐resistant. These patients often need add‐on therapy with other antiepileptic drugs . People with epilepsy often have psychosocial, behavioral and cognitive problems, and may place a heavy burden on society . As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), the overall health burden due to epilepsy accounts for 0.5% of the global burden of disease; this can be considered as more than one‐third of the diabetes burden (1.3%) . In Europe, the total annual costs of epilepsy are approximately EUR 15.5 billion . In China, about nine million people suffer from epilepsy; the overall annual costs are approximately USD 773 per patient, which represents half the average annual income .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Losigamone is a newer antiepileptic drug which has been investigated as an add‐on therapy for partial seizures. When orally administered, losigamone is well absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and reaches a peak plasma concentration after two to three hours of administration. Its plasma elimination half‐life is approximately four to seven hours . In two double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, add‐on studies, losigamone has shown possible effects in patients with partial epilepsy . In one study, losigamone at 1200 mg or 1500 mg per day, in addition to three standard anticonvulsants, was tested in 264 partial epilepsy patients. A dose‐dependent reduction of seizure frequency was observed: 29.3% patients receiving losigamone at 1500 mg per day had a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, as compared to 17.2% in those receiving losigamone at 1200 mg per day and 11.8% in the placebo group . Generally, losigamone has been shown to be safe and well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events are dizziness, headache, somnolence, fatigue, ataxia, nausea, diplopia, abnormal vision and vertigo, and these are alleviated quickly. No significant clinically pharmacokinetic interactions with other antiepileptic drugs have been found, which allows the use of losigamone as an add‐on therapy \n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】The exact mechanism of action of losigamone is remains unclear. Data from experimental studies have shown that losigamone stimulates the neuronal chloride channel without directly binding to γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine or picrotoxin receptors, but it can enhance chloride influx in the absence of GABA and potentiate the effects of GABA . It has also been shown to reduce the frequency of spontaneous action potentials and depress repetitive firing of neurons through a decline in presynaptic activity . Other proposed possible mechanisms by which losigamone may decrease neuronal excitability include a decrease in persistent sodium channel current and activation of the potassium channel channel .\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】Randomised studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of losigamone when used as an add‐on therapy for partial epilepsy, but they have not been systematically reviewed . This review will therefore focus on the use of losigamone as an add‐on therapy for partial epilepsy, summarising the evidence about efficacy and safety from randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of losigamone when used as an add‐on therapy for partial epilepsy.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials with no language restriction.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】Patients of any age with partial epilepsy (defined as simple partial, complex partial or secondary generalised tonic‐clonic seizures) which has failed to respond to one or more antiepileptic drugs, or refractory partial epilepsy (defined as focal seizures) according to the recently released definition by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)  are eligible.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Assessment of the effect of chemotherapy on overall survival in patients with naso‐pharynx carcinoma by studying the following comparison:\n\n【3】*   Radiotherapy\n\n【4】*   Radiotherapy + chemotherapy\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is pathologically, epidemiologically and clinically distinct from other head and neck cancers . Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is rare in the USA and Western Europe. In this area, the histology type is frequently a squamous cell carcinoma (WHO type I). The areas of high incidence include Southern China, Southeast Asia, Middle East, North Africa, Alaska and Greenland. In these areas, Epstein‐Barr virus is strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and poorly or undifferentiated (WHO type II or III) carcinomas are the most common forms of the disease. In addition to the Epstein‐Barr virus, specific environmental (nitrosamine) and genetic factors are involved in the carcinogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Most of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma present with locally advanced stage, and a higher incidence of nodal involvement and bilateral nodal disease is observed as compared to patients with other head and neck cancers. Nasopharyngeal carcinomas are commonly treated by radiation therapy and chemotherapy . Radiotherapy with a dose of 65‐75 Gy in 6‐7 weeks is the standard treatment. The overall survival at 5‐years ranged form 32% to 52% in large series of patients with locally advanced stage treated with radiotherapy alone .\n\n【8】Chemotherapy has been proposed to improve patients' survival, and has been used in three ways in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma : as induction treatment (neoadjuvant chemotherapy); concomitantly with radiotherapy; as adjuvant treatment after radiotherapy. In spite of more than ten randomized trials comparing radiotherapy to radiotherapy plus chemotherapy, the effect of chemotherapy on survival is not established. Only two trials showed beneficial effect on survival and four on relapse‐free survival. The inconstant benefit on survival may be explained by the lack of power of the trials, as for the Meta‐Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH‐NC).\n\n【9】The MACH‐NC study , a meta‐analysis based on individual patients data pooled the results of the randomized trials performed between 1965 and 1993 and compared loco‐regional treatment to loco‐regional treatment plus chemotherapy. Trials including only naso‐pharyngeal carcinoma were not eligible. An absolute benefit of 4% for chemotherapy, from 32% to 36%, at 5 years. There was a significant interaction (p<0.01) between chemotherapy timing and treatment which is illustrated in Table 1 .\n\n【10】Table 1. Table 1\n\n| **Chemotherapy timing**  | **Trial Number**  | **Patient Number**  | **RR (95% CI)**  | **p‐value**  | **Absolute benefit 5y**  | **Heterogeneity p‐val**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adjuvant  | 8  | 1 854  | 0.98 (0.85‐1.19)  | 0.74  | 1%  | 0.35  |\n| Neoadjuvant  | 31  | 5 269  | 0.95 (0.88‐1.01)  | 0.1  | 2%  | 0.38  |\n| Concomitant  | 26  | 3 727  | 0.81 (0.76‐0.88)  | <0.0001  | 8%  | <0.0001  |\n| Total  | 65\\*  | 10 850\\*  | 0.90 (0.85‐0.94)  | <0.0001  | 4%  | <0.0001  |\n| \\*Two 3‐arm trials studied two chemotherapy timing.  | RR = relative risk ; 5y = 5 years  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【12】The greatest benefit was observed when chemotherapy was given concomitantly with radiotherapy, but heterogeneity of the results within this group prohibited firm conclusions. The updating of MACH‐NC which is ongoing will clarify this issue as more than 20 randomized trials (more than 7000 patients) have been performed since 1993.\n\n【13】The main aim of the meta‐analysis of chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be to assess the impact of chemotherapy on overall survival when added to radiotherapy (RT). We will also assess the impact of chemotherapy separately on distant metastases and local‐regional control. The database will also provide the opportunity to evaluate which timing (adjuvant, neoadjuvant or concomitant) and type of chemotherapy can offer the best effect (platinum‐based or not etc.). Finally we will be able to better analyze which population is more likely to benefit from the use of chemotherapy.\n\n【14】The meta‐analysis will be based on individual patient data  and will use methodology similar to that used in the MACH‐NC study , the Breast Cancer Overview , the Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation Overview , and the Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Overview . A similar collaborative group comprising those involved in trials included in the project will be established and the meta‐analysis will be conducted and reported on its behalf.\n\n【15】Both published and unpublished studies will be included in the meta‐analysis since there is evidence that both investigators and journal editors are more likely to publish trials with positive results . Basic survival and prognostic information will be collected for all patients randomized in each study because this allows a more reliable and flexible approach, a more sensitive analysis and avoids the potential bias of post‐randomization exclusion . Updated follow‐up information will be sought which will enable us to report on long‐term survival.\n\n【16】In summary, the constitution of this unique database aims to provide the most comprehensive analysis on the effect of chemotherapy in naso‐pharynx carcinoma. It should contribute to the defining of therapeutic guidelines and generate new hypotheses to be tested in further randomized trials.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】Assessment of the effect of chemotherapy on overall survival in patients with naso‐pharynx carcinoma by studying the following comparison:\n\n【19】*   Radiotherapy\n\n【20】*   Radiotherapy + chemotherapy\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomized controlled trials.

{"seq_id": "831f86f4-ba7f-40c9-9ada-11929ce5874c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the benefits and harms of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (exercise‐based interventions alone or in combination with psycho‐educational components) compared with control (no intervention, treatment as usual or another rehabilitation programme) in adults who have received an ICD.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of global mortality with 17.3 million deaths each year. This is expected to rise to 23.6 million by 2030 . It is estimated that sudden cardiac death is responsible for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths, of which about 80% are caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Therefore, sudden cardiac death is a rising global burden.\n\n【7】An effective way of preventing sudden cardiac death is the use of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) that terminates arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, with estimated rates as high as 97% . The ICD was originally introduced in February 1980 and is an arrhythmia device similar to a pacemaker . It is usually implanted subcutaneously on the chest‐wall with a high‐voltage lead placed in the right ventricle with the purpose of treating life‐threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【8】The indication for treatment with ICD is divided into primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death refers to the use of ICD in people who are at risk of, but have not yet had, an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Secondary prevention refers to prevention of sudden cardiac death in those patients who have survived a prior sudden cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia . In recent years, primary prevention ICD treatment, either with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy, has been extended to patients with symptomatic heart failure as part of the Heart Failure Guidelines from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology . This has led to a marked increase in the implantation rates in the United States of America (USA) and Europe . In 2013, the ICD implantation rate for first time implants was approximately 214 per million inhabitants in the Nordic Countries (Denmark, Sweden and Norway) and approximately 125 per million inhabitants in the United Kingdom . These numbers are low compared with the USA, where the implantation rate in 2006 was almost twice as high with 370 per million inhabitants .\n\n【9】In addition to preventing sudden cardiac death, a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the implantation of an ICD (either alone or in combination with cardiac resynchronization therapy) in both the primary and secondary prevention setting has significant mortality and health‐related quality of life effects . Adverse events for ICD recipients are mostly implantation‐related complications (coronary vein dissection, coronary vein perforation, lead dislodgement, infection and death) and inappropriate defibrillator shocks . Patients who experience defibrillator shocks may experience psychological difficulties . A systematic review of anxiety and depression in ICD patients that included 45 studies and more than 5000 patients concluded that approximately 20% of ICD patients have clinically significant psychological distress . This is twice as high as in individuals with general cardiac and chronic medical conditions .\n\n【10】In spite of the potential mortality benefits of receiving an ICD device, psychological problems experienced by patients after receiving an ICD may negatively impact their health‐related quality of life, and lead to increased re‐admission to hospital and health care, loss of productivity and employment earnings, and increased morbidity and mortality .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive complex intervention that includes components of exercise training, education, psychosocial management and a behaviour‐modification programme designed to improve the physical and emotional conditions of people with heart disease . Cardiac rehabilitation includes, for example, patient assessment, nutritional counselling, and risk factor management for lipids, blood pressure, weight, diabetes mellitus and smoking cessation .\n\n【13】The beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation in post‐myocardial, revascularization and heart failure patients is well established in terms of potential reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and healthcare costs, as well as improvements in exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life .\n\n【14】The European Society of Cardiology recommends that exercise training for people with cardiovascular disease should consist of two and a half hours per week, but recommendations streches up to four hours per week .\n\n【15】Although their psychological needs may be high, no specific evidence‐based cardiac rehabilitation guidelines exist for patients with ICDs as evidence concerning rehabilitation for patients with an ICD is very limited . Neither the European Society of Cardiology nor the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology have published separate or specific guidelines on exercise training for the ICD patient. We have been unable to identify any international consensus reports or guidelines that provide detailed recommendations for exercise training after receiving an ICD. Consequently, recommendations for ICD patients regarding exercise training vary widely . Randomised clinical trials and observational studies evaluating the effect of physical exercise for ICD patients have employed many different training protocols .\n\n【16】Current cardiac rehabilitation recommendations for post‐myocardial infarction/revascularization, heart failure and heart valve replacement patients recommend that, in addition to exercise training, psycho‐social or educational support, or both, should be offered  – so‐called 'comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation'. However, as with exercise training, there are no separate or specific guidelines on psycho‐educational interventions for the ICD patient. Many psycho‐educational intervention studies in ICD recipients, some of which are RCTs, have reported improvements in anxiety, depression and health‐related quality of life outcomes, as well as fewer unplanned hospital admissions and phone calls to healthcare providers compared with the control group . Some of these studies have employed different psycho‐educational intervention protocols, which again reflect the uncertainty surrounding the specific nature of cardiac rehabilitation for patients with ICD and what kind of psycho‐educational intervention they should receive.\n\n【17】In summary, there is evidence from other heart conditions (post‐myocardial infarction, revascularization and heart failure) that suggests that cardiac rehabilitation for patients with ICD should consist of both exercise training and psycho‐educational intervention, but evidence‐based rehabilitation guidelines for ICD recipients are currently lacking.\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Studies of exercise training or psycho‐educational interventions, or both, in ICD patients have reported improvements in both psychological or physical outcomes, or both . Randomised clinical trials have reported that comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation significantly increased average peak oxygen uptake (VO <sub>2 </sub> ) after exercise training with improvements of 16% to 27% in metabolic equivalents (METS) or peak VO <sub>2 </sub> . A retrospective study of 82 ICD recipients indicated that patients who did not participate in outpatient rehabilitation had a higher rate of ICD shock therapy than ICD recipients, who participated in outpatient rehabilitation, after adjusting for physical limitations . Randomised trials have also reported reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms, increased health‐related quality of life and decreased disability days/calls to healthcare providers .\n\n【20】The safety of exercise training after ICD implantation may be compromised due to the risk of inappropriate ICD shocks. Therefore, patients are uncertain as to the level of exercise that is safe to perform without receiving an ICD shock. However, several studies have shown only a few exercise‐related cardiac events during or soon after the training session .\n\n【21】In summary, randomised and observational studies suggest that exercise training has a positive effect on the exercise capacity, general health and quality of life of ICD patients. Furthermore, inclusion of psychosocial or educational support may have positive effects in terms of reduced anxiety and depression.\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Firstly, whilst summaries of the evidence for cardiac rehabilitation in patients with ICD have been published , we are unaware of any systematic reviews of this literature. Secondly, we seek to extend the trial evidence base considered by the Cochrane review of exercise‐based rehabilitation for heart failure . Many trials included in this Cochrane review excluded ICD implants. However, we are aware that some of the more recent randomised clinical trials of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure include a proportion of patients with ICD, e.g. approximately 55% of patients in the HF‐ACTION randomised trial . While these randomised trials were included in the heart failure Cochrane review, outcomes for the ICD subgroup were not reported separately. This Cochrane review will therefore seek to report the outcomes for ICD subgroups included in those heart failure trials.\n\n【24】As outlined above, a proportion of ICD patients have arrhythmia (secondary prevention) and not heart failure (primary prevention). Traditionally the ICD population has been considered as one group due to their similar high risk of sudden cardiac death, ICD shock and device‐dependence. As cardiac rehabilitation studies have been carried out in mixed ICD populations (both arrhythmia and heart failure), we will seek to include patients of all indications who have received an ICD, but aim to stratify our results by primary versus secondary indication.\n\n【25】By conducting this review we will also add to the body of knowledge about cardiac rehabilitation in complex cardiac conditions .\n\n【26】Objectives\n----------\n\n【27】To assess the benefits and harms of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation programmes (exercise‐based interventions alone or in combination with psycho‐educational components) compared with control (no intervention, treatment as usual or another rehabilitation programme) in adults who have received an ICD.\n\n【28】Methods\n-------\n\n【29】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【30】#### Types of studies\n\n【31】Randomised clinical trials irrespective of language, publication year, publication type and publication status will be eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【32】#### Types of participants\n\n【33】Adult patients (18 years or older), of both sexes and all ethnicities, who have been treated with an ICD are eligible for inclusion. We will include patients regardless of their indication or whether the device was implanted for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Patients with ICD devices combined with cardiac resynchronization therapy and permanent ICDs with any additional leads for pacing, including single chamber, dual chamber and biventricular pacemakers will be included. In trials that include both patients with and without ICDs, we will contact trial authors for separate data on the ICD patients. If this is not possible, we will only include the trial if at least 50% of patients are ICD recipients or if the trial has less than 50% but presents the results in a subgroup of ICD patients separately.\n\n【34】#### Types of interventions\n\n【35】##### Experimental\n\n【36】The experimental intervention must include an exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation programme for adults treated with an ICD. We define interventions that are 'exercise‐based' as being either a supervised or unsupervised programme conducted in an inpatient, outpatient, community or home setting that includes any kind of exercise training. The intervention must include a physical exercise component that focuses on increasing exercise capacity, and it may include a psycho‐educational intervention that focuses on improving mental health and the patient's self‐management skills. The exercise intervention must be initiated after discharge from hospital. There will be no restrictions in the length, intensity or content of the training programme and there will be no minimum length of follow‐up for the studies that are eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【37】##### Control\n\n【38】We will include control interventions that exclude exercise training, as listed below:\n\n【39】*   Treatment as usual (e.g. standard medical care, such as ICD follow‐up);\n\n【40】*   No intervention;\n\n【41】*   Any other type of cardiac rehabilitation programme e.g. psycho‐educational intervention.\n\n【42】##### Co‐interventions\n\n【43】We will include trials with co‐interventions other than cardiac rehabilitation of any kind, as long as these are identical and delivered equally in the experimental and the control groups. Co‐interventions can include anything other than the experimental intervention (e.g. drug delivery, surgery techniques or dietary interventions).\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】We will assess all outcomes at two time points:\n\n【46】*   End of the intervention (as defined by the trial authors);\n\n【47】*   Longest available follow‐up after the intervention period.\n\n【48】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【49】1.  Mortality: all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality;\n\n【50】2.  Serious adverse events defined as any adverse event that results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect ;\n\n【51】3.  Health‐related quality of life using generic or disease‐specific validated instruments, e.g. Short For, Heart‐Related Quality of Life and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.\n\n【52】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【53】1.  Exercise‐capacity: any measure of exercise‐capacity including direct measurement of VO <sub>2 </sub> peak or VO <sub>2 </sub> max or indirect measures, such as exercise time, walking distance, etc.;\n\n【54】2.  Proportion of participants with ICD therapy, defined as either shock or anti tachycardia pacing;\n\n【55】3.  Proportion of participants with non‐serious adverse events, such as skeletomuscular injury, palpitations, dyspnoea, dizziness;\n\n【56】4.  Proportions of participants with employment or loss of employment;\n\n【57】5.

Data were entered into RevMan 4.2.5. We used intention‐to‐treat data. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs. Regarding the primary harm outcome, only overall drop‐out rates were available for all studies.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】The search identified 3333 abstracts, but only 10 RCTs with a total of 548 patients could be included in the review. Due to clinical heterogeneity, few meta‐analyses were possible. We found no conclusive evidence that the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic is more effective than an antidepressant alone (two RCTs; RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.41), but a combination is more effective than an antipsychotic alone (three RCTs; RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.80). There were no statistically significant differences in the overall drop‐out rates between any of the treatments, neither in individual studies nor after pooling of studies.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Treatment with an antipsychotic alone is not a good option. Starting with an antidepressant alone and adding an antipsychotic if the patient does not respond or starting with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic both appear appropriate options for patients with psychotic depression. In clinical practice the balance between risks and benefits suggests that initial antidepressive monotherapy and adding an antipsychotic if there is inadequate response should be the preferred treatment strategy for many patients.

{"seq_id": "bccafe83-95ef-4d81-b62a-c7d45f63794e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of first‐line beta‐blockers compared to other anti‐hypertensive medications for treating chronic type B thoracic aortic dissections.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a severe and oftentimes lethal complication in hypertensive patients.  While there are other aortic syndromes such as aortic aneurysms or intramural hematomas, TADs are considered one of the most deadly aortic diseases with variable etiology and poor prognosis.  In 1760, King George II of England was the first documented case of aortic dissection, diagnosed by autopsy .  Since then, many have studied aortic dissections and advances in the diagnosis and treatments have significantly benefited patients with this deadly condition.\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】TADs can be described as hemorrhage into the medial layer of the aorta through a tear in the intima.  The thoracic aorta can be divided into multiple segments – ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, and descending aorta.  The ascending aorta begins distal to the aortic valves, with the sinus of Valsalva and continues to the first branch of the aortic arch.  The transverse aortic arch begins at the brachiocephalic artery and ends just distal to the left subclavian artery.  Finally, the descending aorta starts beyond the left subclavian artery and continues to the point of penetration into the diaphragm.\n\n【8】Two classification systems have been commonly used in literature to describe the location of the TAD.  The DeBakey system describes type I dissections as involvement of the entire thoracic aorta.  Type II dissections describe involvement of only the ascending aorta.  Type III describe dissections only affecting the descending aorta and may involve the abdominal aorta.  The Stanford classification system simplifies the description to type A involving the ascending aorta and may involve the rest of the aorta; type B dissections involve the descending aorta and possibly the abdominal aorta, but strictly without involvement of the ascending aorta.  In this systematic review, aortic dissections will be described using the Stanford classification system.\n\n【9】#### Epidemiology of TAD\n\n【10】Although many have studied aortic dissections, it is believed that the number of TADs reported is an underestimate as many of these patients die before ever reaching a medical facility.  It is estimated that three to four cases of TAD occur every 100,000 persons per year and is increasing, probably due to increased reported cases with improved recognition of symptoms and diagnostic imaging .  Studies have shown that the prevalence of type A dissections (67%) are more common than type B dissections (33%) .  The mean age of onset is typically in the mid‐60s and TAD is twice as likely to occur in men than women, with women having an older mean age of onset of 67 compared to 60 in men .\n\n【11】TAD typically has a poor prognosis, dependent on the anatomical location and extent of the dissection, time between onset and diagnosis, and the treatment administered .  Type A dissections have the worst prognosis with an overall in‐hospital mortality of 30% .  It has been estimated that mortality rate increases by 1% for every hour after onset of symptoms if left untreated .  If only treated medically without surgical intervention, type A dissections have an in‐hospital mortality rate of 59%, compared to 23% with surgical treatment .\n\n【12】Type B dissections tend to have a better prognosis than type A dissections, having an overall in‐hospital mortality rate of 13% .  With surgical intervention, mortality rate of type B dissections is approximately 20%, given that complicated cases are treated surgically.  Medical treatment has a mortality rate of approximately 10% .\n\n【13】#### Etiology and Risk Factors of TAD\n\n【14】Thoracic aortic dissections may have many different underlying etiologies but there is one common theme to its pathogenesis.  Weakening of the aortic walls is believed to be the key pathology leading to the actual dissection .  Aortic dilatation is believed to be one of the risk factors of TAD, with the risk of dissection significantly increasing when the ascending aorta dilates > 6cm and the descending aorta > 7cm .  However, it is not the dilatation that causes a TAD, but rather, it increases the risk of a TAD; a tear in the intimal wall is needed to induce a TAD.\n\n【15】Hypertension has been analyzed extensively in TAD cases and has been well recognized to be one of the key causative factors of TAD .  Chronic hypertension increases the force of systolic ejection jet against the aortic wall, which over time, may weaken from continuous strain and eventually suffer from an intima tear.  A sustained high blood pressure will propagate the false lumen within the walls of the aorta, hence forming the TAD.\n\n【16】Connective tissue disorders have been identified as a risk factor for TAD. These include genetic conditions such as Marfan Syndrome, Loeys‐Dietz Syndrome, Ehler‐Danlos Syndrome, and Turner Syndrome.  Congenital vascular diseases such as bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta have also been identified as risk factors for TAD.  Any forms of aortitis can increase the risk of TAD, such as giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, Behcet’s disease, systemic lupus erythematous or syphilis.  Other risk factors identified include trauma, iatrogenic causes from catheter interventions or valvular/aortic surgery, cocaine use, and pregnancy .\n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】Surgical intervention is almost always the recommended therapy for type A dissections due to the poor prognosis if left untreated .  Type B dissections have a significantly better prognosis and are entitled to different treatment options.  Uncomplicated type B aortic dissections can be managed with medical therapy.  Initial management of aortic dissection with anti‐hypertensive medications is to decrease the aortic wall shear stress.  Aortic wall stress is affected by the velocity of ventricular contraction, the rate of ventricular contraction, and blood pressure.  Intravenous beta‐blockers have been recommended by guidelines as the mainstay first‐line therapy in its ability to decrease aortic wall stress .  Guidelines recommend controlling heart rate to a target of less than 60 beats per minute and a systolic blood pressure between 100 – 120 mmHg or as tolerated while maintaining adequate end‐organ perfusion .  Intravenous non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (Non‐DHP CCB), diltiazem and verapamil, are suggested as an alternative for chronotropic control for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta‐blockers, and can also be used to reduce blood pressure .   If systolic blood pressure remains above target, intravenous vasodilators and angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can also be used to reduce blood pressure .  Once stabilized, patients should be transitioned to oral medications and continued on medical therapy long‐term .  Other anti‐hypertensive medication classes include the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), diuretics, alpha‐blockers, and centrally acting alpha‐agonists. Resistant hypertension occurs frequently and a median of four anti‐hypertensive medications are used in chronic aortic dissections .  Guideline recommendations emphasize the use of beta‐blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs for anti‐hypertensive therapy in patients with thoracic aortic disease .  But the evidence in the approach to medical management and the selection of anti‐hypertensive medications in chronic type B aortic dissections remains scarce. Beta‐blockers have shown some evidence to reduce aortic root dilatation in children with Marfan syndrome . Also, long‐term use of beta‐blockers appears to reduce the need for dissection‐related surgery and the progression of aortic dilatation compared to treatment with other anti‐hypertensive medications .  However, a recently updated Cochrane review emphasized that beta‐blockers are less effective in controlling hypertension as a first‐line therapy when compared to other anti‐hypertensive medications . Furthermore, another Cochrane review demonstrated evidence and recommended the use of other classes of anti‐hypertensive medications over beta‐blockers . ACE inhibitors, in particular perindopril, have also been shown to reduce aortic root diameter in patients with Marfan syndrome .  Takeshita et al. showed that the use of ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of long‐term aortic events in patients with type B aortic dissections . Valsartan, an ARB, demonstrated a reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes and in aortic dissection incidences .  Also, a small study by Brooke et al. showed ARBs slowing the rate of aortic root enlargement in children with Marfan syndrome . Recently, analysis of data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) showed CCBs being associated with improved survival in type B aortic dissections . Benefit with other anti‐hypertensive medications and comparisons between medication classes in aortic dissections remain unclear.\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Due to the deadly nature of this cardiovascular disease, the treatments of TADs need to be well studied to maximize its efficacy and to improve patient prognosis.  This systematic review will focus on medical therapeutics for the treatment of type B thoracic aortic dissections.  Type B dissections tend to have a better prognosis with medical treatment compared to type A dissections.  Although therapeutic guidelines have been developed, there has been limited literature on the direct comparison between the different medications used to treat TADs .\n\n【21】This review will guide physicians in their clinical decision‐making on the optimal treatment regimen for their patients.  Although beta‐blockers are currently considered first‐line therapy, there is still research yet to be done to compare the different possible alternatives as feasible first‐line pharmacological agents.  Through this systematic review, data from past studies comparing the different medications will be synthesized and analyzed for the ease of physicians to interpret and utilize as their future therapeutic guidelines.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the effects of first‐line beta‐blockers compared to other anti‐hypertensive medications for treating chronic type B thoracic aortic dissections.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】The review will be based only on data from randomized controlled trials comparing different anti‐hypertensive medications in the treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】Patients with chronic type B thoracic aortic dissections of all etiologies (including Marfan syndrome, Ehler‐Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, iatrogenic or traumatic cause) that were not prescribed surgical therapy as a first‐line treatment will be considered for this systematic review.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】First‐line beta‐blockers will be assessed in comparison to other anti‐hypertensive medications, such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, vasodilators, renin inhibitors, alpha‐blockers, and central alpha‐agonists.\n\n【32】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【33】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【34】Because TAD is often a lethal complication of hypertension, the major outcomes of concern would be the total mortality rate (TMR). Studies must provide TMR data to be included in this review.\n\n【35】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【36】The total non‐fatal serious adverse events relating to this cardiovascular disease will be assessed as a secondary outcome. If medical treatment fails or if the dissection progresses, surgical intervention is usually the next therapeutic approach. The number of patients not requiring surgery using these compared medical interventions will also be assessed. Measurement of the progression of aortic dimensions will be considered as it may be an effective monitoring tool in the medical intervention of TAD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We also scanned reference lists of all identified studies and contacted researchers.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomized controlled trials of antituberculous regimens containing fluoroquinolones in people diagnosed with bacteriologically positive (sputum smear or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data (both with 95% confidence intervals (CI)), and the random‐effects model if we detected heterogeneity and appropriate to combine data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Ten trials (1178 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No statistically significant difference was found in trials substituting ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin for first‐line drugs in relation to cure (89 participants, 2 trials), treatment failure (388 participants, 3 trials), or clinical or radiological improvement (216 participants, 2 trials). Substituting ciprofloxacin into first‐line regimens in drug‐sensitive tuberculosis led to a higher incidence of relapse (RR 7.17, 95% CI 1.33 to 38.58; 384 participants, 3 trials) and longer time to sputum culture conversion (WMD 0.50 months, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 168 participants, 1 trial), although this was confined to HIV‐positive participants. Adding or substituting levofloxacin to basic regimens in drug‐resistant areas had no effect. A comparison of sparfloxacin versus ofloxacin added to regimens showed no statistically significant difference in cure (184 participants, 2 trials), treatment failure (149 participants, 2 trials), or total number of adverse events (253 participants, 3 trials).\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Only ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin have been tested in randomized controlled trials for treating tuberculosis. We cannot recommend ciprofloxacin in treating tuberculosis. Trials of newer fluoroquinolones for treating tuberculosis are needed. No difference has been demonstrated between sparfloxacin and ofloxacin in drug‐resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【15】----------------------\n\n【16】### Substituting or adding fluoroquinolones to established first‐line antituberculous drug regimens gives no additional benefit or risks\n\n【17】Fluoroquinolones have antituberculous activity, but are not one of the standard antituberculous medicines. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin have been tested in randomized controlled trials. Ciprofloxacin should not be used as a substitute drug in the standard antituberculous regimen, as more people with drug‐sensitive tuberculosis had relapses and it took longer for them to be cured, although it was no different in terms of cure or number of adverse events. Sparfloxacin was no better than ofloxacin when added to antituberculous regimens in drug‐resistant tuberculosis.

Single preventive strategies have not been shown to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration to a significant extent. Therefore, in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined (complex interventions).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of complex interventions in the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus compared with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions. A complex intervention is defined as an integrated care approach, combining two or more prevention strategies on at least two different levels of care: the patient, the healthcare provider and/or the structure of health care.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】For the second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register , The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 May 2015), Ovid MEDLINE , Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 21 May, 2015) and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 22 May, 2015).\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effectiveness of combinations of preventive strategies, not solely patient education, for the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus, with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors were assigned to independently select studies, to extract study data and to assess risk of bias of included studies, using predefined criteria.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Only six RCTs met the criteria for inclusion. The study characteristics differed substantially in terms of healthcare settings, the nature of the interventions studied and outcome measures reported. In three studies that compared the effect of an education‐centred complex intervention with usual care or written instructions, only little evidence of benefit was found. Three studies compared the effect of more intensive and comprehensive complex interventions with usual care. One study found a significant and cost‐effective reduction, one of lower extremity amputations (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71). One other study found a significant reduction of both amputation and foot ulcers. The last study reported improvement of patients' self care behaviour. All six included RCTs were at high risk of bias, with hardly any of the predefined quality assessment criteria met.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is no high‐quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Preventive\n*   Diabetic Care\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Diabetic Care\n*   Usual Care\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Amputation Of The Foot\n*   Diabetic Foot Ulcer\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Combined strategies to avoid foot ulcers in patients with diabetes\n\n【24】Foot ulcers (open sores) are common in people with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2), especially those with problems in the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), the blood supply to their legs (peripheral vascular disease) or both. People with ulcers due to diabetes will sometimes need an amputation (surgical removal of part of the limb). Foot ulcers not only lead to physical disability and loss of quality of life, but also to economic burden (healthcare costs, industrial disability). The aim is therefore to prevent foot ulcers occurring, for example, by showing patients with diabetes how to look after their feet or by prompting doctors to check their patients' feet more often. The results of single prevention strategies alone have so far been disappointing, therefore in clinical practice, preventive interventions directed at patients, healthcare providers and/or the structure of health care are often combined. In this review of trials of complex, preventive interventions, we found insufficient evidence that these combined approaches can be effective in reducing foot problems.\n\n【25】--------------\n\n【26】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【27】### Implications for practice\n\n【28】There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of complex interventions for preventing or reducing diabetic foot ulceration. This should be interpreted, however, as a lack of evidence rather than evidence of no effect. There were very few studies and those that exist were at unclear or high risk of bias. It may be advisable to concentrate preventive efforts on those who appear to be at highest risk of foot ulceration after careful screening and selection.\n\n【29】### Implications for research\n\n【30】More randomised trials that evaluate the effect of intensive comprehensive complex interventions are urgently needed. As discussed above, the evidence in this field is still scarce and does not allow us to draw firm conclusions. The main shortcomings of the studies included in this review are insufficient power and duration of follow‐up to detect clinically relevant improvements in foot ulceration and amputation incidence marked clinical heterogeneity an high risk of bias.\n\n【31】First, the ultimate aim of preventive strategies is to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration. This means that randomised trials that include diabetes patients at average risk of foot ulceration, need at least 430 to 870 patients per treatment arm in order to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of foot ulceration (based on an annual incidence of foot ulceration in the general diabetes population of 2% to 4% per year or 4% to 8% over two years) . Five of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in this systematic review reported amputation or foot ulceration incidence, or both, but only one of these was sufficiently powered .\n\n【32】Secondly, in order to facilitate proper analysis and future comparison of the results of studies evaluating the effects of complex interventions, more homogeneity of study characteristics and study reporting is needed. To begin with, particular consideration should be given to adequate reporting of baseline values and criteria for exclusion and inclusion . Also, it is important that studies report the content of the 'usual care' that is provided to the control group, because this differs between countries and health care settings and has evolved over time. One of the intervention components that could be standardised in the future is (patient) education. This can be achieved by developing clear and commonly accepted learning objectives . Furthermore, all future RCTs studying the effect of complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration should at least report the incidence of foot ulceration and amputation. Also, an outline of the costs that were associated with each intervention is vital to assess cost‐effectiveness. If changes in patients' foot care knowledge and self care behaviour are reported, these should be measured with standardised and validated tools. However, such standard sets of outcomes, like available in rheumatology (OMERACT) and low back pain research , still need to be developed for research on the diabetic foot.\n\n【33】Thirdly, efforts must be made to reduce risk of bias and poor reporting of future studies. Patients should be randomised properly with concealed allocation. Blinding of patients and healthcare providers is often not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but blinding of outcome assessors must be ensured. Also, more pragmatic study design options like the Zelen's design, in which the control group is not informed, might be an option . Co‐interventions need to be registered and reported accurately. Furthermore, loss to follow‐up should be avoided, because this may lead to underestimation of the intervention results. If loss to follow‐up is notable, reasons for study withdrawal should be reported in order to reveal any causality. Finally, RCTs must be reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines  and their extension to cluster‐randomised trials .\n\n【34】We realise that trials of this magnitude are costly, but the benefits in terms of the potential reduction in costs associated with effective treatment are potentially significant.\n\n【35】Background\n----------\n\n【36】### Description of the condition\n\n【37】Diabetes mellitus is a serious health issue globally. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2030, which means that 366 million people will be affected . One of the most disabling complications of diabetes is foot ulceration, which is a common outcome of a variety of aetiological pathways that often comprise neuropathy, ischaemia or both . A diabetic foot ulcer is defined as a full‐thickness wound of any duration, below the ankle, in a person with diabetes. Skin necrosis and gangrene are also classified as ulcers . Foot ulceration affects between 15% and 25% of people with diabetes at some point during their life . Even when immediate and intensive treatment is provided, these wounds may take weeks or months to heal or may not heal at all. This not only leads to physical disability and marked reduction of quality of life , but also precedes the majority of lower‐extremity amputations . Patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulceration have a 7% risk of amputation in the next 10 years . Moreover, 70% of foot ulcer patients have recurrent lesions within five years after treatment .\n\n【38】Treatment of diabetic foot ulceration is very challenging and often needs to be of long duration. It requires not only expert attention, orthopaedic appliances and antimicrobial drugs, but also costly topical dressings and inpatient care . Not surprisingly, this leads to substantial economic burden. According to a review of health‐economic studies, healing of an infected ulcer not requiring amputation costs approximately USD 17,500 (1998 US Dollars) . In cases where lower extremity amputation is required, health care is even more expensive: USD 30,000 to 33,500 (1998 US Dollars) . These costs do not even represent the total economic burden, since costs related to loss of productivity, preventive efforts, rehabilitation and home care should also be considered. When all this is taken into account, 7% to 20% of total expenditure on diabetes in North America and Europe might be attributable to diabetic foot ulceration .\n\n【39】### Description of the intervention\n\n【40】In 1989 the European Declaration of St. Vincent set a target of reducing the incidence of foot amputations by 50% over the next five years . The benefits that could result from such a reduction were further emphasised by cost‐effectiveness evaluations . International guidelines underpinned this drive by outlining foot ulcer prevention strategies, such as optimising metabolic control, identification and screening of people at high risk of diabetic foot ulceration and patient education in order to promote foot self care .\n\n【41】Recent population‐based research suggests that nowadays a meaningful reduction of the incidence of amputations caused by diabetes mellitus has been achieved. Before the European assembly in St. Vincent, the relative risk of a lower extremity amputation was still 15 times higher in people with diabetes mellitus than in people without diabetes mellitus . More recently, one study has suggested that the relative risk of amputation has reduced to 8.8 (7.3 to 10.7) in men and 5.7 (4.3 to 7.6) in women , whilst another reported a relative risk of 7.7 (5.0 to 12.9) . However, it cannot be inferred from these figures that current preventive efforts are (cost)effective, since the reduction in amputation incidence may also have resulted from improvements in ulcer treatment. Moreover, another systematic review has shown that very little evidence is available supporting patient education alone for reducing foot ulceration and amputation incidence effectively  and it is now generally agreed that there is no single, magic bullet for long‐term prevention of diabetic foot ulceration and amputation .\n\n【42】In clinical practice patient education is therefore often combined with a wide variety of other preventive interventions, depending on the availability of expertise and resources. These interventions may, like patient education, aim to improve patients' health outcomes directly (patient level intervention). Examples are: podiatry care, foot ulceration risk assessment and motivational coaching to reinforce foot self care behaviours. However, interventions to prevent foot ulceration may also benefit patients indirectly through improving healthcare professionals' ability to provide adequate care (care provider level intervention) or through improving the health care system (structure of health care level intervention). Examples of the first are healthcare provider education , introduction of clear flow sheets for risk assessment and referral or introduction of new screening instruments for foot ulceration risk assessment. Examples of healthcare structural interventions in general are listed in the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group checklist  and may include the introduction of a multidisciplinary team approach  or measures to improve regularity of follow‐up and continuity of care .\n\n【43】In this systematic review of trials we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of 'complex interventions', defined as an integrated combination of patient level interventions, healthcare provider level interventions and/or structural interventions.\n\n【44】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【45】Despite the fact that preventive interventions are often combined in clinical practice, there is very little scientific evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of such complex interventions. Existing review articles are mainly written from a clinical perspective  and frequently lack the essential components of systematic review methodology, such as assessment of the risk of bias of included studies. A systematic review of the evidence of the effectiveness of complex interventions for the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers is therefore needed.\n\n【46】Objectives\n----------\n\n【47】To determine the effectiveness of complex interventions for the prevention of diabetes‐related foot ulcers compared with single interventions, usual care or alternative complex interventions.\n\n【48】Methods\n-------\n\n【49】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【50】#### Types of studies\n\n【51】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised controlled trials, evaluating complex intervention programmes for the prevention of foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus. We excluded studies that are solely aimed at optimising blood glucose concentration. An explicit focus on foot ulceration was required.\n\n【52】#### Types of participants\n\n【53】People aged 18 years or older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus in any healthcare setting.\n\n【54】#### Types of interventions\n\n【55】Complex interventions aiming to reduce the incidence of foot ulceration in people with diabetes mellitus. A complex intervention is defined as an integrated care approach, combining two or more prevention strategies on at least two different levels of care: the patient, the healthcare provider and/or the structure of health care (for examples of interventions on each level see: Background ). Studies solely directed at patient education were not eligible. This topic is addressed in another systematic review .\n\n【56】Studies of any comparison intervention were eligible for inclusion, i.e. complex interventions compared with single interventions or with usual care. If the comparison intervention consisted of an alternative complex intervention, foot care had to contrast with the experimental intervention on at least two different levels of care.\n\n【57】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【58】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【59】The primary outcomes of interest were risk of:\n\n【60】*   incidence of foot ulceration;\n\n【61】*   rates of amputation (partial or total).\n\n【62】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【63】Secondary outcomes of interest were:\n\n【64】*   callus development (e.g. presence of lesions, or a detailed description of the number, location or diameter of lesions);\n\n【65】*   resolution of callus;\n\n【66】*   number and duration of hospital admissions for diabetes‐related foot problems;\n\n【67】*   foot care knowledge scores;\n\n【68】*   patients' behaviour assessment scores (e.g. washing, creaming, foot inspection, cutting toe nails, use of pumice stones, foot gymnastics);\n\n【69】*   costs;\n\n【70】*   adverse events.\n\n【71】Trials were included even if only secondary outcomes were reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) saves lives, lung distortion during its use is associated with lung injury and chronic lung disease (CLD). Conventional IPPV is provided at 30‐80 breaths per minute while a newer form of ventilation called high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) provides 'breaths' at 10‐15 cycles per second. This has been shown to result in less lung injury in experimental studies.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The objective of this review is to determine whether the elective use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation as compared to conventional ventilation (CV) in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated for the respiratory distress syndrome decreases the incidence of chronic lung disease, without adverse effects.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal hand searching by the Cochrane Collaboration, mainly in the English language. The search was updated in May 2003.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomized controlled trials comparing HFOV and CV in preterm or low birth weight infants with pulmonary dysfunction, mainly due to RDS, who are to be given IPPV. Randomization and commencement of treatment should have been as soon as possible after the start of IPPV and usually in the first 12 hours of life.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】The methodological quality of each trial was independently reviewed by the various authors. Each author extracted data separately; they were compared and differences were resolved. Treatment effects were expressed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD). From 1/RD the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one outcome were calculated. Ninety five percent confidence intervals were used for all measures of effect.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Eleven eligible studies on 3,275 infants were included. Meta‐analysis comparing HFOV with CV revealed no evidence of effect on mortality at 28‐30 days of age or at approximately term equivalent age. These results were consistent across studies. The effect of HFOV on CLD in survivors at term equivalent GA was inconsistent across studies and not significant overall. Pre‐specified subgroup analyses according to use of a high volume strategy, or use of surfactant, did not identify subgroups in which there was evidence of effect on death, or in which the size of effect on CLD was substantially increased, or in which heterogeneity of treatment effect on CLD was removed.\n\n【13】Short term neurological morbidity caused by HFOV was found in some studies, but this effect was not statistically significant overall. The subgroup of two trials not using a high volume strategy with HFOV found increased rates of Grade 3 or 4 IVH and of periventricular leukomalacia. An adverse effect of HFOV on longer term neurodevelopment was found in one large trial but not in two other small trials which reported this outcome.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】There is no clear evidence from this systematic review that elective HFOV, as compared with CV, offers important advantages when used as the initial ventilation strategy to treat preterm babies with acute pulmonary dysfunction. There is no evidence of a reduction in death rate. There may be a small reduction in the rate of CLD with HFOV use but the evidence is weakened by the inconsistency of this effect across trials and is not significant overall. Adverse effects on short term neurological outcomes have been observed in some studies but these effects are not significant overall. Information about effects on long term outcome is not adequate overall.\n\n【16】Any future trials on elective HFOV should target those infants who are at most risk of CLD (extremely preterm), compare different strategies for generating HFOV and CV, and report important long term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Economic analysis should also be incorporated.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Lung disorder\n*   Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n*   Low Birth Weight Infant\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Prophylaxis\n*   High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Chronic Lung Disease\n*   Death\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Theoretically this may produce less injury to the lungs and therefor lower the rate of chronic lung disease. This review of the evidence from eleven randomised controlled trials showed variable results between studies and no overall clear benefit or harms resulting from high frequency oscillatory ventilation.\n\n【29】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D) or ultrasound‐guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), _ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases_ (27 February 2015 _)_ and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included six studies. Overall, trials had an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to poor reporting. Two studies did not stratify data for lactational and non‐lactational breast abscesses, and these studies do not contribute to the results. This review is based on data from four studies involving 325 women.\n\n【12】**Needle aspiration (with and without ultrasound guidance) versus incision and drainage (I&D)**\n\n【13】**Mean time (days) to complete resolution of breast abscess** (three studies) ‐ there was substantial heterogeneity among these data (Tau <sup>2 </sup> \\= 47.63, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 97%) and a clear difference between subgroups (with or without ultrasound guidance; Chi <sup>2 </sup> \\= 56.88, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 98.2%, P = < 0.00001). We did not pool these data in a meta‐analysis. Two studies excluded women who had treatment failure when they calculated the mean time to complete resolution. One study found that the time to complete resolution of breast abscess favoured needle aspiration over I&D (mean difference (MD) ‐6.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.81 to ‐4.33; n = 36), but excluded 9/22 (41%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. Another study reported faster resolution in the needle aspiration group (MD ‐17.80; 95% CI ‐21.27 to ‐14.33; n = 64) but excluded 6/35 (17%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. A third study also reported that needle aspiration was associated with a shorter time to complete resolution of breast abscess (MD ‐16.00; 95%CI ‐18.73 to ‐13.27; n = 60); however, the authors did not indicate the number of women who were lost to follow‐up for either group, and it is unclear how many women contributed to this result. Considering the limitations of the available data, we do not consider the results to be informative.\n\n【14】**Continuation of breastfeeding, after treatment (success):** results favoured the needle aspiration group, but we did not pool data from the two studies because of substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 97%). One study reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more likely to continue breastfeeding (risk ratio (RR) 2.89; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.08; n = 60), whereas the other study found no clear difference (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22 n = 70).\n\n【15】**Treatment failure** was more common among women treated with needle aspiration compared to those who underwent I&D (RR 16.12; 95% CI 2.21 to 117.73; two studies, n = 115, _low quality evidence_ ). In one study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 9/22 women who subsequently underwent I&D to treat their breast abscess. In another study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 6/35 women, who subsequently underwent I&D. All abscesses in the I&D group were successfully treated.\n\n【16】The included studies provided limited data for the review's secondary outcomes. No data were reported for **adverse events** . One study (60 women) reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more **satisfied with their treatment** than women who received I&D to treat their breast abscesses.\n\n【17】**Incision and drainage** ( **I&D) with or without antibiotics**\n\n【18】One study (150 women) compared the value of adding a broad‐spectrum cephalosporin (single dose or a course of treatment) to women who underwent I&D for breast abscesses.\n\n【19】The mean **time to resolution of breast abscess** was reported as being similar in all groups (although women with infection were excluded). Mean time to resolution for women who received a course of antibiotics was reported as 7.3 days, 6.9 days for women who received a single dose of antibiotics and 7.4 days for women who did not receive antibiotics. Standard deviations, P values and CIs were not reported and prevented further analysis. No data were reported for **any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success)** . For **treatment failure,** there was no clear difference between the groups of women who received antibiotics (either a single dose or a course of antibiotics) and those who did not (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.76).\n\n【20】Included studies rarely reported this review's secondary outcomes (including adverse events). For **post‐operative complications/morbidity** , there was no difference in the risk of wound infections between the antibiotics and no antibiotics groups (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17), irrespective of whether women received a single dose or a course of antibiotics.\n\n【21】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【22】There is insufficient evidence to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to I&D for lactational breast abscesses, or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. We graded the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment failure as _low quality_ , with downgrading based on including small studies with few events and unclear risk of bias.\n### PICOs\n\n【23】###### Populatio\n\n【24】*   Mother Currently Breast-feeding\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Breast Abscess\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【25】###### Interventio\n\n【26】*   Antibiotics, Gynecological\n*   Incision And Drainage Of Breast Abscess\n*   Needle Aspiration Of Breast\n\n【27】###### Compariso\n\n【28】*   Antibiotics, Gynecological\n*   Incision And Drainage Of Breast Abscess\n*   Needle Aspiration Of Breast\n\n【29】###### Outcom\n\n【30】*   Wound healing\n*   Treatment Failure\n*   Able To Perform Breast-feeding\n\n【31】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【32】### Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women\n\n【33】Some women develop a breast abscess while breastfeeding, called a lactational breast abscess. An abscess is a collection of infected fluid within the breast tissue. The aim of treatment is to cure the abscess quickly and effectively, ensuring maximum benefit to the mother with minimal interruption of breastfeeding.\n\n【34】Presently, lactational breast abscesses are treated by incision and drainage or needle aspiration, with or without diagnostic ultrasound. Antibiotics may or may not be prescribed. For incision and drainage the abscess is cut open with a scalpel (blade) to release the infected fluid. A drain may be inserted into the wound to help the infected fluid drain or may be left open so that the infected fluid drains naturally. A less invasive way to treat the breast abscess is by needle aspiration. A needle is inserted into the cavity of the breast abscess and a syringe is used to draw out the infected fluid, often using ultrasound guidance. As there are advantages in using this method e.g. no scars, reduced hospitalisation etc. the trend is to use this method more often.\n\n【35】We wanted to find evidence on the effectiveness of different treatments. We looked at the time taken for the abscess to heal using the different types of treatments, the number of women who continued to breastfeed after treatment and how many women had healed in the each group after treatment. The definition of healing varied across the studies.\n\n【36】We found six studies, of which four studies with a total of 325 woman contributed data. These studies compared needle aspiration versus incision and drainage. Needle aspiration appeared to decrease the healing time compared to incision and drainage, but large proportions of women were excluded from the analysis and it was therefore difficult to make conclusions. For the outcome continuation of breastfeeding, both of the studies showed that women treated with needle aspiration were more likely to continue breastfeeding compared to incision and drainage. In two studies, breast abscesses did not heal in some women who had needle aspiration and had to be treated with incision and drainage (l _ow quality evidence_ ). All breast abscesses that were treated with incision and drainage healed. We were not able to make any conclusions regarding unwanted effects or complications. Studies did not report sufficiently on the number of follow‐up visits, duration of continuation of breastfeeding, post‐operative complications, duration of hospital stay and adverse events. However, it appeared that women were more satisfied when treated with needle aspiration.\n\n【37】One study compared different regimens of antibiotics versus no antibiotics in breastfeeding women who were treated with incision and drainage for breast abscesses. We did not find any difference between groups for the outcome resolution of breast abscesses and infections after the procedure.\n\n【38】All of the studies were poorly conducted and/or reported and did not address all of the outcomes that we were interested in. Studies with better design and reporting are needed to properly assess these outcomes.\n\n【39】--------------\n\n【40】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【41】### Implications for practice\n\n【42】Current research is insufficient to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to incision and drainage (I&D) for treating lactational breast abscesses or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. It was difficult to determine what the influence of the interventions were on the secondary outcomes due to the absence of data, e.g. duration of continuation of breastfeeding.\n\n【43】### Implications for research\n\n【44】As needle aspiration is a less invasive method compared to I&D, there is a need for a high‐quality, large randomised controlled trial to inform best practice. Future research design would include studies with adequate power (sample size) and rigorous methods. Follow‐up of participants would be all‐encompassing and therefore include duration of feeding and whether women had to supplement breastfeeding as a result of the intervention used, the impact of HIV, maternal morbidity and preferences for the intervention, cost‐analysis _(_ the latter could ideally be considered in future updates of this review if such information becomes available _),_ the number of women who recovered from the intervention and complications in the management of lactational breast abscesses. Consideration would be given to abscess size as there is still uncertainty around what the optimal size would be for ultrasound‐guided needle aspiration to be effective. High‐risk groups would be included in the sample size, e.g. smokers, rural versus urban, younger versus older women and outcomes would be stratified based on these risks.\n\n【45】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【46】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

However, there are many reasons why women stop breastfeeding; one of the most common being the complications of lactation . Of note for this review, Amir 2004 found in a study of women who commenced breastfeeding that 0.4% (5/1183) developed a breast abscess.\n\n【53】#### Mastitis\n\n【54】Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast that is usually associated with lactation and that can progress from the non‐infective stage, to infective mastitis and then to a breast abscess. The incidence of mastitis in lactating women is between 3% to 20% due to variations in the definition and follow‐up in the post partum period . Mastitis is clinically characterised by a tender, hot, swollen, wedge‐shaped area of the breast associated with high temperatures (> 38.5°C ) and flu‐like symptoms. It may or may not be accompanied by an infection . Some of the predisposing factors are limited feeding, poor positioning of the baby, illness of mother or baby, maternal malnutrition and cracked nipples. In infective mastitis, _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ are the commonest causative organisms . Mastitis usually occurs during the first six weeks but can occur at any time during lactation . The primary cause of mastitis is milk stasis . Conservative management includes efficient removal of milk, with the addition of antibiotics for possible bacterial infections . Other measures include supportive care; rest and fluids, application of heat packs and analgesics. Antibiotics are recommended if symptoms have not improved , although a Cochrane systematic review found insufficient evidence, due to a lack of studies, to confirm or refute when to use antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis .\n\n【55】#### Lactational breast abscess\n\n【56】A breast abscess is defined as a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Breast abscesses are usually puerperal (lactational) but can be non‐puerperal . Three per cent of women with mastitis develop a lactational breast abscess .\n\n【57】The most common causative organism is _Staphylococcus aureus_ , although other organisms have been identified . A recent study has suggested that methicillin‐resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is also beginning to play an important role . Risk factors for developing lactational breast abscesses include: women over the age of 30, first pregnancies, gestational age ≥ 41 weeks and mastitis . A breast abscess usually presents as a hard, tender and sometimes fluctuant mass with overlying erythema (redness of the skin) . Diagnosis is usually made using ultrasound when a hypoechoic lesion with an irregular border is present .\n\n【58】Three Cochrane reviews  have illustrated the need for education about breastfeeding during pregnancy and to determine effective treatments for the prevention of mastitis and engorgement, conditions which contribute towards the formation of lactational breast abscesses. For women at risk of developing a lactational breast abscesses, it is therefore necessary to examine existing studies on treatments for lactational breast abscesses, to understand its impact on maternal health, time to recovery and its effect on breastfeeding.\n\n【59】### Description of the intervention\n\n【60】Approaches to treating breast abscesses include incision and drainage (I&D), usually carried out under general anaesthesia and needle aspiration, which may be a single aspiration with a drain left in situ or serial aspirations. Needle aspiration is usually done with a local anaesthetic. Antibiotics are recommended following either a needle aspiration or I&D . Delayed, inappropriate or even inadequate treatment may result in more extensive lesions and permanent tissue damage, which could affect future lactation in about 10% of women. Breast abscesses that require extensive resection can cause disfigurement .\n\n【61】#### Treatments\n\n【62】##### 1\\. Antibiotics\n\n【63】Treatment of lactational breast abscesses with antibiotics, without removal of pus is considered to be ineffective . Following diagnostic or interventional ultrasound or I&D of breast abscesses, breast milk and fluid samples should be sent for culture to detect the presence of bacteria or resistant pathogens . The most commonly found organism in a lactational breast abscess is _Staphylococcus aureus_ with _Steptococcus_ or _Escherichia coli_ being less common. Antibiotics of choice such as dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500mg four times daily orally, or the recommended sensitive local antibiotic may be prescribed. First generation cephalosporins may also be an alternative. Women who may be allergic to penicillin may be prescribed cephalexin or clindamycin. In cases where _Staphylococcus Aureus_ is resistant to penicillinase‐resistant penicillins (methicillin‐resistant _Staphylococcus Aureus_ (MRSA)) is suspected, breast milk culture and assay of antibiotics sensitivities should be undertaken. Most strains of MRSA are sensitive to vancomycin or trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and less so to rifampin. One should presume that MRSA is resistant to treatment with macrolides and quinolones regardless of susceptibility test results \n\n【64】##### 2\\. Surgical\n\n【65】Lactational breast abscesses have traditionally been treated with I&D, but more recently there is a growing tendency to use less invasive procedures. Where possible, all women with a suspected lactational breast abscess should have an ultrasound, which will be helpful in identifying all pockets of fluid. Management may depend on the state of the overlying skin. For skin that appears normal, drainage of the abscess is done by needle aspiration usually with ultrasound . If the skin over the abscess is thin and shiny or the abscess appears as if it will burst, then I&D is recommended .\n\n【66】Incision and drainage is done with local or general anaesthetic. An incision is made to allow for drainage of the infected fluid and if a drain is required a counter incision is then made. Daily washing out of the wound may be required until secretions decrease or are clear. By week four, the wound should be closed and without complications. I&D is recommended when the abscess is large or if there are multiple abscesses. A course of antibiotics is also advised  .\n\n【67】##### 3\\. Needle aspiration\n\n【68】Breast abscesses are also treated with needle aspiration, using a local anaesthetic and under sterile conditions, with or without ultrasound guidance. The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) defines image‐guided percutaneous aspiration as \"evacuation or diagnostic sampling of a fluid collection with the use of a catheter or a needle during a single imaging session, with removal of the catheter or needle immediately after the aspiration\" while image‐guided percutaneous drainage is defined as \"the placement of a catheter with the use of image guidance to provide continuous drainage of a fluid collection\" ( Wallace 2010 , p432). It may be performed during a single session or as a staged procedure during multiple sessions .\n\n【69】The (WHO , supports the use of ultrasound guidance for diagnosis and treatment of lactational breast abscesses. Ulitzsch 2004 has shown that abscesses of less than three cm in diameter can be treated with single aspiration or serial aspirations until resolution. Failure was seen with abscesses greater than five cm in diameter. A probe or a drain is an alternative to using a needle to remove the infected fluid. If the aspirate is viscous, then a saline or antibiotic solution can be used to assist with the aspiration. Daily aspirations are recommended until the wound cannot be punctured anymore (< 4 mm). Serial aspirations are done between two to nine times. A course of antibiotics is usually recommended .\n\n【70】Although needle aspiration is considered as being less invasive, not all lactational breast abscesses have been successfully treated by this method and have subsequently needed I&D . Some of the reasons cited for treatment failure include lack of clinical improvement, recurrence of abscess or formation of fistulas .\n\n【71】##### Breastfeeding\n\n【72】Prior to drainage of the breast abscess, breastfeeding should continue from the unaffected breast. Breastfeeding from the affected breast should resume soon after drainage to prevent stasis of milk and relapse of the infection . Feeding from the affected breast is recommended, even if a drain is in place but care should be taken to ensure that the infant's mouth is not in contact with the infected fluid or breast tissue . Failure to allow breastfeeding lends itself to the production of fluid that is viscous, which aggravates engorgement. Breastfeeding ensures drainage of the affected area and speedy resolution of the abscess . Giess 2014 recommends that breastfeeding can and should continue from the lactating breast with the proviso that the prescribed antibiotics are safe for the infant. This encourages adequate drainage, which facilitates clearing of the infection and limits the bacterial culture medium.\n\n【73】### How the intervention might work\n\n【74】The objective of any of the interventions employed in treating an abscess is to remove the infected fluid as speedily as possible, hastening resolution, thereby reducing the pain and discomfort and allowing the woman to continue breastfeeding her infant with little or no interruption. Maintaining the integrity of the breast is also important, i.e. the procedure should leave the woman complication‐free, with minimal or preferably no scarring, and the function of breastfeeding should be maintained.\n\n【75】Antibiotics and I&D have been viewed as standard therapy in managing lactational breast abscesses. More recently, however, there has been an emergence of studies favouring treatment of lactational abscesses with needle aspiration, which is considered a less invasive technique.\n\n【76】Christensen 2005 favoured the use of ultrasound‐guided drainage of breast abscesses as it caused less scarring, did not affect breastfeeding, did not require anaesthesia or hospitalisation, and was less expensive than surgery. Although I&D has the advantage of breaking down the loculi, if the procedure is carried out under a general anaesthetic, it will also involve hospitalisation and regular dressings. This is thought to cause considerable distress to both mother and baby during what is already a difficult time and the final cosmetic result may be unsatisfactory . Scholefield 1987 expressed a similar view, suggesting that I&D is associated with a prolonged healing time, regular dressings, difficulties in breastfeeding, and the possibility of an unsatisfactory cosmetic outcome. Conversely Jones 1976 and Ajao 1994 found that I&D, curettage and primary closure of the abscess cavity had better scar formation and a reduction of cost of treatment.\n\n【77】Effective management of a lactational breast abscess is necessary to eliminate discomfort and reduce the risk of discontinuation of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is regarded as fundamental to the growth and development of an infant, and it is therefore important that whatever the intervention is, it should not disrupt any momentum gained by the mother with regards to breastfeeding .\n\n【78】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【79】There have been a number of Cochrane reviews addressing questions around prevention and treatment of breastfeeding complications .\n\n【80】Mangesi 2010 examined treatments for breast engorgement during lactation with one of its key outcomes being mastitis and the secondary outcome as breast abscess formation. One study showed that there was a difference in breast abscesses between the group that received acupuncture and those that did not, however, this study was underpowered and the results were not statistically significant.\n\n【81】Lumbiganon 2012 looked at antenatal breastfeeding education in increasing breastfeeding duration. As a secondary outcome, they also listed breastfeeding complications such as mastitis and breast abscesses. The authors reported that compared to formal breastfeeding education plus lactation consultation versus routine breastfeeding, education showed no significant difference in mastitis but a significant reduction in nipple pain. Crepinsek 2012 examined the effect of different interventions for the prevention of mastitis following childbirth. They showed that none of the interventions were effective in preventing mastitis. As appropriate studies were not available at the time the review by Jahanfar 2012 was done, the author was unable to support or deny the role antibiotics played in treating mastitis.\n\n【82】A recently published non‐Cochrane systematic review on the treatment of breast abscesses Lam 2014 included randomised controlled trials, non‐randomised trials as well as case series. Participants had lactational or non‐lactational breast abscesses and one study included men. Although the authors used SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy) to grade the quality of evidence and the recommendations made, it is not clear how judgements about risk of bias were made. The authors recommend the use of needle aspiration with or without the use of ultrasound as first line treatment of breast abscesses. No meta‐analysis was conducted to measure treatment effects.\n\n【83】Lam 2014 does not recommend breastfeeding from the affected breast due to _Staphylococcal_ organisms, which places the infant at risk of pneumonia, lung abscesses and death. This recommendation contradicts other current literature .\n\n【84】Effective interventions for the prevention of engorgement and mastitis are still to be determined. In the absence of these interventions there is an increased likelihood of developing a breast abscess. Currently, there appears to be no consensus on which the best treatment for lactational breast abscess is and to this end there is a need to rigorously synthesise existing research to obtain clarity.\n\n【85】Objectives\n----------\n\n【86】To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.\n\n【87】Methods\n-------\n\n【88】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【89】#### Types of studies\n\n【90】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Trials using cluster‐randomised or cross‐over designs were not eligible for inclusion. As per protocol, quasi‐randomised trials were also excluded as we identified RCTs. Studies only reported as abstracts were not included in the review. Future updates of this review may consider including quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs (due to paucity of data).\n\n【91】#### Types of participants\n\n【92】Breastfeeding women (exclusive breastfeeding or mixed‐feeding) presenting with breast abscesses in one or both breasts. Women with co‐morbidities were included (e.g. HIV, diabetes).\n\n【93】#### Types of interventions\n\n【94】Any intervention, surgical, non‐surgical, pharmacological, non‐pharmacological, invasive, non‐invasive, or a combination of treatments, to treat lactational breast abscesses, compared with any other intervention, surgical, non‐surgical, pharmacological, non‐pharmacological, invasive, non‐invasive, or a combination of treatments, aimed at treating lactational breast abscesses.\n\n【95】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【96】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【97】1.  Time to complete resolution of breast abscess (resolution of abscess was defined as no recurrence of abscess or need for any intervention). Time was defined by the authors as time of presentation for care or from time of hospitalisation.\n\n【98】2.  Any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success).\n\n【99】3.

Diagnostic ultrasound examination may be employed in a variety of specific circumstances during pregnancy such as after clinical complications, or where there are concerns about fetal growth. Because adverse outcomes may also occur in pregnancies without clear risk factors, assumptions have been made that routine ultrasound in all pregnancies will prove beneficial by enabling earlier detection and improved management of pregnancy complications. Routine screening may be planned for early pregnancy, late gestation, or both. The focus of this review is routine early pregnancy ultrasound.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess whether routine early pregnancy ultrasound for fetal assessment (i.e. its use as a screening technique) influences the diagnosis of fetal malformations, multiple pregnancies, the rate of clinical interventions, and the incidence of adverse fetal outcome when compared with the selective use of early pregnancy ultrasound (for specific indications).\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials that compared outcomes in women who experienced routine versus selective early pregnancy ultrasound (i.e. less than 24 weeks' gestation). We have included quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used the Review Manager software to enter and analyse data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Routine/revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound/concealed: 11 trials including 37,505 women. Ultrasound for fetal assessment in early pregnancy reduces the failure to detect multiple pregnancy by 24 weeks' gestation (risk ratio (RR) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.17; participants = 295; studies = 7), _moderate quality of evidence_ ). Routine scans improve the detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks' gestation (RR 3.46, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.14; participants = 387; studies = 2, _moderate quality of evidence_ ). Routine scan is associated with a reduction in inductions of labour for 'post term' pregnancy (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; participants = 25,516; studies = 8), but the evidence related to this outcome is of low quality, because most of the pooled effect was provided by studies with design limitation with presence of heterogeneity (I² = 68%). Ultrasound for fetal assessment in early pregnancy does not impact on perinatal death (defined as stillbirth after trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12; participants = 35,735; studies = 10, _low quality evidence_ ). Routine scans do not seem to be associated with reductions in adverse outcomes for babies or in health service use by mothers and babies. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scan in utero does not indicate that scans have a detrimental effect on children's physical or cognitive development.\n\n【12】The review includes several large, well‐designed trials but lack of blinding was a problem common to all studies and this may have an effect on some outcomes. The quality of evidence was assessed for all review primary outcomes and was judged as moderate or low. Downgrading of evidence was based on including studies with design limitations, imprecision of results and presence of heterogeneity.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Early ultrasound improves the early detection of multiple pregnancies and improved gestational dating may result in fewer inductions for post maturity. Caution needs to be exercised in interpreting the results of aspects of this review in view of the fact that there is considerable variability in both the timing and the number of scans women received.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   First Trimester Pregnancy\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Second Trimester Pregnancy\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Routine Obstetric Scan\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Non Routine Obstetric Scan For Fetal Observations\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Labour Induction\n*   Multiple Pregnancy\n*   Death\n*   Abnormal Fetus\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Routine compared with selective ultrasound in early pregnancy\n\n【25】Ultrasound is an electronic technology that uses the reflection of pulses of high‐frequency sound to produce an image. Ultrasound may be used in a variety of circumstances during pregnancy. It has been assumed that the routine use of ultrasound in early pregnancy will result in the earlier detection of problems and improved management of pregnancy complications when compared with selective use for specific indications such as after clinical complications (e.g. bleeding in early pregnancy), or where there are concerns about fetal growth.\n\n【26】The focus of this review is routine early pregnancy ultrasound (before 24 weeks). We included 11 randomised controlled trials involving 37,505 women. Early ultrasound improved the early detection of multiple pregnancies and improved gestational dating, which may result in fewer inductions for post maturity. The detection of fetal malformation was addressed in detail in only two of the trials. There was no evidence of a significant difference between the screened and control groups for perinatal death. Results do not show that routine scans reduce adverse outcomes for babies or lead to less health service use by mothers and babies. Long‐term follow‐up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate that scans have a detrimental effect on children's physical or intellectual development. Studies were carried out over three decades and technical advances in equipment, more widespread use of ultrasonography, and increased training and expertise of operators may have resulted in more effective sonography.\n\n【27】--------------\n\n【28】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【29】### Implications for practice\n\n【30】Routine early pregnancy ultrasonography has been shown to detect multiple pregnancy earlier ( _moderate quality evidence_ ), and to reduce induction of labour for post‐term pregnancy ( _low quality evidence_ ), both of which could be clinically useful if resources allow.\n\n【31】### Implications for research\n\n【32】1.  Other benefits which could result from better gestational age assessment, e.g. better management of pregnancies complicated by fetal growth retardation, need to be assessed in much larger studies than have been reported so far.\n\n【33】2.  Earlier detection of twin pregnancies has not been translated into an improvement in fetal outcome. The continuing high perinatal mortality rate from multiple pregnancies is a legitimate cause for concern and requires study on a number of fronts; at least, early detection improves the potential for the proper scientific study of other, potentially useful, interventions in multiple pregnancies.\n\n【34】3.  There is a need to look at the value of the detection of fetal abnormalities in terms of important outcomes (perinatal morbidity, mortality, burden of disease and long‐term outcomes) in the context of newer imaging technologies and advancing skill in fetal abnormality detection.\n\n【35】4.  In settings where resources are constrained, the question of the added value of ultrasonography should be revisited in the light of technological advances.\n\n【36】5.  In the developed world, screening for Down's syndrome and fetal abnormality is moving into the first trimester and there is a need to evaluate the optimal timing of ultrasonography for gestational dating, multiple pregnancy detection including chorionicity determination, and fetal abnormality detection. There is also a need to determine whether one or more scans are needed to provide all this information in a way that is cost‐effective and acceptable to women.\n\n【37】6.  There is still some debate about the long‐term outcomes associated with fetal exposure to ultrasound, especially multiple exposures and the use of colour Doppler in the first trimester.\n\n【38】7.  There is a lack of evidence from trials on women's views; although ultrasound is perceived as a largely benign technology and is popular with women and their families, the finding of structural features in the fetus of uncertain significance can cause great upset. In the context of advancing technology, women's views should be explored as part of future evaluations.\n\n【39】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【40】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Because adverse outcomes may also occur in pregnancies without clear risk factors, assumptions have been made that routine ultrasound in all pregnancies will prove beneficial by enabling earlier detection and improved management of pregnancy complications. Routine screening may be planned for early pregnancy, late gestation, or both. The focus of this review is routine early pregnancy ultrasound.\n\n【47】### Description of the intervention\n\n【48】Diagnostic ultrasound is a sophisticated electronic technology that utilises pulses of high‐frequency sound to produce an image. A transducer, which is moved across the area to be examined, emits pulses of ultrasound that propagate through the tissues. Some pulses are reflected back to the transducer, which converts these returning echoes into electronic signals. The strength of the returning echo is determined by tissue interface characteristics. Returning signals are processed by a computer that displays each echo in both strength and position as an image on a screen. The quality of ultrasound imaging is dependent not only on the technical capabilities of the ultrasound equipment, but also on the experience and expertise of the operator; and standards are variable.\n\n【49】Diagnostic ultrasound examination may be employed in a variety of specific circumstances during pregnancy, such as: after clinical complications (e.g. bleeding in early pregnancy); where the fetus is perceived to be at particularly high risk of malformation; and where there are concerns regarding fetal growth. Because adverse outcomes may also occur in pregnancies without clear risk factors, assumptions have been made that the routine use of ultrasound in all pregnancies will prove beneficial. The rationale for such screening would be the detection of clinical conditions that place the fetus or mother at high risk, which would not necessarily have been detected by other means such as clinical examination, and for which subsequent management would improve perinatal outcome. Routine screening examinations may be planned for early pregnancy, late gestation, or both. The focus of this review is routine early pregnancy ultrasound; late pregnancy screening has been addressed in another Cochrane review .\n\n【50】The use of ultrasound to identify women at risk of preterm delivery by assessment of the cervix may be a component of screening before 24 weeks; this is outside the remit of this review and is considered elsewhere .\n\n【51】### How the intervention might work\n\n【52】#### Early Pregnancy complications and serum screening\n\n【53】An ultrasound at the time of antenatal booking may enable non‐viable pregnancies to be detected earlier than is possible using clinical presentation. This has implications for clinical management of these pregnancies. In addition, earlier detection of ectopic pregnancy may be possible allowing for medical rather than surgical management, or 'minimally invasive' rather than open surgery. Between 11% and 42% of gestational age estimations taken from the menstrual history are reported as inaccurate . A reliable estimate of gestational age is required for maternal serum screening for fetal abnormality to be accurately timed . Accurate knowledge of gestational age may increase the efficiency of maternal serum screening and some late pregnancy fetal assessment tests.\n\n【54】#### Multiple Pregnancy\n\n【55】Multiple pregnancies are associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality compared to singleton pregnancies . Determination of chorionicity plays an important role in risk stratification when managing twin pregnancies. Routine early pregnancy scanning in this group may impact on accuracy of assignment of chorionicity in multiple pregnancies, as some studies have shown that this can be done more accurately at earlier gestations . It is also possible that earlier diagnosis of multiple pregnancy will occur with routine early pregnancy scanning, thus preventing inappropriate maternal serum screening .\n\n【56】#### Detection of structural fetal abnormalities\n\n【57】In a systematic review, based on 11 studies (one randomised controlled trial, six retrospective cohorts and four prospective cohorts), undertaken to examine the use of routine second trimester ultrasound to detect fetal anomalies, the overall prevalence of fetal anomaly was 2.09%, ranging from 0.76% to 2.45% in individual studies and including major and minor anomalies . Using late pregnancy ultrasound scanning overall, detection of fetal anomaly was 44.7%, with a range of 15.0% to 85.3% . Optimum timing of such ultrasound scans may be aided by accurate estimation of dates using routine early pregnancy scanning.\n\n【58】#### Timing of delivery\n\n【59】A recent Cochrane review concluded that compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour induction is associated with fewer perinatal deaths . It is possible that routine early pregnancy scanning will improve the accuracy of pregnancy dating and thereby affect the number of pregnancies undergoing induction for post‐maturity. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that ultrasound is very attractive to women and families, studies have also shown that women often lack information about the purposes for which an ultrasound scan is being done and the technical limitations of the procedure . It is therefore essential that women's satisfaction is considered.\n\n【60】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【61】The use of routine pregnancy ultrasound needs to be considered in the context of potential hazards. In theory, some ultrasonic energy propagated through tissue is converted to heat, and in laboratory experiments, biological effects of ultrasound have been observed. However, these effects have been produced using continuous wave ultrasound with long 'dwell' time (time insonating one area) and high‐power output. In the clinical setting, diagnostic ultrasound uses pulsed waves (short pulses of sound propagation), and most modern machines are designed so that safe power output limits cannot be exceeded. Operators are always advised to apply the ALARA (as low as reasonably attainable) principle to the ultrasound power output used , and to ensure time taken for an examination, including the 'dwell' time over a specific target, is kept to a minimum. One of the aims of this review is to assess available data and determine whether clear epidemiological evidence exists from clinical trials that ultrasound examination during pregnancy is harmful.\n\n【62】Objectives\n----------\n\n【63】To assess whether routine early pregnancy ultrasound for fetal assessment (i.e. its use as a screening technique) influences the diagnosis of fetal malformations, multiple pregnancies, the rate of clinical interventions, and the incidence of adverse fetal outcome when compared with the selective use of early pregnancy ultrasound (for specific indications).\n\n【64】Methods\n-------\n\n【65】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【66】#### Types of studies\n\n【67】All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in women who experienced routine early pregnancy ultrasound with outcomes in women who experienced the selective use of early pregnancy ultrasound. We included quasi‐randomised controlled trials. Cluster‐randomised trials were also eligible for inclusion.\n\n【68】We planned to include trials reported as abstracts provided that they contained sufficient information for us to assess eligibility and risk of bias, and that results were described in sufficient detail.

Non‐opioid drugs are commonly used to treat mild to moderate cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the WHO cancer pain treatment ladder, either alone or in combination with opioids.\n\n【2】A previous Cochrane review that examined the evidence for nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol, alone or combined with opioids, for cancer pain was withdrawn in 2015 because it was out of date; the date of the last search was 2005. This review, and another on NSAIDs, updates the evidence.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To assess the efficacy of oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain in adults and children, and the adverse events reported during its use in clinical trials.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to March 2017, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two online study registries.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We included randomised, double‐blind, studies of five days' duration or longer, comparing paracetamol alone with placebo, or paracetamol in combination with an opioid compared with the same dose of the opioid alone, for cancer pain of any intensity. Single‐blind and open studies were also eligible for inclusion. The minimum study size was 25 participants per treatment arm at the initial randomisation.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality and potential bias. We did not carry out any pooled analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Three studies in adults satisfied the inclusion criteria, lasting up to one week; 122 participants were randomised initially, and 95 completed treatment. We found no studies in children. One study was parallel‐group, and two had a cross‐over design. All used paracetamol as an add‐on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily morphine equivalent doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine equivalents daily). Other non‐paracetamol medication included non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, or neuroleptics. All studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias.\n\n【13】None of the studies reported any of our primary outcomes: participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with pain no worse than mild at the end of the treatment period; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording). What pain reports there were indicated no difference between paracetamol and placebo when added to another treatment. There was no convincing evidence of paracetamol being different from placebo with regards to quality of life, use of rescue medication, or participant satisfaction or preference. Measures of harm (serious adverse events, other adverse events, and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy) were inconsistently reported and provided no clear evidence of difference.\n\n【14】Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, because studies were at high risk of bias from several sources.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There is no high‐quality evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for the first two steps of the three‐step WHO cancer pain ladder. It is not clear whether any additional analgesic benefit of paracetamol could be detected in the available studies, in view of the doses of opioids used.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Cancer Pain\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Paracetamol\n*   Opioids\n*   Oral\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Opioids\n*   Placebo\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Drug Therapy\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Patient Global Impression of Improvement\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Mild Pain\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【26】### Paracetamol for cancer pain\n\n【27】**Bottom line**\n\n【28】There is no evidence to show that paracetamol is useful in treating people with cancer pain, either alone or combined with a morphine‐like drug. Nor is there evidence to disprove that it is useful. There are no good studies evaluating paracetamol for management of cancer pain.\n\n【29】**Background**\n\n【30】One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. In 1986, the World Health Organization recommended taking morphine‐like drugs (opioids) for moderate to severe pain from cancer, and non‐opioid drugs like paracetamol, alone for mild to moderate pain, or alongside opioids in people with moderate to severe pain.\n\n【31】**Study characteristics**\n\n【32】In this review we set out to examine all the evidence on how well paracetamol (alone or with morphine‐like drugs) worked in adults and children with cancer pain. We also wanted to know how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were, for example, whether they caused people to stop taking their medicines.\n\n【33】In March 2017, we found three studies with 122 participants. All compared paracetamol plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. The studies were small, and were of poor quality. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were not reported.\n\n【34】**Key findings**\n\n【35】We found no evidence that taking paracetamol alone made any difference to the level of pain experienced. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol together with a morphine‐like drug was better than the morphine‐like drug alone. Paracetamol did not appear to improve quality of life. No conclusions could be reached about side effects. The amount of information and the differences in how studies were reported meant that no conclusions could be made.\n\n【36】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【37】The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of paracetamol for treating cancer pain. We do not know whether using paracetamol alone, or in combination with an opioid such as codeine or morphine, is worthwhile.\n\n【38】--------------\n\n【39】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【40】### Implications for practice\n\n【41】##### For people with cancer pain\n\n【42】The amount and quality of evidence around the use of paracetamol for treating cancer pain is low. The small amount of evidence we have does not indicate that it has any pain‐relieving effects or makes any improvement to quality of life. No judgement can be made about adverse events or withdrawals.\n\n【43】##### For clinicians\n\n【44】There is no evidence for paracetamol alone. The evidence we have is from add‐on studies with oral morphine doses of 60 mg daily or above, when any additional analgesic effect of oral paracetamol would be difficult to detect. It may be possible to reduce the drug burden for people with cancer pain taking such large amounts of oral morphine equivalents, but we have no evidence that this is the case.\n\n【45】The amount and quality of evidence around the use of paracetamol for treating cancer pain is low. There is no evidence supporting or refuting the use of paracetamol on the first and second steps of the WHO ladder. The small amount of evidence we have for the use of paracetamol combined with opioids does not indicate that it has any additional pain‐relieving effects or makes any improvement to quality of life. No judgement can be made about adverse events or withdrawals.\n\n【46】##### For policy makers\n\n【47】The amount and quality of evidence around the use of paracetamol for treating cancer pain is low. There is no evidence supporting or refuting the use of paracetamol on the first step of the WHO ladder. The small amount of evidence we have for the use of paracetamol combined with strong opioids does not indicate that it has any additional pain‐relieving effects or makes any improvement to quality of life. No judgement can be made about adverse events or withdrawals.\n\n【48】##### For funders\n\n【49】The amount and quality of evidence around the use of paracetamol for treating cancer pain is low. There is no evidence supporting or refuting the use of paracetamol on the first step of the WHO ladder. The small amount of evidence we have for the use of paracetamol combined with strong opioids does not indicate that it has any additional pain‐relieving effects or makes any improvement to quality of life. No judgement can be made about adverse events or withdrawals.\n\n【50】### Implications for research\n\n【51】##### General\n\n【52】This review on paracetamol for cancer pain reveals major problems with the evidence available. The WHO pain ladder is now over 30 years old, and remains probably the most‐used and best‐understood pain guidance worldwide. Despite its obvious importance there are few studies that clearly demonstrate how best to perform a study on the lower two steps, which relate to the treatment of mild and moderate pain with non‐opoid drugs like paracetamol, alone or in combination with weak opioids. As best we know there are no ongoing studies examining the use of paracetamol alone for mild to moderate pain for the first step of the WHO ladder. We know of one ongoing study examining paracetamol plus opioid for the second or third step of the ladder. In this study, participants with moderate to severe pain (3/10 to 9/10) who are taking daily opioid plus 4 x 1000 mg paracetamol are randomised to continued treatment with the combination or the opioid alone.\n\n【53】##### Design\n\n【54】Several methodological issues stand out.\n\n【55】The first is the use of outcomes of value to people with cancer pain. Existing trials are designed more for purposes of registration and marketing than informing and improving clinical practice, often because the outcomes chosen are average pain scores, or statistical differences, and rarely how many individuals achieve satisfactory pain relief. In the situation where initial pain is mild or moderate, some consideration needs to be given to what constitutes a satisfactory outcome. The situation is somewhat different to that of strong opioids in cancer pain that are used for moderate to severe pain.\n\n【56】The second is the time taken to achieve good pain relief. We have no information about what constitutes a reasonable time to achieve a satisfactory result. Initially, this may best be approached with a Delphi methodology.\n\n【57】The third is design. Studies with cross‐over design often have significant attrition. Parallel group designs may be preferable, and while this is a matter of debate , considerable thinking has already gone into study design.\n\n【58】The fourth is size. The studies were small, and, combined with cross‐over design and consequent attrition, ended up reporting on very few participants. Much larger studies of several hundred participants or more are needed.\n\n【59】The fifth is the dose of opioid allowable in add‐on studies to test the analgesic efficacy or effectiveness of oral paracetamol. In the circumstance of high oral opioid doses, additional benefit is unlikely to be measurable, and some upper limit of opioid dose may be needed.\n\n【60】The sixth is that in the current era of precision medicine investigator may have an opportunity to conduct clinical trials involving specific aetiologies of cancer pain, or accrue sufficient numbers of participants to conduct well‐powered subgroup analyses.\n\n【61】There are some other design issues that might be addressed. Most important might be a clear decision concerning the gold‐standard treatment comparator. Placebo‐controlled studies in cancer pain are unlikely to be ethically feasible . It may be that low‐dose oral morphine is a suitable comparator, as a suggested alternative treatment for mild to moderate pain .\n\n【62】##### Measurement (endpoints)\n\n【63】Trials need to consider the additional endpoints of no worse than mild pain and the impact of morphine on symptoms that raise serious concerns such as consciousness, appetite, and thirst, outcomes identified previously as important . The choice of measures to be used in cancer pain studies is not necessarily straightforward.\n\n【64】##### Other\n\n【65】Prospective randomised trials are the obvious design of choice, but other pragmatic designs may be worth considering. Studies could incorporate initial randomisation but a pragmatic design in order to provide immediately‐relevant information on effectiveness and costs. Such designs in pain conditions have been published .\n\n【66】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【67】Summary of findings for the main comparison.\n\n| **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  | **Paracetamol plus opioid compared with the same dose of opioid alone for cancer pain**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  | **Patient or population:** people with cancer pain **Settings:** inpatient or outpatient **Intervention:** paracetamol plus opioid **Comparison:** same dose of opioid alone  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Probable outcome withopioid + paracetamol**  | **Probable outcome withopioid alone**  | **RR(95% CI)**  | **No of studies, participants**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| Participants with at least 30% or at least 50% reduction in pain  | No data  | No data  | N/A  |  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| PGIC much or very much improved  | No data  | No data  | N/A  |  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Mean pain intensity at end of study  | No difference between treatment groups  | No difference between treatment groups  |  | 3 studies, 93 participants  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Pain no worse than mild at one or two weeks (or equivalent)  | No data  | No data  | N/A  |  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Mean quality of life or \"well‐being\"  | No difference between treatment groups  | No difference between treatment groups  | N/A  | 3 studies, 93 participants  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Participant preference  | Better: 15/52  | Better: 9/52 (No different: 28/52)  | Not calculated  | 2 studies, 52 participants  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Adverse events  | No difference between groups for specific opioid‐related adverse events  | No difference between groups for specific opioid‐related adverse events  | N/A  | 2 studies, 80 participants (maximum)  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| Serious adverse events  | None specifically reported. 1 death due to underlying disease ‐ treatment unclear  | None specifically reported. 1 death due to underlying disease ‐ treatment unclear  | N/A  | 3 studies, 93 participants  | Very low  | Very low quality because no or inadequate data  |\n| **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  | **CI:** Confidence interval; **RR:** Risk Ratio  |\n| Descriptors for levels of evidence :**High quality:** This research provides a very good indication of the likely effect.

Another review will examine oral NSAIDs in adults . A separate review will examine the efficacy of NSAIDs for cancer pain in children .\n\n【72】### Description of the condition\n\n【73】Cancer is estimated to cause over eight million deaths per annum ‐ approximately 13% of deaths worldwide . Globally, 32 million people are living with cancer, and detailed information for individual countries is available on the WHO website for the International Agency for Research on Cancer . In the UK alone in 2014, there were around 350,000 new cases of cancer annually, with around 50% of people surviving for 10 years or more after diagnosis .\n\n【74】Cancer pain is perhaps one of the most feared symptoms associated with the disease. Pain may be the first symptom to cause someone to seek medical advice that leads to a diagnosis of cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain . Pain can occur at any time as the disease progresses, but the frequency and intensity of pain tends to increase as the cancer advances . For people with advanced cancer, some 75% to 90% will experience pain having a major impact on daily living . Pain had a significant negative correlation with quality of life in people with cancer in China, Japan, and Palestine, for example . A recent systematic review has shown that approximately 40% of patients suffered pain after curative treatment, 55% during cancer treatment and 66% in advanced disease. Pain related to cancer is frequently described as distressing or intolerable by more than one‐third of patients .\n\n【75】Cancer pain can be the result of the cancer itself, interventions to treat the cancer, and sometimes other underlying pains. Cancer‐related pain is a mosaic of different types of pain generated through different mechanisms. The biology of pain from bone metastasis may well differ from pain due to obstruction of a viscus (internal organ) or invasion of soft tissue, resulting in differences in responsiveness to analgesics that act via different mechanisms. Prevalence of pain is also linked to cancer type, with head and neck cancer showing the highest prevalence. Age also has an impact, with younger patients experiencing more pain . For this review, we will not consider postsurgical pain or specific neuropathic pain conditions.\n\n【76】The current World Health Organization (WHO) cancer pain ladder for adults recommends the use of non‐opioid analgesics, including paracetamol, as the first step on the ladder, with or without an adjuvant . Non‐opioid analgesics are also to be used on the second and third steps, together with weak or strong opioids. The current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK advises that non‐opioid analgesics alone be used for treating mild pain (0 to 3 on a 0 to 10 pain scale), together with a weak opioid such as codeine or tramadol for mild to moderate pain (3 to 6), and with a strong opioid such as morphine for severe pain (6 to 10) . Some authorities have suggested that the second step on the ladder could be removed, and replaced with low doses of strong opioids such as morphine .\n\n【77】Children with cancer consider pain as the most prevalent symptom, usually resulting from treatment side effects or painful procedures . The amount and quality of research on pharmacological treatments for children tends to be poor .\n\n【78】### Description of the intervention\n\n【79】Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is available in a very large number of formulations and products with different names, including Panadol and Tylenol. Paracetamol plus codeine often comes with the generic name co‐codamol, and paracetamol plus dihydrocodeine as co‐dydramol. A listing of brand names by country is available but the list is too long to be given here . Worldwide paracetamol use is measured in thousands of tonnes annually, and questions have been asked about the benefits and risk of such extensive use .\n\n【80】Paracetamol was first identified as the active metabolite of two older antipyretic drugs, acetanilide and phenacetin, in the late nineteenth century . Since then, it has become one of the most popular antipyretic and analgesic drugs worldwide, and is often also used in combination with other drugs. It became available in the UK on prescription in 1956, and without prescription (over‐the‐counter) in 1963 . Nonprescription medications are less expensive, more accessible, and have favourable safety profiles relative to many prescription treatments. There have been calls for the position of paracetamol as a widely‐available analgesic to be re‐evaluated, based on an assessment of evidence over the past 130 years .\n\n【81】Despite a low incidence of adverse effects, paracetamol has a recognised potential for hepatotoxicity and is thought to be responsible for approximately half of all cases of liver failure in the UK , and about 40% in the USA . One study, evaluating all cases of acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT) across seven European countries for a three‐year period, showed that paracetamol overdose was responsible for one‐sixth of cases of ALFT, though this varied considerably between each country . Acute paracetamol hepatotoxicity at therapeutic doses has been judged to be extremely unlikely, despite reports of so‐called 'therapeutic misadventure' . However, it has been observed that non‐overdose ALFT is more likely to follow therapeutic‐dose paracetamol exposure than similar NSAID exposure . Legislative changes have been introduced in the UK to restrict pack sizes and the maximum number of tablets permitted in nonprescription sales , on the basis of evidence that poisoning is lower in countries that restrict availability . The contribution of these changes, which were inconvenient and costly (particularly to people with chronic pain), to any observed reductions in incidence of liver failure or death, remains uncertain . Changes have also been made in the USA, and professionals have been advised not to dispense prescription combination drugs with more than 325 mg paracetamol .\n\n【82】There is a substantial public health impact of paracetamol toxicity. In the USA, incidence proportions peaked at age two years and ages 16 to 18 years . There have been concerns over the safety of paracetamol in people with compromised hepatic function (people with severe alcoholism, cirrhosis, or hepatitis), but these have not been substantiated .\n\n【83】The use of paracetamol during pregnancy has been questioned following reports that it is linked to behavioural problems and hyperkinetic disorders in children whose mothers took it during pregnancy , and suggestions that it can interfere with sex hormones .\n\n【84】In an analysis of single‐dose studies in migraine, there was no evidence that adverse events were more common with paracetamol 1000 mg than with placebo, and no serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone .\n\n【85】Oral paracetamol has long been used as a first‐line analgesic for a variety of acute and chronic conditions. It has modest efficacy in acute pain and migraine , but some randomised trials, systematic reviews, and meta‐analyses have suggested that there is no good evidence for a clinically relevant benefit of paracetamol (as monotherapy) in many chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis and back pain . There are few or no data for a range of other common painful conditions, including dysmenorrhoea and chronic neck pain. Moreover, accumulating evidence from observational studies indicates a considerable degree of paracetamol toxicity, especially at the upper end of standard analgesic doses .\n\n【86】### How the intervention might work\n\n【87】The lack of significant anti‐inflammatory activity of paracetamol implies a mode of action distinct from that of NSAIDs; yet, despite years of use and research, the mechanisms of action of paracetamol are not fully understood. NSAIDs act by inhibiting the activity of cyclo‐oxygenase (COX), now recognised to consist of two isoforms (COX‐1 and COX‐2), which catalyse the production of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. Paracetamol has previously been shown to have no significant effects on COX‐1 or COX‐2 , but is now being considered as a selective COX‐2 inhibitor . Significant paracetamol‐induced inhibition of prostaglandin production has been demonstrated in tissues in the brain, spleen, and lung . A 'COX‐3 hypothesis', wherein the efficacy of paracetamol is attributed to its specific inhibition of a third COX isoform enzyme, COX‐3 , now has little credibility, and a central mode action of paracetamol is thought to be likely . Paracetamol metabolism is subject to genetic variation .\n\n【88】There is some experimental research in rats to suggest that paracetamol may have an effect in neuropathic pain via cannabinoid receptors . One single case report suggested intravenous paracetamol was effective for phantom limb pain .\n\n【89】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【90】A previous Cochrane review examined the evidence for NSAIDs or paracetamol, alone or combined with opioids, for cancer pain , with the last search date in 2005. There have been few subsequent systematic reviews of the evidence. Nabal found little evidence of efficacy for combinations with opioids . A review of paracetamol and NSAIDs concluded that while the role of these non‐opioid drugs remains controversial, the evidence for paracetamol alone was limited .\n\n【91】The evidence of effectiveness of the WHO pain ladder for cancer has been examined several times in the past two decades. These studies reported varying degrees of success, typically between 20% and 100% of people with cancer pain achieving good relief , with some suggesting that as many as 50% of people with cancer pain are undertreated .\n\n【92】In many countries, opioids are severely restricted, if available at all. This means that many people with cancer will have considerable pain and suffering unless non‐opioid analgesics can be used. This review was designed with the intention of informing policy makers such as the WHO on the possible utility of paracetamol to treat cancer‐related pain. It is hoped that the review will inform patients and carers on the value or otherwise of paracetamol in this context.\n\n【93】Other relevant Cochrane reviews include an assessment of codeine alone and with paracetamol , and an evaluation of tramadol alone and with paracetamol . For our purposes we wanted to assess any additional efficacy of paracetamol by comparing paracetamol plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone, a different question to that addressed by those reviews. A number of other reviews have evaluated the evidence for opioids, including buprenorphine , transdermal fentanyl , hydromorphone , morphine , oxycodone , and tapentadol .\n\n【94】The standards used to assess evidence in pain trials have changed substantially in recent years, with particular attention being paid to trial duration, withdrawals, and statistical imputation following withdrawal, all of which can substantially alter estimates of efficacy . The most important change is the move away from using mean pain scores, or mean change in pain scores, to the number of people who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%) . Pain intensity reduction of 50% or more correlates with improvements in comorbid symptoms, function, and quality of life generally . These standards are set out in the PaPaS author and referee guidance for pain studies of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group .\n\n【95】Three additional issues potentially affect how evidence is evaluated.\n\n【96】The first issue is study size and the overall amount of information available for analysis. There are issues over both random chance effects with small amounts of data, and potential bias in small studies, especially in pain . Cochrane reviews have been criticised for perhaps overemphasising results of underpowered studies or analyses . On the other hand, it may be unethical to ignore potentially important information from small studies or to randomise more participants if a meta‐analysis including small, existing studies provided conclusive evidence. In this review, we have therefore chosen to limit analyses to studies with a minimum of 25 participants randomised per treatment group, which we believe has not been done previously.\n\n【97】The second issue is that of study duration. Previous reviews have examined studies of any duration, even in some cases single‐dose studies, or studies lasting one day or less, often with intravenous or intramuscular formulations . While short term studies and non‐oral formulations may have some relevance in some circumstances, they have little relevance to the vast majority of people with cancer pain who will be treated with oral paracetamol over weeks, months, or even years. We have therefore chosen to include only studies with five days' duration or longer.\n\n【98】The third issue is that of comparators. Many cancer pain studies involve direct comparisons of one or more formulations of the same drug, as particularly noted for oral morphine . This type of design has limited importance in evaluating the analgesic contribution of a drug, if that is not already well‐established . For that reason, we have limited this review to the two comparators that speak to the efficacy of paracetamol in cancer pain, namely the comparison of paracetamol versus placebo, and paracetamol plus opioid versus the same dose of opioid alone. The latter comparison would be similar to methods used for determining dose‐response of analgesics in acute pain , or caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant in acute pain .\n\n【99】Objectives\n----------\n\n【100】To assess the efficacy of oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain in adults and children, and the adverse events reported during its use in clinical trials.\n\n【101】Methods\n-------\n\n【102】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【103】#### Types of studies\n\n【104】To be included, studies had to:\n\n【105】*   be randomised (described as 'randomised' anywhere in the manuscript);\n\n【106】*   ideally be double‐blind, but we would have included single‐blind or open studies because we expected there to be a limited literature on this important topic, and we desired to be as inclusive as possible;\n\n【107】*   include a minimum of 25 participants randomised per treatment arm; for cross‐over studies this meant a minimum of 25 participants at the initial randomisation.\n\n【108】*   have a study duration of at least five days of continuous treatment, with outcomes reported at the end of that period.\n\n【109】We excluded non‐randomised studies, studies of experimental pain, case reports and clinical observations. Studies had to be fully published or available as extended abstracts (e.g. from clinical trial websites); we excluded short (usually conference) abstracts as these are often unreliable .\n\n【110】#### Types of participants\n\n【111】We included studies of adults with cancer pain of any intensity. We did not find any eligible studies in children. We did not consider postsurgical pain or specific neuropathic pain conditions.\n\n【112】#### Types of interventions\n\n【113】Orally administered paracetamol for cancer pain, where paracetamol alone was compared with placebo, or where paracetamol was combined with an opioid and compared with the same dose of opioid alone.\n\n【114】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【115】Pain had to be measured using a validated assessment tool. For pain intensity, for example, this could be a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) or 11‐point numerical rating scale (no pain to worst pain imaginable), or a four‐point categorical scale (none, mild, moderate, severe), and for pain relief, for example, this could be a 100 mm VAS (no relief to complete relief), or five‐point categorical scale (none, a little, some, a lot, complete or words to that effect). Measures of 30% or greater (moderate) and 50% or greater (substantial) reduction of pain over baseline are recommended outcomes for chronic pain studies from the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) .\n\n【116】A 30% or greater reduction of pain from baseline corresponds to much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and 50% or greater reduction corresponds to very much or completely improved. We would also use results equivalent to no pain or mild pain, because these are also outcomes acceptable to people with various types of pain .\n\n【117】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【118】*   Number of participants with pain reduction of 50% or greater from baseline.\n\n【119】*   Number of participants with pain reduction of 30% or greater from baseline.\n\n【120】*   Number of participants with pain no worse than mild .\n\n【121】*   Number of participants with PGIC much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording).\n\n【122】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【123】*   Quality of life.\n\n【124】*   Use of rescue medication.\n\n【125】*   Participant satisfaction or preference.\n\n【126】*   Serious adverse events, including death.\n\n【127】*   Other adverse events, particularly reports of effects of treatment on somnolence, appetite, or thirst .\n\n【128】*   Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events, or any cause.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Nursing record systems may be an effective way of influencing nurse practice.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of nursing record systems on nursing practice and patient outcomes.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】For the original version of this review in 2000, and updates in 2003 and 2008, we searched: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, BNI, ISI Web of Knowledge, and ASLIB Index of Theses. We also handsearched: Computers, Informatics, Nursing (Computers in Nursing); Information Technology in Nursing; and the Journal of Nursing Administration. For this update, searches can be considered complete until the end of 2007. We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and other related reviews.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series comparing one kind of nursing record system with another in hospital, community or primary care settings. The participants were qualified nurses, students or healthcare assistants working under the direction of a qualified nurse, and patients receiving care recorded or planned using nursing record systems.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors (in two pairs) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included nine trials (eight RCTs, one controlled before and after study) involving 1846 people. The studies that evaluated nursing record systems focusing on relatively discrete and focused problems, for example effective pain management in children, empowering pregnant women and parents, reducing loss of notes, reducing time spent on data entry of test results, reducing transcription errors, and reducing the number of pieces of paper in a record, all demonstrated some degree of success in achieving the desired results. Studies of nursing care planning systems and total nurse records demonstrated uncertain or equivocal results.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】We found some limited evidence of effects on practice attributable to changes in record systems. It is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi‐experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice. Qualitative nursing research to explore the relationship between practice and information use could be used as a precursor to the design and testing of nursing information systems.\n\n【14】### Nursing record systems to improve nursing practice and health care\n\n【15】When patients are in hospital or sick at home and visited by a nurse, it is important that the care they receive is recorded properly.  Nurses record a wide variety of information about a patient’s care and progress.  For example, nurses would record a patient’s status while in ICU every hour, or when and how pain medication should be given and when it was given, or the progress of a pregnant  woman visiting a clinic.  These nursing records are a way for nurses to share care information with other nurses, other health care professionals and sometimes with patients.  This is Information that can ensure patient care is consistent when staff changes shifts or information that can be used later as a history of previous care.\n\n【16】But what is the best way to record and share this information? Is there a system or way of recording care information that is best?  It has been suggested that there may be a difference in how nurses practice or how well a patient does with the use of one record system compared to another.\n\n【17】A review of the effect of different nursing record systems was conducted.  After searching for all relevant studies, 9 studies were found.  These studies compared nursing records filled out on paper with nursing records done on computer; nursing records that were held by patients themselves to records kept at a hospital or clinic; and nursing records which used different types of forms.\n\n【18】The evidence shows that nursing record systems which aim to fix a specific problem, such as reducing lost notes, decreasing the time required for data entry, or the amount of paper files, may be successful at fixing that problem.  But it is uncertain whether changing an entire system of recording nursing care may improve how nurses practice or how well a patient does.\n\n【19】What this review did show, is that there needs to be more work with the nursing professions to understand exactly what needs to be recorded and how it will be used, and that it is important to involve the nursing staff in the design and development of the nursing record systems.\n\n【20】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of locomotor training on the improvement in walking for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】A traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a lesion of neural elements of the spinal cord, resulting in any degree of sensory and motor deficit, autonomic and bowel dysfunction. There is an annual incidence of traumatic SCI in the industrial nations of approximately 15 to 40 cases per million population . The extent of disability resulting from SCI varies greatly depending on the severity of the injury, the segment of the spinal cord at which the injury occurs, and which nerve fibres are damaged . The neurological deficit or dysfunction can be temporary or permanent and may be complete or incomplete . Over 50% of people with SCI have incomplete motor lesions and most motor recovery occurs within the first two months of inpatient rehabilitation after the injury .\n\n【6】The American Spinal Injury Association's (ASIA) International Classification of Spinal Cord Injury is often used as a measure of recovery as well as for describing the neurological level and completeness of injury . SCI is classified as follows.\n\n【7】*   A: complete, no sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S4 to S5.\n\n【8】*   B: incomplete, sensory but not motor function is preserved below the neurological level and includes the sacral segments S4 to S5.\n\n【9】*   C: Incomplete, motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and more than half of the key muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade less than 3.\n\n【10】*   D: Incomplete, motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and at least half of the key muscles below the neurological have a muscle grade greater than or equal to 3.\n\n【11】*   E: Normal, sensory and motor function is normal.\n\n【12】A significant proportion of patients improve one grade on the AIS (ASIA Impairment Scale) in the first few months post‐injury, particularly those initially assessed AIS grades B and C . One of the primary goals for people with SCI is improvement of locomotor function . The prognosis for ambulation after SCI depends on the type of syndrome and on the lesion. Based on neurological assessment at the first week after injury, 80% to 90% of complete lesions (ASIA = A) remain complete . For patients with sensory‐incomplete lesions (ASIA = B) with preserved sacral pin sensation, often more than 50% will became ambulatory, and for patients with motor‐incomplete lesions (ASIA = C), 75% will recover community ambulation .\n\n【13】Although there is common consensus that inpatient rehabilitation programs soon after SCI may improve locomotor function, approximately 25% of people with initially incomplete SCI do not become independent ambulators .\n\n【14】The rehabilitation of persons with SCI should involve multiple health professions, be initiated in the acute phase, and be continued with specialised inpatient services. Inpatient rehabilitation after SCI incorporates different therapeutic approaches. One of the most important rehabilitation approaches, especially for regaining locomotor function, is physiotherapy. The main limitations on over‐ground locomotion ability for patients with spinal injury are reduced coordination, leg paresis, and impaired balance . Physiotherapists work on this and provide support in standing (for example, through use of braces and tilt tables). If leg strength improves, the therapist may employ braces, parallel bars, or other walking aids to work on balance and weight bearing.\n\n【15】Many studies have suggested that locomotion after SCI may improve due to mechanisms of neuroplasticity . These mechanisms are commonly thought to be influenced by sensorimotor training, for example, during physiotherapy sessions .\n\n【16】Although compensation‐based strategies (such as brace walking) may facilitate walking, such strategies do not contribute to the recovery of walking ability as was known pre‐injury. For example, a patient who walks with braces will probably not be able to walk if the braces are removed. To facilitate and enhance the recovery of locomotor function, new therapeutic strategies and treatment options have been developed and introduced in recent years for locomotor rehabilitation of people with motor incomplete spinal cord injury. Such specific locomotor treatment options combine massed, repetitive practice of complex gait cycles during treadmill‐based training with partial body‐weight support (BWS), body‐weight support systems with manual trainers or robotics . These treatments are built upon an entirely different premise and aim to achieve restoration and recovery of walking using the intrinsic capacities of the nervous system. The aim is for the skills to persist once the person leaves the training environment. Historically, clinicians have compensated for post‐SCI deficits to achieve mobility (that is, providing wheeled mobility, bracewalking, reciprocating gait orthosis) instead of tapping into the nervous system's own capabilities to restore itself.\n\n【17】Despite early reports of very promising results , the evidence for the effectiveness of treadmill‐based training is still mostly restricted to case reports  and cohort studies .\n\n【18】In recent years, in addition to treadmill‐based training, more sophisticated automated electromechanical gait machines have been developed. These consist of either a robot‐driven exoskeleton orthosis  or an electromechanically with two driven foot plates simulating the phases of gait . Evidence for these new locomotor treatment options is also still limited to case reports and single cohort studies.\n\n【19】There has been no previous systematic evaluation concerning the effectiveness of approaches to regain walking function after SCI. Therefore, a systematic review of the evidence is required to assess the effects and acceptability of locomotor training (defined as the repetitive practice of complex gait cycles, for example, treadmill‐based walking) after SCI.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To assess the effects of locomotor training on the improvement in walking for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and randomised controlled cross‐over trials. If randomised controlled cross‐over trials are identified, we will analyse only the first period (pre‐crossover) as a parallel group trial.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】Participants of any gender and any age with a traumatic spinal cord injury will be eligible.\n\n【28】We will include persons with any level of traumatic incomplete lesions, with an ASIA Impairment of B, C, or D, regardless of the duration of illness (acute or chronic SCI) or level of initial walking ability. RCTs involving participants with mixed causes of SCI (for example, traumatic and non‐traumatic) will only be included if 50% or more are traumatic SCI patients.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We will include all trials that compare locomotor training (over‐ground gait training, hybrid strategies using BWS, and functional electrical stimulation) to any other exercise with the goal of improving walking function after SCI or to a no‐treatment control group.\n\n【31】In light of ongoing developments with automated electromechanical devices or robots, we will include newly‐developed devices for locomotor training after SCI.\n\n【32】We will also include studies comparing different forms of locomotor training.  \n\n【33】We will exclude trials of specific treatment components, such as electrical stimulation as stand‐alone treatment and continuous passive motion treatment.\n\n【34】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【35】**_Primary outcomes_**\n\n【36】*   Speed of walking ‐ measured by 10‐meter or 15‐meter walking speed (fastest or casual walking speed ) or any other scale.

A walking capacity of 0 meters will be allocated to people who cannot walk independently.\n\n【38】**_Secondary outcomes_**\n\n【39】*   Level of independence in walking ‐ measured by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)  (people scoring five or less on the walking item would be classified as dependent walkers); Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM)  (people scoring three or less on the items 12 to 14 of the SCIM would be classified as dependent walkers); or Walking Index for Spinal Cord Index (WISCI or WISCI II)  (total scores of the WISCI II will be used as a continuous outcome for dependency in walking); or any other standardised instrument.\n\n【40】*   Safety of exercises ‐ determined with the incidence of adverse effects during the study period, such as thrombosis, major cardiovascular events, injuries (for example, injurious falls or other injuries), pain, and any other reported adverse events.\n\n【41】*   Rate of drop‐outs or withdrawals, for any reason, during the study period will be used as an indicator of the acceptance of locomotor training.\n\n【42】We will undertake separate analyses in respect to the timing of outcome assessment (at the end of the training period and after a follow‐up period).\n\n【43】Depending on the above‐stated categories and the availability of variables used in the included trials, all review authors will discuss and reach consensus on which outcome measures should be included in the analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

One in every three people with DVT will develop post‐thrombotic complications within five years.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the relative effectiveness of, and the rate of complications using, non‐pharmaceutical interventions in people with DVT in the prevention of PTS.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Trials register , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) . In addition, handsearching of non‐listed journals and personal communications with researchers was undertaken.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non‐pharmaceutical interventions, such as bandaging and elastic stockings, in people with clinically confirmed DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS. There were no restrictions on date or language. One author (DNK) identified and assessed titles and abstracts for relevance. This was verified independently by a second author (RS).\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data extraction was undertaken independently by two authors (DNK, RS), using data extraction sheets.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three RCTs that evaluated compression therapy were identified. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings with a pressure of 30‐40 mm Hg at the ankle with no intervention applied directly after an episode of DVT. The other small study compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20‐30 mm Hg) with stockings that were one to two sizes too large in people one year after DVT. Overall, in the treatment group at two years, the use of elastic compression stockings was associated with a highly statistically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS with odds ratio (OR) 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.48). In addition, the incidence of severe PTS was reduced from OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.76). In another RCT that considered the first nine days post DVT, no difference in the incidence of pulmonary embolism and size of thrombus in the femoral vein was found. A statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) was found in pain, swelling and clinical scores, favouring the compression group.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is substantial evidence that elastic compression stockings reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. No serious adverse effects were mentioned in the studies. Hence, elastic compression stockings should be added to the treatment of DVT to prevent the development of post‐thrombotic syndrome.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Deep Venous Thrombosis\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Compression Therapy\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Compression Therapy\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Post-thrombotic syndrome\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Venous Thrombosis\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Non‐pharmaceutical measures for prevention of post‐thrombotic syndrome\n\n【24】People with deep vein thrombosis can significantly reduce the chance of developing post‐thrombotic syndrome by wearing elastic compression stockings. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow through a vein. People with DVT often develop chronic pain, swelling and skin changes in the legs, called post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Elastic compression stockings are used to try to reduce the swelling and improve blood flow in the leg veins. The review found that people with DVT who wear elastic compression stockings are less likely to develop PTS. No adverse effects have been reported, but people with a weakened arterial blood supply may experience a worsening of their condition.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To conduct a systematic review for the evidence of the effects of dressings and topical agents on quality of life in people with fungating malignant wounds.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Fungating wounds arise from primary, secondary or recurrent malignant disease. These lesions may also be referred to as ulcerating tumours, malignant wounds or neoplasic lesions. Grocott  defines a fungating wound as \"the condition of ulceration and proliferation which arises when malignant tumour cells infiltrate and erode through the skin.\"\n\n【6】Fungating wounds are usually associated with advanced cancer, particularly carcinoma of the breast. The exact prevalence of fungating wounds is currently unknown since the data are not found in the population‐based cancer registries. Stotter  followed 525 patients diagnosed with early breast cancer over 30 years and found that 2.66% had later involvement of breast skin. Clearly there will also be a proportion of patients who presented with advanced disease.\n\n【7】Fungating lesions are thought to interfere with tissue oxygenation, lymphatic drainage and haemostasis. Reduced tissue perfusion due to abnormalities in the vascularisation of solid tumours leads to local cell anoxia and sometimes death of cell leading to necrotic tissue . Rapid tumour cell growth may also affect the pH of extracellular fluid which interferes with the clotting mechanism leading to coagulation and the potential occlusion of blood vessels leading to necrosis . The lymphatic system may be impaired and interstitial fluid pressures can exceed extravascular pressures leading to vascular collapse causing infarction, hypoxia and necrosis. . Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria thrive on necrotic tissue leading to malodour and profuse exudate. In addition, the fragility of tumour capillaries increases the risk of haemorrhage .\n\n【8】The management of fungating malignant wounds is complex and challenging and the physical and psychological distress for both patients and their carers is well documented . Although a small proportion of patients may achieve healing following surgical excision, treatment is usually palliative and aims to achieve the best quality of life for patients and their families. Palliative treatment may include radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Wound management aims to alleviate physical symptoms such as copious exudate, malodour, pain, and the risk of haemorrhage.\n\n【9】The authors have been unable to identify any previous systematic review of topical agents and dressings for the management of fungating wounds. Experts have identified the need for a systematic study of the problems encountered in the management of fungating wounds with wound dressings . Grocott  recently published a review of advances in fungating wound management but acknowledged that \"the review does not constitute a systematic review but covers key published work.\" The review concluded that over the last ten years there has been no significant advances in managing fungating wounds. A recent literature review of wound care for fungating wounds concluded that the material currently informing practice was scarce and outdated .\n\n【10】At present, good practice aims for effective management of symptoms such as exudate and malodour rather than the unrealistic aim of promoting healing. Symptom management is primarily through appropriate dressing and topical agent selection although oral antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to reduce the bacteria count of necrotic tissue and thus reduce malodour.  \n\n【11】Dressings and topical agents may be selected to cope with exudate (e.g. foams and alginates) and malodour (e.g. metronidazole gel, charcoal impregnated dressings, sugar paste). Cutaneous pain management may be attempted with topical analgesia (topical diamorphine gel). The application of non‐adherent dressings to minimise trauma on dressing removal may also reduce cutaneous pain and reduce the risk of haemorrhage through minimising tissue trauma on dressing changes . Debridement is the usual approach for managing necrotic tissue in other wounds. However, the friable vessels within fungating wounds significantly increases the risk of haemorrhage and therefore debridement is used with great caution.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】To conduct a systematic review for the evidence of the effects of dressings and topical agents on quality of life in people with fungating malignant wounds.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published and unpublished, which assess the effectiveness of a dressing or topical agent in the treatment of fungating wounds will be considered initially. However, in the absence of RCTs controlled clinical trials (CCTs) with a concurrent control group and cross over trials up to the point of cross over will be considered.\n\n【18】Studies will be included if they report some valid outcome measure such as quality of life as measured by a recognised generic or disease specific tool (e.g. SF36).\n\n【19】There will be no restriction on language or date of publication.\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Patients of any age, male and female and in any care setting who have been clinically diagnosed with fungating wounds due to any type of carcinoma will be included. As the method of diagnosis may vary between studies, no standardised definition will be applied and the author's decision regarding diagnosis will be accepted. Trials which include patients with other conditions will be included only if the outcomes for those with fungating wounds are reported separately.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】The primary interventions will be all topical agents and dressings or dressing systems applied to fungating wounds. Topical agents will include all agents that may be applied topically, including drugs such as metronidazole gel.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of patients with stable COPD.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterised mainly by bronchial obstruction, systemic inflammation and co‐morbidities, is now the third leading cause of death in the world . More than 3 million people die of COPD each year worldwide , and the condition is a concern not only for pulmonologists, but also for physicians and general practitioners. Suspended particles in the atmosphere, especially from tobacco smoking, play a central role in the development of COPD. The most common symptoms of COPD‐ shortness of breath on exertion and cough ‐ are present for a prolonged period and typically worsen over time .\n\n【7】Since the late 1960s, the definition of COPD has been modified repeatedly. Early definitions of COPD included chronic bronchitis, which is clinically characterised by chronic cough, and emphysema, which is pathologically defined by damaged sacs or alveoli in the lungs . In 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) released its first report ‐ Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD  ‐ which proposed a new definition for COPD that indicates the disorder is recognised primarily by chronic obstruction of lung airflow .\n\n【8】If COPD is properly diagnosed and managed, some symptoms can be ameliorated. Smoking cessation and vaccination are the first steps in COPD management, and daily pharmacological treatment is required for most individuals with COPD .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Key medications for COPD management consist of three classes of inhaler device medications: long‐acting beta agonist (LABA), long‐acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) . If the disease cannot be controlled adequately with a single medication, administration of two or more medications from different classes may prove beneficial. When two classes of medications are required, LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS are often selected because these combinations can be administered via a combined medication device , which is most beneficial for improving patient adherence .\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】LAMA: LAMA dilates the airway by selectively blocking acetylcholine from M <sub>3 </sub> receptors  and by inhibiting bronchocontraction. Over the past decade, LAMA, especially tiotropium, has been regarded as the first‐choice medication for treating patients with COPD. LAMA confers anti‐inflammatory and even more important anti‐airway remodelling effects .\n\n【13】LABA: Beta agonist widens the airways by relaxing airway muscles. Recent studies suggest that LABA may also provide anti‐inflammatory and protective effects against bronchoconstrictive substances. Regular use of a short‐acting beta agonist that works quickly and lasts for four to six hours is not currently recommended for individuals with asthma or COPD. A LABA that lasts for about 12 to 24 hours is considered to be a maintenance drug .\n\n【14】ICS: ICS sedates inflammation in the airway. Although ICS is highly indicated for bronchial asthma in which eosinophils play a key role, it is not so effective when neutrophils are observed in the airways of patients with COPD . Recent studies suggest that ICS is highly effective only for people with a high sputum/blood eosinophil count who have asthma combined with COPD .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Current GOLD guidelines recommend first‐line use of ICS only for people with group C and group D COPD, that is, severe to very severe airflow limitation and two or more exacerbations per year, with one or more hospitalisations for exacerbations, in the belief that ICS can reduce the risk of exacerbation . Nonetheless, prescription rates for ICS and combined LABA+ICS agents are high . This is probably because many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have supported the hypothesis that salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination, which is the oldest combination treatment, can improve quality of life, especially for people with dyspnoea, can also decrease acute exacerbations of COPD, and can prevent yearly declines in pulmonary functioning .\n\n【17】Recently developed LAMA+LABA treatments have also shown promising effects . Recognition of asthma‐COPD overlap syndrome throws into question the routine administration of ICS for patients with COPD with severe obstruction . Blood/sputum eosinophil counts can serve as predictive biomarkers for differentiating patients with COPD who will derive greatest benefit from ICS administration from those who will not benefit from use of an ICS .\n\n【18】It remains unclear which type of combination treatment ‐ LAMA+LABA or LABA+ICS ‐ is most beneficial for people with COPD. Researchers must continue to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of patients with stable COPD.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】We will include individual and cluster RCTs and cross‐over trials, but not quasi‐RCTs.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the accuracy of general practitioners’ overall gestalt (unaided) clinical judgement for diagnosing cognitive impairment and dementia in symptomatic people presenting to primary care. There is no comparator index test.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Cochrane is undertaking a series of reviews investigating the diagnostic accuracy of a variety of tests for diagnosing dementia, but to contextualise the findings to practice it is also important to quantify the accuracy of clinical judgement. Doctors use a variety of processes to reach a diagnosis, including non‐analytical reasoning processes such as pattern recognition, to rapidly generate diagnostic hypotheses . Some people with dementia unfortunately have sufficiently advanced disease at the point of diagnosis that additional tests may be unnecessary and burdensome. General practitioners (GPs) often report using their clinical judgement, rather than a formal test, to determine whether someone has dementia . A review of the clinical judgement of GPs is therefore an important step in determining the potential added value of more formal diagnostic workup, such as brief cognitive tests.\n\n【6】### Target condition being diagnosed\n\n【7】In this protocol we investigate the accuracy of gestalt clinical judgement for the diagnosis of two target conditions: all‐cause dementia, and cognitive impairment due to dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\n\n【8】Dementia is a clinical syndrome of cognitive impairment that develops gradually and causes a decline in functioning. Dementia is increasingly common with age, affecting less than 5% of the population aged less than 75 years and 17% of those aged over 89 years . Dementia may result from a variety of pathologies, but in the elderly population in the community these subtype definitions based on disease aetiology are thought by some investigators to be of less relevance, as most old people with dementia have mixed pathology at autopsy .\n\n【9】Cognitive impairment includes dementia and MCI . MCI is a syndrome of cognitive impairment that is greater than expected when accounting for a person's age and educational attainment, but that does not interfere with capacity for independence in everyday activities of daily living. MCI affects between 3% and 20% of adults aged over 65 years , and the prognosis in general practice is variable: approximately 25% of people develop dementia within three years but around 40% revert to normal .\n\n【10】Experience in clinical general practice is that when there are concerns about impaired cognition these are focused primarily on the possibility of dementia rather than MCI, but inevitably some people who are evaluated for possible dementia will be diagnosed with MCI. In this protocol we include people who are ultimately diagnosed as having MCI when we refer to a person consulting with a GP about possible dementia (e.g. under Participants or Clinical pathway ), because it would be unusual for a person to consult a GP about possible MCI or cognitive impairment. Our second target condition includes both dementia _and_ MCI because it would be unusual for a GP to diagnose MCI, especially on the basis of gestalt judgement alone, because neuropsychological evaluation is often required. If gestalt clinical judgement was sensitive for any cognitive impairment, then if the GP assessed the person as being cognitively normal it would rule out both dementia and MCI.\n\n【11】### Index test(s)\n\n【12】The index test will be a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment (due to MCI or dementia), or dementia, based on the overall clinical judgement (or gut feeling/gestalt ) of a primary care physician after a clinical assessment, unaided by formal (even brief) cognitive tests. We operationalise this as a single index test (clinical judgement) with two target conditions . Diagnostic labels in general practice may function primarily to guide the management of the patient, to treat, to investigate, or to exclude serious disease . GPs have been described as using intuition , pattern recognition  and scripts , amongst other strategies , to reach a diagnosis.\n\n【13】The diagnostic accuracy of GPs' clinical judgment about the presence of dementia after consulting with patients had good diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 92%, specificity 76%) in one study . This compared fairly well to the diagnostic accuracy of the informant questionnaire for cognitive disorders in the elderly (IQCODE), a brief cognitive test for diagnosing dementia, at a cutpoint of 3.2 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 76%)  and, in a different clinical context, to the clinical judgement of GPs regarding the severity of chest pain aetiology based only on brief history and examination (sensitivity 82%, specificity 79%) . GPs report lack of time as a barrier to diagnosing dementia  and report often relying on personal observations to make the diagnosis  whereas pen‐and‐paper tests are used by a minority of people .\n\n【14】### Clinical pathway\n\n【15】#### Prior tests\n\n【16】Many people who are concerned about the onset of possible dementia present to a healthcare provider for an evaluation; often the first consultation would be with a primary care provider (commonly a GP) but in some health economies the first consultation may be with a specialist clinician. Some people may not experience subjective cognitive problems , but may be encouraged (or taken) to attend a consultation with a clinician by a close contact (e.g. a carer) or professional who is concerned about possible dementia. A further possibility is that a GP may form an impression of possible cognitive impairment during a consultation with a patient about a (potentially) unrelated matter.\n\n【17】Most commonly in research studies and clinical practice, no tests would be performed before a GP consultation regarding possible dementia. Some people may consult with their GP about the possibility of dementia after performing a self‐administered cognitive test such as test‐your‐memory . Alternatively some people might have been asked to see their GP as a consequence of undergoing brief cognitive testing conducted by another health professional (for example, a district nurse or hospital doctor), or as part of a research project.\n\n【18】In this review we will only consider clinical judgement by a primary care physician (GP) in someone who is considered to have symptoms. Either the patient themselves or someone else, including a health professional (including the consulting GP), should be concerned about possible cognitive impairment. Recent policy in the USA and UK has encouraged screening for dementia in people who do not have symptoms . This remains controversial  and we do not propose to include these people in this review.\n\n【19】#### Role of index tests\n\n【20】It is rare that any single component of a diagnostic evaluation would be diagnostic for a condition by itself. Most people who are being evaluated for possible cognitive impairment or dementia will commonly undergo further assessment that may include brief cognitive tests and investigations such as biochemical analysis and neuroimaging. Most commonly in primary care, further assessment of a patient is dependent on the GPs' clinical judgment: when the GP feels comfortable to exclude cognitive impairment or dementia without further assessment the patient will usually undergo no further tests, whereas when the GP feels uncertain then further evaluation may be arranged. It would be unusual for a GP to rule‐in dementia without further assessment, but this may occur when the patient is frail, affected by multiple comorbidities, and perhaps resident in a nursing home, where the prior probability of dementia (or prevalence) may be as high as 60% , and when the management may be primarily palliative. In some situations GPs may use a test of time  to help increase the specificity of a diagnosis, especially when the condition may fluctuate, and a GP may therefore form a 'working diagnosis', which is reviewed over a period of time, before deciding on a formal recorded diagnosis.\n\n【21】#### Alternative test(s)\n\n【22】Alternatives to the index test would include a more detailed evaluation, which may be conducted by a specialist, and might include aspects of clinical history, examination, cognitive testing, biochemical and haematological analysis and neuroimaging.\n\n【23】### Rationale\n\n【24】A systematic review published in 2010 found that the judgement of GPs was highly specific for diagnosing dementia at all stages of severity, but only moderately sensitive . A second review addressing a similar question used a more restricted search strategy . Both reviews were well conducted but allowed a broad definition of 'clinical judgement' that is not immediately applicable to clinical practice, by including studies where 'clinical judgement' was defined as a documented diagnosis in the medical records, which may not accurately reflect the actual clinical opinion . Additionally, there is scope to develop the search strategy, in particular to include more terms relating to dementia, cognitive impairment and diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【25】Objectives\n----------\n\n【26】To determine the accuracy of general practitioners’ overall gestalt (unaided) clinical judgement for diagnosing cognitive impairment and dementia in symptomatic people presenting to primary care. There is no comparator index test.\n\n【27】### Secondary objectives\n\n【28】To investigate the heterogeneity of test accuracy in the included studies.\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】We will include cross‐sectional studies (where participants have index test and reference test at the same encounter, which would be unusual) and cohort studies. We recognise that cross‐sectional studies might be at higher risk of incorporation bias than cohort studies and we will account for this when we assess studies for risk of bias (quality appraisal); we judge that the alternative approach of excluding cross‐sectional studies would be too restrictive. We will not include case‐control studies because they are at high risk of bias and because, by definition, any participants would have been recruited on the basis of disease state (dementia, cognitive impairment or normal). This would prevent GPs from making a blinded gestalt clinical judgement about the diagnosis, because in most health systems the GP primary care record contains entries relating to all medical and psychiatric diagnoses, which would include cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\n【33】#### Participants\n\n【34】We will only include studies that have recruited participants from primary care. We define primary care as first‐contact health care provided by a non‐specialist clinician in a continuing‐care office setting. We will exclude studies where the consultation with a non‐specialist takes place in hospital (including outpatients or emergency departments) as this is unlikely to represent primary care in the sense that is relevant to our review. Because we anticipate that reporting in original studies may be suboptimal , we will include studies where some or all of the participants are consulting with a primary care provider about possible dementia following a recommendation by a non‐specialist secondary care provider (e.g. emergency department), even if the study does not explicitly state these people were consulting secondary care about a non‐dementia concern (e.g. a fall).\n\n【35】We will only include studies where GPs make a clinical judgement about the presence or absence of cognitive impairment or dementia in someone who is suspected of having it (either by the patient, a caregiver, or professional ‐ including the consulting GP). We will exclude studies where GPs are asked to make a judgement about the presence or absence of cognitive impairment or dementia in all people attending primary care, regardless of the reason for attendance, as this is akin to screening. We recognise that other primary care providers might form clinical judgements about the possibility of cognitive impairment, but we will only include studies that use GPs as the primary care provider because we are concerned that including other professionals would introduce even greater heterogeneity than we already anticipate; for instance, although GPs are required to hold a license to practice medicine, the training requirements and scope of practice may vary substantially in different countries.\n\n【36】#### Index tests\n\n【37】We propose that the core feature of clinical judgement is that it is unaided by any additional test, investigation or inquiry beyond that which is immediately available to the clinician . As outlined above, in this review we are investigating a single index test (clinical judgement) with two target conditions (cognitive impairment composite or dementia). In everyday practice, a clinical judgement is necessarily formed after an encounter with a patient during which GPs would often have access to the medical record and might review this in conjunction with meeting the patient. There are three ways that clinical judgement (for research) may be used in a diagnostic accuracy study in general practice. The first definition is a documented diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia in the medical records; we consider that this definition reflects the process of documentation rather than clinical judgement. The second definition is a judgement of a clinician based on knowledge of the patient and review of the medical notes, but not relating to a specific encounter with the patient; we consider that this definition reflects consulting behaviour of people (in this case with cognitive impairment or dementia). The third definition is a clinical impression formed by the clinician after consulting with a patient who has presented to a specific encounter with the doctor (perhaps with symptoms suggestive of possible dementia, though not always ‐ because it may be the consulting GP who raises the possibility of cognitive problems), and we consider this to be the definition of clinical judgement that is most relevant to practice. For this review, we will include studies that use the third definition (clinical impression after consultation) but we anticipate that there will be very few studies that use this design. Therefore, to avoid an empty review, we will also include studies that use the second definition (based on existing knowledge of the patient and not relating to a particular encounter) so long as the index test (GP judgement about cognitive impairment or dementia) has taken place before any definitive diagnosis (for example, specialist assessment in a memory clinic). We will investigate the use of medical records as a source of heterogeneity under the category 'prior tests' for any study that allows doctors access to the medical records, regardless of whether clinical judgement is defined using definition two or three. For studies that use definition two it will usually be explicit that GPs were allowed to review the medical record, but if this is not clear we will always make the assumption that the records were reviewed. We will judge that access to the medical records was allowed for studies that use definition three only if this is explicit.\n\n【38】The doctor’s clinical impression will often determine the extent of the additional work‐up offered. In one scenario, people who are thought to be highly likely to have dementia might have only a brief 'rule‐in' test together with blood tests to exclude other causes such as hypothyroidism or infection, or (rarely) no additional tests at all; this scenario is less applicable to people who are thought to have cognitive impairment rather than frank dementia. In a second scenario, where there is a degree of uncertainty, people might be referred to a specialist, and in a third scenario those who are thought to be highly unlikely to have any problems might be offered a brief 'rule‐out' test, or none at all. We will include studies where some (but not all) participants undergo both the index test and reference standard, so long as at least some index test positives and index test negatives undergo the reference standard, and will account for this verification bias using the QUADAS‐2 checklist; for these studies we will use the population undergoing both tests as the denominator for diagnostic accuracy and we will document the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in the total sample separately. We will not exclude studies where GPs are allowed to use additional cognitive tests to help determine the management of the patient _after_ formulating and expressing their unaided judgement, but if we judge that these additional tests have contributed to formulation of clinical judgement we will account for this as a source of heterogeneity as described below. However, we will not evaluate the accuracy of any tests other than clinical judgement in this review.\n\n【39】Original studies may offer GPs two (cognitive impairment, normal; or dementia, normal) or three possible diagnostic categories (dementia, cognitive impairment, normal), and may ask GPs to rate their confidence in the diagnosis, or how probable it is.\n\n【40】##### Impact of GP decision‐making on further evaluation and verification bias\n\n【41】If the GP judges that cognitive impairment or dementia is unlikely and does not perform any further verification, but the person has cognitive impairment or dementia, then this person would be a false negative case; in this event prevalence of cognitive problems will be underestimated, and estimated sensitivity will be higher than the true value. In other cases GPs might suspect dementia but not take any further action to confirm (with further tests) or to document the diagnosis; in this event prevalence will be underestimated and the estimated sensitivity and specificity would both be affected (most likely they will be underestimated but this is impossible to determine). This second circumstance might occur if the doctor is not specifically asked about their judgement about dementia after consulting with patients, because in general practice the specific diagnosis is often less important than the prognosis and impact for the patient . This is more likely if the patient is predominantly burdened by some other physical health problem and has an anticipated short life expectancy, so that the purpose of confirming a dementia diagnosis may be unclear . This situation is likely to be much more of an issue for people with dementia than those with cognitive impairment. Only research studies that offer a reference standard assessment to all people presenting with concerns about cognitive impairment, regardless of the GPs' gestalt clinical judgement, will be able to report robust data on diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【42】#### Target conditions\n\n【43】The first target condition is all‐cause dementia. We will include a diagnosis of dementia at any stage of disease, because we do not want to restrict our results and this pragmatic approach is most relevant to clinical practice. We will not examine the utility of clinical judgement for risk prediction of future dementia. The second target condition is cognitive impairment due to MCI or dementia.\n\n【44】#### Reference standards\n\n【45】To allow for a pragmatic and sensitive approach to study inclusion, we will include different reference standards (outlined below). Studies must administer the index test and reference test (excepting longitudinal follow up) within six months; if authors do not provide details of this time interval we will include the study and account for this as 'unclear' in the quality appraisal using QUADAS‐2.\n\n【46】##### Dementia\n\n【47】We will include studies that apply the reference standard of all‐cause dementia according to DSM ( American Psychiatric Association ) or ICD  definitions, regardless of version. We will also include studies that use Agecat , CAMDEX  and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale  as the reference standard, as these are well‐validated methods of applying the aforementioned diagnostic criteria. We will include studies that use expert specialist clinical judgement as the reference standard. We consider a specialist to be a clinician who has particular expertise in diagnosing and managing dementia, who will usually practice in a hospital, and have the professional status of a geriatrician, psychiatrist or neurologist. We will include studies that use longitudinal confirmation of the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia in primary care, because we anticipate that in some studies a specialist assessment will only be offered to some participants. We operationalise 'longitudinal confirmation of the diagnosis in primary care' as case record review occurring at least three months _after_ the index test diagnosis of dementia where no other alternative diagnosis is identified. It is likely that many people who can be correctly diagnosed as having dementia by unaided clinical judgement (true positives) would have a fairly advanced stage of disease, but stage of disease will not form part of the target condition.\n\n【48】Although the target condition is all‐cause dementia we will also include studies that use an aetiological sub‐type definition: for Alzheimer disease dementia , vascular dementia , Lewy body dementia  or frontotemporal dementia .\n\n【49】##### Cognitive impairment\n\n【50】Cognitive impairment is a composite target condition. We will allow any recognised definition of MCI , as well as the reference standards for dementia outlined above.\n\n【51】In addition to dementia and MCI there are other causes of cognitive impairment, such as delirium and head injury, but these are not part of the target condition that we are investigating in this review. If the index tests indicated cognitive impairment or dementia and further evaluation demonstrated that the clinical problem was delirium instead, the test would be false positive.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of laser iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with narrow angles, angle‐closure or angle‐closure glaucoma in non‐acute situations when compared with any other intervention including observation, medical treatment, laser peripheral iridotomy or surgical interventions like trabeculectomy or cataract extraction.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Description of the condition**  \nGlaucoma has been defined as a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic appearances of the optic discs and specific pattern of visual field defects. Based on the appearance of the anterior chamber angle it can be classified into open‐angle or closed‐angle glaucoma. In the latter, an elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) occurs as a consequence of an obstruction of the outflow pathway located in the anterior chamber angle (i.e. trabecular meshwork) by the peripheral iris. Closure of the anterior chamber angle can be appositional (reversible) or synechial (permanent, due to adherent uveal tissue). Among patients with appositional closure of the anterior chamber angle, many have normal IOP without any signs of glaucoma. They are usually described as having 'narrow angles'. If the IOP is elevated and/or there are parts of the angle with synechial closure (but without signs of glaucomatous damage), the preferred term is 'angle closure' (AC). The term 'angle closure glaucoma' (ACG) is reserved for those patients with angle closure and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc damage and/or visual field loss.\n\n【6】Angle‐closure glaucoma (ACG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Sixty seven million people worldwide are affected by glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma is more common than ACG but the latter is more likely to result in bilateral blindness . Angle‐closure glaucoma is more common in Asians and women. Foster estimated that the number of persons with \"narrow\" angles in China, based on previous studies in Mongolia  and Singapore , is 28.2 million, while 9.1 million would have angle closure. Furthermore, of the 1.7 million persons bilaterally blind from glaucoma in China, 91% are caused by ACG. Foster et al concluded that ACG might be the leading cause of glaucoma blindness in the world today .\n\n【7】Patients with narrow angles, AC or ACG may present with acute symptoms of highly elevated IOP but the majority of patients have a chronic course with no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Interventions for acute presentation of angle closure are being evaluated in another Cochrane review and will not be considered in this protocol.\n\n【8】**Description of the intervention**  \nTreatment of ACG is aimed a opening the anterior chamber angle, most commonly by laser iridotomy, an lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients, although in some of them (up to 20%) the anterior chamber angle remains closed. The latter situation is typically due to plateau iris syndrome or prominent and thick peripheral iris. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser iridoplasty is recommended as the next step in current standard treatment for ACG.  \nLaser iridoplasty tries to pull away and 'remove' iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork by shrinking the peripheral iris tissue. Argon laser is applied using a contact lens (e.g. Abraham contact lens) to the iris periphery, approximately six shots per quadrant. The argon laser is set at 500‐micron spot size, with a duration of 0.5 seconds, and an initial starting laser energy of 200 mW. This laser energy level is gradually increased if iris stromal shrinkage is not observed initially. It has been suggested that heat shrinkage of collagen may be responsible for the short‐term response to laser iridoplasty, and that contraction of the fibroblastic membrane may be responsible for its long‐term effects . Laser iridoplasty can be used as a primary treatment or after laser peripheral iridotomy for acute angle‐closure attacks and angle closure glaucoma.\n\n【9】**Why it is important to do this review**  \nLaser iridoplasty is part of the standard treatment for angle‐closure glaucoma and is indicated in patients who do not respond to laser iridotomy. The effects of iridoplasty appear to be increasingly reported in the literature for the treatment of acute angle closure attacks and chronic angle‐closure and angle‐closure glaucoma . So far, there has been no systematic review to assess the effectiveness of laser iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with narrow angles, AC or ACG in chronic situations.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of laser iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with narrow angles, angle‐closure or angle‐closure glaucoma in non‐acute situations when compared with any other intervention including observation, medical treatment, laser peripheral iridotomy or surgical interventions like trabeculectomy or cataract extraction.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】Randomised controlled trials and case‐control trials will be eligible for inclusion in this review.\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】Patients with narrow angles, angle‐closure or angle‐closure glaucoma will be eligible. It is anticipated that some trials will include patients with a previous history of acute presentations while others will evaluate participants with non‐acute conditions only. Studies that include only patients with acute presentations, using laser iridoplasty to break the acute phase will be excluded. We will include studies which have participants with a past history of an acute presentation but have not had laser iridoplasty during the attack .There will be no restrictions with respect to previous treatments (i.e peripheral iridotomy), age, gender, ethnicity or the number of participants.

{"seq_id": "ea8a5e82-686b-4693-96d3-b0e2f2d89318", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of the combined Antiretroviral Treatment containing ABC relative to ABC‐sparing cART. A subgroup comparison will be performed in studies comparing Antiretroviral Treatment containing ABC relative to TDF containing cART.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】With the advent of antiretroviral drugs, especially the implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) , the clinical course of HIV infection has been transformed from an almost uniformly fatal disease to a chronic and manageable condition. The field of HIV medicine  continues to evolve rapidly and, to maintain a high standard of care, treatment guidelines must continually be refined to assist the complex decision‐making process. Treatment can provide durable virological, immunologic, and clinical benefits while minimizing toxicities and drug resistance, improving quality of life and potentially allowing for a normal life span.\n\n【6】The current standard of care for HIV treatment is a three‐drug regimen containing either a non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus two nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) . The most widely used NRTI backbones  are available as fixed‐dose co‐formulations that combine two drugs (tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) in a single tablet taken once daily. Factors such as efficacy, lack of severe adverse events and patient convenience has led to TDF/FTC and ABC/3TC becoming the most widely prescribed initial backbone in industrialised countries. However, some divergences between European and USA guidelines exist. While the EACS guidelines recommend TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC as the nucleoside backbone component of initial combination regimens, USA guidelines recommend TDF/FTC as the first line and ABC/3TC as an alternative regimen \n\n【7】Lamivudine and emtricitabine are similar in their structure, activity, and side effects. Compared to lamivudine, emtricitabine  shows an enhanced pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical trials comparing FTC with 3TC as part of a triple‐drug regimen have demonstrated their equivalence and, in clinical practice, the choice of 3TC versus FTC will most likely be made in the context of drugs coformulated with them . Current guidelines  assume lamivudine and emtricitabine to be equivalent .\n\n【8】Differences between abacavir and tenofovir are of more interest. For instance, recent data have offered conflicting evidence concerning the relative effectiveness of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone combinations. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that among patients with a high baseline viral load (HIV RNA > 100,000 copies/mL), those taking abacavir plus lamivudine with either boosted atazanavir or efavirenz were more likely to experience virological failure than those taking tenofovir plus emtricitabine . By contrast,  a RCT , a head‐to‐head comparison of abacavir plus lamivudine compared to  tenofovir plus emtricitabine,  in combination with lopinavir‐ritonavir , and a retrospective analysis of 6 previous abacavir trials found that the backbones had similar efficacy  .\n\n【9】Perhaps,differences in safety profile of NRTI backbones are more relevant. These are:  \n1.‐ A number of reports have linked renal tubular dysfunction and acute renal failure with tenofovir.  \n2.‐ Modest decreases in bone density have been observed .  \n3.‐Hypophosphatemia can occur .  \n4.‐ An association between combination antiretroviral therapy and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) has been observed in some cohort studies . Current or recent (within the last 6 months) use of the NRTIs abacavir (ABC) and didanosine (ddI) was  associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease . By contrast, the results of a  case‐control study nested within the French Hospital Database on HIV showed that any association of short‐term/recent exposure to ABC with risk of MI  was lost when subjects were case‐matched to controls by cocaine or intravenous drug use . Similarly, results from the Veterans Administration’s Clinical Case registry  show that cumulative exposure to ABC was not associated with significant increase in MI. Moreover, any trend towards an association of ABC use with MI was weaker after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors including renal function . More recently, a modest association was found with the cumulative use of ABC and risk of myocardial infarction . However, no evidence to suggesting that initial ART containing ABC increases MI risk over short term and long‐term periods was found in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Longitudinal Linked Randomized Trials (ALLRT) cohort . In this population with relatively low MI risk, classic cardiovascular disease risk, and not ABC use, were strong predictors of MI. . Moreover, no excess risk of myocardial infarction with ABC therapy has been observed among 14,174 patients in the aggregated clinical trials database maintained by the manufacturer of ABC  and in two meta‐analyses comparing ABC  containing cART to  other regimens not‐containing ABC . The primary criticism of observational studies is that either known or unknown confounding factors may influence any observed association between an exposure of interest and a given outcome . Randomisation minimises imbalances in confounding variables between experimental and control groups. Therefore, well conducted RCTs provide stronger evidence than do observational studies. Evidence that cohort data may not correctly predict associations of treatments with myocardial infarction risk as compared with RCTs has been previously demonstrated with beta‐carotene using meta‐analysis methodology . By contrast, we anticipate  that the possibility of information bias about cardiovascular events exists, since  HIV trials generally are not designed to assess cardiovascular end‐points, the reporting and confirmation of these is done via adverse event reporting (both serious and non‐serious) and source document verification by the sponsors auditor in accordance with GCP standards..\n\n【10】### Description of the condition\n\n【11】The advent of HAART has made HIV infection a chronic manageable disease for many patients. After the implementation of HAART mortality due to AIDS decreased substantially as a result of the effectiveness of current therapy in providing sustained suppression of viral replication and preservation of immune system function . However, the focus on long‐term management of patients with HIV infection has broadened to include comorbid conditions, most notably cardiovascular disease . To date, there are no established biological mechanisms to explain a potential increase in risk of cardiovascular diseases in ABC recipients . Tretament with cART improves endothelial dysfunction, but data on ABC use and  endothelial function are limited to a small cohort study . See  treatment with cART details. Results from others studies failed to demonstrate specific abnormalities in coagulation or inflammation markers that might explain the increased risk of myocardial infarction in ABC recipients .\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】The primary therapeutic goals when initiating therapy in patients infected with HIV are long‐lasting suppression of viral replication, maintenance or restoration of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV‐related morbidity and mortality.Current recommendations support the use of a three‐drug regimen containing either a NNRTI, a PI or an INSTI plus two NRTIs . Individuals taking cART have now a wide range of therapeutic options and good prospects for long‐term success. ABC is available as a single‐agent, in dual combination with 3TC, and as a triple combination with zidovudine and 3TC . A generic form, ABC sulfate is also available. The recommended adult dose of ABC is 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily.TDF is available as a single‐agent, in dual combination with FTC, and as a triple combination with FTC and efavirenz. The recommended adult dose of TDF is 300 mg once daily .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV‐1). Abacavir is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'‐OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated \n\n【16】ABC is rapidly absorbed and is widely distributed . It has good bioavailability, (approximately 83%). The serum half‐life of elimination (t1/2) is about 1.5 hours but the drug has been shown in a number of pharmacokinetic and clinical studies to be efficacious when administered once daily .This is because the activity and efficacy of the drug is mainly determined by its intracellular concentration. Intracellular concentrations of ABC have been shown to be similar after administration of 600 mg once daily or 300 mg twice daily , providing further pharmacokinetic support for the interchangeability of these two regimens .The most important adverse event associated with ABC is the a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) ( Loeliger 2001 ; Appendix 1 ). Multiple studies have shown an association of the ABC HSR with HLA‐B\\*5701 . The use of this screening test to identify high risk patients has been shown to reduce the occurrence of the ABC HSR .\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】Numerous RCTs were conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of ABC containing cART. A summary of the available evidence is required to shed more light on safety and effectiveness issues. Recently, two meta‐analyses have been published on this topic . However, the current review will include outcomes not included in the previous meta‐analysis, and will build on and update the previous meta‐analyses about the cardiovascular events\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of the combined Antiretroviral Treatment containing ABC relative to ABC‐sparing cART. A subgroup comparison will be performed in studies comparing Antiretroviral Treatment containing ABC relative to TDF containing cART.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), in any setting.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Adults patients (> 18 years old) starting a first antiretroviral  regimen as well as  antiretroviral‐experienced participants.

Drug therapy is normally used to control symptoms. However the use of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread. In a UK survey of National Asthma Campaign members, only 41% said they had _not_ used CAM and of those 41%, 67% said they would consider using CAM for their asthma in the future. The most popular forms of CAM in the study population were breathing techniques, homeopathy and herbalism . A survey of CAM use in asthma or rhinosinusitis sufferers in the USA found that 42% of the study population had used some form of CAM for their condition in the 12 months prior to the study. Herbal treatments emerged as being the most commonly reported form of CAM being used . Another US survey of CAM use found that allergies and lung problems ranked as some of the most frequently reported medical conditions that CAM is used for, and the most popular forms of CAM for these conditions were herbs, relaxation and spiritual healing .\n\n【6】Why then, when there are effective treatments available for asthma do people turn to complementary or alternative medicine, especially given that evidence in support of treatments such as acupuncture and homeopathy are weak . The reasons for people turning to CAM can be divided into positive and negative motivations . Positive motivations include perceived effectiveness and safety; 'spiritual' or holistic nature of the therapy; personal control over treatment; good relationship with the therapist; and accessibility. Negative reasons include dissatisfaction with conventional methods; rejection of the 'establishment'; and desperation. A study into the beliefs and motivations of CAM users in Canada backs this theory. It found the two main reasons people used CAM were that it allows them to take a more active role in their health, and a feeling that conventional medicine was not effective for their health condition .\n\n【7】As shown by Blanc 2001 ; Eisenberg 1998 ; and Ernst 1998 , herbal therapy is a popular form of CAM in asthma. There is a long history of using herbs to treat asthma and a number of asthma drugs have their origins in herbal remedies. For example, ephedrine was developed from the traditional Chinese herbal remedy 'ma huang', and tea leaves are the herbal origin of theophylline . Caffeine, found in tea and coffee, is a member of the same family as theophylline, and has been used for centuries as a treatment for asthma. A recent Cochrane review found that it improved lung function for up to four hours after ingestion . There are many different herbs and herbal preparations that are used to treat asthma and each culture has it's own approach. Table 1 shows examples of herbs used for the treatment of asthma by culture. Western cultures use products from local plants but also borrow from Eastern cultures . Herbal interventions for asthma are often used in addition to conventional medicine  rather than as a sole agent.\n\n【8】Table 1.

However there are risks with the use of herbal remedies including drug interactions, inconsistent dosing, contamination and natural toxicity . Drug interactions could be a particular concern as a survey of herbal therapy users found that 81% also used conventional medicines . Barnes 1998 found that herbal remedy users would be less likely to consult their GPs for suspected adverse events to a herbal remedy than they would for a conventional over‐the‐counter medicine. In fact, herbal therapy users tend to self‐medicate or take the advice of a friend/relative  so are unlikely to consult any practitioner at all on the use of herbal products.\n\n【11】Whether herbal products are actually effective in the treatment of asthma is uncertain. A systematic review of herbs for asthma conducted in 2000  found 17 randomised controlled trials: six assessing traditional Chinese herbs; eight assessing traditional Indian remedies; one assessing a Japanese herbal preparation; one assessing dried ivy‐leaf extract, and one assessing use of marijuana. They found the methodological quality of the trials was poor and concluded that herbal products are of \"uncertain value in the treatment of asthma\". However, they also concluded that were some \"promising data\". Given the high usage of herbal products among people with asthma, an assessment of current evidence is needed.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】To determine the effectiveness of herbal therapies as a sole agent or in addition to pharmacological therapy in the management of chronic asthma.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will be included.\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】Adults and children over five years old with a diagnosis of chronic asthma of all severities. Diagnosis should be confirmed on the basis of symptoms and lung function assessment.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】For the purposes of this review, herbal medicine is defined as the use of plants or plant extracts to treat disease. The products may be derived from the leaves, stems, buds, roots, fruit or bark  and administered in a number of different ways. Given the nature of asthma, any substances that are taken by inhaling smoke will be excluded, but other than that there will be no limitation on the method of administration. Single chemicals extracted from a plant, or synthetic chemicals based on plant constituents will be excluded (e.g. ephedrine from _Ephedra sinica_ (ma huang), atropine from _Atropa belladonna_ (deadly nightshade)).\n\n【22】The intervention can be a single herb or a mixture of herbs given either as a sole agent or in addition to usual treatment, with a placebo control. This review will not consider trials that compare one herbal intervention with another, or herbs with any other 'complementary' treatment, such as homeopathy or acupuncture.\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】**Primary outcomes:**\n\n【25】*   Lung function\n\n【26】*   Exacerbations\n\n【27】*   Reduction in use of corticosteroids\n\n【28】**Secondary outcomes:**\n\n【29】*   Symptoms and symptom score\n\n【30】*   Use of reliever medications\n\n【31】*   Health related quality of life (QoL)\n\n【32】*   Changes in rates of consultation\n\n【33】*   Adverse effects\n\n【34】*   Withdrawal or drop‐out rates", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This included handsearching of relevant hyperbaric textbooks; hyperbaric journals ( _Hyperbaric Medicine Review, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal, European Journal of Underwater and Hyperbaric Medicine, Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine Journal_ ); and conference proceedings of the major hyperbaric societies (Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society, European Underwater and Baromedical Society, International Congress of Hyperbaric Medicine).\n\n【8】### Selection criteria\n\n【9】We included all randomized and pseudo‐randomized trials (trials in which an attempt at randomization has been made but the method was inappropriate, for example, alternate allocation) that compared the effects of HBOT with the effects of no HBOT (no treatment or sham) in the treatment of children and adults with necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【10】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【11】We planned independent data collection by two review authors using standardized forms.\n\n【12】### Main results\n\n【13】We found no trials that met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】This systematic review failed to locate relevant clinical evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of HBOT in the management of necrotizing fasciitis.

Routine treatment consists of immediate surgical removal of infected tissue and administration of antibiotics. Use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or HBOT, in addition to surgery and antibiotics has been suggested as a way to minimize tissue loss, decrease the number of limb amputations and reduce death. The aim of HBOT is to increase the supply of oxygen to the site. This approach may be toxic to bacteria, may improve the effectiveness of antibiotics and can improve healing.\n\n【27】We searched the databases to September 2014. This Cochrane review found no high‐quality trials to support or refute the use of HBOT in the treatment of individuals with necrotizing fasciitis. It should be noted that HBOT may very rarely result in serious adverse effects. Further studies are required to address the effectiveness of HBOT because currently it is provided as routine practice in some centres.\n\n【28】--------------\n\n【29】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【30】### Implications for practice\n\n【31】Randomized evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【32】### Implications for research\n\n【33】Given current interest in the use of HBOT for this difficult clinical problem and the wide variation in international practice, the case can be made for new clinical trials of high methodological rigour specifically designed to assess the impact of HBOT as adjunctive therapy for individuals with necrotizing fasciitis. Specifically, information is required to identify the effects of adjunctive HBOT on functional outcome, amputation rate and mortality. Furthermore, adverse effects associated with use of HBOT in the treatment of these critically ill patients must be identified.\n\n【34】Future trials should include the following.\n\n【35】1.  Appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences.\n\n【36】2.  Number of HBOT treatments required.\n\n【37】3.  Number of surgical debridements required.\n\n【38】4.

Adverse effects of therapy.\n\n【43】We urge researchers to consider establishing a multi‐centre randomized controlled trial.\n\n【44】Background\n----------\n\n【45】### Description of the condition\n\n【46】Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly progressive death (necrosis) of the fascia and subcutaneous tissue with relative sparing of underlying muscle . It was first described in the scrotum and penis by Fournier in 1883, and subsequently by Meleney in a series of patients with streptococcal disease . This fulminant tissue necrosis is usually accompanied by generalized toxicity, which may progress to shock and multiple organ failure. Without prompt recognition and immediate aggressive management, NF is often rapidly fatal.\n\n【47】Necrotizing fasciitis may occur in a wide range of anatomical locations, and it has been labelled specifically when it occurs in certain locations, for example, Fournier's gangrene in the scrotum . The initial event in the onset of necrotizing fasciitis is entry of bacteria into the fascia, which may be an apparently ‘spontaneous’ event or may occur secondary to trauma or surgery. Rapid bacterial proliferation in the fascia is followed by polymorphonuclear leukocyte (white cell) infiltration and liquefactive necrosis (tissue death). Progressive thrombosis (occlusion) of blood vessels in the fascia leads to occlusion of the perforating skin vessels and secondary cutaneous (skin) ischaemia and gangrene .\n\n【48】The key therapeutic intervention is immediate and radical surgical debridement of all dead tissue. It has been consistently shown that delay to the first surgical debridement is associated with increased mortality . Surgery should be accompanied by prompt commencement of broad‐spectrum antibiotics and appropriate high‐dependency supportive care. Necrotizing fasciitis may be monomicrobial (Type 2 or 3) or polymicrobial (Type 1) . Group A streptococci (GAS) are the most commonly isolated organisms ; consequently antibiotic treatment should include good bactericidal streptococcal cover. Even with early aggressive surgical intervention and appropriate antibiotic treatment, mortality rates are in the region of 30% to 40% in relatively recently published case series . Furthermore, patients frequently require multiple extensive debridements and not uncommonly are left with large soft tissue deficits. Prolonged hospital stay and rehabilitation are often required. Thus necrotizing fasciitis is a condition that incurs significant morbidity and both early and late mortality.\n\n【49】### Description of the intervention\n\n【50】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen in a pressure chamber at pressures above one atmosphere absolute. This results in greatly increased arterial oxygen content and thus tissue oxygen pressure (PtO <sub>2 </sub> ). The precise details of treatments vary, but most treatments involve 60 to 90 minutes of exposure to oxygen at pressures between two and three atmospheres. Full critical care monitoring, including invasive blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, is available during treatment if required. Patients can be mechanically ventilated throughout HBOT. Furthermore, use of multi‐occupant chambers permits constant medical supervision inside the chamber by critical care nurses and doctors.\n\n【51】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is associated with some risk of adverse effects. The most common adverse event is pressure‐induced damage (barotrauma) to the middle ear, which occurs in approximately 4% of treatments . In the vast majority of cases, barotrauma is self‐limiting and has no long‐term effects on hearing . In ventilated patients, tympanostomies (holes in the tympanic membrane) may be performed under local anaesthetic before HBOT is given to prevent the occurrence of middle ear barotrauma. Pressure‐induced damage to the inner ears, lungs, sinuses and teeth has been reported but is extremely rare; a prospective study reported no cases among 11,376 HBOT treatments . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may cause acute brain oxygen toxicity, which presents with seizures and occurs in approximately 0.03% of HBOT treatments . Seizures terminate when oxygen is removed, and their occurrence does not confer long‐term risk of seizures. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may cause pulmonary oxygen toxicity, resulting in a cough, but this does not affect lung function test results . Temporary worsening of short‐sightedness occurs but usually resolves by 10 weeks . Claustrophobia occurs in a minority of patients . Thus, although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as an entirely benign intervention.\n\n【52】### How the intervention might work\n\n【53】Several of the physiological effects of HBOT indicate that it may be beneficial for individuals with necrotizing fasciitis. Infected necrotic fascia with disrupted vasculature is oedematous and relatively hypoxic . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases tissue oxygen tension in necrotizing fasciitis wounds, thereby salvaging critically ischaemic areas . Furthermore, hyperoxia potentiates antibiotic efficiency, improves white cell killing efficacy and is anti‐inflammatory—all of which may improve outcomes .\n\n【54】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【55】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been used as adjunctive treatment for individuals with necrotizing soft tissue infection since the 1960s, when it was proposed to treat anaerobic infection . However, non‐random evidence supporting the use of HBOT is conflicting. Some retrospective cohort studies report a significant reduction in mortality with adjunctive HBOT , whilst others report no change in mortality . As a result, clinical practice varies widely. At some centres HBOT is an integral part of the standard treatment regimen, whilst at others it is never used . In view of the significant mortality and morbidity associated with this condition and the risks inherent in the transfer of critically ill patients, it is important that potentially beneficial adjunctive treatments be closely evaluated.\n\n【56】Objectives\n----------\n\n【57】To review the evidence concerning the use of HBOT as an adjunctive treatment for patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF). Specifically, we wish to address the following questions.\n\n【58】1.  Does administration of HBOT reduce mortality or morbidity associated with NF?\n\n【59】2.  What adverse effects are associated with use of HBOT in the treatment of individuals with NF?\n\n【60】Methods\n-------\n\n【61】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【62】#### Types of studies\n\n【63】We planned to include all randomized and pseudo‐randomized trials (trials in which an attempt at randomization has been made but the method was inappropriate, for example, alternate allocation) that compared the effects of HBOT with the effects of no HBOT in the treatment of children and adults with necrotizing fasciitis.\n\n【64】#### Types of participants\n\n【65】We planned to include all human trials.\n\n【66】#### Types of interventions\n\n【67】The intervention was HBOT administered in a monoplace or multi‐place chamber at pressures between 1.5 and 3 atmospheres for 60 minutes or longer, at least once a day. The minimum accepted number of treatments was one. The comparator therapy was no HBOT treatment (no treatment or sham). Additional therapy provided concomitantly must have been applied to both groups and may have been diverse. We planned to accept any antibiotic and surgical regimens designed to control the infection.\n\n【68】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【69】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【70】1.

We also included comparative studies assessing serious and rare harms.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included 90 reports containing 116 data sets; among these 69 were clinical trials of over 70,000 people, 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case‐control studies (nearly 25,000 people). We retrieved 23 reports of the effectiveness and safety of vaccine administration in pregnant women (about 1.6 million mother‐child couples).\n\n【12】The overall effectiveness of parenteral inactivated vaccine against influenza‐like illness (ILI) is limited, corresponding to a number needed to vaccinate (NNV) of 40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128). The overall efficacy of inactivated vaccines in preventing confirmed influenza has a NNV of 71 (95% CI 64 to 80). The difference between these two values depends on the different incidence of ILI and confirmed influenza among the study populations: 15.6% of unvaccinated participants versus 9.9% of vaccinated participants developed ILI symptoms, whilst only 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively, developed laboratory‐confirmed influenza.\n\n【13】No RCTs assessing vaccination in pregnant women were found. The only evidence available comes from observational studies with modest methodological quality. On this basis, vaccination shows very limited effects: NNV 92 (95% CI 63 to 201) against ILI in pregnant women and NNV 27 (95% CI 18 to 185) against laboratory‐confirmed influenza in newborns from vaccinated women.\n\n【14】Live aerosol vaccines have an overall effectiveness corresponding to a NNV 46 (95% CI 29 to 115).\n\n【15】The performance of one‐dose or two‐dose whole virion pandemic vaccines was higher, showing a NNV of 16 (95% CI 14 to 20) against ILI and a NNV of 35 (95% CI 33 to 47) against influenza, while a limited impact on hospitalisation was found (NNV 94, 95% CI 70 to 1022).\n\n【16】Vaccination had a modest effect on time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local harms. No evidence of association with serious adverse events was found, but the harms evidence base was limited.\n\n【17】The overall risk of bias in the included trials is unclear because it was not possible to assess the real impact of bias.\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】Influenza vaccines have a very modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost in the general population, including pregnant women. No evidence of association between influenza vaccination and serious adverse events was found in the comparative studies considered in the review. This review includes 90 studies, 24 of which (26.7%) were funded totally or partially by industry.

PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【29】### Vaccines to prevent influenza in healthy adults\n\n【30】**Review question**\n\n【31】We evaluated the effect of immunisation with influenza vaccines on preventing influenza A or B infections (efficacy), influenza‐like illness (ILI) and its consequences (effectiveness), and determined whether exposure to influenza vaccines is associated with serious or severe harms. The target populations were healthy adults, including pregnant women and newborns.\n\n【32】**Background**\n\n【33】Over 200 viruses cause influenza and ILI, producing the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough and runny noses). Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between them as both last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness. At best, vaccines may only be effective against influenza A and B, which represent about 10% of all circulating viruses. Annually, the World Health Organization estimates which viral strains should be included in the next season's vaccinations.\n\n【34】Inactivated vaccine is prepared by treating influenza viruses with a specific chemical agent that “kills” the virus. Final preparations can contain either the complete viruses (whole vaccine) or the active part of them (split or subunit vaccines). These kind of vaccines are normally intramuscularly administered (parenteral route)\n\n【35】Live attenuated vaccines is prepared by growing the influenza viruses through a series of cell cultures or animal embryos. With each passage, the viruses lose their ability to replicate in human cells but can still stimulate the immune system. Live attenuated vaccine are administered as aerosol in the nostrils (intranasal route).\n\n【36】The virus strains contained in the vaccine are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following epidemic seasons (two type A and one B strains), accordingly to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine).\n\n【37】Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible of the pandemic (i.e. the type A H1N1 for the 2009/2010 pandemic).\n\n【38】**Study characteristics**\n\n【39】The evidence is current to May 2013. In this update, 90 reports of 116 studies compared the effect of influenza vaccine with placebo or no intervention. Sixty‐nine reports were clinical trials (over 70,000 people), 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case‐control studies (nearly 25,000 people). Of the 116 studies, 23 (three case‐control and 20 cohort studies) were performed during pregnancy (about 1.6 million mother‐child couples).\n\n【40】**Key results**\n\n【41】The preventive effect of parenteral inactivated influenza vaccine on healthy adults is small: at least 40 people would need vaccination to avoid one ILI case (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128) and 71 people would need vaccination to prevent one case of influenza (95% CI 64 to 80). Vaccination shows no appreciable effect on working days lost or hospitalisation.\n\n【42】The protection against ILI that is given by the administration of inactivated influenza vaccine to pregnant women is uncertain or at least very limited; the effect on their newborns is not statistically significant.\n\n【43】The effectiveness of live aerosol vaccines on healthy adults is similar to inactivated vaccines: 46 people (95% CI 29 to 115) would need immunisation to avoid one ILI case.\n\n【44】The administration of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is not associated with the onset of multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve of the eye) or immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (a disease that affects blood platelets). The administration of pandemic monovalent H1N1 inactivated vaccine is not associated with Guillain‐Barré syndrome (a disease that affects the nerves of the limbs and body).\n\n【45】Evidence suggests that the administration of both seasonal and 2009 pandemic vaccines during pregnancy has no significant effect on abortion or neonatal death.\n\n【46】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【47】The real impact of biases could not be determined for about 70% of the included studies (e.g. insufficient reporting details, very different scores among the items evaluated). About 20% of the included studies (mainly cohorts) had a high risk of bias. Just under 10% had good methodological quality.\n\n【48】--------------\n\n【49】Authors' conclusions\n### Implications for practice\n\n【50】The results of this review provide no evidence for the utilisation of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure. As healthy adults have a low risk of complications due to respiratory disease, the use of the vaccine may only be advised as an individual protective measure.\n\n【51】### Implications for research\n\n【52】The major differences in effect sizes between outcomes highlight the need for careful consideration of the best study design to assess the effects of public health measures such as vaccination. Large studies, encompassing several influenza seasons, are required to allow assessment of the effect of the vaccines on rare outcomes such as complications and death.\n\n【53】Background\n### Description of the condition\n\n【54】Viral respiratory disease imposes a heavy burden on society. The majority of viral respiratory disease (influenza‐like illness (ILI)) is caused by many different agents that are not clinically distinguishable from one another. A variable proportion of ILI (7% to 15% on average) is caused by influenza viruses and is known as influenza .\n\n【55】Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus of the _Orthomyxoviridae_ family. Three serotypes are known (A, B and C). Influenza causes an acute febrile illness with myalgia, headache and cough. Although the median duration of the acute illness is three days, cough and malaise can persist for weeks. Complications of influenza include otitis media, pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease and bronchiolitis in children. Additionally, influenza can cause a range of non‐respiratory complications including febrile convulsions, Reye's syndrome and myocarditis . Efforts to prevent or minimise the impact of seasonal influenza in the second part of the 20th century centred on the use of vaccines. Due to the yearly changes in viral antigenic configuration and the lack of carry‐over protection from year to year, a new vaccination campaign needs to be organised annually, with a huge scientific and logistic effort to ensure production and delivery of the vaccines.\n\n【56】### Description of the intervention\n\n【57】Currently there are three types of influenza vaccines:\n\n【58】1.  whole virion vaccines which consist of complete viruses that have been 'killed' or inactivated, so that they are not infectious but retain their strain‐specific antigenic properties;\n\n【59】2.  subunit virion vaccines, which are made of surface antigens (H and N) only;\n\n【60】3.  split virion vaccines in which the viral structure is broken up by a disrupting agent.\n\n【61】These vaccines contain both surface and internal antigens. In addition, a variety of non‐European manufacturers produce live attenuated vaccines. Traditionally, whole virion vaccines are thought to be the less well tolerated because of the presence of a lipid stratum on the surface of the viral particles (a remnant of the host cell membrane coating the virion, when budding from the host cell).\n\n【62】Influenza vaccines are produced worldwide. Periodic antigenic drifts and shifts pose problems for vaccine production and procurement, as a new vaccine closely matching the circulating antigenic configuration must be produced and procured for the beginning of each new influenza 'season'. To achieve this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has established a worldwide surveillance system, allowing the identification and isolation of viral strains circulating the different parts of the globe. Sentinel practices recover viral particles from the nasopharynx of patients with influenza‐like symptoms and the samples are swiftly sent to the laboratories of the national influenza centres (110 laboratories in 79 countries). When new strains are detected the samples are sent to one of the four WHO reference centres (London, Atlanta, Tokyo and Melbourne) for antigenic analysis. Information on the circulating strain is then sent to the WHO, which in February of each year recommends, through a committee, the strains to be included in the vaccine for the forthcoming 'season'. Individual governments may or may not follow the WHO recommendations. Australia, New Zealand and, more recently, South Africa follow their own recommendations for vaccine content. Surveillance and early identification thus play a central part in the composition of the vaccine.\n\n【63】### How the intervention might work\n\n【64】Every vaccination campaign has stated aims against which the effects of the campaign must be measured. Perhaps the most detailed document presenting the rationale for a comprehensive preventive programme was that by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP), published in 2006 . The document identified 11 categories of people at high risk of complications from influenza, among which are healthy adults 50 to 65 years of age and healthcare workers. The rationale for policy choices rests on the heavy burden that influenza imposes on the populations and on the benefits accruing from vaccinating them. Reductions in cases and complications (such as excess hospitalisations, absence from work, mortality and healthcare contacts) and the interruption of transmission are the principal arguments for extending vaccination to healthy adults aged 50 to 65 years .\n\n【65】The ACIP 2010 document update recommends routine vaccination for all participants aged six months and older. It underlines the importance of focusing vaccination efforts, when vaccination supplies are limited, on healthy adults who are at increased risk of developing severe complications from influenza, such as:\n\n【66】*   people aged 50 years or over;\n\n【67】*   women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season;\n\n【68】*   healthcare personnel;\n\n【69】*   household contacts and caregivers of children aged below five years and adults aged 50 years or over, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children younger than six months of age; and\n\n【70】*   household contacts and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe complications from influenza .\n\n【71】Pregnant women are included among priority recipients for seasonal influenza immunisation in many countries , because of the risk of influenza‐associated morbidity during pregnancy, the possible adverse neonatal outcomes associated with maternal influenza infections, and based on the evidence that vaccination of pregnant women protects their newborns from influenza and influenza‐related hospitalisations .\n\n【72】Inactivated influenza vaccine could be administered at any stage of pregnancy, whereas live vaccine is not licensed for use during pregnancy as the available data about safety and efficacy in mothers and babies are very limited .\n\n【73】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【74】Given the very high cost of yearly vaccination for large parts of the population, the extreme variability of influenza incidence during each 'season' and the heterogeneity of public health recommendations, we carried out a systematic review of the evidence. To enhance its relevance for decision‐makers, in the 2007 update of the review we included comparative non‐randomised studies reporting evidence of serious or rare harms (or both) . In the present update (2013), we have also included evidence about influenza vaccination in pregnant women and newborns.\n\n【75】Objectives\nTo identify, retrieve and assess all studies evaluating the effects (efficacy, effectiveness and harm) of vaccines against influenza in healthy adults, including pregnant women.\n\n【76】We defined 'effects' as follows:\n\n【77】1.  efficacy as the capacity of the vaccines to prevent influenza A or B and its complications;\n\n【78】2.  effectiveness as the capacity of the vaccines to prevent influenza‐like illness and its consequences; and\n\n【79】3.  harm as any harmful event potentially associated with exposure to influenza vaccines.\n\n【80】Methods\n### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【81】#### Types of studies\n\n【82】Any randomised controlled trial (RCT) or quasi‐RCT comparing influenza vaccines in humans with placebo or no intervention, or comparing types, doses or schedules of influenza vaccine. Only studies assessing protection from exposure to naturally occurring influenza were considered.\n\n【83】Comparative non‐randomised studies were included if they reported evidence on the association between influenza vaccines and serious adverse effects, such as Guillain‐Barré syndrome or oculo‐respiratory syndromes, or if they reported effectiveness or efficacy data for vaccine administration during pregnancy.\n\n【84】We defined as RCTs studies in which it appeared that the individuals (or other experimental units) included in the study were definitely or possibly assigned prospectively to one of two (or more) alternative forms of healthcare using random allocation. A study was quasi‐randomised when it appeared that the individuals (or other experimental units) followed in the study were definitely or possibly assigned prospectively to one of two (or more) alternative forms of healthcare using some quasi‐random method of allocation (such as by alternation, date of birth or case record number).\n\n【85】#### Types of participants\n\n【86】Healthy individuals aged 16 to 65 years, irrespective of influenza immune status. Studies considering more than 25% of individuals outside this age range were excluded from the review. Pregnant women together with their newborns were also included.\n\n【87】#### Types of interventions\n\n【88】Live, attenuated or killed vaccines, or fractions thereof, administered by any route, irrespective of antigenic configuration.\n\n【89】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【90】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【91】###### Clinical\n\n【92】1.  Numbers and seriousness (complications and working days lost) of symptomatic influenza and influenza‐like illness (ILI) cases occurring in vaccine and placebo groups.\n\n【93】###### Harms\n\n【94】1.  Number and seriousness of adverse effects (systemic and severe). Systemic adverse effects include cases of malaise, nausea, fever, arthralgia, rash, headache and more generalised and serious signs, such as neurological harms.\n\n【95】2.  Maternal outcomes and outcomes related to the course of pregnancy. These include abortion (spontaneous, internal, fetal death, stillbirth), preterm birth (less than 37 weeks), maternal death.\n\n【96】3.  Neonatal outcomes: congenital malformations (minor and major), neonatal death.\n\n【97】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【98】1.  Local adverse effects include induration, soreness and redness at the site of inoculation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies to increase TB case detection rate through improving access (geographical, financial, educational) to TB diagnosis at primary healthcare or community level services.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Tuberculosis (TB) is infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis._ In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 8.7 million new cases globally, accounting for 1.4 million deaths . People living in Africa and Asia are most heavily affected, with people infected with TB in India and China alone accounting for almost 40% of the world's TB cases. Africa has around a quarter of the global TB burden, and the highest rates of cases and deaths due to TB infection per capita .\n\n【7】In most people, the initial infection is contained by the immune system which typically forms a granuloma within the lung without the development of symptoms (known as latent TB) . Active TB, where the bacterium is no longer contained by the immune system, can occur at any time after infection and is strongly associated with immune system impairment (for example, HIV infection, malnutrition, diabetes, and others). However, most adults with active TB do not have these risk factors . Pulmonary TB (infection of the lungs) is the most common form and also the most infectious, as transmission from person‐to‐person occurs through inhalation of respiratory droplets expelled from people infected with TB when coughing or sneezing .\n\n【8】Guidelines in high TB burden countries generally advise that health workers should suspect pulmonary TB when a person presents with a cough lasting for more than two weeks . Typically however, the cough is present for much longer than this before patients seek care and are accurately diagnosed . Delays in seeking care may be due to stigma around the disease, the patient's perception of the severity of their illness, the distance to health services, the affordability of health services, and local perceptions of the quality of care provided . Similarly, delays in providing a diagnosis once the patient presents may be influenced by the level of training of the health worker, their experience with diagnosing TB, and the availability of appropriate tests and treatment .\n\n【9】Once suspected, pulmonary TB may be diagnosed through a mixture of tests including chest radiography (CXR), sputum smear microscopy, sputum culture, and more recently a new DNA amplification test: Xpert® MTB/RIF . Although sputum culture remains the gold‐standard diagnostic test, a result can take up to eight weeks due to the slow growth of the bacterium, and treatment is often started before the result is received . Treatment of drug sensitive pulmonary TB requires patients to take a combination of medicines for six to nine months .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Pulmonary TB is usually diagnosed when symptomatic individuals visit fixed healthcare services. This has been termed 'passive case detection' where the health workers play no role in the health‐seeking behaviour of the patient. Concerns about the major discrepancy between the number of cases estimated to occur each year and the number of cases reported (up to one third of the cases), delayed diagnosis increasing transmission, and a growing desire to tackle the global epidemic head‐on have led to the promotion of more 'active' approaches to seek out early or undiagnosed TB cases amongst their communities .\n\n【12】Two terms are now used commonly in the literature: 'Active case‐finding' which is typically interpreted as 'systematic screening of populations', and 'Enhanced case‐finding' which is harder to define but typically involves a lower degree of effort . The interventions included under these terms are highly variable, and often multifaceted, containing elements which reduce multiple barriers to accessing care. For example, programmes which systematically screen households for TB will typically improve TB diagnostic skills among health workers (through training), reduce the financial costs of attending healthcare (by providing the initial screening test at the patients home), as well as overcome any barriers related to patient awareness of the severity of their illness, and any stigma related to the disease. As the barriers to accessing a TB diagnosis vary considerably between settings, successful programmes will need to both be aware of the local problems, and be designed specifically to overcome them.\n\n【13】For the purposes of this Cochrane Review, we will therefore consider any intervention by health services which aims to improve access to a TB diagnosis by providing improved diagnostic services at primary healthcare or community level.\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Community‐based interventions may initially increase TB case detection by: 1) identifying people with early TB who are not yet sufficiently unwell to seek care; or 2) identifying people with advanced TB who would not have presented to health services of their own accord .\n\n【16】Logic model showing the additional cases that would never present passively and long term impact on lowering TB prevalence and incidence\n\n【17】People who present late to health services, when the disease is severe, tend to have poorer health outcomes . Decreasing the time to diagnosis could therefore translate into improved health outcomes for people with TB. These may be disease‐related outcomes, such as cure or death, but could also be socioeconomic outcomes, such as reduced time off work, or reduced loss of earnings. Although diagnosing patients early could reduce transmission, one concern that has been raised is that diagnosing people early may in fact lead to higher levels of default from treatment, with subsequent increased spread of resistance.\n\n【18】Although the aim of these interventions is to increase TB case detection in the short‐term, the long‐term aim is a reduction in community transmission of TB, and a consequent fall in TB incidence and case detection .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】This Cochrane Review will increase our understanding of different community‐based interventions in the control of TB that will inform and shape the policy that aims at increasing TB case detection.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies to increase TB case detection rate through improving access (geographical, financial, educational) to TB diagnosis at primary healthcare or community level services.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for which the unit of randomization is the individual or cluster.\n\n【27】We will also include non‐RCTs with parallel control groups (that is, controlled before‐and‐after studies).\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】People living in areas with moderate to high TB prevalence.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】##### Intervention\n\n【32】Any intervention that aims to improve access to a TB diagnosis by providing diagnostic services at primary healthcare or community level.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for preventing the recurrence of any peripheral vascular thrombosis (arterial or venous, or both) in patients with Antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) or 'Hughes syndrome' is a prothrombotic disorder characterized by vascular thrombosis (venous or arterial, or both) or pregnancy complications, or both, in association with persistently positive antiphospholipid auto‐antibodies (aPLs), namely lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) or anti‐β <sub>2 </sub> glycoprotein I (β <sub>2 </sub> GPI) antibodies . These auto‐antibodies bind to plasma proteins found on negatively‐charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin, which contribute to the formation of thrombi and subsequently thromboembolism.\n\n【7】The syndrome can be categorized as primary APS (PAPS), where there is no association with other known autoimmune diseases , or as APS associated to other diseases — particularly autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other less common disorders, such as systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or Behçet's syndrome . Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is another type of APS, associated with high mortality, where blood clots appear in multiple small vascular beds that lead to multiple organ failure .\n\n【8】Thrombosis (both venous and arterial) is one of the two major clinical features in both the Sapporo  and Sydney  classification criterion of APS. Initially thrombosis was documented as the most frequent clinical event (30%) in APS patients . After 17 years of initial assessment, Cervera 2002 established deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as the most commonly observed clinical manifestation followed by thrombocytopaenia, livedo reticularis, stroke, superficial thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), fetal loss and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Again in 2005, thrombosis (both venous and arterial), was the most common clinical manifestation related to highest morbidity . Venous thrombosis accounts for approximately two‐thirds of all the thromboembolic events, represented mainly by DVT of the legs and PE . During the course of the disease, approximately 55% of patients with APS suffer from DVT of the extremities and 40% suffer PE . In the Euro‐Phospholipid project, DVT of the lower extremities was the most common clinical manifestation of APS. However, any tissue or organ vascular bed can be affected. During the 10‐year period study on 1000 patients across 13 European countries (Euro‐Phospholipid project), thrombosis was the most frequent manifestation (28.1%) with 5.3% stroke, 4.7% TIA, 4.3% DVT, 3.5% PE, 8.1% livedo reticularis and 3.1% skin ulcer . The incidence of first thrombosis was as high as 5.3% per year when the patient was detected with all three aPLs (triple positivity) . Approximately 9.5% APS patients with DVT exhibited aPLs .The recurrence of thrombosis in APS patients is a common phenomenon with high occurrence rate. A study with APS patients (N = 147) revealed 69% recurrence (undergoing treatment with warfarin or low dose aspirin, or both) of thrombosis (52% arterial, 40% venous and both 8%), which took place within an average duration of 12 months from the first occurrence . Another study (N = 114) showed recurrent thrombosis occurred in 10.7% of participants assigned to receive high intensity amounts of warfarin and in 3.4% of participants who were assigned to take moderate intensity amounts of warfarin .\n\n【9】Even though the prevalence of positive aPLs in the general population is as high as 5%, only a few individuals develop APS. The prevalence of APS is 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people per year. The incidence is approximately five new cases per 100,000 people per year . The male:female ratio was estimated to be 1:3.5 for PAPS and 1:7 for APS associated to other diseases . However, another study (N = 121) estimated the male:female ratio as almost 1:1 . The total mortality rate during a 10‐year observational period with APS patients was 9.3%. However, in the case of CAPS it was up to 55.6%. The most common cause of death was bacterial infection (21.5%), followed by myocardial infarction (13.9%), stroke (11.8%), hemorrhage (10.7%), malignancy (13.9%), CAPS (5.4%) and PE (5.4%) .\n\n【10】A strong association between aPLs and thrombosis has already been established; however the pathogenic role of aPLs in the development of thrombosis is yet to be clarified. According to the latest classification criteria , the presence of either of the three aPLs is considered a positive laboratory feature for confirming APS. However, there is a tendency of higher occurrences of thrombotic events when multiple aPLs are present . So far, several discrete pathways have been described as the potential pathogenic mechanisms of thrombosis in APS. In thrombi generation, different studies have indicated the pivotal roles of APS associated autoantibodies which direct against a number of plasma proteins and proteins expressed on, or bound to, the surface of vascular endothelial cells or platelets . The aPLs have crucial effects upon platelet activation and pathways of coagulation including procoagulant actions of these antibodies upon protein C, annexin V, serum proteases, toll‐like receptors, tissue factor and via impaired fibrinolysis . Changes in the behavior of cells and the secretion of various immune‐associated molecules occur due to the involvement of aPLs in clinically‐important normal procoagulant and anticoagulant reactions. This might be the basis of possible mechanisms by which aPLs can lead to the development of thrombotic events in APS patients .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】The optimal treatment for APS is still unclear. Currently the regimens used for the treatment of APS include warfarin antiplatelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel) an low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) , which is the same as the treatment offered to the general population presenting with thrombotic events . Among the newly licensed (European Medical Agency) and approved (Food and Drug Administration) oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and dabigatran are well‐known . These agents, unlike warfarin, are fixed dose with predictable anticoagulant effects and there is no need to monitor anticoagulant intensities routinely. These do not interact with dietary constituents or alcohol, and have a few reported drug interactions that affect anticoagulant intensity .\n\n【13】#### Warfarin\n\n【14】Warfarin is one of the most widely used anticoagulants internationally and is typically used to prevent thrombosis and thromboembolism. After oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and reaches maximal blood concentrations in healthy adults after 90 minutes . It is a racemic mixture of two active stereoisomers (R and S) with a half‐life of 36 to 42 hours. It circulates by binding with plasma proteins (mainly albumin) and accumulates in the liver where metabolic transformation takes place mainly by different cytochrome P450 enzymes via different pathways . A recommended international normalized ratio (INR) intensity is between 2.0 and 3.0. However, patients with APS may require a higher targeted INR than 2.0 to 3.0 . A retrospective study with APS patients showed higher efficacy of anticoagulation to a target INR greater than 3.0 in preventing recurrent thrombosis compared with other regimes including standard intensity ( _i.e._ target INR 2.0 to 3.0) anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy . Recently, long‐term anticoagulation has also been recommended in APS with thrombosis to prevent recurrences . Warfarin may cause severe bleeding that can be life‐threatening and even can cause death .\n\n【15】#### Heparin\n\n【16】Heparin is another common (injectable) anticoagulant which is widely used. The bioavailability of LMWH is 100% , and the half‐life is four to five hours . In the treatment of APS the dose of LMWH (enoxaparin) is usually 1 mg/kg/day . In patients with thrombosis who receive high doses, heparin‐induced bleeding, thrombocytopaenia and increased transaminases are the most common adverse effects .\n\n【17】#### Rivaroxaban\n\n【18】Rivaroxaban is absorbed rapidly with no effect of food on absorption or pharmacokinetic parameters. The maximum plasma concentrations peak is observed at one to four hours . A 10 mg tablet has a bioavailability of approximately 80% . In young adults the plasma elimination half‐life is five to nine hours and 11 to 13 hours in older people (due to the age‐related renal dysfunctions) . It is metabolized via CYP3A4, CYP2J2 and CYP‐independent mechanisms . Even though serious and fatal bleeding are quite uncommon, higher rates of bleeding in the GI tract are commonly seen . A recent case series (n = 8) revealed that there was no recurrence of thrombotic events in any of the APS patients during treatment (nine to 36 months) with rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) . However, according to another case series (n = 8), a decreased protective effect of rivaroxaban was observed in APS patients with triple positivity (LA, aCL and β <sub>2 </sub> GPI). Therefore, until the results of an ongoing trial (randomized controlled phase II/III clinical trial) on rivaroxaban are available , the efficacy of rivaroxaban remains inconclusive.\n\n【19】#### Apixaban\n\n【20】Apixaban is an anticoagulant drug with rapid oral absorption. Maximum plasma concentrations peak is achieved by one to three hours after administration . Apixaban has a bioavailability of approximately 66% . The drug has an elimination half‐life of eight to 15 hours in healthy young adults . Apixaban is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4 and also to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2J2 . For the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is suggested . Apixaban has a lower risk of bleeding when compared with warfarin . According to a recent report , recurrence of thrombosis was not observed in a patient with APS (suffering from venous thrombosis in presence of LA and aCL (both IgG and IgM)) treated with apixaban (5 mg three times a day). However, until the results of an ongoing prospective pilot study  (randomized open‐label blinded) in APS patients are available, the efficacy of apixaban in prevention of secondary thrombotic events remains unclear.\n\n【21】#### Edoxaban\n\n【22】Edoxaban is another new anticoagulant drug that shows rapid oral absorption, with the maximum plasma concentrations achieved at one to two hours after administration. It has a bioavailability of approximately 60% with a mean half‐life of six to 10 hours in healthy young adults. Edoxaban is metabolized via CYP3A4 with an oral bioavailability of approximately 60%. For preventing VTE, 30 mg edoxaban is given once daily . The most prevalent adverse effect observed was bleeding .\n\n【23】#### Dabigatran\n\n【24】Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant drug with low bioavailability (approximately 6% to 7%) . It has a half‐life of 12 to 14 hours and the maximum plasma peak is achieved within two hours of oral administration . Dabigatran is not metabolized by the CYP enzymes. However, it is a substrate for the P‐glycoprotein transporter and mainly excreted by the kidneys . The usual recommended oral dose of dabigatran is 110 mg or 150 mg, twice daily and the common adverse effect is bleeding . Some studies indicate dabigatran is a successful new oral anticoagulant drug in the prevention of recurrence of thrombotic events in patients with APS , while others show dabigatran is unsuccessful in preventing recurrent thrombosis in APS patients  or report adverse neurological abnormalities such as acute vision changes, transient weakness, presyncopal events and memory loss .\n\n【25】#### Aspirin\n\n【26】Aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) is an antiplatelet agent which is commonly used to prevent thrombosis. When it is administered orally, it reaches its peak plasma level approximately 30 to 40 minutes after ingestion and is rapidly absorbed in the stomach and upper GI tract . Measurable inhibition of platelet function achieved within 60 minutes after aspirin ingestion . Enteric‐coating of aspirin significantly delays the time (three to four hours) to reach its peak plasma effect . The plasma half‐life of aspirin is only 20 minutes. The oral bioavailability of regular aspirin tablets is approximately 40% to 50% over a wide range of doses . Aspirin acts on platelet function by permanently inactivating a key platelet enzyme, cyclooxygenase (COX) . However, this effect can be reversed by the generation of new platelets . After a single dose of aspirin, platelet COX activity recovers by approximately 10% per day due to platelet turnover , therefore, once‐daily dosage is required. Results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that aspirin is an effective antithrombotic agent when the dosage is between 50 and 100 mg/day, and the suggestible effective dosage is as low as 30 mg/day . The major adverse effect of aspirin administration is an increased risk of bleeding complications, most commonly GI tract bleeding . Administration of nonselective reversible COX inhibitors ( _i.e._ ibuprofen and naproxen) with aspirin results in competition for a common docking site (arginine 120) within the COX channel. This may impair the efficacy of aspirin . Clinicians usually recommend low‐dose aspirin for the primary prevention of thrombosis in asymptomatic patients with moderate to high levels of aPLs . Recently a patient with APS suffering from livedoid vasculitis was successfully treated with aspirin (100 mg/day) in combination with warfarin (2 mg/day) to prevent the recurrence of thrombosis .\n\n【27】#### Clopidogrel\n\n【28】Prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS is also managed by an antiplatelet agent known as clopidogrel . Clopidogrel is a prodrug (a precursor chemical compound of a drug) which is rapidly absorbed in the intestine and is activated in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5) . It is undetectable in human plasma, with a half‐life of approximately six hours after a single oral dose of 75 mg . Bleeding is one of the most common adverse effects of clopidogrel . When clopidogrel was used in combination with hydroxychloroquine, recurrence of thrombotic events and bleeding episodes were not observed in a patient with APS .\n\n【29】### How the intervention might work\n\n【30】#### Warfarin\n\n【31】Vitamin K is an essential co‐factor for normal blood coagulation in the postribosomal synthesis of biologically‐active forms of the calcium‐dependent clotting factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X, as well as the regulatory factors protein C, protein S and protein Z . The vitamin K‐dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X contain a series of glutamate residues at their amino terminus. For proper functioning of the clotting factors, during posttranslational modification (in the liver), the glutamate residues are carboxylated and converted to γ‐carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in the presence of O <sub>2 </sub> , CO <sub>2 </sub> and carboxylase enzyme. The carboxylation process is associated with the vitamin K cycle where oxidation of vitamin K produces vitamin K epoxide (vitamin KO). Vitamin KO is converted back to vitamin K by the enzyme vitamin KO reductase (VKOR). Warfarin interferes in the action of VKOR so that vitamin KO cannot be recycled back to vitamin, thus reducing the availability of vitamin K and the production of blood clotting factors. Due to this disruption, blood clotting and the risk of thrombi generation can be reduced .\n\n【32】#### Heparin\n\n【33】Under normal circumstances, antithrombin III (ATIII) inactivates coagulation enzymes thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. This process occurs at a slow rate. When heparin is administered, it reversibly binds to ATIII and accelerates the rate of coagulation enzymes inactivation by ATIII. The rate of inactivation of these enzymes by ATIII can increase by up to 1000‐fold due to the binding of heparin. Thus the mechanism of action of heparin is ATIII‐dependent. It also prevents the progression of existing clots by inhibiting further clotting .\n\n【34】#### Rivaroxaban\n\n【35】Factor Xa (FXa) is an essential blood coagulation factor that is responsible for the initiation of the coagulation cascade. FXa activates prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Thrombin (a serine protease) then converts fibrinogen to fibrin in the coagulation cascade to activate platelets. Stabilization of the platelet aggregation by fibrin mesh ultimately leads to clot formation. Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant which directly and irreversibly binds to factor Xa. Thereafter, it effectively blocks the amplification of the thrombin generation and prevents the formation of thrombus .\n\n【36】#### Apixaban\n\n【37】Apixaban exerts no direct effect on platelet aggregation. It acts by inhibiting coagulation through direct, selective and reversible inhibition of free and clot‐bound FXa. It has moderate selectivity for clot‐bound over free FXa. Thus apixaban indirectly decreases platelet formation induced by thrombin  **.**\n\n【38】#### Edoxaban\n\n【39】Edoxaban is also a direct inhibitor of FXa (acting as an activator of prothrombinase in converting prothrombin to thrombin) that rapidly and selectively inhibits both free and cell‐bound FXa in a concentration‐dependent manner. Eventually thrombin cannot be formed because of the inhibited FXa, and clot formation is prevented following the same mechanism as rivaroxaban and apixaban .\n\n【40】#### Dabigatran\n\n【41】Dabigatran etexilate is an inactive pro‐drug that is converted to dabigatran (the active form) by esterase‐catalysed hydrolysis in the plasma and liver. It is a rapid‐acting competitive, selective, reversible and direct inhibitor of both free and clot‐bound thrombin (factor IIa) which acts by binding to the active site of the thrombin molecule. Inhibition of thrombin consequently prevents thrombus development by inhibiting fibrin formation in the coagulation cascade. Thus dabigatran inhibits thrombin‐induced platelet aggregation and the formation of blood clots .\n\n【42】#### Aspirin\n\n【43】Thromboxane A <sub>2 </sub> (TXA <sub>2 </sub> ) is a type of thromboxane which is produced by activated platelets. It stimulates activation of new platelets and increases platelet aggregation. COX is the key enzyme that catalyses the production of TXA <sub>2 </sub> from arachidonic acid in platelets. When aspirin is taken as an antiplatelet agent, it directly and irreversibly inactivates the COX enzyme through acetylation so that COX further cannot activate TXA <sub>2. </sub> As a result, platelet aggregation is inhibited, resulting in less blood clot or thrombi generation .\n\n【44】#### Clopidogrel\n\n【45】Clopidogel specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y <sub>12 </sub> subtype of ADP receptor on the platelet cell membrane, and thus obstructs the binding of ADP to its receptor, blocks ADP‐mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex (major fibrinogen receptor by which fibrinogen binds to platelets and causes platelet aggregation by cross‐linking) and consequently hinders the platelets activation and aggregation . Thus it reduces the probability of clot formation as well as the chance of thrombosis.\n\n【46】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【47】Several treatment guidelines have recommended warfarin and aspirin as thrombotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS . However, there is still uncertainty in choosing the appropriate intervention to avoid recurrence of peripheral vascular thrombosis in APS. There is a Cochrane systematic review on aspirin and/or heparin intervention on recurrent miscarriages of APS patients . However, the efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimens to prevent recurrent peripheral vascular thrombosis remains obscure. A systematic review based on RCTs is required to evaluate the comparative efficacy between antiplatelet and anticoagulant regiments for preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS.\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】To assess the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for preventing the recurrence of any peripheral vascular thrombosis (arterial or venous, or both) in patients with Antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n【50】Methods\n-------\n\n【51】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【52】#### Types of studies\n\n【53】We will include all RCTs or quasi‐RCTs.

If urinary incontinence is also present, it is known as OAB‐wet, while if not, it is termed OAB‐dry. OAB has a negative impact on quality of life .\n\n【19】The International Continence Society defines OAB as the presence of urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology . Some conditions are commonly associated with OAB, such as neurologic injuries and diseases, urinary tract infection, bladder inflammation and bladder outlet obstruction. Urinary symptoms occur as a result of spontaneous detrusor contractions increasing the intravesical pressure during bladder filling. This may be caused by disturbances in nerves, smooth muscles or urothelium . Among the different urinary symptoms, subjective symptom of urgency is the main symptom or parameter that should be measured in the diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment for patients with OAB .\n\n【20】According to the report of the 5 <sup>th </sup> International Consultation on Incontinence, the worldwide estimated prevalence of OAB is between 12% and 17% . The prevalence of OAB increases with age; in addition, it has been confirmed that OAB in general is prevalent among population over 40 years of age in both sexes . In the United States, the National Overactive Bladder Evaluation (NOBLE) program conducted a study which showed a prevalence of 16.9% in women and 16% in men . In Europe, the overall prevalence is 16.6% with similar rates in men and women . Abrams 2012 included four population‐based surveys including the Epidemiology of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) (EpiLUTS) study, storage symptoms were reported more frequently in women compared to men: urgency (35.7% vs 22.4%), frequency (24.6% vs 20.5%), and nocturia (75.8% vs 69.4%).\n\n【21】#### Treatment options for OAB\n\n【22】Behavioral therapy is the first‐line therapy for patients with OAB. Patients are educated regarding bladder training, bladder control strategies, pelvic floor muscle training and fluid management.\n\n【23】The current first‐line pharmacologic treatment for OAB is antimuscarinic drugs such as darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium or propiverine . These agents affect the efferent control of the detrusor muscles by antagonising the cholinergic muscarinic receptors. This blocks the parasympathetic impulses and inhibits detrusor muscle contraction. However, antimuscarinic agents can cause adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.\n\n【24】Other treatment options are intermittent catheterisation, sacral neuromodulation and posterior tibial nerve stimulation . Onabotulinumtoxin A was also recently approved by regulatory authorities as a treatment for OAB among patients who do not respond or has inadequate response to anticholinergics .\n\n【25】Cochrane systematic reviews are available covering many of the treatment options mentioned above: anticholinergics , pelvic floor muscle training , bladder training , intermittent catheterisation , sacral neuromodulation (implanted) , and onabotulinumtoxin A .\n\n【26】### Description of the intervention\n\n【27】In June 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new drug class, beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists, for the treatment of OAB. This emerging drug class is represented by mirabegron, ritobegron, and solabegron . It acts by relaxing the detrusor muscle during the storage phase of the urinary bladder by activation of beta‐3 adrenergic receptors, thereby increasing bladder capacity . The effect of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists is through inhibition of the bladder afferent nerves, thereby improving the symptom of urgency, which, as mentioned, is the key symptom in the diagnosis and monitoring response of OAB.\n\n【28】### How the intervention might work\n\n【29】Beta‐adrenergic receptors are classified into three subtypes (beta‐1, beta‐2 and beta‐3) . Cellular and messenger RNA expression studies have identified that majority of the beta‐adrenergic receptors in the human detrusor muscle are of the beta‐3 subtype, which was also found to promote detrusor relaxation and aid urine storage . Hence, it was postulated as a novel drug class stimulating this receptor may have therapeutic potential, particularly in patients with storage symptoms .\n\n【30】Several randomised controlled trials have shown significant reduction of OAB symptoms among patients with moderate to severe symptoms over at least an eight‐week treatment period with beta‐adrenergic receptor agonists . Dose‐dependent improvement (reduction) in the number of micturition episodes have been reported with good safety and tolerability . Moreover, Its efficacy and safety in controlling OAB symptoms on outcomes such as frequency and incontinence, showed fewer incidences of the antimuscarinic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation compared to placebo and other drugs . However, adverse effects such as hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection and headache have been reported in some particular types of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists .\n\n【31】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【32】Beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists is a new drug class that has a promising effect and potential for use in the treatment of OAB. As mentioned, a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted using these drugs. However, only a small difference in the efficacy of such agents was noted when compared to anticholinergics and other treatment options. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the associated adverse events related to its use were also noted in the trials. A meta‐analysis of these trials may provide a clearer picture of the efficacy and tolerability profile of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists, particularly when compared to other treatment options. This will better guide clinicians on its utility in the treatment of OAB.\n\n【33】Objectives\n----------\n\n【34】### General objective\n\n【35】*   Yo assess the overall effects of treatment with beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists in adults with OAB by doing a systematic review and meta‐analysis of all available RCTs.\n\n【36】### Specific objectives\n\n【37】*   To compare the efficacy and safety of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists as an intervention for adult patients with OAB through assessing its effect on the symptoms of urgency, incontinence, nocturia and frequency by making the following comparisons:\n\n【38】    *   beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists versus placebo or no treatment;\n\n【39】    *   beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists versus conservative physical treatments (e.g. bladder training, urge suppression, pelvic floor muscle training).\n\n【40】    *   beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists versus anticholinergic/antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. tolterodine, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine);\n\n【41】    *   beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists versus intravesical Onabotulinumtoxin A injection;\n\n【42】    *   beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonists versus electrical stimulation (non‐invasive or implanted);\n\n【43】    *   one dose regimen of a beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonist versus another;\n\n【44】    *   one frequency of administration of a beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonist versus another;\n\n【45】    *   one route of administration of a beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonist versus another;\n\n【46】    *   one type of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonist versus another.\n\n【47】Methods\n-------\n\n【48】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【49】#### Types of studies\n\n【50】All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs comparing the effectiveness of beta‐3 adrenergic receptor agonist versus currently‐available treatments (pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic) for OAB.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess then relationship of iron, both dietary intake and endogenous body iron stores to the risk of developing colorectal cancer in humas.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Iron is an element essential for mammalian life, being involved not just in oxygen transport but many other functions, some of which include normal growth, oxidative phosphorylation, immune competence and even intellectual development. Iron can also accelerate oxidative damage for macro molecules leading both to inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Because of the high concentration of iron in the human colon, it became natural to consider whether or not iron might be involved in the initiation or promotion of colonic disease. Graf and Eton were the first cogently to suggest this in an editorial in which they posited that dietary fiber, if indeed it diminished the colorectal cancer risk, did so not by accelerating colonic transit or altering colonic pH, but by chelation of dietary iron by the phytic acid component of fiber . That editorial stated that correction of studies relating dietary fiber to colorectal cancer risk for the phytate content of the fiber lead to more consistent results than had been previously reported relating to fiber's ability to diminish colorectal cancer risk. Though many studies have been published since 1985 examining the relationship of dietary fiber to colorectal cancer or colorectal adenomas in humans, including several randomized controlled clinical trials varying fiber ingestion, this key relationship of phytate content in fiber in human epidemiologic studies has for the most part been ignored .  \nNevertheless, in vitro studies and in vivo interventions in laboratory animals have since 1985 consistently supported the role of iron in colorectal cancer risk by the mechanism of augmented oxygen radical synthesis and the role of phytate in reversing the augmentation of tumor risk caused by iron. These studies are well summarized elsewhere . What has not been cohesively presented, is an analysis of the human epidemiologic studies that have examined the relationship of iron (dietary or endogenous) to colorectal neoplastic risk. Many authors have followed Graf and Eton's lead, correlating iron nutriture with colorectal neoplastic risk in a large variety of study designs .

Children's rights to have their views heard in matters that affect their lives are now well established since the publication of the UN Convention treaty (1989). Children with cancer generally prefer to be involved in decision‐making and consider it important that they have the opportunity to take part in decision‐making concerning their health care, even in end‐of‐life decisions. There is considerable support for involving children in healthcare decision‐making at a level commensurate with their experience, age and abilities. Thus, healthcare professionals and parents need to know how they should involve children in decision‐making and what interventions are most effective in promoting SDM for children with cancer.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To examine the effects of SDM interventions on the process of SDM for children with cancer who are aged four to 18 years.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the following sources for the review: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1); PubMed (NLM) (1946 to February 2016); Embase (Ovid) (1974 to February 2016); CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to February 2016); ERIC (ProQuest) (1966 to February 2016); PsycINFO (EBSCO) (1806 to February 2016); BIOSIS (Thomson Reuters) (1980 to December 2009 ‐ subscription ceased at that date); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1637 to February 2016); and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest) (1952 to February 2016). In addition we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles and the following conference proceedings (2005 up to and including 2015): American Academy on Communication in Healthcare (AACH), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), European CanCer Organisation (ECCO), European Association for Communication in Healthcare (EACH), International Conference on Communication in Healthcare (ICCH), International Shared Decision Making Conference (ISDM), Annual Conference of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM). We scanned the ISRCTN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number) register and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Register for ongoing trials on 29 February 2016.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】For this update, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of SDM interventions for children with cancer aged four to 18 years. The types of decisions included were: treatment, health care and research participation decisions. The primary outcome was SDM as measured with any validated scale.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors undertook the searches, and three review authors independently assessed the studies obtained. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】No studies met the inclusion criteria, and hence no analysis could be undertaken.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】No conclusions can be made on the effects of interventions to promote SDM for children with cancer aged four to 18 years. This review has highlighted the dearth of high‐quality quantitative research on interventions to promote participation in SDM for children with cancer. There are many potential reasons for the lack of SDM intervention studies with children. Attitudes towards children's participation are slowly changing in society and such changes may take time to be translated or adopted in healthcare settings. The priority may be on developing interventions that promote children's participation in communication interactions since information‐sharing is a prerequisite for SDM. Restricting this review to RCTs was a limitation and extending the review to non‐randomised studies (NRS) may have produced more evidence. For this update, we included only RCTs and CCTs. Clearly more research is needed.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Cancer\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Support For Family Decision Making Process\n*   Shared Decision Making\n*   Decision Making Encouragement\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Finding Related To Ability To Use Decision Making Strategies\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### Ways of helping children with cancer to take part in decisions about their health care\n\n【23】**Review question**\n\n【24】We reviewed the evidence about what helps children with cancer to take part in decisions about their health care. We found no studies.\n\n【25】**Background**\n\n【26】Cancer is a serious illness that involves complex treatments with unpleasant side effects. Children with cancer generally prefer to be involved in some way in decisions about their care and treatment. Involving children in decisions about their health care can help their understanding of the disease and treatment, reduce their fears, help them feel more prepared and to cope better with their cancer.\n\n【27】**Study characteristics**\n\n【28】The evidence is current to 29 February 2016. We did not find any studies that helped children to participate in decision‐making with parents and healthcare staff.\n\n【29】**Key results**\n\n【30】At the moment, there is no evidence on ways of helping children with cancer take part in decisions about their health care. We need more high‐quality research before definitive conclusions can be made.\n\n【31】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【32】Not applicable as no eligible studies were found.\n\n【33】--------------\n\n【34】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【35】### Implications for practice\n\n【36】This update of the review has highlighted the dearth of high‐quality quantitative research on interventions to promote participation in shared decision‐making (SDM) for children with cancer. It remains unclear what factors promote the SDM approach and what interventions are effective and suitable for children. Based on the currently available evidence it is not possible to give recommendations for clinical practice.\n\n【37】### Implications for research\n\n【38】More research in needed to investigate the effects of interventions that promote participation in SDM for children with cancer. New studies should be randomised controlled trials. Identifying such interventions will provide reassurance and guidance, and potentially contribute to successful communication between children, parents and the healthcare team. The interventions should be developed with the support of children and also should draw upon existing research, which reports the needs and preferences of children with cancer about SDM . Research on SDM for children with other chronic illnesses may add useful information . Tailoring the interventions to children's preferences may help make the intervention more acceptable to children with cancer. SDM for children with cancer should be promoted as a positive end in itself rather than a means to achieve other ends desired by healthcare staff such as patient compliance.\n\n【39】Including children in healthcare SDM is an area that is relatively under‐researched and underdeveloped but over time we should see more research occurring. Advances in technology will potentially lead to more developments of multi‐media interventions to promote communication and SDM for children with chronic illnesses. A large number of patient decision aids has been developed for adults , and similar work needs to be done for children and young people. Studies are needed to identify how new multi‐media innovations can support information exchange between children and healthcare professionals. Children are more familiar with new technologies and may prefer to receive information about their disease and treatments via an information technology medium .\n\n【40】Background\n----------\n\n【41】### Description of the condition\n\n【42】#### Participation in health matters\n\n【43】Children's rights to have their views heard in matters that affect their lives are now well established since the publication of the UN Convention treaty . There is considerable support for involving children in the healthcare decision‐making process, and a dearth of well‐articulated reasons to exclude them. Children's participation in health matters has been demonstrated to increase internal locus of control and decision‐making ability , promote preparedness , decrease fears and concerns , increase adherence , reduce healthcare use , and promote satisfaction with health care . Lack of involvement can have adverse consequences such as increased fears and anxieties, reduced self‐esteem, depersonalisation and feeling unprepared for procedures . Children who are not involved may assume their views are unimportant or irrelevant and may not seek to share their views in future . Therefore, key documents emphasise the importance of children's participation in decision‐making at a level commensurate with their experience, age and abilities .\n\n【44】#### Childhood cancers\n\n【45】This review focused on shared decision‐making (SDM) for children with cancer. There are 12 major types of childhood cancer but leukaemias (blood cell cancers) and cancers of the brain and central nervous system account for more than half of the new cases diagnosed. The most common type of leukaemia is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The most common tumours are brain tumours (for example, gliomas and medulloblastomas). The other solid tumours are less common (for example, neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma). With significant medical advances in recent years, increasingly, children are surviving cancer. Survival rates vary greatly according to the type of childhood cancer diagnosed. The mean five‐year survival rate for all of the major childhood cancers among children aged under 15 years is now approximately 80% for children diagnosed in 1996 to 2004 .\n\n【46】#### Information sharing and decision‐making\n\n【47】Cancer is a potentially life‐threatening illness where important decisions are made at key points in the disease process. In many cases, several treatment options exist with different possible outcomes and substantial uncertainty. It is important for children's psychological welfare that they are allowed a collaborative role in decision‐making. Children with cancer generally prefer to be involved in decision‐making , and consider it important that they have the opportunity to take part in the decisions concerning their health care, even in end‐of‐life decisions . It appears that children with cancer cope better with their illness when provided with developmentally appropriate information at different stages of the illness trajectory . Current guidelines in paediatric oncology advocate that healthcare professionals encourage children to participate in medical decisions according to their developmental level and to share developmentally relevant information that will improve children's ability to participate in the decision‐making process . Information sharing is a prerequisite to SDM , but communication with children about their disease, treatment and care provision is often poorly performed in practice .\n\n【48】#### Participation in shared decision‐making\n\n【49】Health professionals and parents play an important role in communication interactions and can either facilitate or obstruct children's participation in decision‐making . Although SDM is increasingly valued, children's participation in SDM may be limited because cancer is a life‐threatening condition and treatment 'has to be' administered . It is further complicated by issues such as: adults' concerns about children's competence to participate, a desire to protect children from distressing information and the burden of decision‐making, and the child's position in the three‐way relationship (parent‐child‐healthcare professional) . Research in primary care settings has revealed a variety of ways in which doctors and parents frequently constrain children's participation in triadic interactions . Research with adolescents with cancer found that they struggle to assert their independence in decision‐making and dislike loss of control .\n\n【50】### Description of the intervention\n\n【51】Any intervention for SDM for children with cancer. The interventions should focus primarily on children, but can also include carers, parents and health providers. The term 'parent' refers to a parent or the person or guardian serving in the parental role. For convenience, we will use the term 'parent' in all circumstances.\n\n【52】#### Defining shared decision‐making\n\n【53】Although significant conceptual work has taken place to define SDM many inconsistent definitions currently exist, which means that the concept is open to different interpretations . One conceptual framework has identified the core aspects of SDM . Drawing on this work, SDM is defined as having four necessary characteristics.\n\n【54】*   SDM involves at least two participants, the healthcare professional and child, and can involve three: healthcare professional, parent and child.\n\n【55】*   Both the healthcare professional and child share information with each other.\n\n【56】*   Both the healthcare professional and child take steps to participate in the treatment decision‐making process by expressing treatment preferences.\n\n【57】*   A treatment decision is made and both the healthcare professional and child agree to the decision.\n\n【58】### How the intervention might work\n\n【59】Interventions used to help children make shared decisions may consist of those aimed at improving information exchange, understanding and communication; and those aimed at encouraging children to participate in decision‐making. The interventions may aim to enhance children's abilities to participate in SDM, or they might be interventions targeted at healthcare professionals or parents, or both, to encourage them to include children with cancer in the decision‐making process. For example, some interventions may help children to understand options and consequences while others may focus on developing children's skills. Other interventions may focus on educating parents and healthcare professionals and improving their motivation and skills to support children's participation.\n\n【60】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【61】Despite increasing interest in children's participation in decision‐making, most of the research studies are essentially descriptive in nature, are mainly focused on proxy decision‐making by parents or health professionals, and do not provide information about what interventions promote children's participation in SDM. It is unclear what factors promote the SDM approach and what interventions are effective and suitable for children. No evidence‐based guidelines exist to inform healthcare professionals on methods of supporting children's participation in SDM. Healthcare professionals and parents need to know how they should involve children in decision‐making and what interventions are most effective in promoting SDM for children with cancer. Identifying such interventions provides reassurance and guidance, and potentially contributes to successful communication for children, parents and the medical care team.\n\n【62】This is an update of a previously published Cochrane review .\n\n【63】Objectives\n----------\n\n【64】To examine the effects of SDM interventions on the process of SDM for children with cancer who are aged four to 18 years.\n\n【65】Methods\n-------\n\n【66】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【67】#### Types of studies\n\n【68】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of SDM interventions with children with cancer. We excluded cross‐over trials as this design is not appropriate when an intervention can have a lasting effect that compromises entry to subsequent periods of the trial. CCTs using historical controls were not eligible for inclusion.\n\n【69】#### Types of participants\n\n【70】For the purpose of this review, a child is defined as a person between four and 18 years of age. We excluded children younger than four years as they are potentially too young to participate in the interventions adequately.\n\n【71】*   Children diagnosed with any type or stage of cancer; studies with children diagnosed with cancer who also have other illnesses were eligible.\n\n【72】*   Studies that involved parents or healthcare professionals, or both were eligible.\n\n【73】*   Studies that involved interventions given to only one group (for example, children or parents or healthcare professionals), a combination of two groups (for example, parents and children or healthcare professionals and children), or all three groups of participants (children, parents and healthcare professionals) were eligible. The term 'healthcare professionals' refers to doctors and nurses and, for this review, excludes any other healthcare professional.\n\n【74】#### Types of interventions\n\n【75】Studies evaluating an intervention designed to promote SDM between children with cancer and parents and healthcare professionals were eligible for inclusion. The types of decisions included decisions faced in the context of clinical care, such as treatment decisions, healthcare decisions and research participation decisions. Studies focused on the involvement of children in consent or assent for involvement in clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. SDM interventions developed for research participation were relevant for this review. At the same time, it must be noted that research participation decisions and treatment decisions differ in fundamental ways that may have substantial effects on information provision, competence to process the information and the capacity to respond voluntarily to the options available. Decisions about research participation could result in different outcomes as compared to treatment decisions. Therefore, a subgroup analysis was planned if the search found sufficient studies to compare research decisions with clinical care decisions, but since we identified no eligible studies, this was not feasible.\n\n【76】Interventions presented individually or in group sessions were eligible for inclusion. Examples of interventions could include the following:\n\n【77】*   providing information to a child, parent or healthcare provider, or combinations of the three (communication interventions such as: booklet, video, web resources, workbook, posters, meetings, role play, puppets);\n\n【78】*   preparing the child or parent, or both, to participate in decision‐making (educational interventions such as specific educational programmes, memory prompts, pre‐consultation rehearsal questions, question prompt sheets, decision aids or boards, online decision support tutorials, leaflets, posters, media, implementation of models of participation, guidelines);\n\n【79】*   training interventions targeted at healthcare professionals to promote implementation of SDM;\n\n【80】*   providing opportunities to review decisions made.\n\n【81】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【82】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【83】*   SDM as measured with any validated scale.\n\n【84】*   Adverse effects (anxiety  or uncertainty , or both).\n\n【85】The processes and outcomes of SDM could have been measured with scales such as: the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision Making Effectiveness (COMRADE) scale , Observing Patient Involvement (OPTION) scale , Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) , or with any other validated scale that measured involvement of people in SDM. Numerous other potential measurement scales are listed in the systematic review of instruments that measure the involvement of people in medical decision‐making . The diversity of instruments available for measuring SDM demonstrates the broad range of constructs involved in its assessment .\n\n【86】The primary outcome of SDM is often measured through direct observation of the behaviour exhibited by physician, parents and patient.\n\n【87】*   Patient's and parents' behavioural outcomes (for example, patterns of interaction with the medical care team, development of communication skills or techniques, level of involvement, question asking) could have been measured with scales such as: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) , Perceived Involvement in Care Scale , and the Autonomy Preference Index .\n\n【88】*   Health professionals' behavioural outcomes (for example, patterns of communication, patient‐directed questions, amount of deliberation and time spent) could have been measured by scales such as: the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS)  and the DCS .\n\n【89】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【90】If the primary outcome of interest was met, then the secondary outcomes were:\n\n【91】*   measures of decisional quality (for example, whether the child or parent was adequately informed about the options, pros and cons discussed, preferences met, understanding checked, decisional conflict reduced). Scales that could have been included were the Satisfaction with Decision Scale , Decisional Quality Inventory (DMQI) , and DCS ;\n\n【92】*   measures of patient psychological outcomes (for example, self‐concept, sense of control, satisfaction, stress, anxiety). Scales such as the State‐Trait Inventory for Children (STAIC) scale for children , Satisfaction with Decision Scale , or Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scales  could have been used;\n\n【93】*   Measures of patient health outcomes (for example quality of life outcomes). Scales could have been used such as: the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) , Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0) , or study‐specific observational rating scales.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy and safety of celecoxib in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Schizophrenia, a disabling psychiatric illness, affects about one percent of the population and is associated with high social burden and functional impairment as well as high rate of hospitalisation and economic impact .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Recent findings suggest that inflammatory processes in the brain may contribute to pathogenesis of psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia . Immune system abnormalities have been reported in schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotics have been shown to have immunomodulatory properties . Reports of several randomised controlled trials have shown that celecoxib, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase‐2 with anti‐inflammatory effects, may have implications for the treatment of schizophrenia . The drug can be a relatively safe and inexpensive adjunct to standard treatment of schizophrenia, potentially decreasing the need for antipsychotic drugs and their adverse effects . Some authors have raised concerns about increased rate of cardiovascular events . However, this is possibly related to COX‐2 inhibitors other than celecoxib, as in a recent meta‐analysis on more than 31000 patients, no increased risk of cardiovascular events was found for celecoxib compared to both placebo and other NSAIDs  .\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】Celecoxib is a COX‐2 inhibitor and has anti‐inflammatory properties. It has been shown that COX‐2 system has interactions with dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems .\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】Although evidences suggest beneficial effect of celecoxib for schizophrenia, this has been not replicated in all reports. We will conduct the present review to determine the efficacy as well as safety and side effects of celecoxib as an adjunct in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To assess the efficacy and safety of celecoxib in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】All relevant randomised controlled trials.

It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres, including the Epley manoeuvre.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal BPPV, or no treatment.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; _m_ RCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 19 May 2010, following a previous update search in July 2006.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials of the Epley manoeuvre versus placebo, no treatment or other active treatment for adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix‐Hallpike test). We considered the following outcome measures: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo, proportion of patients improved by each intervention and conversion of a 'positive' Dix‐Hallpike test to a 'negative' Dix‐Hallpike test.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for risk of bias.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included five trials involving 292 participants in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. The studies included in the review compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre or control group by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to a negative Dix‐Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe, effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, based on the results of five mostly small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long‐term resolution of symptoms. There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Nystagmus\n*   Dix-Hallpike Positional Test\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Epley Maneuver\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Therapeutic Procedure\n*   Brandt-Daroff Exercises\n*   Placebo\n*   Physical therapy exercises\n*   Obliteration Of Posterior Semicircular Canal\n*   Vestibular Neurectomy\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Vertigo\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The person feels they or their surroundings are moving or rotating. Common causes are head trauma or ear infection. BPPV can be caused by debris in the semicircular canal of the ear that continues to move after the head has stopped moving. This causes a sensation of ongoing movement that conflicts with other sensory information. The review of trials found that the Epley manoeuvre (four specific movements of the head and body designed to move the debris out the ear canal) is safe and effective in the short term. More research is needed.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Reminders may help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting the doctor to recall information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing information or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the effects of reminders automatically generated through a computerized system and delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on processes of care (related to healthcare professionals' practice) and outcomes of care (related to patients' health condition).\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】For this update the EPOC Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the following databases between June 11‐19, 2012: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Cochrane Library (Economics, Methods, and Health Technology Assessment sections), Issue 6, 2012; MEDLINE, OVID (1946‐ ), Daily Update, and In‐process; EMBASE, Ovid (1947‐ ); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980‐ ); EPOC Specialised Register, Reference Manager, and INSPEC, Engineering Village. The authors reviewed reference lists of related reviews and studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included individual or cluster‐randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) that evaluated the impact of computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals on processes and/or outcomes of care.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Review authors working in pairs independently screened studies for eligibility and abstracted data. We contacted authors to obtain important missing information for studies that were published within the last 10 years. For each study, we extracted the primary outcome when it was defined or calculated the median effect size across all reported outcomes. We then calculated the median absolute improvement and interquartile range (IQR) in process adherence across included studies using the primary outcome or median outcome as representative outcome.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】In the 32 included studies, computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals achieved moderate improvement in professional practices, with a median improvement of processes of care of 7.0% (IQR: 3.9% to 16.4%). Implementing reminders alone improved care by 11.2% (IQR 6.5% to 19.6%) compared with usual care, while implementing reminders in addition to another intervention improved care by 4.0% only (IQR 3.0% to 6.0%) compared with the other intervention. The quality of evidence for these comparisons was rated as moderate according to the GRADE approach. Two reminder features were associated with larger effect sizes: providing space on the reminder for provider to enter a response (median 13.7% versus 4.3% for no response, P value = 0.01) and providing an explanation of the content or advice on the reminder (median 12.0% versus 4.2% for no explanation, P value = 0.02). Median improvement in processes of care also differed according to the behaviour the reminder targeted: for instance, reminders to vaccinate improved processes of care by 13.1% (IQR 12.2% to 20.7%) compared with other targeted behaviours. In the only study that had sufficient power to detect a clinically significant effect on outcomes of care, reminders were not associated with significant improvements.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is moderate quality evidence that computer‐generated reminders delivered on paper to healthcare professionals achieve moderate improvement in process of care. Two characteristics emerged as significant predictors of improvement: providing space on the reminder for a response from the clinician and providing an explanation of the reminder’s content or advice. The heterogeneity of the reminder interventions included in this review also suggests that reminders can improve care in various settings under various conditions\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Healthcare Professional\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Reminders\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Clinical Finding\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Quality of care\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### The effect of automatically generated reminders delivered to providers on paper on professional practice\n\n【23】Healthcare professionals do not always provide care that is recommended or that reflects the latest research, partly because of information overload or inaccessibility. Reminders may help doctors overcome these problems by reminding them about important information or providing advice, in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. For example, when a doctor sees a patient for his annual check‐up, he receives the patient's chart with a reminder section detailing the screening tests that are due that year, such as colorectal cancer screening.\n\n【24】This review found 32 studies that evaluated the effects of reminders, automatically generated through a computer system but delivered on paper to healthcare professionals, compared to usual care. The studies examined reminders to order screening tests, to provide vaccinations, to prescribe specific medications, or to discuss issues with patients. The reminders improved professional practices by 7% (median).

It blocks the interleukin‐2 receptor alpha subunit (CD25), and seems to be beneficial to patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of outcomes.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the safety of daclizumab and its efficacy to prevent clinical worsening in patients with RRMS.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (17 May 2013). We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials and reports  from the most important neurological associations and MS societies. We contacted researchers participating in trials on daclizumab.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating daclizumab, alone or combined with other treatments versus placebo, or any other treatment for patients with RRMS.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed references retrieved for possible inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We resolved any disagreements by consensus among review authors.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included two trials with 851 patients that evaluated the efficacy and safety of daclizumab versus placebo for RRMS. We judged them to be at low risk of bias. Due to different time point evaluations and available data on primary studies, we were unable to undertake a meta‐analysis. At 24 weeks, the median change was 0 (range ‐2 to 3) in the interferon beta and placebo group, 0 (‐2 to 4) in the interferon beta and low‐dose daclizumab group and 0 (‐2 to 2) in the interferon beta and high‐dose daclizumab group in 230 participants. The proportion of patients who had new clinical relapses were the following: 16 patients (21%) in the interferon beta and high‐dose daclizumab group, 19 (24%) in the interferon beta and low‐dose daclizumab group and 19 (25%) in the interferon beta and placebo group had relapses (P value = 0.87). At 52 weeks, the changes in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from baseline was 0.09 ± 0.71 in placebo group, ‐0.08 ± 0.52 in low‐dose daclizumab group and 0.05 ± 0.61 in high‐dose daclizumab group in 621 participants. There was a significant difference between placebo and low‐dose daclizumab groups (P value = 0.01), but no significant difference between placebo and high‐dose daclizumab groups (P value = 0.49). The proportion of patients with new relapsing MS was significantly reduced in both daclizumab groups (19% in low‐dose daclizumab group, 20% in high‐dose daclizumab group) compared with placebo group (36%) (P value < 0.0001 and P value = 0.00032, respectively). There was no increased number of patients in any adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07) or serious adverse events in daclizumab groups compared with placebo (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.54). Infections were the most frequent adverse events in treated participants and were resolved with standard therapies. One trial was still ongoing.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There was insufficient evidence to determine whether daclizumab was more effective than placebo in patients affected by RRMS in terms of clinical and MRI measures of outcomes. Daclizumab appeared to be relatively well tolerated. Infections were the most frequent adverse events, and were resolved with standard therapies.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Daclizumab\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Adverse Event\n*   Expanded Disability Status Scale\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010, and previously updated in 2012. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of daclizumab, alone or combined to other treatments for the improvement in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\n\n【26】**Study characteristics**\n\n【27】To test the efficacy we measured the disability changes and the proportion of patients who had new relapses, while to test the safety we took into account the number of patients who exhibited any type of adverse events. We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment group) comparing daclizumab, alone or with other treatments versus placebo (a pretend treatment). Patients were aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Evidence is current to May 2013.\n\n【28】**Key results**\n\n【29】We found two studies (funded by Facet Biotech/Biogen Idec and Biogen Idec/AbbVie Biotherapeutics Inc), which met our inclusion criteria, with 851 patients, both male and female, aged 18 to 65 years. The results did not provide sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of daclizumab, and further studies are needed. One study is still ongoing. Daclizumab was generally well‐tolerated, the most frequent adverse events being infections, which were all resolved with standard therapies. In order to have more clear results, the length of follow‐up (where the patients are observed and monitored following treatment) needs to be longer.\n\n【30】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【31】We considered both studies to be of high quality.\n\n【32】--------------\n\n【33】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【34】### Implications for practice\n\n【35】There is insufficient evidence to determine whether daclizumab is more effective than placebo in patients affected by relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) both in terms of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of outcomes.\n\n【36】The efficacy of daclizumab still needs to be further evaluated. Daclizumab appears to be relatively well tolerated. Infections were the most frequent adverse events, and were resolved with standard therapies.\n\n【37】### Implications for research\n\n【38】More research is required. In particular:\n\n【39】1.  Length of treatment and follow‐up needs to be longer.\n\n【40】2.  Comparison should be better defined. In addition to placebo, other active controls should be considered to evaluate the efficacy and safetyof daclizumab.\n\n【41】Background\n----------\n\n【42】### Description of the condition\n\n【43】Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroimmunological disease featured with demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). MS can potentially cause all the neurological symptoms involving different CNS regions, such as visual loss, double vision, motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, sensory loss, sphincter dysfunction and cognitive impairment . Furthermore, relapses are the important features in MS, which can be triggered by numerous factors. A secondary progressive phase follows an exacerbating and remitting course in 80% of relapsing patients within two decades .\n\n【44】### Description of the intervention\n\n【45】Based on new insights into the pathophysiology of MS, several novel selective immunotherapies are currently in clinical development. New monoclonal antibody treatments target specific cell populations, including B cells, T cells, immune cell migration into the brain and the inflammation associated with MS . By selectively targeting individual cell populations rather than all of the immune system cells, these novel agents might provide improved safety profiles and enhanced efficacy. Daclizumab (Zenapax®), a humanised monoclonal antibody that blocks the interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) receptor alpha subunit (CD25), has been developed and is currently being investigated in the clinical treatment of MS. It is administered by subcutaneous or intravenous injections.\n\n【46】### How the intervention might work\n\n【47】IL‐2 signalling plays a central role in the activation of immune responses, involving the accommodation of T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells . Daclizumab inhibits T‐cell expansion by binding to the CD25 epitope and masking the IL‐2 binding site , and dramatically reduces brain inflammation in patients with MS. Moreover, significant expansion of CD56 (bright) NK cells has been found in vivo by IL‐2 receptor blockade, which is another possible mechanism of action through further inhibition of T‐cell survival . It is used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation, especially in kidney transplants. The drug is currently under investigation for the treatment of MS. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that its be considered for all kidney transplant recipients .\n\n【48】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【49】Results of previous open‐label studies of intravenous daclizumab in patients with active MS have suggested beneficial effects of daclizumab for both add‐on and monotherapy protocols as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical outcomes . There were no severe safety concerns arising from clinical testing . However, no systematic review exists in the peer‐reviewed literature that focuses on daclizumab for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010 , and previously updated in 2012 , to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daclizumab.\n\n【50】Objectives\n----------\n\n【51】To assess the safety of daclizumab and its efficacy to prevent clinical worsening in patients with RRMS.\n\n【52】Methods\n-------\n\n【53】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【54】#### Types of studies\n\n【55】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating daclizumab, alone or combined with other treatments versus placebo, or any other treatment for patients with RRMS.

Similarly no significant differences in persistent kidney damage (3 studies, 341 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49) were found between IV therapy (3 to 4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7 to 14 days.

Primary closure has traditionally been reserved for traumatic wounds presenting within six hours of injury and considered 'clean' by the attending surgeon, with the rest undergoing delayed primary closure as a means of controlling wound infection. Primary closure has the potential benefit of rapid wound healing but poses the potential threat of increased wound infection. There is currently no evidence to guide clinical decision‐making on the best timing for closure of traumatic wounds.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effect on time to healing of primary closure versus delayed closure for non bite traumatic wounds presenting within 24 hours post injury. To explore the adverse effects of primary closure compared with delayed closure for non bite traumatic wounds presenting within 24 hours post injury.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register ; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2011, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to July Week 1 2011); Ovid MEDLINE ; Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 27); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 14 July 2011).

Primary closure (which is bringing the edges of the wound together with stitches, adhesive tape, staples or glue) is usually used on wounds which are treated quickly (within 6 hours of injury) and which are clean of debris. Wounds can be contaminated by dirt and debris and in these cases may not be closed until later, meaning a delayed closure. If this happens, the wound is cleaned, left for two to three days, checked to see if it is still clean and then closed. This is thought to reduce the chances of becoming infected. Primary closure has the potential benefit of rapid wound healing but may lead to an increased chance of infection.\n\n【25】We wanted to determine the effects on healing, and any adverse effects, of immediate closure compared with delayed closure. We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials but found no studies which answered the question. There is currently no evidence to suggest the best timing for closing acute traumatic wounds to promote the best healing.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Once chronic infection is established, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infection in children and adults with cystic fibrosis eradicates the organism, delays the onset of chronic infection, and results in clinical improvement. To evaluate whether there is evidence that a particular antibiotic strategy is superior to or more cost‐effective than other strategies and to compare the adverse effects of different antibiotic strategies (including respiratory infection with other micro‐organisms).\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.\n\n【6】Most recent search: 08 September 2014.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We included randomised controlled trials of people with cystic fibrosis, in whom _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics. We excluded non‐randomised trials, cross‐over trials, and those utilising historical controls.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】The search identified 49 trials; seven trials (744 participants) with a duration between 28 days and 27 months were eligible for inclusion. Three of the trials are over 10 years old and their results may be less applicable today given the changes in standard treatment. Some of the trials had low numbers of participants and most had relatively short follow‐up periods; however, there was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment given the interventions and comparators used. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used.\n\n【13】Evidence from two trials (38 participants) at the two‐month time‐point showed treatment of early _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infection with inhaled tobramycin results in microbiological eradication of the organism from respiratory secretions more often than placebo, odds ratio 0.15 (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.65) and data from one of these trials, with longer follow up, suggested that this effect may persist for up to 12 months.\n\n【14】One randomised controlled trial (26 participants) compared oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin versus usual treatment. Results after two years suggested treatment of early infection results in microbiological eradication of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ more often than no anti‐pseudomonal treatment, odds ratio 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.79).\n\n【15】One trial comparing 28 days to 56 days treatment with nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation in 88 participants showed that both treatments were effective and well‐tolerated, with no notable additional improvement with longer over shorter duration of therapy. However, this trial was not powered to detect non‐inferiority or equivalence .\n\n【16】A trial of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation alone (223 participants) failed to show a difference between the two strategies, although it was underpowered to show this. A further trial of inhaled colistin with oral ciprofloxacin versus nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation with oral ciprofloxacin also showed no superiority of the former, with increased isolation of _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ in both groups.\n\n【17】A recent, large trial in 306 children aged between one and 12 years compared cycled nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation to culture‐based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. The primary analysis showed no difference in time to pulmonary exacerbation or proportion of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ positive cultures. An analysis performed in this review (not adjusted for age) showed fewer participants in the cycled therapy group with one or more isolates of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa,_ odds ratio 0.51 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.28) _._\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or in combination with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ . Eradication may be sustained for up to two years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotic strategies for the eradication of early _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials of two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa._ There have been no published randomised controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in cystic fibrosis. Overall, there is still insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infection in cystic fibrosis.\n### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Populatio\n\n【21】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Cystic Fibrosis\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Infection due to Pseudomonas Aeruginosa\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【22】###### Interventio\n\n【23】*   Intravenous\n*   Oral\n*   Antibacterial drug\n*   Inhaled\n\n【24】###### Compariso\n\n【25】*   Intravenous\n*   Placebo\n*   Oral\n*   Usual Care\n*   Antibacterial drug\n*   Inhaled\n\n【26】###### Outcom\n\n【27】*   Body Mass Index\n*   Forced Vital Capacity\n*   Growth\n*   Body weight\n*   Nutritional Finding\n*   Time-to-Event\n*   Infection due to Pseudomonas Aeruginosa\n*   Cough\n*   Weight change\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Forced Expiratory Volume\n*   Height and growth measurements\n*   Infective Pulmonary Exacerbation Of Cystic Fibrosis\n*   Withdrawal Due To Adverse Events\n*   Respiratory Tract Infection\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

It is associated with chest infections, which can lead to progressive breathing failure and death. A germ called _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is a frequent cause of infection and is difficult to treat effectively, once infection has become established.\n\n【34】**Search date**\n\n【35】The evidence is current to September 2014.\n\n【36】**Study characteristics**\n\n【37】We wanted to compare different combinations of inhaled, oral and intravenous (IV) antibiotics for eliminating _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in people with cystic fibrosis and find out if any single treatment works best and is more cost‐effective. We included seven trials with a total of 744 individuals, but the treatments were mostly different so we could not combine the results. Two trials compared tobramycin to placebo (a dummy treatment). Three trials used a combination of oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled colistin in one group of volunteers and compared this combination to no treatment in one trial, to inhaled tobramycin in a second trial and to oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled tobramycin in the third trial. Another trial compared 28 days of inhaled tobramycin to 56 days of inhaled tobramycin and the final included trial compared regular cycles of inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) to culture‐based inhaled tobramycin (plus oral ciprofloxacin or placebo). Trials included people with cystic fibrosis of both sexes, any age and both mild and more severe lung disease. The trials lasted from 28 days to 27 months.\n\n【38】**Key results**\n\n【39】Two small trials (38 volunteers) treating early infection showed that, after two months, nebulised antibiotics were better than no treatment and eliminated _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in most people. One of these trials reported results over a longer period and these suggested that this effect may last for up to 12 months. Another small trial (26 volunteers) which lasted two years showed that treating early infection with a combination of nebulised and oral antibiotics was better than no treatment at eliminating _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ . A further trial (88 volunteers), which compared 28 days of nebulised tobramycin solution for inhalation to 56 days, showed both were equally tolerated and effective at eliminating _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ . Four direct comparisons of oral or inhaled antibiotics (or combinations of both), one of which reported on 223 volunteers, did not find a difference between different antibiotic combinations. A recent, large trial in 306 children (aged up to 12 years) compared a regular cycle of treatment to treatment only when it was shown that a child was infected with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa,_ the treatment used was either an antibiotic or a placebo. When we analysed the data for this review, we found that when children were given a regular cycle of inhaled tobramycin (with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo) fewer of them grew _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ from their sputum. The official published results from this trial made an adjustment for age and did not show any difference in the number of times _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ was grown from samples between the groups, nor was there any difference in the length of time until the patients had their next chest infection.\n\n【40】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【41】Some of the trials were conducted between 10 and 20 years ago and the results may not be applicable to patients today. Some trials were small and all the trials had quite a short follow‐up period. Therefore, we could not show whether treatment made people with cystic fibrosis feel better or live longer. Given the types of treatment used in most of the trials, it would have been easy for the volunteers to guess which treatment they were receiving, which might have influenced some of the results. Two trials were supported by the pharmaceutical industry. Further research is still needed to see whether eliminating the bacteria completely improves the well‐being and quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis and to establish which antibiotic combination provides the best way of eliminating _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ .\n\n【42】--------------\n\n【43】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【44】### Implications for practice\n\n【45】Significantly more children with cystic fibrosis (CF) show clearance of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ ( _P. aeruginosa_ ) from their respiratory secretions up to three months after commencing antibiotic therapy aimed at eradication of the organism from their respiratory tract when compared to placebo. This effect may last for several months. This review has not established any improvement in clinical outcome measures following treatment. The small numbers of participants in some trials and the short duration of follow up mean that this review may have insufficient statistical power to detect changes in these clinical outcomes. However, there are many observational studies which have shown a decline in clinical status once chronic _P. aeruginosa_ infection occurs and so clinical benefit from eradication is likely. There was no significant difference in the rate of common adverse effects detected. An increased incidence of the emerging pathogen _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ ( _S. maltophilia_ ) was seen after eradication treatment in two trials, but there was no statistically significant difference between regimens .\n\n【46】We found that nebulised antibiotics (or a combination of nebulised and oral antibiotics) were better than no treatment in treating early infection with _P. aeruginosa_ , which was eliminated in the majority of individuals. Eradication may be sustained in the short term. We were unable to determine whether there is an associated clinical benefit to people with CF, though data from observational studies suggest that benefit is likely. Overall, there is insufficient evidence from this review to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early _P. aeruginosa_ infection in CF.\n\n【47】### Implications for research\n\n【48】Whilst there is evidence that eradication treatment is more effective than placebo or no treatment, there is no evidence to help the clinician choose which regimen to use. There remains an urgent need for well‐designed and well‐executed trials, comparing eradication regimens. Where possible these should evaluate whether eradication results in appreciable clinical benefit to patients, without causing them harm. Trials should also explore the influence of prior infection with _P. aeruginosa_ (\" _Pseudomonas_ ‐free\" compared to \" _Pseudomonas‐_ naive\") and whether there is an advantage in early institution of therapy (within weeks rather than within months). This might be accomplished, using a stratified trial design. Consideration should be given to appropriate outcome measures, particularly spirometric lung function, nutritional status, socio‐economic outcomes (including quality of life) and duration of follow up. Long‐term follow‐up trials with careful clinical and bacteriological surveillance are required. These trials will be challenging to design and deliver. Randomisation should include two active treatments that are both believed to be effective and safe and would still need to recruit a sufficient number of patients to show differences in efficacy with adequate power. Adult participants as well as children should be included in such trials.\n\n【49】Background\n----------\n\n【50】### Description of the condition\n\n【51】Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life‐limiting, autosomal recessively inherited disease in Caucasian populations. Although this is a multisystem disease, the primary cause of death in CF is respiratory failure resulting from chronic pulmonary infection . The most frequent cause of chronic pulmonary infection beyond infancy in people with CF is _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ ( _P. aeruginosa_ ) and, once established, appears to be permanent in the majority of cases . A number of definitions have been used for chronic _P. aeruginosa_ infection in CF.\n\n【52】1.  The presence of _P. aeruginosa_ in monthly specimens for six successive months or the development of precipitating antibodies to _P. aeruginosa_ or both .\n\n【53】2.  The culture of _P. aeruginosa_ from the sputum or respiratory secretions, on two or more occasions extending over six months or a shorter period if accompanied by a sustained rise of anti‐pseudomonal antibodies .\n\n【54】3.  The isolation of _P. aeruginosa_ in more than 50% of months over a 12‐month period  ‐ the second and subsequent positive specimens in the same month do not count. Conversely, eradication is defined as all monthly specimens negative for _P. aeruginosa_ over 12 months.\n\n【55】4.  Three or more isolates of _P. aeruginosa_ in a 12‐month period .\n\n【56】We have used the first definition in this systematic review.\n\n【57】The age‐specific prevalence of _P. aeruginosa_ in pre‐school children is under 5%, rising to 30% at aged 16 years . Some authors have suggested that the use of prophylactic anti‐staphylococcal antibiotic therapy in early childhood may predispose to chronic _P. aeruginosa_ infection . However, this effect was not seen in a systematic review of prophylactic antibiotic use, including over 400 participants .\n\n【58】In children who are too young to expectorate, cough swabs or oropharyngeal swabs are the only respiratory specimens which can be easily obtained. These do not reliably predict the presence of _P. aeruginosa_ in the lower respiratory tract , whereas flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may detect positive _P. aeruginosa_ in children with negative cough swabs or oropharyngeal swabs . Sputum cultures have been shown to accurately reflect lower respiratory tract organisms in expectorating children and adults . Over half of people with CF have chronic infection with _P. aeruginosa_ by their early twenties , although prior to chronic infection _P. aeruginosa_ is often isolated intermittently from respiratory tract specimens. This may represent transient colonies of _P. aeruginosa_ within the lower respiratory tract or alternatively it may reflect the difficulties in accurately detecting _P. aeruginosa_ in the lungs of young people with CF . The quantity and type of _P. aeruginosa_ present in the lower respiratory tract changes as infection becomes established. It is known that _P. aeruginosa_ has two major phenotypes ‐ mucoid and non‐mucoid. Following first isolation there is a progressive increase in the density of _P. aeruginosa_ colonies in the lower respiratory tract . Initial isolates often show a non‐mucoid phenotype; however, as infection progresses a mucoid phenotype may prevail and will be more difficult to eradicate. Douglas has reported a relatively high prevalence (18.2%) of mucoid _P. aeruginosa_ ) at first isolation in newborn screened infants, speculating that the notion of transformation from non‐mucoid to mucoid phenotype under environmental pressure may be inaccurate in young children. . It has been reported that _P. aeruginosa_ provokes an inflammatory response of the lower respiratory tract  and there is a marked step up in this inflammatory response as the number of _P. aeruginosa_ colonies increases .\n\n【59】The presence of _P. aeruginosa_ in respiratory secretions is a major predictor of mortality in children with CF . Individuals with CF infected with _P. aeruginosa_ also suffer greater morbidity with a more rapid deterioration in lung function  and a more rapid decline in chest radiograph score , poor growth, reduced quality of life, increased hospitalisation and increased need for antibiotic treatment . Some studies suggest there is a temporal relationship between the onset of chronic infection and increased morbidity , whilst others do not support these findings . On balance, there seems to be good evidence from well‐designed non‐experimental studies that clinical state deteriorates after first isolation of _P. aeruginosa_ .\n\n【60】### Description of the intervention\n\n【61】Several strategies exist to treat early infection with _P. aeruginosa_ and include the use of the inhaled antibiotics such as colistin and tobramycin , oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin  and intravenous antibiotics usually consisting of combination of an aminoglycoside with a beta‐lactam .\n\n【62】### How the intervention might work\n\n【63】As well as antibiotic treatment of _P. aeruginosa_ given at the time of first isolation, other strategies have the potential to prevent or delay infection of the respiratory tract. These include avoidance of contact with people who carry _P. aeruginosa_  and the development of vaccines against _P. aeruginosa_ . Uncontrolled series have indicated that a variety of anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics either singly  or in combination  at first isolation may delay the onset of chronic infection. A trial using historical controls suggested that oral ciprofloxacin and nebulised colistin are effective in delaying or preventing chronic infection . An uncontrolled pilot study of intravenous therapy suggested that intravenous treatment alone was less effective in delaying the onset of chronic infection . There is also evidence supporting eradication therapy from long‐term observational studies of chronic infection with _P. aeruginosa_ in CF clinics such as the study reported by Lee .\n\n【64】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【65】There are differences in the approach to detection and management of first isolation of _P. aeruginosa_ . Some CF centres advocate frequent microbiological surveillance with attempts to eradicate _P. aeruginosa_ when it first appears in the lung , whereas others treat only when clinical or radiological signs of pulmonary infection are present . There is evidence that, when _P. aeruginosa_ is cleared from respiratory secretions it is not simply suppressed because, when infection recurs, this is with a genetically distinct organism in most cases . Evidence that eradication strategies result in increased survival or improved quality of life for people with CF are from observational studies alone. There are multiple different eradication regimens that have been described using different anti‐pseudomonal antibiotics in different combinations of intravenous, oral or nebulised (or both) and with varying doses and duration of therapy . Given the expense of chronic anti‐pseudomonal suppressive therapy, there is a clear rationale for early eradication from a cost‐effectiveness perspective and this is supported by observational data ; however, there has not been any formal evaluation of cost effectiveness to date.\n\n【66】This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006 and 2009 .\n\n【67】Objectives\n----------\n\n【68】To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early _P. aeruginosa_ infection in children and adults with CF alters clinical and microbiological outcome when compared to usual treatment.\n\n【69】To test the hypotheses that antibiotics against _P. aeruginosa_ , given at the time of first isolation, reduce CF‐related mortality; improve quality of life; improve pulmonary function; nutritional status; and reduce the need for subsequent hospitalisation and consumption of antibiotics.\n\n【70】To investigate whether these antibiotics prevent or delay the onset of chronic infection of the respiratory tract with _P. aeruginosa_ ; increase the incidence of isolates of other micro‐organisms from the respiratory tract; and are associated with adverse effects which are either important to the individual with CF or have long‐term sequelae.\n\n【71】To investigate whether there is evidence of superior _P. aeruginosa_ eradication efficacy or improved cost‐effectiveness between different antibiotic strategies.\n\n【72】Methods\n-------\n\n【73】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【74】#### Types of studies\n\n【75】Randomised controlled trials.\n\n【76】#### Types of participants\n\n【77】Children and adults with CF, diagnosed clinically and by sweat or genetic testing (or both) with a first ever positive microbiological isolate of _P. aeruginosa_ from a respiratory tract specimen. Trials will also be included where the participants have been proven to be free of _P. aeruginosa_ for at least six months before a new isolation and should not be currently receiving _Pseudomonas‐_ suppressing treatment such as daily inhaled antibiotic therapy. Participants should be enrolled into a trial within six months ( _post hoc_ change ‐ previously not more than two months) from isolation of _P. aeruginosa._ In a further _post hoc_ change, we have also altered our eligibility criteria to allow trials where all participants receive some eradication therapy before randomisation ( _see_ Differences between protocol and review ). People with CF of all ages and disease severity will be included.\n\n【78】#### Types of interventions\n\n【79】Combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with the aim of eradicating first pulmonary isolates of _P. aeruginosa_ compared with placebo or usual treatment (or both) or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics.\n\n【80】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【81】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【82】1.

It has been suggested that the laparoscopic approach is associated with a reduction in operative morbidity. Over the last 10 to 15 years there has been a steady increase of laparoscopy for endometrial cancer. This review investigates the evidence of benefits and harms of laparoscopic surgery compared with laparotomy for presumed early stage endometrial cancer.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS) for laparoscopic surgery versus laparotomy in women with presumed early stage endometrial cancer.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to April 2012. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies. Trial registers we searched included NHMRC Clinical Trials Register, UKCCCR Register of Cancer Trials, Meta‐Register and Physician Data Query Protocol, as well as abstracts of scientific meetings.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy for early stage endometrial cancer.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used for OS and recurrence‐free survival (RFS), risk ratios (RR) for severe adverse events and the mean difference (MD) method was used for continuous outcomes in women who received laparoscopy or laparotomy and these were then pooled in random‐effects meta‐analyses.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eight RCTs comparing laparoscopy with laparotomy for the surgical management of early stage endometrial cancer were identified.\n\n【12】All eight trials met the inclusion criteria, 3644 women were assessed at the end of the trials. Three trials assessing 359 participants with early stage endometrial cancer, found no statistically significant difference in the risk of death and disease or recurrence between women who underwent laparoscopy and those who underwent laparotomy (HR = 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62 to 2.10) and HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.42 for OS and RFS respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of peri‐operative death, women requiring a blood transfusion, and bladder, ureteric, bowel and vascular injury. However, a meta‐analysis of two trials found that women in the laparoscopy group lost significantly less blood than those in the laparotomy group (MD = ‐106.82 mL, 95% CI: ‐141.59 to ‐72.06). A further meta‐analysis of two trials, which assessed 2923 women and included one very large trial of over 2500 participants, found that the rate of severe post‐operative adverse events was significantly lower in the laparoscopy group compared with the laparotomy group (RR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.91). The large trial did not give a breakdown of these severe post‐operative adverse events into different adverse event categories. Most trials were at moderate risk of bias. Hospital stay was reported in all of the trials and results show that on average, laparoscopy was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】This review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer.\n\n【15】For presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease‐free survival. Laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. There is no significant difference in severe post‐operative morbidity between the two modalities.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Endometrial Cancer\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Surgery\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Total Abdominal Hysterectomy\n*   Laparotomy\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy\n*   Laparoscopic-assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Recurrence free survival\n*   Death\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

For women with cancer of the womb, removal of the womb (hysterectomy) and removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries is considered current standard treatment. Other treatments include radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Traditionally, surgery for cancer of the womb is performed through a laparotomy (open cut in abdomen).\n\n【27】The aim of this review was to compare the overall survival and disease‐free survival for laparoscopic (keyhole surgery) surgery with laparotomy in women with presumed early endometrial cancer.\n\n【28】We found that laparoscopy is associated with less blood loss and earlier discharge from hospital. With regards to long term survival outcomes, treatment by keyhole surgery is comparable to open surgery (laparotomy).\n\n【29】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound and alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP), alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of any size and at any stage in people with chronic advanced liver disease, either in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver neoplasm, usually developing in the setting of chronic liver disease. It is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer worldwide; there were 782,000 deaths due to HCC in 2018 . HCC ranks fifth in terms of global cases of cancer and second in terms of cancer deaths for males . In Western countries, the incidence and mortality rates of HCC increased substantially between 1990 and 2015 . Most common risk factors include liver cirrhosis, severe liver fibrosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcohol intake, and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease , although some people may develop HCC without the presence of known risk factors .\n\n【6】Clinically, HCC is frequently diagnosed in the late stages of liver disease because of the absence of specific symptoms of the malignancy, other than those related to chronic liver disease. Only 20% of patients are eligible for curative treatments — such as liver resection, transplantation, or ablation — due to advanced tumour stage, liver dysfunction, or shortage of liver donors . According to the current guidelines, HCC can only be considered as resectable and amenable to surgical radical resection if it presents as either a single lesion with a maximum diameter of less than five cm, or up to two lesions, each with a maximum diameter of three cm . Furthermore, curative treatment options are unfeasible for most patients due to severe clinical deterioration at the moment of diagnosis, or due to the inaccuracy of the preoperative clinical evaluation and staging procedure.\n\n【7】Despite the poor initial prognosis (the mortality‐to‐incidence overall ratio has been reported as 0.93) , a five‐year survival rate of more than 50% can be achieved if HCC is detected at an early stage . According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system, only patients with early‐stage HCC are eligible for curative treatment . Therefore, accurate and early diagnosis of HCC is considered of high importance.\n\n【8】Abdominal ultrasound has become an acceptable imaging modality in detecting HCC because it is non‐invasive, acceptable to patients, has moderate costs, and no associated risks. A recent meta‐analysis showed a pooled sensitivity of 84% of ultrasound surveillance in detecting HCC in people without any symptoms . However, the same study showed a poor result for ultrasound in the detection of early‐stage HCC in people who are eligible for curative therapies, with a pooled sensitivity of only 47% . Accordingly, detection of HCC poses a challenge. The sonographic liver tissue characteristics in people with fibrosis make it particularly difficult to detect and differentiate small neoplastic nodules from the surrounding parenchyma and from regenerative nodules. Furthermore, the performance of ultrasound can be influenced by the expertise of the operator and the quality of the equipment.\n\n【9】Alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumour marker which has been used as a diagnostic test for HCC since the 1970s, when most patients were diagnosed in the late stage and with clinical symptoms . Although the test for AFP is widely available, inexpensive, and easy to perform, it has poor accuracy as a serological test for the early detection of HCC . Levels of AFP increase not only in people with HCC, but also in people with active hepatitis, cirrhosis without HCC, or exacerbation of the underlying liver disease, due to pathophysiological changes of inflammation and regeneration; this means the test can have low specificity in the population at risk .\n\n【10】Surveillance programmes for early detection of HCC in high‐risk patients have been implemented in the current medical practice in most Western and Asian‐Pacific countries, despite the very low‐certainty evidence regarding the effects on mortality . The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), European Association for the Study of the Liver with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL‐EORTC), and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) recommend abdominal ultrasound as an imaging modality for surveillance of HCC every six months in people at risk. However, disagreement exists between using serum biomarker AFP as an additional test .\n\n【11】There are several published systematic reviews which examine the accuracy of ultrasonography and AFP in detecting HCC , but to our knowledge, there is no recent systematic review which compares AFP alone, ultrasound alone, and combination of ultrasound and AFP in detecting HCC. Therefore, the aim of our review is to use Cochrane methodology to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these three modalities for the diagnosis of HCC, as well as the first stage of HCC, in people with chronic liver disease.\n\n【12】### Target condition being diagnosed\n\n【13】Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer which occurs mostly in people with chronic liver disease. The incidence of HCC increases in individuals with hepatitis B and C, alcohol use, and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease, and in those with liver cirrhosis of various aetiologies . There is no definite threshold in the definition of lesion size, although the literature tends to classify lesions with a diameter equal to or less than two cm as \"small\" .\n\n【14】In clinical practice, and according to pertinent guidelines, multiphasic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravascular contrast allow for a highly accurate diagnosis of HCC, without an invasive biopsy . The diagnosis of HCC is usually obtained on the basis of cross‐sectional CT or magnetic resonance imaging features: focal liver lesions which show non‐rim‐like hyperenhancement in arterial phase, subsequent non‐peripheral washout appearance, and capsule appearance . Liver histology is required only for undefined lesions during CT and MRI .\n\n【15】A number of staging systems for HCC have been proposed and developed; however, there is no globally applicable staging system . Among different staging protocols, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system has a notable feature of treatment recommendations for each stage, based on the best treatment options currently available . It is comprised of four elements: tumour extension, liver functional reserve, physical status, and cancer‐related symptoms. According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system , only patients with early‐stage HCC are eligible for curative treatment such as surgical resection or percutaneous treatment. Orthotopic liver transplantation is reserved for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\n\n【16】Orthotopic liver transplantation is considered a definite curative treatment for HCC. When orthotopic liver transplantation for HCC was initially introduced in the 1980s, it was associated with poor five‐year survival rates and high recurrence rates, which led to the treatment being contraindicated for HCC . In 1996, specific criteria, known as Milan criteria , were developed for the selection of patients for liver transplantation. With the implementation of these criteria, the overall five‐year survival rates for post‐orthotopic liver transplantation patients exceeded 70% . The criteria for patients eligible for orthotopic liver transplantation include: a single HCC lesion with a diameter equal to or less than five cm, or up to three HCC lesions, each with a diameter equal to or less than three cm; no vascular invasion; and no extrahepatic involvement (no metastasis). The same criteria are recommended for the selection of patients eligible for surgical resection.\n\n【17】Along with interferon‐based treatment, a new direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) therapy was developed for people with chronic hepatitis C; these therapies therefore acted against one of the major risk factors for developing HCC . DAA therapy allowed the achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) in more than 70% of patients, compared to less than 40% with interferon therapy . However, a consensus exists that even after achieving SVR, people with chronic hepatitis C should be surveyed closely, especially those with advanced fibrosis and those who received a recent treatment for HCC in order to detect HCC at an early stage .\n\n【18】### Index test(s)\n\n【19】Abdominal ultrasound is a safe, inexpensive, non‐invasive, and real‐time diagnostic technique with relatively low costs. A transducer transforms electrical energy into sound waves (two megahertz (mHz) to eight mHz) and transmits them into the body. Simultaneously, the transducer detects the sound waves reflected by the underlying tissue. The intensity of these reflected (echo) waves is based on several properties of the tissue, such as density, depth, and properties of adjacent tissues. The echo waves are converted into electrical energy and displayed as a cross‐sectional tomography image.\n\n【20】According to the Liver Reporting and Data System (LI‐RADS) for detection of HCC, there are three ultrasound categories for diagnosing suspected liver lesions: US‐1 (negative), US‐2 (subthreshold), and US‐3 (positive). Since ultrasound is an operator‐dependent imaging modality and limitations due to patient characteristics can occur, an ultrasound visualisation score is added: A (no or minimal limitations); B (moderate limitations); and C (severe limitations). A negative observation is reported when no liver lesions have been detected or the detected lesions are definitely benign. Subthreshold lesions of less than 10 mm are noted only when no definitely benign features have been observed. A positive observation is reported when a lesion of more than 10 mm with no definitely benign features is observed, or a new venous thrombus has been detected .\n\n【21】Alpha‐fetoprotein is a glycoprotein of 591 amino acids and a carbohydrate moiety which is assessed in serum by enzyme immunoassays. In presence of HCC, high serum values of AFP are reported with variable accuracy  .\n\n【22】### Clinical pathway\n\n【23】For people with advanced chronic liver disease, a surveillance programme is usually recommended. The surveillance programmes among the different scientific societies have minimal variations .\n\n【24】Table 1. Guideline recommendations for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n| **GUIDELINE**  | **INDICATION TO SURVEILANCE**  | **TEST**  | **INTERVAL**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)   | Cirrhosis  | Abdominal ultrasound alone or plus AFP  | 6 months  |\n| European Association for the Study of the Liver with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL‐EORTC)   | Cirrhosis in Child Pugh stages A and B; cirrhosis in Child C stage awaiting liver transplantation; non‐cirrhotic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with active hepatitis or family history of HCC; non‐cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C with advanced liver fibrosis stage 3 (F3)  | Abdominal ultrasound  | 6 months 3 to 4 months: people with a nodule less than 1 cm or after resection or loco‐regional therapies  |\n| Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL)   | Cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection at risk of HCC  | Abdominal ultrasound with serum AFP  | 6 months  |\n\n【26】AFP: alpha‐fetoprotein; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma\n\n【27】#### American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines\n\n【28】According to the AASLD guidelines, to increase overall survival, only adults with cirrhosis who are considered at risk of developing HCC are in need of surveillance. It is suggested that surveillance be performed using abdominal ultrasound, with or without AFP, every six months. However, it is not possible to determine which type of surveillance test (ultrasound alone or ultrasound plus AFP) would lead to a greater improvement in survival. Surveillance is not suggested for those with Child‐Pugh class C cirrhosis, unless they are on the liver transplant waiting list, because of low anticipated survival .\n\n【29】#### European Association for the Study of the Liver with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL‐EORTC) guidelines\n\n【30】According to the EASL‐EORTC guidelines, people at risk of developing HCC for which surveillance should be performed include: people with Child‐Pugh stage A or stage B cirrhosis, people with Child‐Pugh stage C cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, non‐cirrhotic hepatitis B virus carriers with active hepatitis or family history of HCC, and people with chronic hepatitis C in the absence of cirrhosis but with advanced liver fibrosis stage 3 (F3). People on liver transplant waiting lists should be screened for HCC in order to detect and manage tumour progression. Surveillance should be performed using abdominal ultrasound every six months. A three‐ to four‐month interval is recommended in people where a nodule of less than one cm has been detected, and in the follow‐up strategy, after resection or loco‐regional therapies. Serum biomarkers such as AFP, AFP‐L3 (third electrophoretic form of lentil lectin‐reactive AFP), and des‐gamma‐carboxy prothrombin are suboptimal for routine clinical practice, and therefore, not recommended for screening .\n\n【31】#### Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) guidelines\n\n【32】According to the APASL guidelines, the following people are at risk of HCC development and are therefore eligible for HCC screening: those with cirrhosis, those who have chronic hepatitis B virus infection with cirrhosis, and those who have chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the absence of cirrhosis. The optimal surveillance strategy includes abdominal ultrasound with serum AFP measurement every six months. Measurement of AFP alone is not recommended for routine surveillance of people with HCC .\n\n【33】#### Outside surveillance programmes\n\n【34】Ultrasound and AFP are usually performed in people with clinically suspected HCC or liver cirrhosis (or both), or at the moment of decompensation of chronic liver disease, or all these factors.\n\n【35】#### Prior test(s)\n\n【36】The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is usually based on clinical judgement derived from history, laboratory testing, physical examination, imaging, liver stiffness measurement, liver histology, or a combination of these. Due to the accuracy of non‐invasive tests, liver histology is reserved to only a minority of patients with unclear diagnosis, and a non‐invasive diagnosis of chronic advanced liver disease is considered equivalent to a histological diagnosis of cirrhosis . No test is recommended by the guidelines, prior to a surveillance programme for HCC detection.\n\n【37】#### Role of index test(s)\n\n【38】Both abdominal ultrasound and AFP (independently, or in combination, or in sequence) are used as first‐line tests to exclude the presence of focal liver lesions suspected of being HCC. Further testing is required to confirm the diagnosis as well as for staging.\n\n【39】#### Alternative test(s)\n\n【40】Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an advanced form of ultrasound examination in which images are acquired using intravenously injected microbubble contrast agent with optimised technology required for contrast visualisation. The CEUS exam consists of a 'bolus' administration of contrast media through a superficial peripheral vein. The sequence of blood entering the liver is first arterial (10 to 40 seconds), then portal (40 to 120 seconds), and then late venous (more than 120 seconds). This vascular discrimination, similar to that obtained by contrast CT or MRI, allows for the collection of information regarding the circulatory system of a tumour (e.g. types of feeding vessels, tumour circulatory volume). Positivity criteria for HCC are based on arterial hyperenhancement and subsequent washout appearance. The advantages of ultrasound contrast agent over CT and MRI agents include no adverse reactions, possible multiple injections of contrast in the same examination, safety, practicality, no risk of nephrotoxicity, and no ionising radiation .\n\n【41】Contrast‐enhanced multiphasic multidetector CT and contrast‐enhanced MRI have been established as relevant non‐invasive modalities for detection and evaluation of liver lesions . The ability to detect HCC rests on characterising the enhancement patterns in arterial, portal venous phases, and subsequent phases relative to the surrounding liver tissue. The differences in blood flow and extracellular volume between HCC and normal liver tissue lead to main radiological hallmarks such as non‐rim‐like arterial phase hyperenhancement and subsequent non‐peripheral washout with enhancing capsule in later phases . CT is a commonly used modality for diagnosing HCC due to its short acquisition time and high spatial resolution. However, MRI offers several beneficial features such as absence of X‐ray radiation and combination of various sequences (multiphasic T1‐ and T2‐weighted sequences, diffusion‐weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient) in combination with the use of extracellular or hepatocellular gadolinium‐based contrast agent, or both .\n\n【42】Apart from AFP, there are other potential serological tumour biomarkers for the detection of HCC. Des‐gamma‐carboxyprothrombin, also known as prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence‐II (PIVKA‐II), is an abnormal prothrombin protein that is increased in the serum of people with HCC. It is recognised as a specific marker for the detection and prognosis of HCC , although contrary data exist on the benefit of using PIVKA‐II over AFP . AFP‐L3 can differentiate an increase in AFP due to HCC from that in people with benign liver disease, and from a potential biomarker for early HCC detection . Glypican‐3 (GPC3) is considered to be a promising biomarker for early detection of HCC and a potential epitope for HCC‐targeted therapies . Other biomarkers include Golgi protein 73, osteopontin, circulating free DNA, and microRNAs. However, none of these have been introduced in daily practice .\n\n【43】### Rationale\n\n【44】Hepatocellular carcinoma is currently detected by liver ultrasound in people with advanced chronic liver disease with normal or high AFP levels during surveillance programmes. Following ultrasound, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by high levels of AFP or by using contrast‐enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) (or both), CT, or MRI. The diagnosis in people who are not in a surveillance programme is usually obtained at decompensation of chronic liver disease (i.e. detection of oesophageal varices, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or ascites), or during the diagnosis of previously unrecognised chronic liver disease. In such patients, liver ultrasound or AFP (or both) are also the first test(s) of choice and, if positive, further testing is required with CEUS, CT, or MRI.\n\n【45】There is no clear evidence on the benefit of surveillance programmes in terms of overall survival: the conflicting results could be a consequence of inaccurate detection, ineffective treatment, or both. Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound and AFP serum concentration may clarify whether the absence of benefit in surveillance programmes might be related to under‐diagnosis. Furthermore, an assessment of the accuracy of these two tests for diagnosing HCC is needed for either ruling out, diagnosing, or supporting further testing in people with chronic liver disease who are not included in surveillance programmes.\n\n【46】People with previous diagnoses of, and who had previous treatments for, HCC make up a distinct group and the diagnostic accuracy for the recurrence of HCC after surgical or any other type of treatment is not the focus of this review.\n\n【47】This review represents the first part of a planned overall evaluation of diagnostic performances of the most commonly used modalities for diagnosing HCC in people with chronic liver disease. The present systematic review will assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and AFP serum concentration for the diagnosis of HCC. Another systematic review will focus on the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in characterising suspected lesions as HCC as a second‐line diagnostic modality, and a third systematic review will focus on the assessment of CT as another second‐ or third‐line imaging modality (if CEUS was used as second‐line test) in assessing focal liver lesions detected on ultrasound. A review assessing the accuracy of MRI for diagnosing HCC is in progress . We are planning to produce an overview of the reviews that assess abdominal ultrasound and AFP, CEUS, CT, and MRI for the diagnosis of HCC.\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】To assess the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound and alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP), alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of any size and at any stage in people with chronic advanced liver disease, either in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting.\n\n【50】### Secondary objectives\n\n【51】*   To assess the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound and AFP, alone or in combination, for the diagnosis of resectable HCC in people with chronic advanced liver disease, either in a surveillance programme or in a clinical setting. The definition of resectable HCC is a neoplasm amenable to surgical radical resection according to the current guidelines , that is, a single lesion with a maximum diameter of less than five cm, or fewer than three lesions with a maximum diameter of three cm.\n\n【52】*   To compare the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests versus the combination of both tests.\n\n【53】*   To investigate the following predefined sources of heterogeneity:\n\n【54】    *   study design (prospective compared to retrospective; case‐control studies compared to cross‐sectional cohort studies);\n\n【55】    *   study date (studies published before the year 2000 compared to studies published after the year 2000, due to advancements in technology and changes in diagnostic criteria);\n\n【56】    *   inclusion of participants without cirrhosis (studies including more than 10% participants without cirrhosis compared to studies including less than 10% participants without cirrhosis);\n\n【57】    *   study location (population differences): studies conducted in the Americas compared to Europe compared to Asia;\n\n【58】    *   prevalence of the target condition (studies with HCC prevalence more than 10% compared to studies with HCC prevalence less than 10%);\n\n【59】    *   participant selection (participants recruited from planned screening programmes compared to clinical cohorts);\n\n【60】    *   different HCC stage (studies with more than 20% of participants with resectable HCC compared to studies with less than 20% of participants with resectable HCC);\n\n【61】    *   different reference standard (histology of the explanted liver compared to liver biopsy compared to another reference standard);\n\n【62】    *   different liver cirrhosis aetiology (hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus associated cirrhosis compared to all other aetiologies);\n\n【63】    *   different severity of the underlying chronic liver disease (per cent of participants with MELD (model for end‐stage liver disease) score less than 15 or Child Pugh score A);\n\n【64】    *   different AFP positivity cut‐off values in studies using ultrasound and AFP in combination.\n\n【65】Methods\n-------\n\n【66】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【67】#### Types of studies\n\n【68】We will aim to include studies, irrespective of publication status and language, that have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound and AFP, independently or in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC in people with chronic liver disease. These studies should have used one of the acceptable reference standards .\n\n【69】We will consider studies of cross‐sectional design which include participants with clinical suspicion of HCC, or cohort studies which include high‐risk participants in a surveillance programme, as well as studies with a case‐control design that compare people with known HCC to a matched control (participants with chronic liver disease without evidence of HCC). We will include studies assessing one index test (AFP or ultrasound, or both in combination) if all the participants underwent at least one of the acceptable reference standards. We plan to exclude studies that analysed data only per‐lesion, that is, those that considered the number of lesions rather than participants, unless participant data are made available by study authors.\n\n【70】#### Participants\n\n【71】##### Eligibility criteria\n\n【72】We will include study participants aged 18 years and older, of any sex, who are diagnosed with a chronic liver disease, irrespective of the severity and duration of the disease. Study participants must have been treatment‐naive for HCC when enrolled in the respective study.\n\n【73】##### Exclusion criteria\n\n【74】We will exclude studies which have included participants treated for HCC unless they represent less than 5% of all the included participants, or if data are presented in such a way as to allow this group of participants to be isolated from the remaining included participants.\n\n【75】#### Index tests\n\n【76】We will include abdominal ultrasound alone, AFP alone, and a combination of abdominal ultrasound and AFP for the detection of HCC in people with advanced chronic liver disease.\n\n【77】#### Target conditions\n\n【78】*   Hepatocellular carcinoma of any size and at any stage.\n\n【79】*   Resectable hepatocellular carcinoma .\n\n【80】#### Reference standards\n\n【81】We will accept as a reference standard for the diagnosis of HCC one of the following.\n\n【82】*   The pathology of the explanted liver in case of transplantation.\n\n【83】*   The histology of resected focal liver lesion(s), or the histology of resected or biopsied focal liver lesion(s) with a follow‐up period of at least six months to exclude synchronous lesions from the parenchyma surrounding the resected or biopsied area.\n\n【84】*   Typical characteristics on cross‐sectional multiphasic contrast CT or MRI, with a follow‐up period of at least six months in order to allow the confirmation of an initial negative result on CT or on MRI.\n\n【85】We acknowledge that all these reference standards, even if commonly used in clinical practice, are not perfect. The pathology of the explanted liver is possible only in the case when all the included patients undergo liver transplantation; therefore, the setting does not correspond to the clinical question that only people with advanced and decompensated liver disease are candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation. In the case of histology of resected focal lesion, histology of biopsied liver lesions, CT or MRI examination, the negative result can be confirmed only with an adequate follow‐up period. This would introduce an unavoidable differential verification bias. In addition, CT and MRI cannot be considered completely accurate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effectiveness and safety of fertility preservation strategies including controlled ovarian hyper stimulation with freezing oocytes/embryos or ovarian suppression with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in premenopausal women with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Infertility secondary to premature ovarian failure (menopause) at the time of cancer treatment can be caused by various toxins. Anti‐cancer drugs are the most common toxins having the potential to cause irreversible damage to the ovarian tissues . This may lead to premature ovarian failure, characterised by absence of periods (amenorrhoea) and subsequent infertility, hot flushes, sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis . The effect of anti‐cancer drugs on ovarian function varies widely. Because of the impact on dividing cells, it seems likely that the granulosa and theca cells are most affected by anti‐cancer drugs. Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent used in almost all breast cancer treatments , is one of the most ovarian‐toxic agents. The effects vary by age, dose and drug. Considering the impact on ovarian tissue at a cellular level, we find in women treated with chemotherapy, a normal to mildly decreased number of immature eggs (primordial follicles) and a greater decrease in the number of larger maturing follicles. This indicates a smaller effect on oocytes than on follicular development . Clinical observations, especially amenorrhoea, which is often permanent, and develops during chemotherapy, match these findings. Menstrual function and fertility may return once treatment has finished .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】There are two main methods of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer: ovarian suppression and controlled ovarian hyper stimulation with freezing of oocytes/embryos.\n\n【9】_Ovarian suppression_  \nGonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) result in ovarian suppression and have a possible role in fertility preservation . Endogenous GnRH stimulates the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) by binding to the G‐protein coupled transmembrane receptor on the pituitary gland and entering the cell. After a while, GnRH and the receptor disconnect, the receptor migrates back to the pituitary gland surface and is ready for a new stimulation by GnRH. As long as the receptor is coupled, the cell is blocked . GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH‐receptor for a much longer time. Due to this binding, we see a down regulation of receptors. Fewer receptors are available so less stimulation is possible. This leads to a reduced production (or even a stop of production) of LH and FSH and thereby a suppression of the ovaries . GnRH agonists used for this purpose are goselerin, leuprolide acetate and triptorelin .\n\n【10】_Controlled ovarian hyper stimulation with freezing of oocytes/embryos_  \nThis treatment can be offered to women with cancer as a rapid intervention prior to the commencement of anti‐cancer drugs, and includes embryo cryopreservation (freezing), vitrification of oocytes, and ovarian tissue freezing with in vitro maturation of oocytes. This is sometimes described as emergency in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation methods are widely used and currently considered as established methods of fertility preservation in women with cancer . All these techniques require ovarian hyper stimulation: a technique used to induce ovulation by multiple ovarian follicles. A conventional IVF cycle requires approximately 10‐14 days of controlled ovarian hyper stimulation to achieve multi‐follicular development. Normally, this stimulation results in a 10‐15 times higher level of oestrogen (serum oestradiol). Although there is no evidence for poor outcomes with high levels of oestrogen, in women with breast cancer there are concerns about safety . To avoid these high levels, tamoxifen or letrozole are used for hyper stimulation. Letrozole is a non‐steroid aromatase inhibitor, which competitively inhibits the aromatase enzyme and thereby reduces the formation of oestrogens . Tamoxifen, a non‐steroid triphenylethylene, inhibits binding of natural oestrogen to the oestrogen receptor .\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】_Ovarian suppression_  \nThe exact way in which GnRH agonists protect the ovaries is unclear. The most supported theory at the moment is that the ovaries are less susceptible to damage if they are inactive. So in theory, temporary elimination of the ovarian function causes temporary protection of the ovaries. GnRH agonists facilitate this temporary elimination. However, it is likely that the ovarian follicles are still exposed to the DNA damaging agents. In addition, primordial follicles do not express gonadotropin receptors, so it is unknown how GnRH agonists positively affect these cells . Following the cessation of the GnRHa, it is hoped that a proportion of the follicles have been protected by the treatment and will respond to ovarian stimulation at a later date.\n\n【13】_Controlled ovarian hyper stimulation with freezing of oocytes/embryos_  \nTo increase the chances of successful IVF treatment, we need to aim for multifollicular follicular growth. This can be done by controlled ovarian hyper stimulation, using aromatase inhibitors, such as tamoxifen or letrozole which are associated with lower oestrogen levels, and which may be important for women with breast cancer. Transfer of embryos or fertilisation of oocytes can then be scheduled at a time when all anti‐cancer drugs are ceased.\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Women with cancer are often in the reproductive age group and they face a difficult decision about undergoing treatment that may result in complete loss of their fertility. Although we will search for evidence on all types of cancer, breast cancer will be our primary focus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, covering 25% of all cases . Approximately 7% of women with breast cancer are diagnosed before the age of 40 . In the last 20 years, improvements in diagnostics and treatment have yielded an important decrease in mortality . Owing to these improvements, more and more women are now surviving cancer and have to deal with the serious long‐term effects of cancer treatment, of which infertility due to irreversible damage to the ovaries is one. Fertility is one of the topics women are concerned about, after surviving cancer. It is important to eliminate these concerns, because they may affect decisions about cancer treatment or may have a negative impact on global health of young survivors of breast cancer .This review can gain an understanding of the best way to support women with breast cancer, in order to not lose their fertility.\n\n【16】Embryo cryopreservation after IVF after ovarian stimulation, is currently considered as an established fertility preservation option. However, this technique is not available to everyone and the delay of a few weeks at the start of cancer treatment is a concern. That is why we need to have the best available evidence for ovarian suppression regimens used during chemotherapy as well .\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To determine the effectiveness and safety of fertility preservation strategies including controlled ovarian hyper stimulation with freezing oocytes/embryos or ovarian suppression with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in premenopausal women with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】We will include published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

The main purpose of these aids is to reduce pain, improve physical function and, possibly, to slow disease progression. This review was originally published in Issue 1, 2005.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of a brace or orthosis in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE (Current contents, Health STAR) up to October 2002 in the original review and in this update until May 2007. Reference lists of identified trials were screened.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised and controlled clinical trials investigating all types of braces and orthoses for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Three reviewers independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, pooling of outcomes was not possible.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Five studies (n=589) were included: two knee brace and three orthoses studies. In the longer follow‐up studies (1 to 2 years) many patients stopped their brace or insole treatment.\n\n【12】The pain and function scores of a brace and a neoprene sleeve group showed greater improvement at six months compared with a control group. In a second brace study, the pain and function scores were improved in the brace group compared with the controls, but only the walking distance was significantly longer.  \n\n【13】In one study there was a significantly less intake of NSAIDs and significantly better compliance in a lateral wedge group compared with a neutral wedge group, but there were no significant differences in function scores at 6 and 24 months.\n\n【14】In another insole study at 6 months follow up, the pain score was significantly improved in the strapped insole group compared with the traditional lateral wedge group (relative percentage difference (RPD=29%). The femorotibial angle was significantly improved in the strapped insole group at 6 and 24 months (RPDs at both timepoints= ‐1.1%). The pain and function scores were not significantly different at 24 months.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Based on two brace and three insole studies, we conclude that there is 'silver' level evidence  that a brace and a lateral wedge insole have small beneficial effect.  \nThere is 'silver' level evidence that strapped insoles correct leg alignment. However, long‐term adherence to brace and insole treatment is low. There is no evidence whether a brace is more effective than an insole.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Knee osteoarthritis\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Ankle Joint Orthosis\n*   Foot Orthosis\n*   Inshoe Orthosis\n*   Flexible Ankle-foot Orthosis\n*   Ankle/foot Orthosis\n*   Brace\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Ankle Joint Orthosis\n*   Foot Orthosis\n*   Usual Care\n*   Inshoe Orthosis\n*   Flexible Ankle-foot Orthosis\n*   Ankle/foot Orthosis\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Pain\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Treatment Failure\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Stiffness\n*   Withdrawal Due To Adverse Events\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Functional ability\n*   Health-Related Quality of Life\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【26】### Braces and orthoses for osteoarthritis\n\n【27】This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of braces and orthoses for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\n\n【28】The review shows that in people with OA of the knee :\n\n【29】wearing a knee brace compared to no brace:\n\n【30】increases the distance you are able to walk.  \nmay not lead to any difference in pain, knee function, or quality of life.\n\n【31】wearing a laterally wedged orthosis compared to wearing a neutral wedge:\n\n【32】may not lead to any difference in pain, knee function or overall well‐being.\n\n【33】wearing an elastically strapped insole compared to wearing a traditional lateral wedge after 6 months:\n\n【34】may improve pain and function.\n\n【35】We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Possible side effects may include pain in the back of the knee, low back pain, foot sole pain, skin irritation and poor fit.\n\n【36】An assessment of any changes in the x‐rays of the joints over the long term was not measured in these studies.\n\n【37】**What is osteoarthritis and what are braces and orthoses?**  \nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis that can affect the hands, hips, shoulders and knees. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down and causes pain and swelling. OA can occur in different areas of the knee or the whole knee. Depending on the area, OA can change the alignment of joints. Braces and orthoses are devices that you wear to support your knee joint. Orthoses are insoles that fit comfortably inside your shoes. Braces are made of combinations of metal, foam, plastic, elastic material and straps. A knee brace can be fitted especially for the person wearing it.\n\n【38】**Best estimate of what happens to people with OA who use a knee brace:**\n\n【39】Walking distance: People were able to walk 1.8 km longer after wearing a knee brace for one year. These results are based on high quality evidence.\n\n【40】**Best estimate of what happens to people with OA who wear foot or ankle orthoses:**\n\n【41】Pain: People's pain was reduced by 14 more points on a scale of 0 to 100 after wearing an orthoses for 6 months.

Primary outcomes of interest were global state and adverse effects.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We inspected citations and abstracts independently, ordered papers and re‐inspected and quality assessed trials. We extracted data independently. Dichotomous data were analysed using fixed effects relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI).

Compared with placebo, in the short‐term, global state outcomes for 'not improved' were not significantly different (n=75, 2 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.5 to 1.1). There is evidence that oral fluphenazine, in the short term, increases a person's chances of experiencing extrapyramidal effects such as akathisia (n=227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.43 CI 1.2 to 9.6, NNH 13 CI 4 to 128) and rigidity (n=227, 2 RCTs, RR 3.54 CI 1.8 to 7.1, NNH 6 CI 3 to 17).

Fluphenazine's global position as an effective treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the outcome of this review. However, fluphenazine is an imperfect treatment and If accessible, other inexpensive drugs less associated with adverse effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia.\n\n【15】The addition of seven studies to awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review once assessed.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Schizophrenic Related Disorders\n*   Schizophrenia\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Fluphenazine\n*   Oral\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Placebo\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Anticholinergics\n*   Relapse\n*   Extrapyramidal Sign\n*   Global Assessment\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Schizophrenia is a chronic relapsing mental illness, characterised by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and emotional withdrawal. Antipsychotic drugs are effective for controlling florid symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions but are less effective for treating emotional withdrawal. Antipsychotics are associated with adverse effects such as movement disorders, and the overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.\n\n【27】Fluphenazine is an inexpensive and widely accessible antipsychotic drug that has been available to treat people with schizophrenia for five decades. In this review, for perhaps the first time, we objectively quantify the effects of oral administration of fluphenazine in comparison with placebo. It is indeed a potent antipsychotic but with considerable adverse effects. Other drugs may well be preferable.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

MPS I who do not undergo HSCT;\n\n【4】2.  MPS I who receive ERT prior to HSCT.\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】A glossary of terms can be found in the appendices .\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Mucopolysaccharides, more commonly termed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), are essential components of connective tissue providing structural support, as well as being involved in cellular regulation and communication. They are sugars composed of highly sulfated, alternating uronic acid and hexosamine residues, assembled into repeating units bound to specific core proteins within complex macromolecules called proteoglycans. Lysosomes are the cell organelles which are involved in the degradation of these large proteoglycans. The process of degradation requires several acid hydrolases. Deficiency of any one of these hydrolases results in a specific disease state. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) results when there is a deficiency of the enzyme alpha‐L‐iduronidase. This results in the inability of the lysosomes to breakdown two specific GAGs, dermatan and heparan sulphate.\n\n【10】Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1 in 100,000  and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha‐L‐iduronidase located on chromosome 4p16.3. The pathological MPS I alleles display significant ethnic variation. The common gene mutations in Caucasians are W402X and Q70X . The disorder can be detected on screening of urine for urinary GAGs and if this is positive, confirmed by white cell enzyme analysis followed by mutation analysis. It is possible to perform antenatal testing on chorionic villus samples.\n\n【11】Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified as three clinical sub‐types, Hurler syndrome, Hurler‐Scheie syndrome and Scheie syndrome, with the scale of severity being such that Hurler is the most severe and Scheie the least. In cases of Hurler syndrome the child classically presents in the first year of life. The presentation can be varied and may take the form of cardiomyopathy, recurrent ear, nose and throat symptoms or recognition of coarse facies. Over the second and third years of life the other classic features of short stature and bony deformity, developmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly and corneal clouding develop. The clinical consequence is a chronic, progressive multi‐system disease, which if left untreated results in death by adolescence. At the opposite end of the spectrum, children with Scheie syndrome are intellectually normal and can have a normal life span; however, many will become disabled due to degenerative bony disease, corneal opacity and valvular heart disease. It is estimated that 26% of MPS I cases are of the attenuated Scheie phenotype and 50% to 80% the severe Hurler form . Biochemically, the different phenotypes are indistinguishable and it is being increasingly acknowledged that MPS I represents a disease spectrum. All cases of MPS I are recorded on the MPS I register . This is a database which contains the clinical, investigation and treatment details of all patients with any of the mucopolysaccharidosis disorders. This database provides valuable information which can then be used for evidence‐based research and practice.\n\n【12】Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) either alone or in combination with haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the mainstay of treatment. It has been seen that the earlier treatment with ERT is commenced the better the outcome and that the use of HSCT prior to two years of age preserves cognition. In order to therefore maximise outcomes the diagnosis of MPS I must be made in a timely manner. It is thus postulated that MPS I may be a candidate for part of an expanded newborn screening schedule. It would be a suitable screening candidate as it can be detected on a blood spot sample, there is an effective treatment available and outcomes are much improved with early diagnosis. There would however be cost implications as ERT and HSCT are expensive therapies, and more research would be required into the effectiveness and long‐term outcomes.\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase, and in recent years laronidase in combination with HSCT in children under two years of age, has become the mainstay of treatment .The latter is the preferred treatment regimen as transplantation provides an endogenous source of the missing enzyme, avoids the need for long‐term ERT and is better able to preserve cognition. The children typically receive laronidase between diagnosis and transplantation in order to maximise their pre‐transplantation condition and thus reduce their transplantation morbidity and mortality risks. The laronidase is then continued throughout conditioning and until donor engraftment has occurred.\n\n【15】Laronidase (Aldurazyme <sup>® </sup> , produced by the Genzyme Corporation) is a specific recombinant alpha‐L‐iduronidase which received Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) approval as long‐term treatment for MPS I in 2003. It is a polymorphic variant of the human enzyme, alpha‐L‐iduronidase, with a molecular weight of 83 kD. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The rationale of therapy is to provide exogenous enzyme for uptake into lysosomes and so to increase the catabolism of GAGs, and prevent their build up in tissues. The uptake of laronidase by cells into lysosomes is most likely mediated by the mannose‐6‐phosphate‐terminated oligosaccharide chains of laronidase binding to specific mannose‐6‐phosphate receptors.\n\n【16】The recommended dose is 0.58 mg/kg administered on a weekly basis as an intravenous infusion.The pharmacodynamic effects have been assessed by analysing alterations in urinary GAG levels, it was shown to significantly reduce these levels. The pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in patients six years and over. The mean plasma clearance ranged from 1.7 to 2.7 ml/min/kg and the mean half life ranged form 1.5 to 3.6 hours. (These data come from published information on the Aldurazyme <sup>® </sup> drug .)\n\n【17】It has been observed that most patients develop antibodies by week 12 of the infusion. Patients are therefore routinely pre‐medicated with anti‐histamines and anti‐pyretics one hour before the infusion commences. Side‐effects of laronidase include vomiting, nausea, arthralgia, diarrhoea, tachycardia, abdominal pain, hypertension, erythema, and cyanosis. There are no known drug interactions. Overall, the safety data have been encouraging .\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Gaucher disease, another inherited lysosomal storage disorder, is due to a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. The disorder is characterised by accumulation of the lipid glucocerebroside within the lysosomes of the monocyte‐macrophage system and leads to a multi‐system disorder with three distinct clinical phenotypes . In 1991 targeted enzyme replacement therapy in the form of Cerezyme <sup>® </sup> (imiglucerase for injection) was developed by the Genzyme Corporation in cooperation with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It was introduced into clinical practice in 1994 and it was seen to alleviate and even reverse many effects of Type 1 Gaucher disease . It was therefore postulated that enzyme replacement therapy might also work in MPS I and consequently laronidase was developed on a dog model. Laronidase has subsequently been used in human patients to replace the missing alpha‐L‐iduronidase and so allow the lysosomes to breakdown dermatan and heparan sulphate.\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】Debate has arisen regarding the potential for newborn screening for MPS I, as it is believed that the earlier the condition is diagnosed the better the outcome. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of ERT with laronidase for patients with MPS I.\n\n【22】This review is important to conduct because:\n\n【23】*   it will be the first systematic review of the use of laronidase in the management of MPS I;\n\n【24】*   data collation will allow provision of evidence‐based rationale for management recommendations;\n\n【25】*   the systematic review will be of use to the MPS I Registry ;\n\n【26】*   it can be used in the debate surrounding newborn screening for MPS I.\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】The objectives of this review will be to assess the effectiveness and safety of ERT with laronidase in the management of patients with:\n\n【29】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone for pain in adults with cancer.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pain from cancer can be caused by direct invasion of tumour into soft tissue or bone and is often a presenting symptom at the diagnosis of cancer. A European survey published in 2009 found that of 5000 cancer patients (including 617 community‐based National Health Service (NHS) patients in the United Kingdom (UK) 72% experienced pain (77% in UK) which was of moderate to severe intensity in 90% of this group . This is consistent with a recent systematic review that demonstrated cancer pain prevalence of up to 75% in advanced disease, and that almost one in two patients are under treated .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Oxycodone is a strong opioid analgesic indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain, including cancer pain. It is available orally as immediate release solution and tablets (for 4‐ hourly dosing), and as sustained release tablets (for 12‐ hourly dosing). It is also available as a parenteral injection. In some countries, oxycodone is available as a compound with acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen.\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】Oxycodone works primarily as an agonist of mu‐opioid receptors in the spinal cord and brain. It has some activity at kappa‐opioid receptors (which are also involved in nociception or analgesia) though the importance of this mechanism in the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone is unclear. Despite animal studies suggesting differences in pharmacodynamics, this has not been demonstrated in clinical studies to date. Therefore, the shared mechanism of action to morphine (i.e. agonist activity at mu‐ opioid receptors) means that clinical benefits and adverse effects are likely to be similar. However, important differences exist in the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs (morphine undergoes second phase elimination via glucuronidation, while oxycodone undergoes extensive first phase metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 pathways) so clinical equivalence cannot be inferred .\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】The World Health Organisation published the Method for Cancer Pain Relief (WHO analgesic ladder) in 1986  which advocates a stepwise approach to analgesia for cancer pain and revolutionised the use of oral opioids. It recommended that morphine be used first line for moderate to severe cancer pain. Observational studies have suggested that this approach results in pain control for 73% of patients  with a mean reduction in pain intensity of 65% .\n\n【13】Many patients with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with strong analgesics. Oxycodone and morphine are examples of strong opioids that are used for the relief of cancer pain. Strong opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all patients, nor are they well‐tolerated by all patients. Recent guidance on the use of opioids in cancer pain by the European Association for Palliative Care suggests that oxycodone could be used as first line treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain as an alternative to morphine . The aim of this review is to assess whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other analgesic options for patients with cancer pain.\n\n【14】This protocol has been updated from Reid 2010 .\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone for pain in adults with cancer.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Randomised controlled trials, with parallel‐group or cross‐over design., comparing oxycodone (any formulation and any route of administration) with placebo or an active drug (including oxycodone) for cancer background pain.

Cervical dystonia is the most common form of focal dystonia, and is a highly disabling movement disorder, characterised by involuntary, usually painful, head posturing. Currently, botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is considered the first line therapy for this condition.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BtA versus placebo, in people with cervical dystonia.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched Cochrane Movement Disorders' Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, and conference proceedings in July 2020. All elements of the search, with no language restrictions, were last run in July 2020.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Double‐blind, parallel, randomised, placebo‐controlled trials (RCTs) of BtA versus placebo in adults with cervical dystonia.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently assessed records, selected included studies, extracted data using a paper pro forma, and evaluated the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review author. We performed meta‐analyses using a random‐effects model, for the comparison of BtA versus placebo, to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We performed preplanned subgroup analyses according to BtA dose used, the BtA formulation used, and the use (or not) of guidance for BtA injections. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement in cervical dystonia‐specific impairment. The primary safety outcome was the proportion of participants with any adverse event.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included nine RCTs, with moderate, overall risk of bias, that included 1144 participants with cervical dystonia. Seven studies excluded participants with poorer responses to BtA treatment, therefore, including an enriched population with a higher probability of benefiting from this therapy. Only one trial was independently funded. All RCTs evaluated the effect of a single BtA treatment session, using doses from 150 U to 500 U of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), 120 U to 240 U of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin), and 250 U to 1000 U of abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport).\n\n【12】BtA resulted in a moderate to large improvement from the participant's baseline clinical status, assessed by the investigators, with a mean reduction of 8.09 points in the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS total score) at week four after injection (95% CI 6.22 to 9.96; I² = 0%) compared to placebo. This corresponded, on average, to a 18.4% improvement from baseline. The mean difference (MD) in TWSTRS pain subscore at week four was 2.11 (95% CI 1.38 to 2.83; I² = 0%) compared to placebo. Overall, both participants and clinicians reported an improvement of subjective clinical status. It was unclear if dropouts due to adverse events differed (risk ratio (RR) 2.51; 95% CI 0.42 to 14.94; I² = 0%) However, BtA treatment increased the risk of experiencing an adverse event (RR) 1.23; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.43; I² = 28%). Neck weakness (14%; RR 3.40; 95% CI 1.19 to 9.71; I² = 15%), dysphagia (11%; RR 3.19; 95% CI 1.79 to 5.70; I² = 0%), and diffuse weakness or tiredness (8%; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.95; I² = 0%) were the most common treatment‐related adverse events. Treatment with BtA resulted in a decreased risk of dropouts. We have moderate certainty in the evidence across all of the aforementioned outcomes, with the exception of subjective assessment and tolerability, in which we have high confidence in the evidence.\n\n【13】We found no evidence supporting the existence of a clear dose‐response relationship between BtA and improvement in cervical dystonia‐specific impairment, a destinction between BtA formulations, or a variation with use of EMG‐guided injection for efficacy outcomes.\n\n【14】Due to clinical heterogeneity, we did not pool health‐related quality of life data, duration of clinical effect, or the development of secondary non‐responsiveness.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】We are moderately certain in the evidence that a single BtA treatment session resulted in a clinically relevant reduction of cervical dystonia‐specific impairment, and pain, and highly certain that it is well tolerated, compared with placebo. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that people treated with BtA are at an increased risk of developing adverse events, most notably, dysphagia, neckweakness and diffuse weakness or tiredness. There are no data from RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of repeated BtA injection cycles. There is no evidence from RCTs to allow us to draw definitive conclusions on the optimal treatment intervals and doses, the usefulness of guidance techniques for injection, the impact on quality of life, or the duration of treatment effect.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Idiopathic Orofacial Dystonia\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Intramuscular\n*   Botulinum Toxin Type A\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Placebo\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Asthenia\n*   Isolated Cervical Dystonia\n*   Tiredness\n*   Dysphagia\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Tolerance Related Finding\n*   Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

It is a relatively uncommon condition (affecting 57 to 280 people per million) that can be very disabling, and can negatively affect a person's quality of life. In most cases, the cause is unknown; no cure exists. Since cervical dystonia is normally a long‐term disorder, it requires long‐term treatment.\n\n【31】Botulinum toxin is a powerful, natural chemical that can cause severe paralysis (an inability to move in the part of the body where it is injected) in animals and humans _._ It can also be used to treat many conditions, in particular, those with involuntary muscle contractions, such as cervical dystonia. Botulinum toxin is delivered by injections into the muscles that contract to produce most of the disorder symptoms. There are different types of botulinum toxin, not all are available for treating health conditions. BtA is typically considered the first treatment option in cervical dystonia.\n\n【32】**Study characteristics**\n\n【33】We searched the medical literature up to July 2020. We found nine studies that compared treatment with BtA versus placebo, and included a total of 1144 participants, with on average, a moderate disease impairment. The participants remained in most of the studies for 16 to 20 weeks after the treatment. The average age of people in the studies was 52.8 years, and they had cervical dystonia for an average of 4.8 to 12.1 years before taking part in the trials. Sixty‐four percent of the people in the studies were women. Eight of the nine trials were funded by drug manufacturers with possible interests in the results of the studies.\n\n【34】**Key results**\n\n【35】The results show that a single treatment session improved cervical dystonia symptoms, including pain, and participant's self‐evaluations. However, the risk of having an unpleasant or undesirable event, particularly swallowing difficulties, tiredness, and neck weakness, was also increased. Only three studies examined the impact of BtA on quality of life, suggesting some benefit from BtA.\n\n【36】**Certainty in the evidence**\n\n【37】There is moderate certainty in the evidence for overall and pain improvement, and the risk of undesired events. There is high certainty in the evidence that participants reported self‐evaluated improvement, and the risk that participants did not tolerate treatment.\n\n【38】To be included in the studies, participants must have had a history of successful treatment with BtA. People with certain types of cervical dystonia, in particular the types that make the head turn mostly backward or forward, were not allowed to participate in the studies; it is known that they do not respond as well to botulinum toxin treatment. Therefore, the conclusions from this review may not apply to all people with cervical dystonia.\n\n【39】We can draw no conclusions regarding long‐term effects of BtA for this condition.\n\n【40】--------------\n\n【41】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【42】### Implications for practice\n\n【43】In this updated Cochrane Review, we found that a single treatment session of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) is effective and well‐tolerated in the treatment of moderately impaired adults with certain types of cervical dystonia. The clinical benefit includes moderate to large improvements in severity, disability, and pain. The benefit is also meaningful when subjectively assessed by participants. The evidence is less robust regarding health‐related quality of life improvements. Adverse events are frequent, but are not commonly associated with discontinuing treatment. In fact, since dropouts were less frequent in the BtA group, we can assume that people with cervical dystonia find the risk‐benefit profile of BtA to be favourable. Dysphagia, diffuse weakness or tiredness, and neck weakness are the most frequent treatment‐related adverse events of special interest. We are moderately certain about the conclusions based on the evidence.\n\n【44】The available evidence does not allow us to draw conclusions on the existence of a clear dose‐benefit response, support or refute the routine use of electromyography (EMG)‐guided BtA injections, or to determine the comparative risk‐benefit profiles of the different BtA formulations available.\n\n【45】We can draw no conclusions for people with pure retrocollis or anterocollis, as they were predominantly excluded in the clinical trials.\n\n【46】### Implications for research\n\n【47】We had access to published research data from trials of BtA versus placebo, in adults with certain types of cervical dystonia. The net benefit of a single BtA injection in the treatment of cervical dystonia was not clearly established in the published trials, making it difficult to determine which, and how many resources should be invested in future research. Essentially, the clinical benefit and utility of BtA is not in doubt, although the magnitude of this benefit, as with other movement disorders, is liable to vary in a real‐world setting .\n\n【48】Nonetheless, further studies are needed to establish the relative effectiveness of different doses of BtA, assessing efficacy, safety, duration of effect, and quality of life across regimens. They should consider repeated BtA treatment sessions, and assess these factors under conditions more closely resembling clinical practice (pragmatic clinical trials). Because therapy typically requires optimising a dose for each person, rather than administering a fixed dose of botulinum toxin, such a line of research would be important to support physicians' management of doses, and allow a more solid and safe individualisation of treatment. Also to be determined is the added value, if any, of guidance methods (e.g. EMG) for injecting botulinum toxin into the cervical muscles.\n\n【49】Future research concerning all formulations of botulinum toxin should endeavour to establish clinical effectiveness, not only based on changes from baseline, but also, preferably, based on validated measures of minimal clinically important difference or change . Research is required to establish such a parameter for the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), currently the most widely used and disseminated clinical scale in the field. We are aware of an effort to create a new clinical scale in dystonia ‐ the Comprehensive Cervical Dystonia Rating Scale, which will include a revision of the TWSTRS, to be named TWSTRS‐2, with plans in the works to validate a minimal clinically important change .\n\n【50】It is currently uncertain whether or not the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin decays over repeated treatment sessions, and whether a possible loss of effectiveness occurs in all clinical domains. Future studies comparing any form of BtA should address the comparative proportion of participants who develop secondary non‐responsiveness to treatment.\n\n【51】Finally, in conducting this systematic review, we were faced with the fact that there is no defined core outcome set in cervical dystonia research, as there are for other areas . To promote research in this field, and to support the clinical effectiveness of botulinum toxin, it would be relevant to define a set of core outcome measures, and include it in future research, via well‐established methodology, to determine the inclusion of participant‐reported outcomes .\n\n【52】Given the high degree of certainty in the results, and the fact that most of the outcomes are adequately‐powered and provide robust evidence of efficacy, future efforts to update this review may not be justified, unless Cochrane methodology changes or some of the research suggestions are published.\n\n【53】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【54】Summary of findings 1.

Dystonia syndromes are a group of disabling, painful disorders, characterised by involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements or postures of the face, neck, trunk, or limbs. Dystonic movements are typically patterned or twisting, and are often initiated or worsened by voluntary action . These neurological disorders can be classified, based on topographic distribution, including focal dystonia (one body region, e.g. cervical dystonia and blepharospasm), segmental dystonia (two or more adjacent regions), multifocal dystonia (two or more nonadjacent regions), hemidystonia (ipsilateral regions), and generalised dystonia (trunk and two or more other regions; ).\n\n【65】Focal dystonia is a highly disabling movement disorder, with serious functional and social impairment. Close to half of the people with it quit work by the age of forty, or retire early, and 10 years later, only 25% of people are working compared to 62% of the general population . Moreover, health‐related quality of life is importantly diminished, mainly attributable to depression and anxiety, with scores comparable to people with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, or stroke .\n\n【66】Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is the most common form of adult‐onset focal dystonia, with estimates from population studies ranging from 57 per million in Europe , to as high as 280 per million in the USA . It typically has its onset in the fifth decade , and affects more women than men . This condition is characterised by abnormal movements of the head, neck, and shoulder, resulting in posturing of the head away from its normal central position . It may present predominantly with sustained abnormal posture, spasm, jerks, tremor, or a combination of these features. Neck or shoulder pain, or both, occur in more than 70% of individuals with cervical dystonia .\n\n【67】Cervical dystonia can be classified according to the dominant head position, with the most common type involving horizontal turning, the so‐called rotatory (or simple) torticollis . Other common patterns include laterocollis (tilt to one side), retrocollis (tilt upwards, resulting in neck extension), and anterocollis (tilt downwards, resulting in neck flexion). Among all forms of cervical dystonia, complex torticollis, a combination of these abnormal patterns, is found relatively frequently in clinical practice.\n\n【68】The aetiology of most forms of dystonia is still not fully understood, with the exception of early‐onset dystonia, for which a hereditary aetiology is common . In most cases of focal adult‐onset dystonia, such as cervical dystonia, the pathophysiology is generally considered to result from inhibition of the central nervous system (CNS) at multiple levels, resulting in abnormal sensorimotor integration . Cervical dystonia can also be secondary to brain injury, infections of the CNS, drugs (such as levodopa or antipsychotics), toxins, vascular or neoplastic disorders, and may also be psychogenic (i.e. functional; ). Although most cases of cervical dystonia are currently classified as idiopathic, it should be noted that some may come to be reclassified as inherited, since new gene discoveries are under investigation .\n\n【69】The natural course of cervical dystonia remains unclear. It usually develops gradually and deteriorates over the initial years. The clinical presentation in adults seldom progresses to generalised dystonia, although it often extends to adjacent body regions. For most individuals, cervical dystonia is a life‐long disorder, with only about 10% undergoing spontaneous remissions .\n\n【70】To date, no curative or disease‐modifying treatments are available for cervical dystonia.\n\n【71】### Description of the intervention\n\n【72】Botulinum toxin is a powerful biological toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ . The active form of botulinum toxin is a di‐chain polypeptide composed of two chains: a heavy chain (100 kDa) and a light chain (50 kDa), and by associating with certain auxiliary proteins (haemagglutinins and non‐haemagglutinins), the toxin forms a non‐covalent multimeric complex of variable size . The nontoxic proteins aid the formation of neutralising antibodies, though beyond this, their role is unclear . Botulinim toxin binds to peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals of the neuromuscular junction, as well as sympathetic ganglionic, parasympathetic ganglionic, and postganglionic terminals . After binding to an acceptor protein, botulinum toxin is endocytosed at the presynaptic membrane of acetylcholine nerve terminals . By action of the N‐terminal on the heavy chain, a pore is formed on the endocytic membrane, which permits the release of the light chain into the cytosol. This light chain, which is a zinc protease, performs the key action of the botulinum toxin, by cleaving soluble N‐ethylmaleimide‐sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins (SNARE proteins; ).\n\n【73】SNAREs are docking proteins for acetylcholine vesicles that allow for the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft . The overall effect of botulinum toxin is a local chemodenervation by the temporary blockade of acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses. Temporary synapses are consequently formed via the process of axonal sprouting .\n\n【74】There are seven immunologically distinct botulinum toxin serotypes (labelled A to G). These different botulinum toxin serotypes cleave specific SNARE proteins. Serotype A cleaves SNARE protein SNAP 25, located on the inner membrane of nerve cells .\n\n【75】Botulinum toxin is injected into the muscles thought to be involved in dystonia, with or without guidance by either electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. As a general rule, the number of muscles injected are tailored to the severity of the case in question, and the number of injection sites per muscle are determined by the mass of the muscle. Within roughly three months after injection of botulinum toxin into skeletal muscle, the nerve terminal resumes exocytosis, and the muscle returns to its baseline clinical function, showing a wearing‐off response from the botulinum toxin injection . Eventually, the muscle paralysis subsides; this is associated with the formation of new sprouts that are capable of neurotransmission. Over time, synaptic activity resumes in the original nerve terminals, leading to sprout regression .\n\n【76】Currently there are two commercially available botulinum toxin serotypes – botulinum toxin type A (BtA) and botulinum toxin type B (BtB). The following products are commonly available (three BtA and one BtB): onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport, Reloxin, or Azzalure, Ipsen Pharma, Boulogne Billancourt, France), incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin or Bocoture Merz GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany), and rimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc or Neurobloc, Solstice Neurosciences Inc., Louisville, KY, USA). Other BtA formulations are available in more restricted markets, and are yet to receive a generic name: Prosigne or Lantox (Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, China), PurTox (Mentor Worldwide LLC, Santa Barbara, CA, USA), and Neuronox (Medy‐Tox Inc, South Korea; ).\n\n【77】### How the intervention might work\n\n【78】The therapeutic potential of all botulinum toxin serotypes derives from their ability to inhibit the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal into the synaptic cleft, causing local chemodenervation . In addition to this, recent research has also suggested that botulinum toxin is active at multiple levels, namely sensory nerve terminals, and muscle spindles, which leads to a reduction in sensory input and fewer muscle contractions .\n\n【79】It has been further suggested that cortical reorganisation may result from changes in the spinal cord, brainstem, and central nervous pathways . Animal research has shown the presence of supra‐therapeutic levels of botulinum toxin by way of retrograde axonal transport and penetration of the CNS . However, botulinum toxin has not been shown to penetrate the blood‐brain barrier in humans.\n\n【80】Until recently, SNARE proteins were considered the only target molecules of botulinum toxin. Thus, it was widely accepted that the therapeutic and toxic actions of botulinum toxin were exclusively mediated by SNARE cleavage preventing the release of synaptic neurotransmitters. However, recent studies have suggested that a number of botulinum toxin actions might not be mediated by SNARE cleavage, specifically regarding neuroexocytosis, cell cycle and apoptosis, neuritogenesis, and gene expression . The existence of unknown botulinum toxin molecular targets and modulation of unknown signalling pathways is a possibility that may prove to be pharmacologically relevant.\n\n【81】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【82】BtA is the toxin serotype that has been most intensively studied and approved for the treatment of the large number of focal dystonias. BtA is considered first line therapy for cervical dystonia . BtB has also been shown to be efficacious, though with a different safety profile . However, even in moderately severe dystonia, there is evidence that people attach a considerable expectation of harm due to botulinum toxin, the so called nocebo effect .\n\n【83】This is an update of a Cochrane Review that assessed the efficacy and safety of BtA compared to placebo in people with cervical dystonia. Since the release of the original review, three new trials have been published . Cochrane’s criteria for evaluating studies' risk of bias and the certainty in evidence have also evolved and been updated. Therefore, the authors considered it important to update this review.\n\n【84】Objectives\n----------\n\n【85】To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) versus placebo in people with cervical dystonia.\n\n【86】Methods\n-------\n\n【87】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【88】#### Types of studies\n\n【89】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), blinded, single or multiple dose, parallel‐designed, of any duration, assessing the efficacy or safety, or both, of botulinum toxin type A (BtA) treatment versus placebo, in people with cervical dystonia were eligible for inclusion in this review. We excluded non‐parallel study designs, namely cross‐over trials, due to uncertainty about whether this type of study design was appropriate to study people with cervical dystonia, as well as methodological concerns with regards to detection and performance bias.\n\n【90】There were no restrictions regarding the number of participants recruited to trials, or the number of recruitment centres.\n\n【91】#### Types of participants\n\n【92】Adults (i.e. 18 years of age or older), in any setting, with a clinical diagnosis made by any physician, specialist, or _other healthcare provider’_ , of idiopathic cervical dystonia. We included trials enrolling participants with any form of cervical dystonia, with or without widespread dystonias.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of the current review is to analyze the rates of trocar‐related complications and postoperative pain for different trocar types used in patients undergoing laparoscopy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Surgery is by nature invasive and inevitably associated with complications and trauma. Laparoscopic surgery, also known as minimally invasive surgery, was developed to minimize surgical trauma as opposed to the open abdominal surgical technique (that is laparotomy). A laparoscopic procedure is an abdominal or pelvic operation conducted through small incisions in the abdominal wall. In gynecology, laparoscopy began in the late 1970s and was primarily used for diagnostic procedures. The first widely accepted laparoscopic procedure was tubal ligation . Thereafter; gynecological surgeons began to explore other applications, including diagnostic procedures for pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancies and appendicitis. In the early 1980s, additional operative procedures were introduced including adnexal surgery, uterine myomectomy and hysterectomy . Less visible scarring, less postoperative pain and rapid recovery have fueled patient advocacy and enabled an increasing use of laparoscopy. For healthcare providers, laparoscopy has the benefit of shorter hospital stays and thus reduced inpatient costs. The benefits for the surgeon include the magnified optics and no‐touch operative technique . There is indeed evidence that laparoscopy has advantages compared to laparotomy, which include fewer surgical injuries, fewer postoperative complications, less postoperative pain and shorter hospital stays . At present, with advanced laparoscopic operations for pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence and gynecological cancers, laparoscopy has become completely integrated into the field of gynecologic surgery. In general surgery and urology, laparoscopy is increasingly being used for different purposes as well.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】The first step in a laparoscopic procedure involves the introduction of a primary instrument (that is a Veress needle or trocar) followed by the insufflation of carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity. This is called the primary entry, which is applied to create a pneumoperitoneum. Different primary entry techniques are used in practice. Ahmad et al performed a Cochrane review on laparoscopic entry techniques and compared the different techniques in terms of their influence on intraoperative and postoperative complications . They found no evidence of benefit in terms of safety of one technique over another.\n\n【9】Intraperitoneal access for laparoscopic instruments is provided via 'ports'. Specific cannulas, called trocars, are introduced through the abdominal wall to create these ports. A distinction needs to be made between primary and secondary trocar ports. The first port for primary entry is located in or near the umbilicus. This port is used for the introduction of the laparoscope. Secondary or ancillary ports are intended for the introduction of laparoscopic instruments. The secondary port locations depend upon the location in the abdomen where the surgical procedure is to take place. In general a minimum of two secondary ports are created. The trocars are placed to facilitate operating in line with the camera while maintaining a comfortable operating position for the surgeon with triangulation of the instruments around the surgical focal point within the abdomen.\n\n【10】Trocar designs include a myriad of device designs, including over 100 brands from more than 20 manufacturers . A distinction can be made between reusable and disposable trocars. Reusable trocars are made of metal and have a perforator tip. Completely blunt trocars, with a cone‐shaped perforator tip, and sharp or cutting trocars with a conical, pyramidal, triflanged or excentric tip can be differentiated. Disposable trocars are made of plastic materials and are provided with bladed or bladeless tips. Shielded disposable trocars are provided with a retractable shield that covers the tip before and after insertion. Dilatation systems represent yet another technical alternative in trocar techniques. These trocars are equipped with a radially expanding sleeve that can be dilated from 5 mm to 12 mm in diameter. This radially expanding access (REA) trocar was developed to minimize tissue trauma and, in theory, its use would result in fewer vascular and visceral injuries. Optical access trocars allow laparoscopists to view the cutting tip as it penetrates the tissues. Many other different trocar designs are described, for example trocars with a threaded sleeve or an expandable arm . The diameters of trocars vary from 2 mm to 12 mm, depending upon the largest instrument needed for a particular port. For exceptional indications (for example extirpation of large cysts) larger or modified trocars are available .\n\n【11】The rapid evolution of instrumentation has led to the development of new minimally invasive techniques such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), laparo‐endoscopic single‐site surgery (LESS) and minilaparoscopy. NOTES refers to surgery via natural orifices, where procedures are performed with transluminally placed instruments to gain access to the abdominal cavity. Transvaginal, transanal, transvesical, transesophageal, transgastric and transoral approaches for NOTES are described . LESS surgery is an advanced minimally invasive approach that allows laparoscopic operations to be undertaken through a single small (12 mm to 15 mm) incision, typically placed at the patient's umbilicus . Minilaparoscopy involves the use of smaller incisions, smaller instruments and fewer ports to further reduce perioperative morbidity and enhance cosmesis. Other terms for minilaparoscopic surgery include miniport or microlaparoscopic surgery . NOTES, LESS and minilaparoscopy are in their early stages of development. NOTES, LESS and minilaparoscopy are not included in this review since these techniques are different from traditional laparoscopy.\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Laparoscopic trocars are the most common device named in malpractice injury claims associated with laparoscopic procedures, representing one‐third of all claims . The incidence is estimated to be 3 to 4 per 1000 procedures . Trocar‐related complications represent all types of complications due to the contribution of the trocar, including intra‐abdominal vascular injury, intra‐abdominal visceral injury, trocar site bleeding, trocar site herniation and trocar site infection. Of all trocar‐related complications, vascular and visceral injuries are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality . By inserting a trocar, the trocar tip can damage abdominal wall vessels (for example the epigastric artery), intra‐abdominal vessels (for example the aorta, vena cava, iliac artery or iliac vein) or visceral organs (for example the bowel, stomach and bladder). Although vascular injury is often noticed directly during laparoscopy, bowel injuries are more likely to go undetected during the procedure . When vascular or visceral injury occurs, additional surgical intervention is often required. Cardin et al reported vascular and visceral injuries in 51 out of 4007 (1.3%) patients undergoing a laparoscopic procedure. At least 14 (27.5%) of these patients required a subsequent surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention under general anesthesia . Mortality is reported occasionally after vascular or visceral injury .\n\n【14】An important postoperative trocar‐related complication is trocar site herniation. A trocar site hernia (TSH) is a protrusion of intestine or omentum through a remaining defect in the peritoneum, abdominal fascia or musculature at the trocar insertion site. TSHs occur postoperatively, which can vary from shortly following surgery to several years postoperation. Whereas TSH is uncommon, with an estimated prevalence of 0·5% in patients operated on laparoscopically, it is a potentially serious complication. Patients with TSH may require emergency reoperation for bowel obstruction or strangulation . Less severe trocar‐related complications are trocar site bleeding, trocar site infection and pain. Although pain is not always classified as a complication, it is considered clinically important and is an indicator for recovery.\n\n【15】The use of trocars inevitably leads to risks of trocar‐related complications. Major complications such as vascular and visceral injury can have serious consequences including conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy, other invasive interventions, medical therapies and prolonged hospitalization. When discovered postoperatively, occasionally emergency or revision surgery is required, resulting in longer hospital stay or readmission and additional costs. Minor complications might also result in the need for additional pharmacological treatment and compromise postoperative recovery. All these deviations from a normal intra‐ and postoperative course after laparoscopy potentially have a negative effect on patients' quality of life and satisfaction.\n\n【16】A difference in trocar‐related complications may be attributable to different types of trocars and the experience of the surgeon according to the trocar type. The Cochrane review from Ahmad et al studied different trocar systems. Eight RCTs were found where different trocar designs were compared. In four, REA trocars were compared with standard trocars. A meta‐analysis demonstrated fewer trocar site bleeding episodes when using REA trocars compared to standard trocars for the primary laparoscopic entry . In two RCTs cutting trocars were compared to blunt trocars for primary and secondary port insertion, and no significant difference in any type of complication was demonstrated. Two RCTs compared the REA trocar with a conventional cutting tip trocar for secondary port entry. REA trocars were associated with lower rates of trocar site bleeding compared to standard secondary port trocars. Our review differs from Ahmad et al in that we will search for differences in the outcome of postoperative pain. Specific types of trocars could relate to higher or lower risks on any of the trocar‐related complications or for postoperative pain. The sharpness of disposable cutting trocars is usually better compared to that of reusable cutting trocars. This sharpness of disposable trocars facilitates smooth insertion. Reusable trocars do lose their sharpness through repetitive insertion. Reusable trocars require a relatively high puncture force for penetration through the abdominal wall. Increased entry force could result in an abrupt and uncontrolled introduction of the trocar that may result in a deeper penetration and potential serious visceral and vascular injury . The cutting trocar mechanism of sharp trocars may result in occasional bleeding from the trocar port. Conical blunt tipped trocars are designed to stretch, rather than cut, the abdominal wall to enable port placement. The use of conical reusable trocars compared to sharp cutting disposable trocars was associated with fewer trocar‐related bleeding events and trocar site hernias in a non‐randomized prospective study . A larger trocar diameter creates a larger defect in the abdominal wall and potentially results in a increased risk of trocar site herniation. In 1993, a retrospective study demonstrated an increased risk of trocar site herniation when trocars with a diameter of 12 mm were used compared to 10 mm .\n\n【17】This Cochrane review aims to determine whether specific trocar designs can be recommended for use in patients undergoing laparoscopy, with a goal to minimize trocar‐related complications and postoperative pain.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】The objective of the current review is to analyze the rates of trocar‐related complications and postoperative pain for different trocar types used in patients undergoing laparoscopy.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Only randomized controlled trials are to be considered.

It is also promoted as an important tool for achieving the health Millennium Development Goals, improving the effectiveness of development aid, and motivating patients to improve their attendance at health facilities and compliance with recommended health interventions. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health, particularly in lower income countries .\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】Paying for performance refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target (CGD working group on performance‐based incentives . Paying for performance is also referred to as results‐based financing, performance‐based funding, and output based aid. While paying for performance is relatively a simple concept, it includes a wide range of interventions that vary with respect to the level at which the incentives are targeted (recipients of healthcare, individual providers of healthcare, health care facilities, private sector organizations, public sector organizations and national or sub‐national levels). Paying for performance interventions also measure specific targeted results such as health outcomes, delivery of effective interventions (for instance immunization), utilization of services (such as prenatal visits or births at an accredited facility), quality of care etc. Also central to paying for performance are interventions on ancillary components schemes such as increasing the availability of resources to health care, education, supplies, technical support or training, monitoring and feedback, increasing salaries, construction of new facilities, improvements in planning and management or information systems .\n\n【17】While it is conceivable that pay increases designed to increase motivation and retention of staff might fall within this definition (coming to work is, after all, a measurable action), in this review we focus on reforms which are explicitly linked to changing patterns of activity, output or outcome indicators (thus excluding routine changes to pay or public funding flows or user fee regimes).\n\n【18】Another systematic review has recently addressed the use of conditional cash transfers for service users (demand side paying for performance) for improving the uptake of health interventions in low and middle‐income countries (LMIC) . This review will therefore focus on evidence of the impacts of supply side paying for performance aimed at improving the delivery of health interventions. We will include all impact evaluations of paying for performance interventions which have a supply side component.\n\n【19】In this review, paying for performance includes both paying for performance schemes (including ancillary components) and paying for performance per se (where any ancillary components are controlled for).\n\n【20】### How the intervention might work\n\n【21】On one level, paying for performance by individuals is nothing new. It has taken the form of user fees, and in many low and middle income countries it remains one of the main forms of health financing. However, public funding for health (including aid funding, where this is channeled through governments) has traditionally not been linked to specific activities, but has taken the form of budget flows, which are linked to indicators such as staffing levels or bed numbers (for facilities), inputs (such as estimated drug needs), population numbers (for regions and districts, in some cases) and also historical trends in expenditure (all modified by overall budget constraints).\n\n【22】These bureaucratic mechanisms offer the advantage of stability, and predictability, and rely on local clinical judgement as to how and what services to offer. The disadvantage, however, is that health systems based on budget funding and salaried staff can lack incentives to improve quality, to increase outputs and to improve outcomes. Paying for performance aims to reintroduce those incentives by linking pay (at individual or facility level) to desired activities and/or outcome indicators. It may in addition increase resources (by providing supplementary funding) or may be an alternative mechanism for channeling existing funding resources (substituting for existing funds).\n\n【23】In OECD countries, paying for performance is generally described as a tool for improving quality . In LMICs, however, it generally has wider objectives , including:\n\n【24】*   to increase the allocative efficiency of health services (by encouraging the provision of high priority and cost effective services)\n\n【25】*   to increase the technical efficiency (by making better use of existing resources such as health staff)\n\n【26】*   to improve equity of outcomes (for example, by encouraging expansion of services to hard‐to‐reach groups)\n\n【27】Paying for performance for providers (P4P4P) is clearly premised on the assumption that for these three dimensions to shift, a change in behaviour on the provider side is required. If, however, the barriers are more connected with demand side factors (such as low affordability of services), then paying for performance for providers alone will not be effective.\n\n【28】Paying for performance for providers in LMICs can operate at a number of levels. It can be offered directly to health workers (in public, private or private not‐for‐profit sectors). It can be linked to facility budgets. It can be used to set budget or supplement budgets at higher organisational units, such as health districts or regions. It can also be used at national level, in particular by donor organisations negotiating aid to a national health sector. Clearly, incentives would be expected to operate differently at these different levels: incentives to individuals are likely to be more directly motivating (incentives to organisations only affect behaviour indirectly, if passed on in some way to individuals), but may undermine cooperation (unlike organisational incentives, which might be expected to reinforce cooperation).\n\n【29】It seems intuitive that paying more money for the delivery of effective services will improve health care, but health care does not operate like a classic free market. Human behaviour is complex and there are many theories that attempt to explain both health behaviour and professional behaviour. Principalagent theory addresses relationships where one individual (the patient) cannot directly observe or know the level of skill or effort expended by the other individual (the professional) doing the contracted work. Because patients do not have perfect knowledge of their medical condition, their need for care, or the expected outcome of health care services, they are willing to have health care professionals act as their agents in providing information and services. Because patients have asymmetric information about the need for and outcomes of health care, patient demand for health care may be unresponsive to technical quality. Therefore, one theoretical advantage of performance pay is that explicit financial incentives are provided even when patient demand for health care is unresponsive to quality. Professional effort in providing high quality is rewarded, regardless of whether patients recognise it. This theoretical advantage relies however on a whole host of assumptions, including the ability to assess quality, the linkage of paying for performance systems with quality measures, the absence of adverse consequences etc.\n\n【30】Moreover, as indicated above, in LMICs in particular, paying for performance is being deployed for a wide range of reasons other than quality. It is envisaged more ambitiously as a tool to increase the responsiveness of staff and the health system generally to priority areas.\n\n【31】It is also important to note that although financial incentives and health care payment systems are likely to have an important influence on professional behaviour, this influence is far from exclusive. In economic terms, professionals are viewed as maximizing their utility function. (Utility can be defined as well‐being.) Important factors included in the utility function, besides income, are professional and social status, altruistic concerns, the cost of the effort to provide care, and the uncertainty of the clinical effectiveness of treatment. Moreover there may be other barriers to changing professional behaviour, even when professionals are motivated, including patient factors, lack of time, lack of technical skills, lack of resources, and organisational constraints.\n\n【32】It is generally accepted that professionals are motivated by the satisfaction of doing their jobs well (intrinsic motivation). Indeed, it is doubtful whether some valued‐but‐difficult‐ to‐observe dimensions of quality (such as empathy or listening in the medical encounter) would be provided at all if physicians were solely interested in income. Thus, professionals have both non‐monetary (that is, personal ethics, professional norms, regulatory control, clinical uncertainty) and monetary (from the payment system) incentives, all of which affect effort. It is possible that financial incentives may dilute professionals’ intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, where health workers pay is low in absolute terms, incentives may be an important channel to improve motivation through increasing their income levels.\n\n【33】The timescale of evaluation is another important consideration. Financial incentives might be effective in the short run for simple and distinct, well‐defined behavioural goals, but these are not necessarily sustained in the longer run.\n\n【34】Paying for performance schemes are often accompanied by ancillary features, such as an increase in resources. For paying for performance schemes it may be impossible to disentangle the impact of paying for performance per se from the impact of increased resources.\n\n【35】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【36】Although both demand and supply side paying for performance are widely advocated in LMICs, there are currently no systematic reviews of the impacts of supply‐side paying for performance in LMICs . Several non‐Cochrane systematic reviews have addressed the impacts of paying for performance or financial incentives in high‐income countries. Another Cochrane review  assessed evidence on target payments for primary care. However, this had a more limited scope (focusing on target payments alone) and only found OECD‐country studies. With the growth in interest in paying for performance in developing countries, it is believed that more rigorous studies may have been produced in the last few years which can now warrant a review focused on the LMICs.\n\n【37】While reviews of schemes in high‐income countries can help to inform decisions in LMICs, there are several reasons for undertaking a review of the impacts of paying for performance in LMICs specifically. The potential benefits, harms and costs of paying for performance may be greater in LMICs, where there are fewer resources and financial incentives than in high‐income countries, weak health systems, inadequate supplies, facilities and human resources and greater inequities; and where paying for performance schemes are often introduced by donors and include ancillary components, such as increased resources and technical support.\n\n【38】Paying for performance is a complex intervention with uncertain benefits and potential harms. It may, just to give one example, lead to the concentration of resources in areas where targets are easier to meet (which typically are better served areas), thus increasing inequity of provision. The extent to which benefits attributed to paying for performance in LMICs are attributable to conditionality (versus ancillary components of paying for performance schemes in LMICs such as increased resources and technical support) is also uncertain. Paying for performance may not be a good use of resources, even when it is effective, due to potentially small effects and high costs. For these reasons a systematic review of evaluations of the impacts of paying for performance is needed to inform decisions about whether and when to use paying for performance, how to design these schemes, and how to monitor and evaluate them in LMICs.\n\n【39】Finally, this is an area of growing interest for funders and for LMIC governments, so a review of evidence on effectiveness would be timely.\n\n【40】Objectives\n----------\n\n【41】The overall objective of the systematic review is to summarise the current evidence for the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low and middle‐income settings.\n\n【42】The analyses will focus on the following comparisons:\n\n【43】*   Paying for performance targeted at health workers vs no paying for performance\n\n【44】*   Paying for performance targeted at facilities vs no paying for performance\n\n【45】*   Paying for performance targeted at areas or groups of providers vs no paying for performance\n\n【46】*   Paying for performance targeted at national governments (aid) vs no paying for performance\n\n【47】*   Paying for performance targeted at multiple levels vs no paying for performance\n\n【48】*   Comparisons of different types of paying for performance, including paying for performance  targeted at different levels, and different magnitudes of incentives\n\n【49】Methods\n-------\n\n【50】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【51】#### Types of studies\n\n【52】The review will include:\n\n【53】*   Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\n\n【54】*   Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs)\n\n【55】*   Controlled Before‐and‐After (CBA) studies with:\n\n【56】*   1.  at least two clusters in each comparison\n\n【57】    2.  pre and post intervention periods for study and control groups are the same\n\n【58】    3.  the choice of the control site is appropriate, e.g. similar socio‐economic characteristics and/or and no major differences in the baseline group\n\n【59】*   Interrupted Time Series (ITS) studies with at least three measurements before and after introducing the intervention.\n\n【60】Well‐designed cluster randomised trials protect against selection bias and are likely to provide the most rigorous estimates of the impacts of paying for performance schemes. Although we are aware of some trials that are underway, few if any have been reported and advocates of paying for performance frequently cite the results of CBA studies. Although these studies have a high risk of bias, we believe it is important, at least at this time, to include these studies. ITS studies may be problematic due to changes in information systems and the reliability of information systems used in paying for performance schemes in LMICs. However, they may potentially have less of a risk of bias than CBA studies and cluster randomised trials may not be practical for evaluating some paying for performance schemes; e.g. when there is simultaneous system‐wide implementation. ITS studies, particularly evaluations of the impact of GAVI, are also frequently cited (and contested) as evidence of the benefits of paying for performance .\n\n【61】Other study designs may provide useful information about acceptability, potential effects, or explanations for observed effects of paying for performance, but are unlikely to provide useful estimates of the impacts of paying for performance on the main outcomes of this review.\n\n【62】#### Types of participants\n\n【63】The participants are providers of health care services in low and middle income countries (as defined by the World Bank).

It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including a variety of asthma medications. Methylxanthines, the main medication used for paediatric asthma for many decades in Western countries, is still widely used in non‐Western countries. Also, methylxanthines have other pharmacological properties and their bronchodilator effect is only modest.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the efficacy of methylxanthines in treating children with non‐specific cough.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in October 2010.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised controlled trials comparing methylxanthines with a placebo medication in treating children with non‐specific cough.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Results of searches were reviewed against pre‐determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis. Four small non‐randomised controlled trials were reported.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】No randomised controlled trials that examined the efficacy of methylxanthines in the management of prolonged non‐specific cough in children were found. In the non randomised trials above, a significant effect was seen within 2‐14 days of therapy.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is currently an absence of reliable evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for symptomatic control of non‐specific cough in children. If methylxanthines were to be trialed in children with prolonged non‐specific cough, cohort data (thus limited) suggest a clinical response (subjective cough severity) would be seen within two to five days (and certainly within 14 days) of therapy. However methylxanthine use has to be balanced against the well known risk of toxicity and its low therapeutic range in children. Further research examining the efficacy of this intervention is needed.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Chronic Cough\n*   Unexplained Cough\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Xanthines\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Treatment Failure\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

This review examined whether there was any evidence for using methylxanthines in children with non‐specific cough. There were no randomised controlled trials that assessed methylxanthines for prolonged non‐specific cough in children. In four non‐randomised controlled studies, the researchers described that dramatic improvements in cough were seen within 2‐14 days of taking oral theophylline. However, this is possibly a placebo and/or time period effect. There is no RCT evidence to support the routine use of methylxanthines for the symptom of non‐specific cough in children. Further research examining the effects of methylxanthines using child appropriate cough outcome measures are needed.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We will also compare the cost‐effectiveness of these methods during routine cataract surgery.\n\n【6】--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Cataract is the most common correctable cause of visual impairment worldwide. It is defined as any opacity within the naturally clear lens inside the eye. The presence of this opacity is associated with increased scattering of light and decreased image contrast sensitivity . Visual acuity is often preserved initially, and those affected more commonly complain of glare or difficulty with night driving. Other symptoms include light sensitivity, seeing halos around lights, monocular double vision, and seeing colors less bright.\n\n【10】An estimated 150 million individuals suffered from cataract‐related visual impairment in 2010, and 10 million cataract operations are done each year, although the need is estimated to be at least 30 million per year . It is estimated that over the next 20 years the burden will increase by about one‐third, predominantly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Its economic impact is still substantial in high‐income countries. In the United States alone, over 20 million people were affected by cataracts, and approximately 3 million surgeries are performed annually at a cost of $3.4 billion to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .\n\n【11】Cataract formation is a multifactorial process. Risk factors include age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, ultraviolet radiation exposure, diabetes, nutritional factors, and certain medications (e.g. steroids) . In particular, increasing age has a strong association. The prevalence of cataract in Europe increased from 5% for those 52 to 62 years of age to 30% and 64% for those 60 to 69 years of age and 70 years and above, respectively . At present, surgery remains the only definitive treatment, and no therapy exists for its prevention.\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】Cataract surgery is one of the oldest known surgical procedures , and has evolved to be one of the safest and most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide, with significantly improved visual outcomes and faster recovery times. Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) followed by extracapsular extraction (ECCE) were the initial procedures of choice, routinely undertaken until the 1960s. The most significant development in cataract surgery was the introduction of phacoemulsification in 1967, followed by intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, considered now to be the gold standard technique .\n\n【14】Achieving appropriate mydriasis intraoperatively is one of the critical factors associated with ease of performing the surgery and its safety , as most surgical steps except for the clear cornea incision are performed at or behind the plane of the iris . High‐risk groups showing poor pupillary dilation include people with pseudoexfoliation syndrome , diabetes mellitus , posterior synechiae, eye trauma, and those taking alpha‐adrenergic receptor agonists . Inadequate pupillary dilation or constriction of the pupil during cataract surgery reduces the surgeon’s field of view, can make maneuvering of instruments difficult, and is a known risk factor for various intraoperative complications such as iris prolapse and damage, incomplete cortex removal, posterior capsule rupture, dropped nucleus of the lens, vitreous loss, cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment . Adequate pupillary dilation is essential for safe completion of cataract surgery and for reducing the incidence of complications.\n\n【15】Mydriatic agents can be administered traditionally via topical eye drops or through alternative methods such as intracameral mydriasis and depot delivery systems (Mydriasert/sponge).\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Topical mydriatic agents (phenylephrine, cyclopentolate, and/or tropicamide) typically have sympathomimetic or anticholinergic properties, or both, and are frequently administered before and during cataract surgery to maintain adequate pupillary dilation. However, this regimen has significant limitations. These topical agents have a low penetration into the eye (2% to 10%), with most of the drug being systemically absorbed . Due to the slow penetration, maximum onset of dilation takes at least 30 minutes, which can be longer than the time of the cataract surgery; furthermore, the dilation can wear off during the surgery . There is also a risk of cardiovascular complications (i.e. increase in blood pressure and heart rate) associated with their use, especially in people who have a history of hypertension or underlying cardiac disease . In addition, frequent spillage of the drop from the palpebral fissure makes successful administration of topical mydriatics difficult in some patients.\n\n【18】Intracameral mydriasis involves the injection of a mydriatic directly into the anterior chamber after the initial incision into the eye . This method usually requires lesser concentrations of mydriatics as compared with standard topical doses , and has been shown to significantly decrease the risk of systemic adrenergic side effects including cardiovascular complications .\n\n【19】Mydriasert is a long‐acting drug insert (0.28 mg tropicamide and 5.4 mg phenylephrine hydrochloride) with greater bioavailability than topical mydriatic agents and increased local efficacy and decreased systemic absorption . The risk of systemic complications is therefore less with Mydriasert, and it can serve as a safe and effective alternative to topical mydriatics. Unlike topical drops, which require frequent administration, Mydriasert is usually applied to the inferior fornix 60 minutes before surgery, and hence might be a simpler and more effective alternative. However, despite these advantages, the use of this insert is limited due to doubts regarding the best time for its insertion and its ability to maintain mydriasis long enough during cataract surgery, as well as the cost . The pledget mode of delivery of topical mydriatics agents is another convenient and time‐saving option.\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】Topical mydriatic drops have traditionally been used for pupillary dilation during cataract surgery. Intracameral administration of mydriatics and depot mydriatic delivery systems (Mydriasert/sponge) are reasonable alternatives. The most effective intervention for achieving adequate intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery has not yet been established. This review will help answer this question by comparing the effectiveness and safety profile of topical mydriatics, intracameral delivery of mydriatics, and depot delivery systems.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】### Primary objectives\n\n【24】To evaluate the effectiveness of various methods of pupillary dilation among people who underwent phacoemulsification for cataract extraction. Comparisons of interest include topical mydriatics versus intracameral mydriatics, topical mydriatics versus depot delivery systems, and intracameral mydriatics versus depot delivery systems.\n\n【25】### Secondary objectives\n\n【26】To assess and compare the incidence of intra‐ and postoperative cardiovascular and ocular complications associated with the use of these methods of pupillary dilation.

This will have to include an evaluation of the frequency, duration, intensity, localisation, and cause of pain in ALS. We also seek to evaluate possible adverse effects associated with the different drugs and their influence on survival and quality of life.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is the commonest neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system in adults. The incidence is up to 2 per 100,000 population per year and age specific incidence and mortality rates peak between 55 to 75 years . People with ALS show a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs and death usually results from respiratory failure. Over 50% of people with ALS die within three years of the first symptom.\n\n【6】Pain has been reported to be an issue in the later stages of ALS . Pain seems less of an issue in the earlier stages of ALS, but others have reported pain to occur in the later stages of the disease in up to 80% of cases . Pain has been reported to mainly affect the lower back, shoulders, neck and legs  and may have a dull or electrical character . Sometimes patients report pain of a different quality in different parts of the body. Although in most cases the severity of the pain is reported to be mild or moderate, severe pain is reported in 20% of patients . It has been suggested that the intensity of pain increases with disease duration .\n\n【7】The aetiology of pain in patients with ALS is not well understood. Musculo‐skeletal pain may arise in the later stages of disease as a result of stress on bones and joints that have lost their protective muscular sheath due to atrophy . In addition, pain may be caused by muscle contractures and joint stiffness  This may explain why pain seems to be a particular feature in the later stages of the disease. Pain may also arise from muscle cramps and muscle spasticity. Another cause of pain in patients with ALS seems to be skin pressure caused by immobility . In this context, decubitus ulcers have been reported in 16% of patients . Pain may also occur as a manifestation of the sensory phenomena reported . The cause of such sensory disturbances which are reported to occur in up to 11% of patients  is not well understood. Pathological involvement of sensory pathways in motor neuron disease has only infrequently been reported . A chronic central pain syndrome potentially associated was reported in a further single patient .\n\n【8】The first line treatment of pain in ALS is usually non‐narcotic analgesics including non‐steroidal drugs . Opioid drugs are usually used if these drugs fail to relive the pain . Opioids may also be used in the symptomatic treatment of dyspnoea and coughing in MND . There is considerable discrepancy in the literature regarding the use of opioids in ALS in terms of frequency of dose and actual dose ministered as well as the roots of administration . Opioids are possibly more frequently used in patients treated in hospices or palliative care units . It is possible that some health professionals might be loathe to use opioids for fear that they might hasten death by suppressing ventilation  and because patients and carers might associate opiate drugs with terminal stages of disease and imminent death .\n\n【9】Continuing uncertainty over the indications, doses, application modes and side effects of pain medication in palliative therapy of patients with ALS suggest that a systematic review of all randomised clinical trials concerning treatment of pain in ALS is required. The results will need to be considered in the context of non‐randomised studies in the 'Discussion' section of this review.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】The objective of this review is to examine the efficacy of drug therapy in relieving pain in ALS.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the impact of antimalarial MDA on population asexual parasitaemia, gametocytemia, anaemia, clinical illness, mortality, and MDA‐associated adverse events.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Malaria is the most common and deadly parasitic infection. It causes an estimated 243,000,000 clinical episodes and 863,000 deaths annually, primarily among young children in sub‐Saharan Africa . Four main species of the malaria parasite infect humans: _Plasmodium falciparum_ , _P. vivax_ , _P. ovale_ , and _P. malariae_ . _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ cause the majority of infections, while _P. falciparum_ is responsible for most cases of severe and potentially fatal malaria.\n\n【7】In nature, malaria parasites spread by successively infecting two types of hosts: humans and female _Anopheles sp._ mosquitoes. All four species of malaria parasites are transmitted to humans via a mosquito bite. Malaria parasites invade hepatocytes, then multiply in the liver as liver schizonts, before being released into the blood stream, invading erythrocytes and developing into asexual blood schizonts. This cycle of erythrocyte invasion and destruction often leads to clinical disease manifested as fever, chills, and flu‐like illness symptoms. Left untreated, persons may develop severe complications and die. During this erythrocytic phase, some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages, called gametocytes. These gametocytes may be ingested by a mosquito during a blood meal, potentially perpetuating another cycle of growth and multiplication in the mosquito. Additionally, _P. vivax_ and _P. ovale_ can develop dormant liver stage parasites (hypnozoites), which can reactivate and cause relapsing malaria several months or years after initial infection.\n\n【8】Malaria is both preventable and treatable. Prevention efforts have focused on vector control strategies to reduce adult mosquito populations and human‐mosquito contact, and to eradicate mosquito breeding grounds. They include the use of insecticide treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, larviciding, and environmental management. In addition, treatment strategies in endemic areas frequently combine case management, the diagnosis and treatment of malaria patients, with disease prevention by administering antimalarial drugs for prevention of clinical disease to particularly vulnerable population groups such as pregnant women, infants, and non‐immune travellers to endemic areas. Success in malaria control using these existing tools has led to renewed interest in the possibility of malaria elimination in some countries or regions.  While the malaria eradication agenda of the mid‐twentieth century was ultimately abandoned, current calls for elimination stress the need for new technologies (insecticide delivery systems, new drugs and insecticides, and candidate vaccines) and the revitalization of older strategies (indoor residual spraying).  Mass drug administration (MDA) was a component of many malaria elimination and eradication programmes in the 1950s, but is not currently recommended due to concerns about efficacy, logistical feasibility, sustainability, and the risk of accelerating drug resistance.  However, evidence to guide this recommendation, particularly in light of the development of new antimalarial drugs, is lacking .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Over the past 20 years, annual MDA has been a key strategy for controlling and eliminating highly prevalent neglected tropical diseases such as lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminthes, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. The simultaneous administration of essential medicines to target high‐prevalence neglected tropical diseases has two main functions: to treat prevalent infection and subsequently to reduce further transmission within the population . Mass antimalarial drug administration, defined as the empiric administration of a complete therapeutic course of an antimalarial regimen to an entire population or well‐defined sub‐population at the same time, has been used for malaria control since the early 1930s and was advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1950s as a tool in situations where other more conventional control measures had failed . While not widely used, there are several examples where MDA, in combination with other malaria control measures, had some success. For instance, MDA with sulfalene‐pyrimethamine combined with indoor residual spraying achieved high levels of malaria control during the Garki project in Northern Nigeria in 1969 . In addition, the use of MDA combined with other malaria control interventions succeeded in permanently interrupting malaria transmission on the island of Aneityum in Vanuatu . Primaquine, the only registered drug that can eliminate gametocytes, was also given in combination with chloroquine to an estimated 70% of Nicaragua's population in 1981, preventing an estimated 9200 cases of malaria .  In these instances, the entire population was simultaneously treated with a therapeutic dose of an antimalarial both to reduce malaria burden and potentially to interrupt transmission.\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Malaria transmission is dependent on mosquito vector dynamics, the proportion of humans with peripheral gametocytemia, and the infectiousness of circulating gametocytes to mosquitoes.  MDA of antimalarials might reduce malaria burden by its direct effect on individuals who receive a treatment dose of antimalarials, as well as by reducing rates of transmission. Antimalarial MDA could reduce transmission in a number of ways. First,  MDA could reduce parasitemia prevalence and potentially reduce malaria transmission via inhibition of the liver or asexual intraerythroctytic stages of the parasite, thus reducing the number of parasites that can progress to form gametocytes. Second, the  antimalarial drug could have a  direct effect on gametocytes. Third, the antimalarial drug could have a sporonticidal effect and inhibition of the sporogonic cycle in the mosquito.  If all persons in a given population are treated by antimalarial MDA then one would expect an immediate reduction in asexual parasite prevalence in the population, and possibly a sustained reduction in the population parasite prevalence if there was a concomitant reduction in transmission.\n\n【13】Most antimalarial drugs target the asexual blood stage of the parasite, as this stage is responsible for the symptomatic disease.  Blood schizonticidal drugs reduce asexual parasitemia and early stage gametocytes in _P. falciparum_ by preventing the development of mature gametocytes, without having a direct effect on circulating mature gametocytes.  Some antimalarial drugs, such as the artemisinins and 8‐aminoquinolines (eg primaquine), have known gametocytocidal activities and have the potential to reduce transmission by reducing circulating gametocytemia.  In addition, the 8‐aminoquinolines also inhibit the hypnozoite stage of _P. vivax_ and _P. ovale_ species, thus reducing the chance of relapse .\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Several examples illustrate the use of MDA as a malaria control tool.  Since its popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, however, it has fallen into disfavour due to concerns regarding its efficacy, logistical feasibility, sustainability as a malaria control tool, and risk of accelerating drug resistance.  But with a renewed interest in malaria elimination and the development of new gametocytocidal antimalarials such as artemisinins, MDAs are once again being considered as a tool for malaria control . Given this renewed interest in conducting MDAs, it is important to review the currently available literature to assess the potential of this strategy to reduce malaria burden and transmission.  In addition, a systematic review of the literature will allow us to define the gaps in our understanding of the potential benefits and risks of this strategy, such as the risk of adverse drug events in an asymptomatic population. This information could guide both future antimalarial MDA interventions and their evaluation.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To assess the impact of antimalarial MDA on population asexual parasitaemia, gametocytemia, anaemia, clinical illness, mortality, and MDA‐associated adverse events.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】In this review, we will include MDA studies that report estimates of any one of our outcomes of interest. Due to the nature of the intervention, only studies that are carried out on entire populations or well‐defined sub‐populations will be included; we will exclude individually randomized trials. We will include randomized and non‐randomized studies, including non‐randomized controlled trials, controlled before‐and‐after studies, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, historically controlled trials, nested case‐control studies, case‐control studies, cross‐sectional studies, and before‐and‐after comparisons. Although we will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of all studies , we will include studies of high, moderate, low and very low quality.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】Children and adults living in malaria endemic areas pre‐ and post‐MDA.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】For the purposes of this review, an MDA will be defined as the empiric administration of a complete therapeutic course of an antimalarial regimen targeted to an entire population or well‐defined sub‐population at the same time.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of ear drops (or sprays) to remove or aid removal of ear wax in adults (aged 18 years and over) and children (aged under 18 years).\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Ear wax (cerumen) is a normal bodily secretion that becomes a problem when it blocks the ear canal. People may seek medical attention when they have a sensation of blockage or hearing loss. These symptoms can also be caused by conditions other than wax. Nonetheless, symptoms _attributed_ to wax are among the commonest reasons for patients to present to their primary care or general practitioner (GP) with ear trouble.\n\n【7】Wax obstruction is more common in men than in women and is particularly common in the elderly and people with intellectual impairment . Ear wax removal is the most common ENT procedure performed in primary care; it is performed between four and eight million times each year in the US and the UK .\n\n【8】Wax is part of the self cleaning mechanism of the ear and usually comes out of the ear canal without causing problems. However, when natural expulsion fails, wax is retained in the canal and may become impacted. An occluding wax plug is not associated with poor personal hygiene. Wax may get impacted if people try to clean their ear with cotton buds or when they regularly put things in their ears (for example, earbud‐type headphones and hearing aids).\n\n【9】The accumulation of wax may be associated with a sensation of blockage but, conversely, not all patients who feel their ears are blocked actually have a problem related to wax. Wax accumulation has several consequences: (a) it can interfere with the clinician's view of the tympanic membrane; (b) it can cause a conductive hearing loss and hence may interfere with formal hearing assessment; (c) if in contact with the tympanic membrane it can cause discomfort and occasionally vertigo; and (d) it can contribute to infection . Wax removal can help to solve these problems and potential complications.\n\n【10】Once wax has accumulated enough to cause symptoms or prevent a clear view of the tympanic membrane, interventions to encourage or secure its removal may be considered. There are several ways in which this may be done and the methods chosen vary around the world.\n\n【11】Self administered remedies include the use of drops to soften or disperse the wax. This may prevent the need for any further intervention. Alternatively, it may make the alternative, mechanical methods of wax removal easier and more effective. The mechanical methods are of two types: dry or wet.\n\n【12】With the dry methods the wax is removed under direct vision using ear curette (a type of surgical instrument), hook or suction. These methods are used in conjunction with an operating microscope. With the wet cleansing methods, ear syringing or irrigation with body temperature water is used to 'wash out' the wax from the ear canal. There are advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods and not all methods are suitable for all patients. In particular, the mechanical methods described in this paragraph are less often undertaken in children.\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】A variety of topical medications are available that can be applied directly into the ear canal with the aim of softening the wax to aid natural expulsion or mechanical removal. The word 'cerumenolytic' has been used to refer to compounds that lead to the disintegration of wax. The liquids used are typically administered in drop or spray form.\n\n【15】Liquids used to remove/soften wax are of several kinds:\n\n【16】*   Oil‐based compounds, which soften the wax by dissolution (for example, olive or almond oil).\n\n【17】*   Water‐based compounds, which improve water miscibility (for example, sodium bicarbonate) or water itself.\n\n【18】*   A combination of the above.\n\n【19】*   Non‐water, non‐oil‐based solutions, such as carbamide peroxide (a hydrogen peroxide‐urea compound) and glycerol.\n\n【20】### How the intervention might work\n\n【21】The intended mode of action for these medications is to dissolve or soften the wax sufficiently to allow natural expulsion or to make mechanical removal easier.\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Ear wax accumulation is common and may cause considerable problems. The widespread use of ear drops (with or without ear syringing or suction) suggests that many practitioners believe them to be effective , although a more recent systematic review has shown weak evidence for cerumenolytics alone in improving wax clearance compared to no treatment . The Cochrane review of ear drops for the removal of ear wax was last updated in 2009 ; this is a new protocol for the next update of this review. It is important to update this review as it addresses a common clinical problem and aims to collate the available literature to inform the clinician on which type of cerumenolytic is most effective.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effects of ear drops (or sprays) to remove or aid removal of ear wax in adults (aged 18 years and over) and children (aged under 18 years).\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster‐randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials. We will only use the first phase of cross‐over trials.\n\n【30】We will also include trials that randomise patients by ear as we believe it is possible to ensure that the effects of any intervention considered can be localised and the treatment of one ear will not have an effect on the opposite ear.\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】Adults (aged 18 years and over) and children (aged under 18 years) with ear wax requiring removal because (a) it is symptomatic or (b) it is preventing an adequate view of the ear drum.\n\n【33】We will exclude studies where the majority of patients have wax that is being removed 'routinely' rather than for a specific reason.\n\n【34】#### Types of interventions\n\n【35】All topical preparations regardless of dose, frequency or duration of use.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of continuous physiological monitoring on blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and heart rhythm in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Stroke is the second most common cause of death and the leading cause of disability in developed countries. It consumes about 5% of health services resources, and much of the cost is attributable to the care of disabled inpatients . The acute phase of stroke is crucial for long‐term outcome; indeed, the most common complications arise mainly in the first 24 hours and rarely after four days . The approximate frequency of complications of different types is: neurological (6%), infective (21%), pressure sores (21%), deep venous thrombosis (1%), pulmonary embolism (2%), pain (22%), and psychological (11%) . These complications, along with cardiac complications and mortality, may be related to the quality of care provided.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】The intervention is the non‐invasive intensive or continuous monitoring of vital functions such as blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and heart rhythm assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG). Intensive monitoring should be useful because acute medical interventions, targeted at maintaining these essential physiological variables within a narrow physiological range, should improve outcome .\n\n【9】On the other hand, continuous monitoring could both increase the rate of unnecessary medical interventions and, by limiting patients' mobility, favour bed‐related complications such as infections, hypostatic pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, thromboembolism and pain . Moreover, intensive continuous monitoring for several days may lead to a psychological dependence on the monitoring equipment and delay mobilisation, even if the devices are removed during physiotherapy.\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】The use of intensive monitoring should favour prompt medical intervention aimed at obtaining an intensive control of physiological homeostasis and the early detection of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n【12】The importance of monitoring stroke patients is supported indirectly by the evidence that fever , hypertension, hypotension , hypoxia and cardiac arrhythmias  play an important role in determining the outcome of patients: an elevated body temperature can increase metabolic demand in the ischaemic penumbra and enhance the release of cytotoxic excitatory amino acids and the formation of free radicals ; mild to moderate hypotension may result in a critical fall in cerebral blood flow, worsening the degree of ischaemia in the penumbra and transforming areas of reversible injury into infarct ; hypoxia further depletes the energy stores and can influence ischaemic progression ; patients with acute stroke are at risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias  and circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest may occur in conditions such as myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. A few studies conducted to evaluate the role of monitoring in management of acute stroke patients showed a better outcome at discharge and one‐year follow up in the patients monitored continuously for at least 48 hours .\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】Stroke units (SU) can significantly reduce mortality, institutionalisation and dependence of stroke patients . However, the reasons for their effectiveness remain undetermined . Despite the presence of standardised protocols for acute evaluation, medical treatment, strategies for early mobilisation, a strong focus on rehabilitation, multidisciplinary teams and integration between medical care, nursing and rehabilitation  there is uncertainty about the most effective SU model. One of the most controversial issues is the intensity of monitoring, which has a strong impact in the SU organisation in terms of the number of personnel, specialisation, structure and costs.\n\n【15】It is therefore important to gather all available evidence to determine whether intensive monitoring improves outcome. The questions ar how, when, and in which patients should this aetiological work start? an for how long should it continue? .\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To assess the effects of continuous physiological monitoring on blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and heart rhythm in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】We aim to include all apparently published or unpublished, unconfounded, randomised controlled trials (RCT) with or without blinding.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】Patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, according to the World Health Organization criteria , irrespective of age, gender, or social status, whose symptom onset was less than three days from stroke onset and followed up at least until discharge. Confirmation of clinical diagnosis using imaging is not compulsory.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】##### Active intervention\n\n【26】Continuous physiological monitoring (CPM), defined as non‐invasive continuous (i.e. covering at least 12 hours) monitoring, within the first 72 hours of admission, of at least one of the following variables: blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, oxygenation, heart rhythm, or body temperature. We will consider monitoring to be continuous even if it is discontinued for a short period of less than one hour (so that the patient can be toileted, bathed or mobilised).\n\n【27】##### Control\n\n【28】Non‐continuous physiological monitoring (NCPM). NCPM is defined as monitoring for less than 12 hours within the first 72 hours of admission of at least one of the above‐mentioned variables.\n\n【29】Since there is potential for great heterogeneity in the definitions both of the threshold level of abnormality that triggers an intervention for each of the above‐mentioned physiological variables and of the specific intervention that is given to correct the abnormality, we will include details on these aspects of each study.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】We will study the following measures in both treatment groups.\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】*   Death from any cause at discharge.\n\n【34】*   Dependence, preferably at three months or longer (Barthel Index or modified Rankin scale score or any other scale that measures active daily living).\n\n【35】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【36】*   Death from vascular causes.\n\n【37】*   Quality of life.\n\n【38】*   Length of stay.\n\n【39】*   Institutionalisation.\n\n【40】*   Neurological complications (stroke progression, stroke recurrence, seizures).\n\n【41】*   Cardiac complications (arrhythmias, heart failure, myocardial infarction).\n\n【42】###### Adverse effects\n\n【43】*   Complications related to immobility (infections, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,  falls, pressure sores, pain) or to treatments triggered by the monitoring of listed variables.\n\n【44】###### Surrogate outcome\n\n【45】Number of patients who triggered an intervention for at least one of the following conditions:\n\n【46】*   oxygen desaturation;\n\n【47】*   fever;\n\n【48】*   atrial fibrillation;\n\n【49】*   hypertension;\n\n【50】*   hypotension.\n\n【51】We will describe the type of intervention and threshold level of abnormality considered in each study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】This aim of this review is to examine if chewing gum after laparoscopic or open colorectal surgery reduces the duration of post‐operative ileus and enhances post‐operative recovery. The review will consider the impact of the intervention on indicators of restoration of bowel function (passage of flatus and faeces) and recovery (time to discharge). The review will also explore whether analgesic regime and surgical procedure (open vs closed) alters any effect of the intervention.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】There is considerable variation in rates of recovery following major colorectal surgery. A dominant factor in the speed of recovery is the time taken for normal gut function to return post‐operatively. The stress response to surgery, pain and its treatment with opiates, plus gut oedema can all contribute to bowel paralysis (ileus) which can lead to lengthened hospital stays . Data from a randomised controlled trial indicate that mean time to first peristalsis is longer after open procedures (38 hours) than laparascopic ones (26 hours) but full recovery of bowel function is highly variable and first bowel movement occurs on average 90 hours post surgery for open procedures, 70 for closed . Various strategies aim to minimise it . However, there is relatively little consensus and more clearly effective strategies such as epidural local analgesia are not routinely used in many institutions  and, in the case of laparoscopic procedures, remain controversial because of wider implications of the strategy .\n\n【6】Early post‐operative feeding is a simple strategy that may stimulate gut motility and avoid prolonged ileus . However, this is not universally accepted, due to fear of adverse effects should an anastomotic leak occur  and is not well tolerated in some 20% of patients . Recently a number of studies have examined the effect of chewing gum in the post‐operative period following an early report with encouraging findings that suggested improved recovery . Chewing gum is a form of sham feeding which may stimulate gut motility without these risks by providing vagal cholinergic stimulation, which in turn leads to release of gastrointestinal hormones. The objective of this review is to determine if chewing gum after laparoscopic or open colorectal surgery reduces the duration of post‐operative ileus and recovery time.\n\n【7】Objectives\n----------\n\n【8】This aim of this review is to examine if chewing gum after laparoscopic or open colorectal surgery reduces the duration of post‐operative ileus and enhances post‐operative recovery.

In technically developed countries, perinatal asphyxia affects approximately 73 per 1000 live preterm infants, of whom 50% may be moderately or severely affected . Approximately 25% of the survivors exhibit permanent neuropsychological deficits such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, seizures and learning disabilities . Over the past 20 years, improvements in perinatal management of preterm newborns have substantially reduced mortality . Although more preterm infants now survive, the proportion who sustain significant neurologic impairment remains relatively constant. Thus, the number of impaired survivors has actually increased . Given these figures, it is not surprising that effective strategies to prevent or minimise the long term consequences of perinatal cerebral hypoxic ischaemic injury have long been sought .\n\n【20】### Description of the condition\n\n【21】The preterm brain is more susceptible to hypoxia‐ischaemia (HI) and may have a more severe response to brain injury than term infants . In a hospital‐based study, the incidence of perinatal HIE in infants of 32 to 36 weeks gestational age was 0.9%. Fifty‐eight per cent of these patients suffered poor outcomes, which is higher than the incidence of poor outcomes in term infants with HIE . Animal models support the concept of greater susceptibility to injury in the preterm brain. Buser 2010 found that preterm rabbits are more susceptible to brain injury due to HIE than term rabbits because late oligodendrocyte progenitors in preterm rabbits are particularly vulnerable to HIE. Preterm fetal HIE causes hypertonia and motor deficits in the neonatal rabbit, which is consistent with human data in which preterm infants with a birth weight < 1500 g are 100 times more likely to have cerebral palsy (CP) than term infants of 3000 g to 3500 g birth weight .\n\n【22】Regional differences in vulnerability to HIE exist. The thalamus and posterior brainstem myelinate earlier than the basal ganglia and the anterior brainstem, so these areas may be especially vulnerable to HI. The preterm cortex may be less susceptible to calcium‐induced excitotoxic injury than later in gestation because the proportion of a subtype of glutamate receptors allowing calcium influx into the cell is lower in the early third trimester . The basal ganglia are more susceptible to injury following acute HI than the white matter, which is similar in preterm infants at term and term‐born infants . However, positron emission tomography studies demonstrate a lower glucose transport capacity in the preterm brain .\n\n【23】Few studies have specially defined or staged HIE in preterm infants. In some studies, the investigators applied the standard definitions and Sarnat stages for HIE in preterm infants . In these studies, the diagnosis of HIE was made in infants as low as 26 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) . However, there are no studies that explored whether the diagnosis is possible at these lower gestational ages.\n\n【24】A variety of pharmaceutical products that potentially have neuroprotective properties, including calcium channel blockers, free‐radical scavengers, glutamate receptor blockers, anti‐inflammatory and anti‐apoptotic agents, and growth factors, have been used to treat HIE . _The Cochrane Library_ has published many reviews that assess these drugs and some interventions to prevent and treat perinatal asphyxia or HIE . These drugs were only studied in term and late preterm infants; none of these studies was conducted in preterm infants. Of these therapies, only therapeutic mild hypothermia has been proven to limit brain damage in term infants with perinatal asphyxia or HIE . Therapeutic hypothermia has not been tested in preterm infants because of concern that preterm infants would have a greater risk for hypothermia‐induced problems such as hypoglycaemia, and coagulopathy . Currently, preterm infants with HIE following perinatal asphyxia are provided supportive care, including correcting metabolic acidosis, close monitoring of the fluid status, and seizure control .\n\n【25】### Description of the intervention\n\n【26】Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine hormone that regulates erythropoiesis and promotes red blood cell maturation. It is widely used to prevent or treat anaemia . The observation that EPO‐treated anaemia patients exhibit improved neuromuscular function  was quickly followed by the demonstration that EPO protected neurons against hypoxia in vitro . In neonatal animal models of hypoxic ischaemic injury, effective neuroprotective dosages ranged from 1000 to 30,000 U/kg . Optimal protection was produced with three doses of 5000 U/kg given within 72 hours of injury . Some observational studies have demonstrated the effects of EPO in treatment of encephalopathy in term infants and adult subjects .\n\n【27】### How the intervention might work\n\n【28】The effects of EPO for the treatment of hypoxic ischaemic injury have been investigated most intensively in neuronal cell cultures, in experimental animal models, and in some clinical trials . Experimental animal models of hypoxic ischaemic brain injury show that EPO has neuroprotective effects via the modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity and the differential regulation of the expression of genes involved in apoptotic processes . There are many mechanisms underlying EPO‐mediated neuroprotection. The effects of EPO include direct neurotrophic effects , decreased susceptibility to glutamate toxicity , induction of anti‐apoptotic factors , decreased inflammation , decreased nitric oxide‐mediated injury , direct antioxidant effects  and protective effects on glia cells . Early EPO spares spatial memory and hippocampal CA1 neurons . It is speculated that EPO‐induced erythropoiesis may protect neurons by enhancing utilization of free iron liberated by hypoxic ischaemic injury . Lastly, EPO provides neuroprotection by improving blood flow to the injured tissue .\n\n【29】When high doses of EPO are administered systemically, a small proportion crosses the blood‐brain barrier and can protect against HI brain injury . Infants with elevated serum concentrations of EPO have higher Mental Development Index scores than those with lower serum EPO concentrations . Some clinical trials in Western countries and China have supported a role for EPO in promoting neurodevelopment in preterm infants .Therefore, we hypothesise that high doses of EPO at the beginning or within a short critical time period (up to six hours) after the onset of brain injury may achieve significant neuroprotective effect in preterm infants with HIE.\n\n【30】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【31】Effective therapies are urgently required to prevent neurosensory impairment following perinatal asphyxia in preterm infants. Clinical trials have evaluated the safety and neuroprotective effects of high doses of EPO in preterm infants . These trials provide important insight into preterm infants who received high doses of EPO for the prevention and treatment of HIE. However, there are concerns regarding the adverse effects of long term EPO treatment including hypertension, seizures, thrombotic events, polycythaemia, and red cell aplasia secondary to anti‐EPO antibodies . There is particular concern regarding the incidence of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP; stage III or greater) seen in preterm infants receiving EPO within the first eight days of life for the prevention of anaemia . Since very few prospective human trials assessed the risk of ROP in preterm infants receiving high‐dose EPO, some animal models have tried to answer this question. A study recently reported that early high‐dose EPO (5000 U/kg/×3) did not exacerbate (or reduce) ROP in a neonatal rat model . However, another study of a mouse model suggested that the effect of EPO on ROP might depend on timing which early EPO administration is shown to decrease ROP and late EPO exposure increase ROP pathology . Long term effects, particularly neurodevelopmental outcome, need to be further addressed . In some studies of lower dose of EPO exposure (250 to 400 U/kg/dose EPO, three times/week for six weeks to prevent anaemia of prematurity), they indicate that even lower doses of repeated EPO can be beneficial to neurodevelopmental outcome . Therefore, it is important to review the available evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early administration of high dose EPO for the treatment of preterm infants with HIE, and determine the optimal dosage and timing of EPO administration, the dosing intervals and the course of treatment.\n\n【32】Objectives\n----------\n\n【33】To assess the effects of therapeutic erythropoietin (EPO) compared to standard supportive treatment on death, long term neurodevelopmental disability and clinically important side effects in preterm infants (less than 35 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE).\n\n【34】Secondary objectives include assessment of the adverse effects of EPO and effects on early prognostic indicators of adverse outcome (severity of electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality; seizures (and number of anticonvulsants used); imaging appearance of areas of hyperintensity on diffusion weighted (DW) images; basal ganglia, posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) and/or white matter (WM) injury; parasagittal neuronal necrosis on late magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (> 4 days)).\n\n【35】We plan subgroup analyses on the basis of:\n\n【36】1.

This is a potentially debilitating social problem which leads to high health care costs, estimated in billions of dollars in the United States .\n\n【7】Continence is achieved through interplay of the normal anatomical and physiological properties of the bladder, urethra and sphincter, pelvic floor and the nervous system coordinating these organs. The active relaxation of the bladder coupled by the ability of the urethra and sphincter to contain urine within the bladder by acting as a closure mechanism during filling, allow storage of urine until an appropriate time and place to void is reached. The role of the pelvic floor in providing support to the bladder and urethra, and allowing normal abdominal pressure transmission to the proximal urethra is also considered essential in the maintenance of continence. Crucial to the healthy functioning of the bladder, urethra, sphincter and pelvic floor is coordination between them, facilitated by an intact nervous system control. New insights on the pathophysiology of urinary incontinence have evidenced that mid urethral support, provided by the pubo‐urethral ligaments, also plays an important role in maintaining continence during rises in the intra abdominal pressure .\n\n【8】Incontinence occurs when this normal relationship between the lower urinary tract components is disrupted, resulting from nerve damage or direct mechanical trauma to the pelvic organs. Advancing age, higher parity, vaginal delivery, obesity and menopause are associated with an increase in risk .\n\n【9】There are different types of urinary incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence is the most common type . It is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine on effort, or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing . 'Stress incontinence' is the involuntary loss of urine from the urethra during physical activities that increase abdominal pressure, in the absence of a detrusor (bladder wall muscle) contraction or an over‐distended bladder. . Two mechanisms for stress incontinence are recognized: hyper‐mobility or significant displacement of the urethra and bladder neck during exertion, and intrinsic urethral sphincter deficiency . In women, these mechanisms may co‐exist . Few clinical trials have distinguished between the two conditions, probably because there is no standardized and validated test available to date . Women whose incontinence may be due to either of these two mechanisms will be considered together in this review.\n\n【10】The diagnosis of 'urodynamic stress incontinence' implies that urodynamic investigation was done to confirm stress incontinence and exclude the presence of detrusor involuntary contractions caused by a stress maneuver and to define the intensity of detrusor overactivity (which may affect prognosis). Standard clinical assessment includes history taking, physical examination, frequency/volume charts and urine analysis. Some authors have described women with only the symptom of stress incontinence (diagnosis made on clinical evaluation without urodynamics). Women with stress incontinence both with and without urodynamic investigation will be included in this review.\n\n【11】'Urgency urinary incontinence' is the symptom of involuntary loss of urine associated with a sudden, strong desire (urgency) to void. 'Detrusor overactivity' is a diagnosis that denotes involuntary detrusor contractions observed during the filling phase of an urodynamic examination. It may be spontaneous or provoked and can be qualified according to cause ‐ neurogenic or idiopathic . Both women with the symptom and the formal urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor overactivity will be included in the review only if they have co‐existing stress incontinence ('mixed' incontinence).\n\n【12】Women with mixed incontinence included in this review will either have symptoms of stress plus urge incontinence or other urinary symptoms (diagnosed clinically), or urodynamic stress incontinence plus detrusor overactivity (diagnosed using urodynamics).\n\n【13】Treatments for stress urinary incontinence include conservative, pharmacological and surgical interventions. Conservative treatment centres on physical methods, including pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, biofeedback and weighted cones. Mechanical devices which prevent or reduce urinary leakage are available, such as meatal plugs/patches and urethral and vaginal inserts. Drug therapies, principally oestrogens and less often alpha adrenergic agents, can be used. Recently, inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake have been proposed as new drug therapy for urinary stress incontinence, used alone or in combination with other conservative management . A trial of conservative therapy is generally undertaken before resorting to surgery. These interventions are the subject of separate Cochrane reviews. Surgical procedures to remedy stress incontinence generally aim to lift and support the urethro‐vesical junction. There is disagreement, however, regarding the precise mechanism by which continence is achieved. Choice of procedures is often influenced by co‐existent problems, surgeon's preference and the physical features of the person affected.\n\n【14】Numerous surgical methods have been described, but essentially they fall into seven categories:  \nOpen abdominal retropubic suspension (e.g. colposuspension (Burch), Marshall‐Marchetti‐Krantz (MMK))  \nLaparoscopic retropubic suspension  \nVaginal anterior repair (anterior colporrhaphy ‐ e.g. Kelly, Pacey)  \nSuburethral slings (including traditional suburethral slings and minimally invasive sling operations)  \nNeedle suspensions (e.g. Pereyra, Stamey)  \nPeri‐urethral injections, and  \nArtificial sphincters.\n\n【15】Several reviews on surgical treatment of stress incontinence have been published in the Cochrane Library. . This review is one of two reviews on sling operations. The first review concentrates on traditional suburethral sling operation . A traditional suburethral sling operation requires a combined abdominal and vaginal approach. Strips of material are tunneled under the proximal urethra. They are attached either to the rectus muscle or the ileopectineal ligaments resulting in a tightening of the sling and increased bladder support every time the woman strains. The materials that have been used for slings may be biological or synthetic. They are applied under open surgery and are fixed with sutures.\n\n【16】A modification of the suburethral sling procedure is the minimally invasive, 'self‐fixing' polypropylene mesh (for example, transvaginal tape (TVT), suprapubic arc (SPARC), etc) in which a polypropylene tape covered by a plastic sheath is inserted around the mid‐urethra without fixation and in some centres under local anaesthesia . The aim is to restore the patient's urethra to its normal position and to support it during a sudden movement, such as a cough or sneeze. This prevents the involuntary loss of urine . The procedure involves the insertion of two needles passed through the retropubic space blindly from vagina to abdomen or from abdomen to vagina. Cystoscopy is usually recommended to detect any perforation of the bladder. Another type of self fixing sling was described in which the tape is inserted tension‐free in a horizontal plane underneath the middle of the urethra between the two obturator foramens. The ends of the tape are tunnelled percutaneously with a tunneller (curved needle). As the retropubic space is preserved intact, cystoscopy is not required . Only self fixing mid‐urethral sling operations, applied by minimally invasive surgeries, either through the retropubic space or the transobturator route will be included in this review.\n\n【17】A concern of using synthetic material is the potential risk of complications caused by infection and tissue reaction to the tapes. Some aspects of the material that may vary include pore size, mono or multifilament design, and bio compatibility. All type of mesh used in different self fixing slings will be included in this review and possible differences on the risk of complications will be addressed on the outcome measures.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】The objectives of this review are to assess the effects of minimally invasive sling procedures for treatment of urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (urodynamic diagnosis), or for symptoms of stress or mixed incontinence (clinical diagnosis) in women.\n\n【20】The following comparisons will be made for self fixing mid‐urethral sling procedures:  \n1\\. Minimally invasive mid‐urethral sling operation versus traditional sub‐urethral slings for the management of urodynamic stress incontinence (urodynamic diagnosis), and for symptoms of stress or mixed incontinence (clinical diagnosis).  \n2\\.

The searches were last run on 7 July 2008.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials of treatment for unilateral refractive amblyopia by spectacles, with or without occlusion were eligible.

Stewart 2007a: 6 hours versus full‐time occlusion: MD ‐0.12 (not statistically significant: 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.03)\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】In some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. Where amblyopia persists there is some evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. It remains unclear which treatment regimes are optimal for individual patients. The nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified.\n\n【14】### Patching treatment for amblyopia (lazy eye) caused by needing spectacles\n\n【15】Patching treatment for amblyopia (lazy eye) caused by unequal optical errors in either eye when the (usually) worst eye can fail to develop optimum vision. Amblyopia is a condition where the vision of one (or more rarely both) eyes is reduced because the part of the brain responsible for vision does not develop properly. Amblyopia happens because the brain receives a weaker image from the eye with the greater optical error and prefers the eye with a clearer image. Children who have amblyopia because of optical errors are often given a patch to cover the good eye in addition to their spectacle correction to improve their vision. This review found that for some children with this type of amblyopia a period of spectacles wear can restore normal vision. At present it is not possible to tell at the start of treatment which children will just need spectacles and which ones will need a patch as well. For those children who still have reduced vision even after they have been wearing their spectacles for a while there is evidence that patching therapy further improves their vision. The amount of patching that will be needed for an individual child can not yet be predicted. This is because the effects of factors such as age are not fully understood. These findings are based on the results of six high quality trials.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different enteral nutrition formulations in patients with acute pancreatitis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a rather common and potentially life‐threatening inflammatory disorder of the pancreatic gland. Its incidence in most Western and Asian countries ranges between 10 to 30 per 100,000 inhabitants, and it accounts for more than 200,000 hospital admissions in the United States annually . Indicative increase in the incidence of acute pancreatitis has been reported, and attributed to the use of more accurate diagnostic tests (i.e. computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasound), and an increase in the incidence of gallstones and obesity . In about 80 to 85% of cases acute pancreatitis presents as a mild and self‐limiting disease, requiring only conservative treatment, while the remaining 15% to 20% are severe forms of the disease characterised by the development of local and systemic complications . Local complications consist of possible tissue destruction or necrosis; formation of a pseudocyst, an abnormal collection of fluid or necrotic material whose walls are formed by the pancreas and other surrounding organs; and formation of an enclosed collection of liquefied purulent tissue, called abscess. Systemic complications are caused by a systemic inflammatory response possibly leading to organ failure (most commonly, renal failure, respiratory failure and shock). The most common causes of AP are gallstone disease and excessive alcohol consumption, accounting for more than two thirds of cases . Less common causes include metabolic disorders, such as hypertriglyceridaemia (abnormal elevation of serum triglycerides, normal constituents of oil and fat), and hypercalcaemia (abnormal elevation of serum calcium), autoimmune pancreatitis, various bacterial or viral infections (i.e. mumps, Coxsackievirus, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ ), parasitic infestations of the biliary tract (i.e. _Ascaris lumbricoides_ ), abdominal abnormalities, trauma, drugs (i.e. steroids, sulphonamides, furosemide, thiazides), etc.\n\n【7】Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of AP are still controversial, it is believed that a causative factor leads to an uncontrolled enzyme activation within the pancreatic tissue and self‐digestion of the gland, causing release of molecules that mediate the inflammatory response, tissue damage and possible necrosis. These local pathological changes can trigger an intense inflammatory cascade leading to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, a generalised inflammatory response affecting different organs and whole organ systems, which can consequently cause organ failure and death . The described events represent the first phase of the clinical course of severe AP, which can be followed in up to 40% of cases by a second phase marked by infection of the necrotic pancreatic tissue . Infected pancreatic necrosis usually develops after the second week of disease, and is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of organ failure, with death occurring in about 30% of cases .\n\n【8】According to clinical guidelines , the diagnosis of AP is established by the presence of two of the following three features: a compatible clinical presentation, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; a three‐fold or greater elevation in serum amylase or lipase (digestive enzymes essential in the breakdown of starch and fat, that released to a greater extent from the inflamed pancreas into the blood); or evidence of acute pancreatitis on CT. There is no specific treatment for AP. The majority of cases respond well to conservative management, including fluid volume resuscitation, pain control, oxygen administration, anti‐vomiting drugs, and a regulated introduction and administration of food intake. Severe cases require admission to an intensive care unit and continuous monitoring of vital signs. Severe AP precipitates metabolic distress leading to an increased total energy expenditure and enhanced protein consumption. Therefore, nutritional support is an essential part of disease treatment , and several studies indicate certain advantages of enteral nutrition (EN) versus total parenteral nutrition (TPN) . EN involves the application of nutrients in liquid form directly into the stomach or small intestine via specific tubes that can be placed through the oral or nasal cavity, as well as, surgically implanted through the abdominal wall directly into the specified gastrointestinal organ. TPN is the intravenous administration of all nutrient requirements of a patient via a central venous catheter. Use of antibiotics to prevent infection of the necrotic tissue is highly debated. A recent Cochrane review showed no beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis, except for imipenem, an antibiotic from the carbapenem group with a broad spectrum of activity against various bacteria, which showed significant decrease in the incidence of pancreatic infection . Early endoscopic procedures, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, that help visualise the common bile duct should be considered in the early stages of severe gallstone pancreatitis with co‐existing bile ducts obstruction, bile ducts inflammation (cholangitis), or sepsis . In these cases, cutting the sphincter of Oddi, a muscle that lies at the junction of the intestine with both the bile and pancreatic ducts, by a procedure called retrograde sphincterotomy could help to remove bile duct stones, or treat other causes of bile obstruction. Surgical removal of necrotic tissue, as well as fluid collection, pseudocyst, or abscess drainage are indicated only when there is presence of infected tissue. Sterile necrosis should be treated conservatively .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Over decades one of the main principles in treating patients with acute pancreatitis has been 'nil‐by‐mouth', with or without the use of TPN, in order to achieve suppression of pancreatic enzyme secretion and bowel rest. However, experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that this approach can lead to an increased risk of infectious complications due to bacterial overgrowth and translocation in the gut, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe forms of disease. Furthermore, severe AP is marked by an increased amount of energy required to obtain vital functions at complete rest, also called basal metabolism, with a potential negative effect on nutritional status and disease progression . Therefore, an adequate nutritional support is essential, preferably applied by enteral route. The administration should start as soon as possible, especially if there is pre‐existing malnutrition, and usually prior to 48 hours of admission . Nutritional support is preferably administered via a tube inserted through the nasal cavity and the upper gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus and stomach), into the middle part of the small intestine called the jejunum. This nasojejunal tube should be placed distal to the duodenojejunal junction (the point where the proximal part of the small intestine, the duodenum, ends and the jejunum begins) either blindly, endoscopically, or by using radiologic procedures. It has been discussed that tube positioning has several advantages: it avoids the problem of decreased stomach motility or gastroparesis, and possible duodenal obstruction due to inflammation or pseudocyst formation; provides increased energy delivery to the small bowel; and ensures better pancreatic rest than tubes placed proximally . However, there are studies showing no significantly different effects between the use of nasojejunal and nasogastric route of administration, where nutrients are being delivered into the stomach . A wide range of different enteral nutrition formulations are available for clinical usage and different indications. They can be divided into three groups: polymeric, oligomeric, and specialised formulations. Polymeric formulations contain intact proteins; carbohydrates are represented in the form of maltodextrins or water‐soluble molecules containing three or more glucose molecules, and oligosaccharides, which are molecules containing two to six simple basic sugar molecules known as monosaccharides; finally, lipids are present in the form of long‐chain fatty‐acids. Oligomeric, also known as elemental or semi‐elemental, comprise of maltodextrins and monosaccharides, medium‐chain fatty acids and free fatty acids, while protein components consist of smaller molecules, such as free amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides (two or three interconnected amino acids). Oligomeric formulations are preferred to polymeric formulations in the treatment of AP, mostly because of better tolerance and absorption in the gut, and better achievement of pancreatic rest . However, they are several times more expensive than polymeric formulations. Specialised formulations represent a larger group of specifically designed formulas enriched with different supplements. These include immunoenhanced formulations, which are enhanced by substances potentially able to modify the immune response. Mostly, they contain specific amino acids like glutamine and arginine, omega‐3 fatty acids, and nucleotides (chemical compounds composed of a base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group, which are the main structural element of nucleic acids, i.e. deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). Other specialised formulations are fibre‐enhanced formulations, formulations supplemented with probiotics (substances containing live bacteria or yeast that supplements normal gastrointestinal flora), and disease‐specific formulations . The cost of the latter preparations is even higher, and without reliable evidence of their efficiency. In addition, formulations enriched with certain strains of probiotics have even been associated with increased mortality .\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Intestinal barrier dysfunction has a pivotal role in the course of AP. It is known that microorganisms responsible for pancreatic infection and septic complications, are generally common enteric bacteria, normally present in the gut . Disruption and overgrowth of these bacterial population that forms the normal intestinal flora in a metabolically deprived and inert bowel could lead to bacterial and endotoxin translocation, meaning that bacteria and their toxic products could move through the intestinal membrane to emerge in the lymphatic or internal organs circulation. This mechanism is further supported by an increased permeability of the intestinal membrane and local ischaemia (insufficient blood supply) of the gut due to dynamic changes of blood flow regulation in AP. The intense inflammatory state and above mentioned processes cause impairment of the patient's immunological system . Direct delivery of nutrients to the gut, and the stimulation of metabolic activity helps maintaining the structural and functional integrity of intestinal mucosa, and therefore, could reduce septic complications and morbidity . Data suggest that enteral nutrition reduces the acute phase response by preserving protein metabolism of internal organs and down‐regulating the cytokine response (proteins that act as intercellular mediators, as in the generation of an immune response) . The use of immuno‐enhanced formulas is supposed to intensify this effect. Glutamine released from muscle tissues acts as a gene promotor for cellular protection and immune responsiveness by activating the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma, an intracellular receptor that regulates glucose metabolism and fatty‐acids storage. In addition, glutamine is a potent antioxidant through its metabolite glutathione, which is a tripeptide important for the protection of various cellular structures and the detoxification of harmful compounds. Furthermore, glutamine stimulates arginine production, which is another supplement that has demonstrated potential effects by influencing the synthesis of nitric oxide (a naturally occurring gas in the body that stimulates vessel dilatation and improves blood flow). Nucleotides act as prebiotics, substances that stimulate the growth of beneficial enteric bacteria. Fish oils containing omega‐3 fatty acids have a suppressive effect on endothelial cells and pro‐inflammatory mediators. Their effects are supposedly acquired by inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (a protein controlling gene expression), displacement of arachidonic acid from cellular membranes, and stimulation of leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2 production . Arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid and the precursor to leukotrienes and prostaglandins, which are classes of molecules produced by cells to mediate allergic and inflammatory reactions.\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】Acute pancreatitis represents a global burden of morbidity and mortality with an increasing incidence. Due to the differences in the studies conducted to date, and a variety of accessible preparations for enteral feeding, it is important to do a systematic review of specific formulations and try to point out the most efficient and cost‐effective method of enteral nutrition in these patients.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of different enteral nutrition formulations in patients with acute pancreatitis.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Randomised clinical trials assessing enteral nutrition in patients with acute pancreatitis.\n\n【21】We will include randomised clinical trials irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

{"seq_id": "af037eec-693a-43e4-9cd1-4fc1cbfba73a", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. It includes at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms. These are bodily symptoms, such as a racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach‐churning, faintness and breathlessness, and fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (unreal perception) . Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent, spontaneous and unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed by one month (or more) of persistent concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications of the attack (or its consequences) or a significant change in behaviour related to the attacks . In around a quarter (or more) of patients, panic disorder is accompanied by agoraphobia (avoidance of situations where escape would be difficult when panic attacks occur) . The presence of agoraphobia is associated with increased severity and worse outcome .\n\n【7】Panic disorder is common in the general population, with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4% . In primary care settings, the prevalence rises to around 10% . It is also highly co‐morbid with other psychiatric disorders, such as drug dependence, major depression, bipolar I disorder, social phobia, specific phobia and generalised anxiety disorder . It is estimated that generalised anxiety disorder co‐occurs in 68% of people with panic disorder , whilst it co‐occurs in only 38.6% of people with major depression . People suffering from panic disorder exhibit considerably poorer overall mental well‐being than individuals with cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, hypertension and a host of other chronic physical conditions . Having panic disorder is also related to poorer quality of life and physical function ; the risk of attempting suicide is also higher . These effects are similar to or greater than those associated with major depression . A study has reported that nearly one‐third of these patients in primary care had seen three or more healthcare professionals and almost one‐fifth had visited general hospital emergency departments .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】#### Psychological therapies\n\n【10】There are various psychological therapies for panic disorder. Whilst they may all be variously used in the treatment of panic disorder in everyday clinical practice, only approaches informed by the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended in clinical guidelines for panic disorder .\n\n【11】Psychoeducation consists of providing information to patients on things such as symptoms and theories of psychological therapy . Supportive psychotherapy is the non‐specific component of psychological therapies and involves warm, empathic and non‐directive emotional support . Physiological therapy uses physical techniques such as breathing retraining, relaxation and biofeedback. Its aim is to help patients to control the physiological symptoms of panic disorder . Behaviour therapy is characterised by exposure and habituation; patients are gradually exposed to their phobic situations (in vivo exposure) or bodily sensations (interoceptive exposure) in order to reduce their anxiety in such environments . Cognitive therapy is composed of cognitive restructuring, in which the patient and therapist co‐operate to find and reconstruct irrational or maladaptive thoughts . Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the combination of behaviour therapy and cognitive therapy, and often includes psychoeducation and physiological therapy, such as breathing retraining and progressive muscle relaxation. The third‐wave therapies are a group of treatments which share some features of CBT, but focus on mindfulness, acceptance, the patient's values in life and relationships . Examples are acceptance and commitment treatment, cognitive behavioural analysis, dialectical behavioural therapy and mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy . Psychodynamic therapy is represented by psychoanalysis and its derivatives, which deal with unconscious content exploration, analysis of dreams, past experience, parental relationships, transference and resistance.\n\n【12】#### Pharmacological interventions\n\n【13】Different types of antidepressants augment the function of chemicals in the brain, in particular serotonin, noradrenaline or both. Tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors inhibit both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prevent the reuptake of serotonin into nerve terminals by inhibiting serotonin transporters. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors inhibit enzymes which oxidise monoamines such as serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine. Other types of antidepressants include bupropion, which prevents reuptake of noradrenaline and dopamine; trazodone and nefazodone, which block serotonin receptors; and mirtazapine, which increases central noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission (by inhibiting the negative feedback from serotonin and noradrenaline that has already been released by the neuron), but also has antagonist and partial agonist actions on certain serotonin receptors . Benzodiazepines have been used for panic disorder . However, recent guidelines recommend SSRIs as the first‐line medication , as benzodiazepines may lead to dependence and tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors have more unfavourable adverse effects than SSRIs .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Psychological therapy can be broadly conceived and defined as therapeutic interaction aimed at the alleviation of mental suffering through verbal and non‐verbal communication between a professional and a client, based on a certain theoretical model of how that mental suffering occurs and is maintained. Psychoeducation aims to help people to acquire the competence to manage their symptoms and preserve their mental health . Supportive psychotherapy helps patients see things more clearly by supporting reality testing, challenging unrealistic ideas and demonstrating more effective, less costly ways of defending while supporting adaptive defences . Physiological therapy is based on the suffocation alarm theory, which postulates that a monitor in the human central nervous system sets off the alarm for imminent suffocation when its regulatory threshold is exceeded . Physiological therapy, such as respiratory training, tries to treat panic disorder by controlling P <sub>CO2 </sub> (carbon dioxide partial pressure), which is the key to the suffocation alarm. Behavioural therapy focuses on the maintenance of fear through avoidance and treats agoraphobia by exposure to feared stimuli and habituation of fear responses . Cognitive therapy postulates that panic disorder occurs through a catastrophising misinterpretation of bodily sensations, which should therefore be corrected either through cognitive restructuring or behavioural experiments . The third‐wave therapies focus more on contact with internal events, acceptance and mindfulness; emphasis is given to contacting the present moment . Mindfulness alters the function of thoughts without first altering their form . Psychodynamic therapy assumes that a panic attack occurs when the defence mechanism against anxiety is broken. The loss of parents or experience of separation anxiety in childhood is regarded as the cause of agoraphobia according to this theory .\n\n【16】A range of psychotropic agents have been shown to be effective against panic disorder. Medications affecting the serotonin system, such as tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, have anxiolytic effects ; some studies also suggest that they have a regulatory effect on respiration . The frontal cortex is the most consistently reported site that responds to antidepressant treatment, which induces normalisation of its over‐activity and under‐activity . Other supposed regions affected by antidepressant treatment include specific subcortical (brain stem, hypothalamus), limbic‐paralimbic (hippocampus, posterior cingulate) and striatal (caudate, globus pallidus) nodes . The site and direction of regional changes also suggest mechanisms for changes in mood and motor, cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression . Benzodiazepines enhance gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission by acting as agonists at a specific site on the GABA‐A receptor, resulting in anxiolytic, hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects. They are effective for rapid relief of symptoms, but have disadvantages, such as sedation, and the potential for abuse and formation of tolerance . Decreased benzodiazepine receptor binding in panic disorder patients has been suggested in a study ; this is consistent with the idea that panic disorder may be due to defective brain inhibition that leads to paroxysmal elevations in anxiety during panic attacks.\n\n【17】Some authors have suggested that the biological mechanisms of action of psychological therapies and antidepressants may not be entirely mutually exclusive .\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Various randomised controlled trials and meta‐analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of psychological therapies in comparison with waiting list, psychological placebo or pharmacological placebo controls , and the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in comparison with placebo . Several meta‐analyses have also examined the relative efficacy of psychological therapies and pharmacotherapy.\n\n【20】A meta‐analysis of combined psychological therapy and antidepressant medication, compared to either treatment administered as monotherapy, concluded that combined therapy is better than antidepressants and that psychological therapy is as effective as combined therapy . Considering this evidence, it could be the case that psychological therapy is better than antidepressants. However, to make any firm and direct conclusions we would need to analyse head‐to‐head comparisons of psychological therapy alone and antidepressants alone.\n\n【21】Three previous meta‐analyses have included studies directly comparing psychological therapy with pharmacotherapy, but they have some critical limitations . Two of these reviews used data from 1964 to 1990 and from 1974 to 1994, and are therefore out of date. Moreover, only one study out of the 29 included in Clum 1993 , and three studies out of the 43 included in Gould 1995 , directly compared pharmacotherapy with psychological therapies and their only pharmacological intervention was imipramine. Now that between 30 to 40 antidepressants are available, with different modes of action (such as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants), meta‐analyses including a wide range of medications should be carried out.\n\n【22】A more recent meta‐analysis analysed different therapy approaches including pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies, but within the latter category only cognitive behavioural therapy or behaviour therapy were included . There are, however, other psychotherapies which have been shown to be effective for panic disorder, such as psychoanalytic therapy .\n\n【23】There is therefore a need for an up‐to‐date and more comprehensive review, which directly compares different types of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy, in order to better inform treatment choices.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effects of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised studies in which the effects of clustering have been taken into account. We will exclude quasi‐randomised trials, such as those allocating participants using alternate days of the week. We will include trials using a cross‐over design in the review.\n\n【30】#### Types of participants\n\n【31】##### Age range\n\n【32】The participants have to be 18 years of age or older. We will not include studies focusing on adolescents. There is the Cochrane review on cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents . However, we will include studies with patients younger that 18 in the sample as long as it can be safely assumed that at least 80% of patients are aged 18 or older.\n\n【33】##### Diagnosis\n\n【34】We will include studies that have enlisted participants with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, according to any of the following criteria: Feighner criteria , Research Diagnostic Criteria , Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)‐III , DSM‐III‐R , DSM‐IV  or ICD‐10 . We anticipate there will be few, if any, studies that use DSM‐V diagnostic criteria, owing to its relatively recent publication. As such, we will not include DSM‐V criteria in this version of the review. DSM‐V considers panic disorder and agoraphobia as independent conditions; in future revisions of the review, we will include studies based on DSM‐V if they focus on panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.\n\n【35】If studies focuses on agoraphobia, rather than panic disorder, we will include them if participants were operationally diagnosed according to the above criteria and when it can be safely assumed that some of the participants were suffering from panic disorder as defined by the above criteria. In other words, we will exclude studies that focus on agoraphobia without panic disorder. There is evidence that over 95% of patients with agoraphobia seen clinically also suffer from panic disorder . However, we will examine the effect of the inclusion of these studies (i.e. studies in which some, but possibly not all, of the patients had panic disorder) in a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【36】We will exclude studies where panic is induced.\n\n【37】##### Setting\n\n【38】Participants must be outpatients at the time of enrolment.\n\n【39】##### Previous treatment\n\n【40】We will include both treatment‐naive patients and patients who have already undergone some previous treatment (either psychological or pharmacological), as long as they satisfy the above inclusion criteria.\n\n【41】##### Co‐morbidities\n\n【42】We will include studies where participants may have other anxiety disorders (e.g. generalised anxiety disorder, specific phobias) or with subthreshold panic disorder if: 1) separate results for patients with panic disorder are available and 2) randomisation is stratified by specific diagnoses. Stratification by diagnosis will not be required if the total sample includes at least 40 participants with panic disorder.\n\n【43】We will exclude studies in which all participants had a concurrent primary diagnosis of Axis I or II disorders other than panic disorder or agoraphobia.\n\n【44】We will include studies in which the participants may have physical co‐morbidities. However, we will exclude studies that explicitly focus on panic disorder or agoraphobia among patients with a specific physical co‐morbidity, which can be a confounding factor.\n\n【45】#### Types of interventions\n\n【46】For this review, we choose to focus on the most representative psychological therapy schools (that is, CBT and its components or developments, psychodynamic psychotherapy and supportive psychotherapy) and their control conditions.\n\n【47】We will include trials if they compare a psychological therapy with a pharmacological intervention.\n\n【48】##### Psychological therapy\n\n【49】1.  Psychoeducation, defined as sessions in which patients are provided with information about their disease .\n\n【50】2.  Supportive psychotherapy, defined as sessions in which patients are administered an active, although non‐specific, psychological treatment .\n\n【51】3.  Physiological therapies that use some kind of physical training (e.g. breathing retraining, progressive muscle relaxation, applied relaxation) in order to reduce the physiological manifestations of anxiety .\n\n【52】4.  Behaviour therapy, with or without physiological components, aiming at patients' habituation to anxiety‐provoking situations and sensations through some kind of exposure (e.g. interoceptive, in vivo) .\n\n【53】5.  Cognitive therapy, with or without physiological components and behavioural experiments, aiming at the modification of maladaptive thoughts through some kind of cognitive restructuring .\n\n【54】6.  Cognitive‐behavioural therapy: face‐to‐face cognitive behavioural therapy, with or without physiological components, containing both cognitive and behavioural therapy elements.\n\n【55】7.  Third‐wave therapies: third‐wave CBT, including acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness‐based therapy and other so‐called 'third‐wave' therapies administered with or without other CBT components (e.g. exposure, cognitive restructuring, breathing retraining, muscle relaxation) .\n\n【56】8.  Psychodynamic therapy, focused on revealing and resolving intrapsychic or unconscious conflicts .\n\n【57】Therapies can be of any length, so we will accept those given in a single session.\n\n【58】We will include both individual and group therapies.\n\n【59】Therapies must be administered face‐to‐face. We will exclude therapies administered in their self help (for example, book, computer, internet) or remote (for example, telephone, video conference) versions. In the case of psychoeducation, we will not consider the simple provision of informational material without any face‐to‐face session to be an active intervention, but rather a comparator intervention (such as no psychological treatment or waiting list).\n\n【60】We will exclude family therapy, couple therapy and other psychosocial interventions whose intervention focus is not the individual but rather the family system or couple as a whole.\n\n【61】We will include so‐called component studies (e.g. dismantling studies) as long as each arm can be regarded as any of the above‐defined experimental interventions compared against another experimental or comparator treatment. Ultimately, we may regard study arms as giving information about the same experimental intervention and thus combine them.\n\n【62】We will exclude any other psychological therapies (such as interpersonal therapy (IPT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) and Morita therapy) on the grounds that they do not meet the criteria described above for a CBT (and its components and developments), psychodynamic psychotherapy or a supportive psychotherapy approach.\n\n【63】When psychoeducation or psychological support (or both) are accompanied by any other psychological intervention, we will classify study arms according to the latter and regard psychoeducation and psychological support as components of that intervention.\n\n【64】##### Pharmacotherapy\n\n【65】1.  Tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressants: imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin/dothiepin, trimipramine, lofepramine, protriptyline, amineptine.\n\n【66】2.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline.\n\n【67】3.  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): phenelzine, isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, brofaromine.\n\n【68】4.  Serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, venlafaxine.\n\n【69】5.  Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine.\n\n【70】6.  Noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors: reboxetine.\n\n【71】7.  Other antidepressants: agomelatine, bupropion, trazodone, nefazodone, mianserin, maprotilin, vortioxetine, vilazodone, viloxazine.\n\n【72】8.  Benzodiazepines: adinazolam, alprazolam, bentazepam, bromazepam, brotizolam, camazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, clotiazepam, cloxazolam, diazepam, etizolam, flutoprazepam, halazepam, ketazolam, loflazepate, lorazepam, lormetazepam, medazepam, metaclazepam, mexazolam, midazolam, nordazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, propazepam, quazepam, ripazepam, tofisopam.\n\n【73】Combination pharmacotherapy: we will include studies where regular use of antidepressants and irregular use of benzodiazepines took place and regard them as antidepressant monotherapy. We will also include studies where regular use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines took place but will regard them as combination therapy of antidepressants plus regular benzodiazepines. We will exclude other combination pharmacotherapy.\n\n【74】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【75】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【76】###### Effectiveness\n\n【77】*   Short‐term\\* rate of 'remission', i.e. satisfactory end‐state as defined by the global judgement of the original investigators, such as 'panic free' or 'no or minimal symptoms' according to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity Scale , or a Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score of seven or below , or a Fear Questionnaire Agoraphobia Subscale score of nine or below .\n\n【78】*   Short‐term\\* rate of 'response' (a dichotomised outcome). 'Response' is intended to be a substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the global judgement of the original authors, such as 'very much' or 'much' improvement according to the CGI Change Scale, a more than 40% reduction in the PDSS or a more than 50% reduction in the Fear Questionnaire Agoraphobia Subscale.\n\n【79】###### Adverse effects\n\n【80】*   Total number of drop‐outs for any reason, as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability.\n\n【81】(\\*) Short‐term, i.e. within six months from treatment commencement. When multiple time point measures are available, we will give preference to measures at approximately three months after treatment commencement.\n\n【82】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【83】###### Effectiveness\n\n【84】*   Long‐term rate of remission/response of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, either by treatment discontinuation or by continued treatment. Long‐term is defined as six months or longer after treatment commencement. When multiple time point measures are available, we will give preference to measures at approximately 12 to 15 months after treatment commencement.\n\n【85】*   Short‐term improvement of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as measured on a continuous scale.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of special diets, or dietary advice, on the outcome of multiple pregnancies.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Multiple pregnancies occur when two or more fetuses are present in the uterus; this can be a result of implantation of two genetically different fertilised eggs by two different sperm (dizygotic twins), or due to the division of a one fertilised egg (monozygotic). Monozygotic twins can share the same placenta (monochorionic) or have separate placentas (dichorionic) .\n\n【7】Twin pregnancies can be diagnosed by an ultrasound scan as early as six weeks. Women with twin pregnancies may have more severe nausea and vomiting than those with singleton pregnancies, as a result of higher levels of hCG .\n\n【8】Since the 1970s there has been a steady increase in the number of twin pregnancies; from 9.6 per 1000 maternities in England and Wales  in 1976 to 15.5 in 2008 ; in the USA, 18.8 per 1000 were twins in 1975  rising to 32.1 per 1000 in 2006 . This rise has been attributed to the increase in the use of assisted reproductive technology, and to some women deciding to have children later in life. An increase in maternal age increases the chances of twin pregnancy. In the USA it was found that 20% of twin pregnancies from 1980 to 1997 were due to spontaneous conception, 40% due to in vitro fertilisation and 40% due to ovulation induction . In Europe, spontaneously conceived twins comprise 1% of all deliveries; 20% to 30% of all twins are due to assisted reproductive technology .\n\n【9】Twin pregnancies are associated with higher rates of complications for both the mother and the fetuses. Gestational hypertension and pre‐eclampsia are twice as likely to occur as in singleton pregnancies with risk ratios of 2 and 2.6 respectively . There is a higher incidence of antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, with the average blood loss after delivery being 500 ml higher than after singleton birth .\n\n【10】Mulitple births have a substantial perinatal mortality rate (PMR) compared to singletons. In England and Wales, in 2006, there was an overall PMR of 8.2 per 1000 births with twins having a rate of 27.2 per 1000, and triplets and higher order births 81.8 per 1000 . When infants are born long before term they are functionally immature, and are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care unit. They have poor thermoregulatory mechanisms, which is worsened by low brown fat levels and heat loss. Respiratory distress syndrome occurs as a result of lack of surfactant, and may be associated with chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) . Multiple pregnancies have a strong association with preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks), ranging from 48.2% in Ireland to 68.4% in Austria; between 39.1 and 47.1% occur at 32 to 36 weeks, and 8.1 to 12.7% before 32 weeks .\n\n【11】Fifty percent of twins are small for gestational age (SGA) by 39 weeks using the 1991 US singleton live birth values. Ten per cent to 15% of multiple pregnancies (twins and triplets) are SGA by 22 to 30 weeks' gestation .\n\n【12】Cerebral palsy is also eight times more likely to occur in twins, and has a greater prevalence when the birthweight is less than 1000 g . When infants are below 1500 g, 30% to 65% will have neurological problems ranging from motor to cognitive/behavioural deficits. Other severe neurological concerns are intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. Necrotising enterocolitis also affects low birthweight infants, and there is a high risk of infection due to an immature immune system. Prematurity is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); the retina is vascularly immature as there is insufficient vascularisation due to poor production of angiogenic factors .\n\n【13】Depending on the chorionicity of the twins, there are specific complications. For example 10% to 15% of monochorionic twins have twin‐twin transfusion syndrome which can result in fetal death if left untreated. This occurs as a result of anastomoses on the placenta, resulting in a compromise of blood flow to one of the twins which results in poor growth while the other twin receives the redirected blood from the placenta .\n\n【14】The risk to mother and fetus is increased even more when the number of fetus increases. High order pregnancies such as triplets and quadruplets have higher rates of perinatal mortality and have an earlier gestation at delivery; the average gestation for triplets is 33.4 weeks. High order births are more likely to deliver earlier on in the pregnancy than twins, 16.9% triplets and 29.2% quadruplets were born before 29 weeks compared to 5.6% of twins. The number of fetuses also impacts on the chances of survival for both twins, with 6.3 % triplets, 8.0 % quadruplets pregnancies having one or more fetal deaths compared to 2.4 % of twins .\n\n【15】In one series, 100% of triplets were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and 54% had a major morbidity (retinopathy of the newborn, necrotising enterocolitis, ventilator support or intraventricular haemorrhage) .\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】It has been suggested that improved diets may lead to improved outcomes in multiple pregnancies. This is based on observations that a particular range of maternal weight gain is optimally associated with good fetal outcome . However, the converse is not necessarily true ‐ that outcome can be improved by boosting maternal weight gain through improved diet.\n\n【18】Dietary input consists of many different components that may be relevant to multiple pregnancy. These include quantity of calorific intake, the source of calories such as a fat or proteins, micronutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, thiamine, magnesium, calcium and zinc as well the inclusion of certain nutrients such as omega fats. The balance and amount of these components have the potential to impact on the health of the mother and fetuses.\n\n【19】Detailed dietary advice has been popular in the US. For example, Luke et al recommend a calorie intake of 4000 kcal for underweight mothers (body mass index (BMI) 19.8) with a total weight gain of 50 lbs to 62 lbs (23‐28 kgs); 3500 kcal for normal weight (BMI 19.8 to 26.0) with a weight gain of 40 lbs to 54 lbs (18‐25 kgs); 3250 kcal for overweight (BMI  26.1 to 29.0) 38 lbs to 47 lbs (17‐21 kgs) and 3000 kcal for obese mothers (BMI greater than 29.0) with a weight gain of 29 lbs to 38 lbs (13‐17 kgs) .\n\n【20】The Institute of Medicine in the US has produced guidelines recommending a weight gain of 37 lbs to 59 lbs (17‐28 kgs) for normal weight, 31 lbs to 50 lbs (14‐23 kgs) for overweight, and 25 lbs to 42 lbs (11‐19 kgs) for obese women .\n\n【21】Published work also discusses the importance of a high carbohydrate diet as it has been linked to unwanted weight gain, poor glycaemic control and poor fetal growth, whereas a diet consisting of 20% protein, 40% carbohydrate, and 40% fat was found to have better fetal growth .\n\n【22】Haematinic supplements such as folic acid and iron will not be considered in this review, as they are assessed elsewhere .\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】In multiple pregnancies, the metabolic rate of the mother is 10% greater than in women with singleton pregnancies , as a result of an increasing demand on the mother’s energy expenditure due to a larger placenta producing higher quantities of hormones, and two fetuses requiring a continuous nutrient supply for growth . As a result of the increased energy use, fasting glucose levels are lower with a resulting depletion of glycogen reserves. Fats are broken down as an alternative energy source .\n\n【25】The theoretical basis for recommending high calorie diets is to increase the provision nutrients to prevent the likelihood of poor fetal growth. Poor fetal growth may have a number of adverse consequences and can also be associated with preterm birth. A high calorie diet may also help maintain the mother's nutritional state, which otherwise may be depleted by the needs of the babies, resulting in impaired maternal sense of well being. A retrospective study has shown that women with normal weights at the start of twin pregnancies are more likely to have larger neonates and less likely to deliver preterm if their weight gain during pregnancy met US Institute of Medicine recommendations .\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】Some recommended diets for women with multiple pregnancies have calorific contents similar or greater than those for frontline troops. As some women with multiple pregnancies are more sedentary than they would be when not pregnant, these diets have the potential to be associated with substantial weight gain. Excess weight gain is associated with increased complications in labour and higher rates of caesarean births, gestational diabetes, pre‐eclampsia and anaesthesia related risks . Obese mothers have higher rates of fetal macrosomia, as well as increased chance of infection post surgery. By advocating a high calorie diet and a high weight gain it is important to consider the psychological impact this might have on the mother as well as future implications for her health. The mother will then have to face the difficulty of losing her extra weight postpartum, as obesity is linked to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and thromboembolism . It therefore needs to be established whether special diets do lead to improved outcomes for the babies and whether these cause unwanted weight gain in the mother.\n\n【28】It is also important to consider the financial implications, as a high calorie diet may be expensive.\n\n【29】Objectives\n----------\n\n【30】To assess the effects of special diets, or dietary advice, on the outcome of multiple pregnancies.\n\n【31】Methods\n-------\n\n【32】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【33】#### Types of studies\n\n【34】We will include randomised controlled trials; 'quasi‐random' studies, and cluster‐randomised trials.

Antiepileptic drugs may reduce aggression by acting on the central nervous system to reduce neuronal hyper‐excitability associated with aggression.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs in reducing aggression and associated impulsivity.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT) and ClinicalTrials.gov to April 2009. We also searched Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials on aggression, National Research Record and handsearched for studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Prospective, placebo‐controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs taken regularly by individuals with recurrent aggression to reduce the frequency or intensity of aggressive outbursts.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Three authors independently selected studies and two authors independently extracted data. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs), with odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Fourteen studies with data from 672 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five different antiepileptic drugs were examined. Sodium valproate/divalproex was superior to placebo for outpatient men with recurrent impulsive aggression, for impulsively aggressive adults with cluster B personality disorders, and for youths with conduct disorder, but not for children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder. Carbamazepine was superior to placebo in reducing acts of self‐directed aggression in women with borderline personality disorder, but not in children with conduct disorder. Oxcarbazepine was superior to placebo for verbal aggression and aggression against objects in adult outpatients. Phenytoin was superior to placebo on the frequency of aggressive acts in male prisoners and in outpatient men including those with personality disorder, but not on the frequency of 'behavioral incidents' in delinquent boys.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The authors consider that the body of evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to allow any firm conclusion to be drawn about the use of antiepileptic medication in the treatment of aggression and associated impulsivity. Four antiepileptics (valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) were effective, compared to placebo, in reducing aggression in at least one study, although for three drugs (valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin) at least one other study showed no statistically significant difference between treatment and control conditions. Side effects were more commonly noted for the intervention group although adverse effects were not well reported. Absence of information does not necessarily mean that the treatment is safe, nor that the potential gains from the medication necessarily balance the risk of an adverse event occurring. Further research is needed.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Aggressive Behavior\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Antiepileptics\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Aggressive Behavior\n*   Impulsive Behaviour\n*   Hostility\n*   Feeling Angry\n*   Non-compliant Behavior\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Antiepileptic drugs for treating recurrent aggression\n\n【24】Various medicines, which are collectively termed 'antiepileptic drugs', have been used to treat persistent aggression. This review systematically examines the evidence supporting this practice. From the evidence available, we were unable to draw any firm conclusion about using these medicines to treat aggression. Four antiepileptic drugs (valproate/divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and phenytoin) helped to reduce aggression in at least one study. However, for three of these drugs (valproate, carbamazepine and phenytoin) we found at least one other study where there was no significant improvement. Further research is needed to clarify which antiepileptic drugs are effective for whom. Such research is best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials. Such trials need to take account of the type of aggression displayed, the severity of the aggression, and any other disorders experienced by the participants.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Certain antibiotics, particularly the aminoglycosides, have higher toxicity compared to the others. We would aim to elucidate and compare the various adverse events relating to the regimens used.\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Secondary peritonitis, which is defined as inflammation of the peritoneum secondary to perforation of a hollow viscus or transmural necrosis of gastrointestinal tract, is associated with a high mortality rate . To serve as an example, patients with large bowel perforation have mortality rates varying from 20% to 60% . These severe abdominal infections are accompanied by a high level of sepsis, endotoxin production and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which often results in multiple organ failure .\n\n【8】Surgical eradication of the infectious focus (source control) is the most important prerequisite for a successful treatment . Timely surgical intervention aims to eliminate the source of contamination, reduce the microbial inoculum and prevent the development of persistent sepsis .\n\n【9】Judicious use of appropriate antibiotics in peritonitis serves as an adjunctive treatment to surgical intervention . Antibiotic therapy was first introduced in the 1960s, however mortality did not improve until better understanding of the pathophysiology of these infections, screening techniques, intensive care and resuscitation, and use of appropriate antimicrobial drugs were developed in the 1990s . Even the best antimicrobial agent, however, has little efficacy if used without an effort to gain adequate source control .\n\n【10】The polymicrobial nature of the gastrointestinal tract demands use of antibiotics which cover aerobic, facultative anaerobic enterobacteriaceae and anaerobic organisms, particularly Bacteroides fragilis . The current practice of early empirical administration of antibiotics targeted against these bacteria is well established . These have been accomplished by a number of regimens either in single or combinations of antimicrobials. There is, however, no strong evidence to identify one regimen as being more efficacious to another and at the same time has the least acceptable side‐effects. Recent reviews on antibiotics and intra‐abdominal infections  have further highlighted these problems and the inadequacies where current evidence is lacking.  \n\n【11】Treatment failure is often associated with the cause and extent of the initial infection as well as the response of the host to that infection. Useful tools for identifying patients at increased risk of adverse outcome following the insult are the APACHE II  and POSSUM severity scoring system . Identifying these high risk patients will often guide the clinician towards a more aggressive approach and use of broader spectrum antimicrobial regimens. However, the latter may put this particular group of patients at an increased risk of toxicity from these agents.\n\n【12】The course of the disease is thus influenced by the physiological reserve of the patient, perioperative optimisation, the severity of the underlying pathology, success of the operation and subsequent management and complications. These factors generate controversy concerning the optimal antibiotic therapy.\n\n【13】There have been a vast expansion and development in antibiotic regimens over the last decade, many of which are costly. This review is therefore strategically timed and will aim to scrutinise the clinical cost‐effectiveness and toxicity of the regimens and provide the evidence required for guiding practitioners in treating secondary peritonitis with systemic parenteral antibiotics.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】1\\. The primary aim of this review will be to assess the adequacy of the antibiotic regimens in eradicating initial sepsis and the need for subsequent interventions to eradicate peritoneal sepsis.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To study the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial (chemo)embolisation compared with other nonsurgical ablation methods in patients with liver metastases.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are the two most common malignant tumours to affect the liver . Primary liver tumours arise from malignant cells within the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma represents the most common form of primary liver cancer . Metastatic liver disease is more common than primary liver cancer and develops when malignant cells migrate from other organs to the liver .\n\n【7】The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease . More than half of the patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications . The most common primary sites for liver metastases are lung, breast, colon and rectum, and uterus. On pre‐operative imaging, liver metastases are found in 35% of patients with colorectal cancer, and 8% to 30% of other patients will subsequently be found to have liver involvement. Almost half of patients dying from stomach, pancreatic, or breast cancer are found to have liver metastases at autopsy, while in patients with endometrial cancer they occur in about 40% of patients . Colorectal carcinoma is the third leading cancer in the United States and the third in cancer‐related deaths. Approximately 142,570 new patients with large bowel cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, of which 102,900 have colon and the remainder rectal cancers. Annually, approximately 51,370 Americans die of colorectal cancer, accounting for approximately 9% of all cancer deaths . Globally, the age‐adjusted annual incidence rate for colorectal cancer is 17.2 per 100,000 . The highest annual incidence is observed in North America (age adjusted, 30.1 per 100,000), Australia and New Zealand (age adjusted, 39.0), northern Europe (age adjusted, 30.5), and western Europe (age adjusted, 33.1). Lower annual incidences are observed in Africa (age adjusted, 5.9) and Asia (age adjusted, 12.9). Globally, the annual age‐adjusted mortality for colorectal cancer is 8.2 per 100,000, and it is higher in the countries with a higher incidence and lower in the countries with a lower incidence. In the United States, five‐year survival after the diagnosis of colorectal cancer is 66.6% . In all developed countries analysed together, the estimated five‐year survival is 55%  with the lowest survival reported for Eastern Europe (35% male and 36% female). In developing countries analysed together, it is 39%  with the lowest rate reported for Sub‐Saharan Africa (13% for males and 14% for females). Approximately 50% of colorectal cancer patients will develop a recurrence within five years of initial diagnosis, with the liver being the most common site for metastatic disease . For the other common primary sites for liver metastases, the age‐standardised incidence and mortality rates are as follows: lung cancer 23.0 and 19.4 per 100,000 people of both sexes respectively, stomach 14.1 and 10.3 per 100,000 people of both sexes, pancreas 3.9 and 3.7 per 100,000 people of both sexes, breast 39.0 and 12.5 per 100,000 women, and corpus uteri 8.2 and 2.0 per 100,000 women . In the United States, five‐year survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer is 16.4%, stomach 26.7%, pancreas 5.7%, breast cancer 89.9%, and corpus uteri cancer 84.1% . In all developed countries analysed together, the estimated annual survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer is 13% in men and 20% in women; the estimated annual survival for stomach cancer is 35% in men and 31% in women; for breast cancer it is 75%; and for cancer of the corpus uteri it is 82% . In all developing countries analysed together, the estimated survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer is 12% in men and women, for stomach cancer it is 21% in men and 20% in women, for breast cancer it is 57%, and for cancer of the corpus uteri it is 67% .\n\n【8】For many patients, the progressive involvement of the liver is the primary determinant of long‐term survival. Surgical resection is the only curative option for patients with malignant liver neoplasm, with median survival times of 21 to 46 months or five‐year survival rates of 20% to 58% . However, only 20% of patients with hepatic tumours are candidates for resection . Other options for patients with unresectable liver metastases include chemotherapy delivered intra‐arterially (5‐fluorouracil), called 'regional chemotherapy'; systemic chemotherapy (5‐fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, capecitabine); or monoclonal antibodies (such as bevacizumab or cetuximab). Additional methods include local tumour ablative techniques, transarterial (chemo)embolisation, percutaneous ethanol injection, microwave coagulation, laser‐induced thermotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgical ablation .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Chemoembolisation is defined as a selective administration of chemotherapy usually combined with embolisation of the vascular supply to the tumour . This treatment results in selective ischaemic and cytotoxic effects on liver metastases . Vascular occlusive agents can be used either temporary, like microspheres, degradable starch microspheres, collagen and gelatine sponge, or permanent, like polyvinyl alcohol . Embolisation can also be performed without cytotoxic agent (bland embolisation).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】(Chemo)embolisation is based on the concept that the blood supply to hepatic tumours originates predominantly from the hepatic artery, while 75% of the normal liver parenchyma is supplied by the portal vein . It is well established that both primary and secondary liver tumours derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery . Therefore, embolisation of the hepatic artery can lead to selective necrosis of the liver tumour while it leaves normal parenchyma virtually unaffected . This ischaemic damage increases vascular permeability and promotes penetration of the cytotoxic drug into the tumour . However, ligation of the hepatic artery increases the portal vein blood supply to liver metastases and this may cause poor results for hepatic artery ligation and perfusion alone . The selective administration of the drugs into the affected part of the liver may prevent extensive liver parenchymal damage. Portal vein thrombosis, high grade liver dysfunction, and hepatorenal syndrome are common contraindications for transarterial embolisation or transarterial chemoembolisation. In hepatocellular carcinoma, transarterial embolisation or transarterial chemoembolisation may reduce tumour growth, but randomised trials and meta‐analyses assessing survival have found no significant effect on mortality .\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】In patients with liver metastases, local or regional treatment methods can provide local control but it is uncertain what the long‐term outcomes are of some of these therapies. Systematic reviews may help to establish the effectiveness and the trade off between the benefits and harms associated with different nonsurgical ablation methods for the treatment of all forms of malignant liver tumours (primary and metastatic). Reviews and meta‐analyses published so far focus mostly on primary liver tumours or colorectal cancer liver metastases and include studies only up to April 2006 . The methods used in these publications lack clarity on how the risk of systematic errors (bias) and the risks of random errors (play of chance) have been addressed . We assessed transarterial chemoembolisation versus no intervention or placebo in another review . There is no Cochrane review comparing transarterial (chemo)embolisation with other nonsurgical ablation methods in people with liver metastases from any sources. Therefore, a new review with updated searches and dealing with all types of malignant liver metastases is warranted.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To study the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial (chemo)embolisation compared with other nonsurgical ablation methods in patients with liver metastases.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】We will include all randomised clinical trials assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial (chemo)embolisation and its comparators, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding. Quasi‐randomised and other controlled studies that come up in the search will be considered only for the reporting of data on harm.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Patients with liver metastases regardless of the location of the primary tumour. The trials will be grouped by the location of the primary cancer.\n\n【23】#### Types of interventions\n\n【24】Transarterial (chemo)embolisation compared with other nonsurgical ablation methods. Co‐interventions will be allowed if they are provided equally to the experimental and control groups of the individual randomised trials.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objectives are to assess the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines for the treatment of patients with IBD.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The term 'Inflammatory bowel disease' (IBD) describes a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the colon and small intestine . The most common conditions are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) . Although CD and UC differ, they may present with similar symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and weight loss . Extraintestinal symptoms, such as anaemia and conditions due to malnutrition, are highly prevalent in patients suffering from IBD . A diagnosis of UC or CD is based on the defining symptoms (rectal bleeding, diarrhoea, abdominal pain), and verified by colonoscopy and histopathology. Colonoscopy and the biopsy of pathological lesions are required to confirm the presence of inflammation in the intestine. The existence of inflammatory markers in patients' stool and blood samples also aid diagnosis and follow‐up.\n\n【7】Despite considerable research effort, the etiology and pathophysiology of both UC and CD remain largely unknown . Both conditions appear to be caused by multifactorial processes, relating to individuals' genetic predisposition, issues of immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and altered microbial flora .\n\n【8】In addition to physical symptoms, IBD can cause psychological and social distress and reduces quality of life . Psychological factors have also been shown to influence the course of these diseases emphasizing the need for a multimodal therapy approach to treatment .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Herbal medicine refers to the use of plants, plant components or preparations derived from them to cure or alleviate diseases, pathological conditions or functions of the body or mind . Herbal medicine is considered part of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as defined by the National Health Institute . From this perspective, isolated active ingredients or synthetic derivatives from plants, are not considered to constitute herbal medicine . Herbal medicines can take different forms, including the use of powders, teas, tablets, capsules, suppositories, extracts, lotions, fresh or dried plants .\n\n【11】Herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years ; knowledge about the effects of medicinal plants having been passed down across the ages . The use of herbal medicine is also commonplace, both in traditional medicine and in home remedies. Most consumers assume that herbal medicine is safe , natural and gentle; with the possibility of adverse effects being largely neglected . Adverse effects may occur, with direct toxic effects from biologically active constituents, or by contaminants and interactions between herbal and traditional medications .\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】The intervention consists of a variety of herbal preparations, which may act through different mechanisms. Plants' cellular constituents include proteins, lipids or saccharides, intermediary metabolites such as organic acids and secondary cellular constituents such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannins and essential oils . Whilst the exact composition of ingredients in particular herbal drugs remains unclear the secondary cellular constituents are generally assumed to be pharmacologically relevant . Such constituents may have anti‐inflammatory, antiphlogistic or astringent properties, as well as exerting mucosal protective effects or even influencing fecal microflora. Most herbal medicines, however, act via the combination and interaction of all of their active ingredients .\n\n【14】Herbal medications may also have psychological effects. Patients who use CAM therapies often report that they help them to gain a feeling of control over their diseases and treatments ; perhaps thereby reducing their emotional distress and discomfort. A placebo effect may also contribute to CAM therapies' effectiveness.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】The prevalence of CAM use in IBD patients ranges from 21 to 60% . Although a similar range of CAM therapies are used internationally, the use of single treatments differs widely between countries and regions . Probiotics and fish oils are commonly used, with herbal medicines being used by 5 to 58% of IBD patients . Most patients combine CAM with conventional medicine, rather than using it as an alternative treatment option. Patients prior beliefs and expectations are therefore likely to influence whether treatment effects are attributed to conventional or CAM treatment . This may help to explain why surveys show that most patients treated with CAM do not report the amelioration of their symptoms .\n\n【17】IBD patients' reasons for using CAM therapies are manifold. Many patients report serious adverse effects from conventional treatments . Some patients seek to reduce their use of steroid medications . Other patients see conventional therapies as ineffective , or they are searching for an optimum treatment . Although most patients continue to use conventional medicine, once they start CAM therapy , few appear to advise their treating physician of this fact , potentially causing adverse effects from interactions with prescription drugs.\n\n【18】While reviews and meta‐analyses have been undertaken for probiotics , and fish‐oils , high quality scientific evidence supporting the use of herbal medicine is lacking . A systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines for the treatment of IBD is vital to provide reliable data to inform decision making by patients, physicians and CAM providers.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】The primary objectives are to assess the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines for the treatment of patients with IBD.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomised controlled trials examining the effects of herbal medicines on IBD will be eligible for inclusion. Parallel group, crossover trials, and dose‐finding studies will be considered for inclusion. Full text publications and abstract publications will be eligible for inclusion if sufficient information about study design, participants, interventions used and outcomes are reported.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Trials that include participants of both genders and any age, with active or quiescent UC or CD or both will be included. Data for patients with CD or UC will be analysed separately. No restriction on the diagnostic procedures or settings used in the studies will be applied. Studies that include participants with other disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, will be excluded.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】Any form of herbal medicine used for the management of IBD or IBD‐related complaints, will be included, with the exception of traditional Chinese medicine herbal preparations which are covered by a Cochrane review . For the purpose of this review, aroma therapy and homeopathy (mother tinctures only) preparations will be regarded as herbal medicines. Preparations of synthetic origin or those consisting only of plant derivatives will be excluded . Special emphasis will be paid to the quality of the herbal medicines used, and we will differentiate between studies that use herbal medicinal products or botanicals. In the studies using herbal medicinal products, the source of the therapeutic agents will be determined. Preparations produced in the European Union, Switzerland and Australia, will be differentiated from those produced elsewhere, as the former have high standards of quality regulation for the manufacture of herbal medicinal products, which the latter may not.\n\n【29】No restrictions will be applied regarding control groups. Studies with placebo or no therapy controls, or any active control therapy will be eligible for inclusion as comparators. The use of concomitant medication or interventions will be allowed, if studies used them in both groups.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【32】The primary outcomes will be clinical remission or relapse (dichotomous outcomes) as defined by the included studiesClinical remission could be defined by several different clinical indices including the Colitis Activity Index (CAI score of ≤ 4), the Ulcerative Colitis ‐ Disease Activity Index (UC‐DAI score of ≤ 2), the Rachmilewitz index (score of ≤ 4), the Mayo score (score of ≤ 2), a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI score of < 150), or a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI score of < 10 points).\n\n【33】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【34】Secondary outcomes will include the following.\n\n【35】*   Clinical response or improvement (dichotomous outcomes) as defined by the included studies. Clinical improvement could be defined by several different clinical indices. For example, a decrease of > 70 points in the CDAI score from baseline, or a decrease of 30% or 3 points on the Mayo score.\n\n【36】*   Clinical disease activity (continuous outcomes) as measured by various clinical indices. For example, the CDAI, PCDAI, the CAI, Mayo score, or Harry‐Bradshaw Index or any other validated instrument.\n\n【37】*   Endoscopic remission or improvement as defined by the included studies. Endoscopic remission or improvement could be defined by several different endoscopic indices. For example the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) and Simple Endoscopic Scale for Crohn’s Disease (SES‐CD) or the Rachmilewitz score or endoscopic index (EI), and endoscopic activity index (EAI) for patients with UC.\n\n【38】*   Endoscopic relapse as defined by the included studies.\n\n【39】*   Health‐related quality of life as measured by any validated generic or disease‐specific self‐report scale such as the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF‐36), Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF‐12), the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ‐5D).\n\n【40】*   Safety‐related findings, for example reports of adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or any abnormal laboratory findings.\n\n【41】Where more than one measure is used for an outcome in a reviewed study standard instruments will be preferred over novel ones and multi‐item instruments over single‐item ones.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the outcomes related to the choice of anaesthesia (TIVA versus Inhalational anaesthesia) for adult patients undergoing transabdominal robotic assisted gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The introduction of robotic transabdominal surgery has resulted in a need for a re‐evaluation of the most suitable form of anaesthesia. The objective is to minimize the perioperative risk and discomfort for patients during surgery. Anaesthesia for patients undergoing robotic surgery is different from anaesthesia for patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery and new anaesthetic concerns accompany robotic surgery. These concerns include the physiological effects of fixed extreme positioning of the patient during a long period of time, pneumoperitoneum, restricted access to the patient during surgery and the need for carefully monitored relaxation of the patient. Regardless of the method of surgery it is universal that the three anaesthetic qualities, which include sleep, freedom from pain and muscle relaxation, can be reached by two methods:\n\n【7】1.  total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) in which the patient receives all anaesthetic drugs through an intravenous line; or\n\n【8】2.  inhalational anaesthesia, in which one of the drugs is delivered through the lungs.\n\n【9】This review addresses the advantages and disadvantages of TIVA compared to inhalational anaesthesia in transabdominal robotic surgery.\n\n【10】Anaesthetists advocating for TIVA might highlight the lower risks of both postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pollution of the operating room and environment compared to anaesthesia gas . However, those advocating for inhalational anaesthesia might focus on easier monitoring and regulation of the delivered anaesthesia, faster emergence from the anaesthesia and, although controversial in non‐cardiac surgery, the proposed cardioprotective effect of inhalational anaesthesia . It has to be considered how these circumstances influence patients in the context of transabdominal robotic surgery.\n\n【11】Two issues in transabdominal surgery that might influence the outcome of the anaesthesia are positioning and pneumoperitoneum. Extreme positioning, for example steep Trendelenburg (in lower abdominal surgery) or steep anti‐Trendelenburg (in upper abdominal surgery), and insufflation of carbon dioxide in the abdominal cavity affect the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems as well as the intracerebral pressure. At the same time, the patient’s normal compensatory mechanisms are blunted by the anaesthesia. Absorption of carbon dioxide over the abdominal tissue membranes, as well as the upwards pressure on the diaphragm and compromised venous return, is a constant challenge to the patient's respiratory and circulatory systems. These physiological disturbances are tolerated differently by patients according to their age, body mass index (BMI), medications and comorbidity.\n\n【12】The restricted access to the patient during often lengthy surgery demands careful preparation of the intravenous lines and the monitoring equipment as well as a focus on avoiding nerve damage and ocular injuries .\n\n【13】The refinement of surgical conditions in transabdominal robotic surgery with reduced bleeding and the potential advantages of lower rates of surgical trauma due to minor incisions makes it possible to consider surgery for a broader patient population. Some of the patients subjected to robotic surgery may have been considered inoperable by traditional operating techniques, especially the growing patient population with a very high BMI . This additional aspect of change in patient selection has to be considered when choosing the type of anaesthesia.\n\n【14】Robotic surgery is increasingly used in the treatment of cancer in gynaecology , in urology  and in gastrointestinal oncology .\n\n【15】Anaesthesia for robotic surgery in the treatment of cancer involves another aspect of the choice of aesthesic, namely a potential different effect of inhalational agents and TIVA on the immune system thereby influencing the recurrence of cancer .\n\n【16】The use of robotic surgery is expanding rapidly in the developed world. At present there are two manufacturers of robotic surgical systems on the market . One is the Zeus Surgical System (Computer Motion) and the other is the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical). The latter manufacture claims that 2900 da Vinci robots are located throughout the world and that more than half a million robotic assisted surgeries were performed in 2013. The high cost and increasing volume of robotic assisted surgeries has implications for public health  as health services have limited budgets and there is limited evidence in terms of large multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to determine which patients may benefit from robotic surgery as opposed to conventional surgery . Outcomes such as shorter length of stay, less postoperative pain, fewer episodes of PONV, faster recovery and return to habitual functioning after anaesthesia and surgery are of great importance to public health.\n\n【17】This review compares two different anaesthesia techniques for transabdominal robotic surgery and focuses on postoperative patient comfort (pain, PONV, perioperative cardiovascular and respiratory conditions) and patient safety.\n\n【18】### Description of the intervention\n\n【19】For maintenance of anaesthesia it is possible to use either TIVA or a halogenated inhalational agent in combination with intravenous drugs for maintaining a painless operation. The drugs used for maintaining a painless operation are mainly opioid‐based but might also be a secondary analgesic or a regional anaesthetic administered as a central nervous blockade .\n\n【20】This review will focus on the applicability of anaesthesia for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery with an intravenous infusion of a hypnotic and a pain killing agent compared to a halogenated inhalational agent together with an analgesic. We will not consider the level of relaxation, combination with regional anaesthesia or local infiltration in this review. Instead, we will focus on different aspects of delivering these two types of anaesthesia regimens and include measures of pain, PONV, cardiovascular and pulmonary impact, effects on cerebral autoregulation, cognitive function, practical aspects, controllability as well as environmental effects.\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】The difference between the two anaesthesia types that we plan to study resides in their physiological properties as well as the practical delivery of the drugs. While delivery of anaesthesia gas is easily monitored via the ventilator, the pumps and intravenous lines associated with TIVA are potentially exposed to error through accidental disconnection. It is also important to consider the cardiovascular stability with the drugs being used during anaesthesia for transabdominal robotic surgery, where patients are in unphysiologic positions such as the steep head‐down (Trendelenburg) or steep head‐up (anti‐Trendelenburg) position. Traditionally, anaesthesia gas is considered to be easier to control than TIVA‐based anaesthesia in patients with cardiovascular morbidity  and possibly to have cardioprotective properties during cardiac surgery , although this might be controversial for non‐cardiac surgery . For obese patients undergoing surgery such as knee arthroscopy, transurethral resection of the prostate, minor breast or hand surgery, inhalational anaesthetics (desflurane) may have a safer profile than propofol with regards to postoperative pulmonary function. This has been measured by surrogate outcomes such as oxyhaemoglobin saturation and lung function . The combination of extreme positioning together with pneumoperitoneum during most transabdominal robotic procedures are factors that are known to affect intracerebral pressure . For this reason, it is important that the anaesthesia for this type of surgery preserves the cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms in order to prevent cerebral events and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Comparative studies of the use of sevoflurane versus propofol‐remifentanil for spinal or maxillo‐facial surgery have indicated that propofol preserves cerebral autoregulation whereas this is not the case when sevoflurane is used in higher concentrations . The cerebral vascular responsiveness to carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2 </sub> ) is impaired during sevoflurane anaesthesia but not during anaesthesia with propofol‐remifentanil .\n\n【23】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【24】Robot assisted techniques are increasingly used for a wide variety of surgical specialties in the developed world . It is imperative that the outcomes of the anaesthesia for transabdominal robotic surgery are known. The advantages and disadvantages must be clear for both clinicians and patients so that the most appropriate anaesthesia technique can be chosen. At present we know of isolated RCTs  which address this clinical question in specialized areas of the field (either gynaecology, urology or gastroenterology). We expect this body of evidence to expand within the next few years as there are several ongoing trials registered a .\n\n【25】Objectives\n----------\n\n【26】To assess the outcomes related to the choice of anaesthesia (TIVA versus Inhalational anaesthesia) for adult patients undergoing transabdominal robotic assisted gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery.\n\n【27】Methods\n-------\n\n【28】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【29】#### Types of studies\n\n【30】We will include RCTs conducted in any clinical or research setting where the management of anaesthesia in transabdominal robotic surgery is the intervention.\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】We will include adult patients aged 18 years and older, of both genders and treated with transabdominal robotic assisted gynaecological, urological or gastroenterological surgery.\n\n【33】#### Types of interventions\n\n【34】We will include the following interventions during transabdominal robotic assisted surgery.\n\n【35】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Primary objective\n\n【3】*   To determine the effectiveness of interventions implemented through sporting organisations to promote physical activity, healthy diet, reductions in alcohol consumption or tobacco use.\n\n【4】The primary objective focuses on four health behaviours among the most relevant for morbidity and mortality worldwide .\n\n【5】Secondary objectives\n\n【6】*   To determine the effectiveness of interventions in the setting of sporting organisations, or using a sporting organisation as a means of access to promote other healthy behaviours, health knowledge, or health outcomes.\n\n【7】*   To determine whether effects are different based on the characteristics of the interventions including target population, geographical location, type of sports, type, duration, context and implementation of intervention, and timing of outcome measurement.\n\n【8】*   To assess adverse events or unintended effects related to included interventions.\n\n【9】--------------\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】### Description of the condition\n\n【12】Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases or malignancies, are responsible for about two‐thirds of mortality worldwide, with the majority of deaths occurring in low‐ and middle‐income countries, where deaths due to chronic diseases are expected to increase because of population growth, improved longevity and urbanisation . In addition, chronic diseases are an important cause of poor health and disability, with diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being among the ten leading causes of disability . Besides, there is an important economic burden associated with chronic diseases, and related costs are expected to rise .\n\n【13】There is an important need to prevent, or at least delay, the development of chronic diseases, many of which are influenced by modifiable risk factors. These risk factors can be the target of health promotion interventions. Important behavioural risk factors associated with chronic diseases are physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and unhealthy diet . Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and some cancers. It is estimated that almost one‐third of the global population does not meet the minimum amount of recommended physical activity . Tobacco use is a well‐established risk factor for lung diseases, and also a leading risk factor for death in high‐income countries . Although the prevalence of tobacco use has been decreasing in high‐income countries, it is increasing in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Consequently, the global burden of disease from tobacco use is likely to increase further . Nearly 6% of all deaths worldwide are caused by alcohol consumption which varies widely across countries and population groups due to differences in culture or sociodemographic determinants . Finally, unhealthy diets increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and associated health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes .\n\n【14】Often, individuals have more than one of these behavioural risk factors. For example, smokers are more likely to consume alcohol than non‐smokers and physically inactive individuals often consume less fruits and vegetables than those who are active . Each additional risk factor may increase the risk of death, especially due to cardiovascular diseases . Conversely, a particular type of healthy behaviour may be associated with additional healthy behaviour of another type, and thus further favour good health. For example, physically active individuals are less likely to smoke or use illicit drugs .\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】This systematic review will focus on interventions promoting one or several healthy behaviours, in particular, those addressing physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, tobacco use, or alcohol consumption.\n\n【17】Since the mid‐1980s, the environment and societal context have become increasingly important in health‐promoting activities . In 1986, the Ottawa Charter stated that “health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love”. This emphasised the importance of the so‐called “settings approach” in health promotion . In this model, the focus is on a setting's potential to promote health in everyday life. A healthy setting is seen as part of a dynamic system that belongs to, and is influenced by, other settings. In this review, we aim to evaluate interventions that are conducted in the setting of sporting organisations. These may be very diverse and range from very small units (such as sports clubs in a community) to larger organisations that span over many communities or countries, such as national or international sport associations. The review will comprise interventions in both professional and amateur sporting organisations with a non‐profit or for‐profit character. They have in common, the provision of opportunities for competition and sports practice, while some can also be considered social organisations, promoting social welfare and health .\n\n【18】The intervention which is initiated by or occurs within a sporting organisation may consist of any programme, activity or policy that aims to promote healthy behaviour, or improve health outcomes. It may also use the image of a sporting organisation (or of one of its members) to convey a health message. Interventions may include the implementation of policies or initiatives to promote responsible consumption of alcohol during sports events. It may also consist of an intervention to increase the awareness of coaches on fair‐play issues or educational sessions for promoting a healthy diet among members of a sporting organisation.\n\n【19】The included interventions target individuals that come in contact with sporting organisations in different ways, e.g. their active or passive members, but also their staff (e.g. coaches) or their supporters . Further, the intervention may use the resources of the setting, in which case it is mainly used as a means to reach a specific target group. For example, this may be the case if the celebrity of a sports club or an individual athlete is used as a role model to promote healthy behaviour . The intervention could further consist of delivering information during sports events to make people aware of a particular health issue or a healthy behaviour . Similarly, commercial companies make use of sports settings to reach consumers and successfully promote products such as food and beverages when they sponsor national or regional sporting organisations . Furthermore, the included intervention may also target the setting itself, for example, a smoking ban in sports stadia.\n\n【20】### How the intervention might work\n\n【21】Sporting organisations are a setting that interacts with other settings, such as residential communities and the natural environment. Interventions delivered in sporting organisations consequently influence health at different levels by affecting individuals, families or communities. They allow for interactions to occur between individuals, groups and settings . A socioecological approach of health promotion highlights the assets of an intervention within a sporting organisation. Healthy behaviour of individuals is influenced by intra‐ and interpersonal factors, as well as systems (e.g. organisational settings, communities, environment, policies) which interact with each other . In sporting organisations, there is infrastructure available to practice sports, and their primary aim is the promotion of a sports activity, which is itself a healthy behaviour. However, it should be noted that participation in sports has also been associated with unhealthy behaviour, such as a higher risk of hazardous alcohol consumption . Further, sporting games are settings in which heavy drinking is common among people attending these events, for example, as supporters .\n\n【22】_Logic model: interventions implemented through sporting organisations for promoting healthy behaviour_\n\n【23】Besides providing these interactions on different levels, many sporting organisations allow access to a larger part of the population. In many countries, practicing sports within a sporting organisation has a long tradition, and is a popular leisure activity. A survey of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) from 2006 reported that 270 million people or 4% of the world’s population was playing soccer under the umbrella of an association . In a population survey conducted in Australia, 27.2% of the participants were actively involved in organised sports . Similar participation rates in sports clubs have been described among the English (22%) and Swiss population (25%) . These numbers show that an estimated one in four individuals is actively involved in a sporting organisation. The number of individuals passively involved in sports is likely to be higher. The proportion of children that can be reached in the setting of a sporting organisation seems to be even higher. In Australia, 63% of children were found to participate in at least one organised sport .\n\n【24】Globally, sports organisations have a potential for health promotion, though this may not always be in a comprehensive way . Limited resources from an umbrella organisation can limit the development and the implementation of healthy policies. On the other hand, good support through health agencies may promote their implementation . Across ten European countries, the implementation of healthy policies in sports stadia was found to be relatively low. This was explained by the conflicting interests of sponsors and health promotion activities . Furthermore, while policies were found to frequently focus on anti‐discrimination or fair‐play, topics such as the promotion of healthy food or beverages seem to be underrepresented .\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】In many countries, sporting organisations are considered a setting that is suitable to promote health and reduce the burden of chronic diseases in the population. Consequently, government agencies and other bodies are investing in sporting organisations, while assuming that this enhances health promotion and ultimately improves population health . However, there is currently no clear evidence on the effects of interventions implemented within sporting organisations to promote healthy behaviour and improve health outcomes.\n\n【27】In 2008, two Cochrane systematic reviews assessed the then available evidence on the effects of interventions implemented through sporting organisations on participation in sports , and healthy behaviour change . In either review, no controlled studies could be identified despite comprehensive searches. By way of updating these reviews to explore if new evidence has emerged, we consulted with the original authors and agreed to cover the two related topics in the one review. This recognises that sporting organisations and individuals involved in health promotion activities may be interested in the potential for a health promotion role of sporting organisations as a setting as well as their ability to increase participation in sport and its associated activities.\n\n【28】Results of this review will be of particular interest to active members and decision‐makers in sporting organisations. The review will explore the potential impact of interventions promoting health in their setting and may guide future investment. Its results will also be of interest to other individuals or organisations involved in health‐promoting activities in alternative settings, such as health policy‐makers or public health practitioners.\n\n【29】Objectives\n----------\n\n【30】### Primary objective\n\n【31】*   To determine the effectiveness of interventions implemented through sporting organisations to promote physical activity, healthy diet, reductions in alcohol consumption or tobacco use.\n\n【32】The primary objective focuses on four health behaviours among the most relevant for morbidity and mortality worldwide .\n\n【33】### Secondary objectives\n\n【34】*   To determine the effectiveness of interventions in the setting of sporting organisations, or using a sporting organisation as a means of access to promote other healthy behaviours, health knowledge, or health outcomes.\n\n【35】*   To determine whether effects are different based on the characteristics of the interventions including target population, geographical location, type of sports, type, duration, context and implementation of intervention, and timing of outcome measurement.\n\n【36】*   To assess adverse events or unintended effects related to included interventions.\n\n【37】Methods\n-------\n\n【38】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【39】#### Types of studies\n\n【40】We will include:\n\n【41】*   randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs;\n\n【42】*   quasi‐randomised trials;\n\n【43】*   controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies; and\n\n【44】*   interrupted time series (ITS) studies and repeated measures studies (RMS).\n\n【45】We will only include CBA, ITS and RMS studies if they fulfil the criteria of the Cochrane Effective Practice of Care (EPOC) Group: CBA studies must have at least two intervention sites and two control sites, ITS and RMS studies must have a defined point in time when the intervention has been started, and at least three data points before and three after it's start .\n\n【46】We will exclude historical controlled studies.\n\n【47】#### Types of participants\n\n【48】Studies are eligible for inclusion irrespective of participants' age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity or nationality. For a study to be included, its participants must have been exposed to an intervention involving a sporting organisation, as either a setting, or a means of access to individuals. A study participant may have been an active or passive sports club member, coach, supporter, student, or any other individual.\n\n【49】#### Types of interventions\n\n【50】We will consider any intervention that is implemented within a sporting organisation or using a sporting organisation for access to a target population. Control interventions will be 'no intervention' or usual practice. Interventions may occur within a sporting organisation (e.g. implementation of a minimum age for participation in the Olympic Games) or outside the immediate boundaries of the setting (e.g. using the celebrity of a sports club or of an athlete to convey a health message) . For the purpose of this review, we will define sporting organisations as “social entities involved in the sport industry that are goal‐directed, with a consciously structured activity system and a relatively identifiable boundary“ . Sporting organisations may be local (e.g. local swimming club, gym), national (e.g. national football league), or international (e.g. International Association of Athletics Federations).\n\n【51】Eligible interventions include but are not limited to:\n\n【52】*   mass media campaigns;\n\n【53】*   information or educational sessions;\n\n【54】*   management or organisational change strategies;\n\n【55】*   policy changes, for example, targeting the sociocultural environment to encourage a specific group of people to participate;\n\n【56】*   changes to traditional or existing programmes, for example, club or association‐initiated rule modification programmes;\n\n【57】*   provision of activities beyond traditional or existing programmes, for example, 'Come and Try' initiatives, skill improvement programmes, volunteer encouragement programmes; and\n\n【58】*   interventions using role models defined as “an individual who is perceived as exemplary, or worthy of imitation or who inspires individuals or groups of people through personal contact and relationship” .\n\n【59】If feasible, we will group the interventions according to the target population as follows:\n\n【60】*   interventions targeting the population outside the boundaries of a sporting organisation (e.g. general population or a selected group);\n\n【61】*   interventions targeting members of a sporting organisation; and interventions targeting individuals in the setting of a sporting organisation that are not (yet) taking part.\n\n【62】We will exclude studies in which the individual effect of sporting organisations cannot be separated from the effect of other intervention components (e.g. multi‐component interventions), as well as studies implementing interventions across settings.\n\n【63】Further, we will exclude studies with interventions:\n\n【64】*   designed specifically for the treatment (or as therapy) for specific medical conditions (e.g. rehabilitation programmes);\n\n【65】*   designed specifically to increase paid active or paid non‐active participation;\n\n【66】*   surrounding sports injury prevention; and aiming to reduce drug use related to sports (i.e. anti‐doping interventions). Not excluded are policies or practices aiming to reduce alcohol consumption or tobacco use in the setting of sporting organisations.\n\n【67】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【68】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【69】Primary outcomes will be measures of physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use. We will consider any measures of physical activity, such as intensity or time spent, step counts, or the proportion of individuals meeting the minimum recommended amount of physical activity. These outcomes may be reported subjectively (e.g. self report in questionnaires, such as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) or objectively (e.g. as quantified by an accelerometer or direct observation). For alcohol consumption, we will include any measure, e.g. the number of units of alcohol consumed or the frequency of drinking alcohol. For tobacco use, we will include any measures of reduction or cessation of tobacco use, e.g. proportion of participants smoke‐free after a specified time period. For dietary outcomes, we will include measures of adherence to dietary advices (e.g. consumption of five servings of fruit and vegetables per day). We will exclude studies reporting mean dietary intake without any measure of adherence to dietary advice.\n\n【70】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【71】Secondary outcomes will be:\n\n【72】*   measures of other health behaviours, intention to change health behaviours, and health knowledge;\n\n【73】*   measures of the following health outcomes: weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) or another body composition measure, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, quality of life;\n\n【74】*   occurrence of adverse events or unintended effects related to the intervention (e.g. occurrence of intervention‐related injuries).\n\n【75】If data are available for different measures of a specified outcome we will prioritise objective measures over subjective measures.\n\n【76】We will also extract information on factors relating to the implementation of an intervention (e.g. involvement of stakeholders, pilot‐testing of interventions, completeness of implementation, interventions' reach and maintenance after the evaluation period has ended, any modification of initially planned interventions) as well as contextual factors (e.g. intervention conducted during Olympic Games).\n\n【77】Further we will extract the timing of outcome measurements. Outcomes will be grouped (if possible) in short‐term (<6 months after intervention has been completed) and long‐term outcomes (≥6 months after intervention has been completed).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness and safety of inosine to modify disease course and prognosis in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that primarily affects people aged from 20 years to 50 years . MS is the leading cause of non‐traumatic disability in young adults in many countries . An updated report by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation showed that the estimated number of people with MS worldwide increased from 2.1 million in 2008 to 2.3 million in 2013 . The global median prevalence of MS has increased from 30  to 33 per 100,000  . While MS is present in all regions of the world, its prevalence varies from 2.1 and 2.2 per 100,000 (Sub‐Saharan Africa and East Asia respectively) to 140 and 108 per 100,000 (North America and Europe respectively) . MS is two to three times more prevalent in women than men . MS imposes a huge economic burden on the healthcare system and society with an average annual cost of USD 41,133 (adjusted by purchasing power parity) per patient .\n\n【7】The aetiology of MS is not clear. The underlying causes include genetics and environmental factors such as infections . While locations of attacks can differ, few clinical features are disease‐specific. Major systems involved in MS include motor, sensory, visual and autonomic . There are four clinical courses of MS: relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS) (85%): secondary progressive MS (SPMS) (which evolves from an initial course of RRMS); primary progressive MS (PPMS) (10%); and progressive‐relapsing MS (PRSM) (5%) .\n\n【8】The prognosis of MS is variable, hard to predict and depends on the disease subtype, the individual's sex and age, and the severity of demyelinating lesions . In a population‐based series of 806 people with RRMS, the median time from disease onset to requiring aids for walking, bed bound status and death was roughly 15, 26 and 41 years respectively . After 25 years from onset, 80% of people with RRMS may convert to SPSM . Furthermore, people with MS have a statistically significant increase in mortality compared with the general population, with a reduction of life expectancy of between 7 years and 14 years .\n\n【9】At present, there is no cure for MS. The main aims of current treatments are to hasten recovery from acute attacks of MS, reduce the risk of relapse, and prevent the occurrence of disability. High dose corticosteroid treatment after acute attacks can hasten relapse recovery . However, there is insufficient evidence that corticosteroid treatment delays progression of long‐term disability or prevents new attacks in people with MS . Studies have shown that disease‐modifying therapies such as interferon beta can reduce the risk of relapse and delay disability progression . At present, there is no treatment available that can comprehensively halt disease progression or regenerate damaged nerves. Alternative MS therapies are needed to expand the current treatment repertoire.\n\n【10】The successful use of inosine has been reported to reduce magnetic resonance imaging activity and prevent disease progression in an uncontrolled clinical trial in participants with MS . A non‐randomised clinical trial including 64 MS participants showed that inosine can reduce relapse rates and delay progression of disease measured on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) . A randomised, double‐blind trial also showed that oral administration of inosine can decrease the number of gadolinium‐enhanced lesions and improve the disease measured on the EDSS . However, benefits of inosine for MS were not confirmed in subsequent studies .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Uric acid, the end product of purine metabolism in humans, is an antioxidant. It is a potent scavenger of peroxynitrite, which can cause a variety of potentially toxic chemical changes in tissue . Studies have shown that uric acid may have a protective effect against degenerative neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Treatment of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mice with uric acid has been reported to elicit strong, dose‐dependent therapeutic effects . Meta‐analyses have showed that serum uric acid levels were lower in people with MS than healthy people in control arms . Studies have also showed that serum uric acid levels were lower in people with clinically‐active MS compared to those whose MS was clinically inactive .\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Oral administration of uric acid does not increase serum uric acid levels because it is degraded in the gut. Oral administration of inosine to people with MS can increase uric acid levels both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid . As a precursor of uric acid, inosine is a low‐molecular weight molecule that participates in a wide variety of intracellular biochemical processes. Inosine confers anti‐inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of several pro‐inflammatory cytokines . A study demonstrated that inosine is a potent activator of axon outgrowth in the central nervous system . Inosine has also demonstrated protective effects on ischaemic brain damage and spinal cord injuries in rats . On the other hand, as a naturally occurring purine, inosine appears to be non toxic to humans, even when ingested at high doses .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】There have been no systematic reviews to date focusing on inosine for people with MS. A systematic review of the existing evidence is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of inosine for people with MS.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the effectiveness and safety of inosine to modify disease course and prognosis in people with multiple sclerosis.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】We will include all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication status or language. We will include data from the first phase of included cross‐over trials.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】People with a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) according to published criteria  regardless of age, sex, degree of disability, duration, type and course of the disease. All concomitant treatments will be accepted.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】We will evaluate trials independent of dosage, route of administration, frequency of administration and duration of treatment.\n\n【27】Comparisons include: inosine versus placebo or no intervention; inosine plus approved treatments (such as beta interferon) versus placebo or no intervention plus approved treatments.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】The outcome measures per se will not form part of the exclusion criteria for this review.\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】###### Benefit\n\n【32】1.

Relative risks were used to analyse complete response rate, treatment‐related mortality and adverse events. Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed quality of trials.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】A total of 790 records were screened. Five eligible trials (four published, one ongoing), were identified. These trials included only adult patients (16 to 60 years of age). Four trials with 2868 patients were included in the meta‐analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials from Germany, the HD2000 and GSM‐HD trials from Italy. All trials reported results for PFS and OS. PFS was statistically significantly longer for escalated BEACOPP: HR was 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.64, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%). There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the comparators: HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%). Three trials reported adverse events: the escalated BEACOPP regimens caused statistically significantly more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV (anaemia P < 0.00001, neutropenia P = 0.007, thrombocytopenia P < 0.00001), infections ) and occurrence of myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (P = 0.05). There were no differences between both regimens for secondary malignancies, treatment‐related mortality or infertility.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】This meta‐analysis showed that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable or advanced stage HL benefited from chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP regarding PFS, but there was no significant difference in OS. Longer follow‐up and the inclusion of the EORTC 20012 trial will lead to a more definitive answer with respect to OS.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Hodgkins Lymphoma\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Escalated BEACOPP\n*   Radiotherapy\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   ABVD\n*   Radiotherapy\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Hodgkins Lymphoma\n*   Acute Myelocytic Leukemia\n*   Adverse Drug Reaction\n*   Treatment Related Secondary Malignancy\n*   Myelodysplastic Syndrome\n*   Disease Progression\n*   Infertility\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Death\n*   Secondary Amenorrhea\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Comparison of the two international standards of chemotherapy for patients with early unfavourable or advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n【24】Hodgkin lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. It is one of the most common cancers in young adults, particularly in their third decade of life, but it occurs also in children and elderly people. Within the last fifty years it has become one of the most curable forms of cancer. To find the best treatment with the greatest efficacy and least toxicity is the most important challenge in treating Hodgkin lymphoma. There are two international standards for the treatment of early unfavourable or advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma: chemotherapy with escalated BEACOPP (bleomycin/etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone) regimen initiated by the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and chemotherapy with ABVD (doxorubicin/ bleomycin/ vinblastine/ dacarbazine) regimen, which is widely used because it has been proven to be effective, well tolerated and easy to administer. We aimed to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of both treatments by comparing the chance of survival (overall survival), the chance of recurrence of the tumour and the frequencies of adverse events after treatment in patients with early unfavourable stage or advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【25】We found five eligible trials but one was unpublished. These trials included only adult patients (16 to 60 years of age). We included 2868 patients in our review. The analysis shows a better chance of avoiding recurrence of the tumour in patients who received chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP. In those with early unfavourable disease, 22 patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 18 to 29) had to be treated to prevent one tumour recurring within 3.5 years; in patients with advanced disease, 7 patients (95% CI 6 to 10) had to be treated to prevent such an event within 10 years. Treatment with escalated BEACOPP caused a higher risk of adverse events such as anaemia (10 times higher) and thrombocytopenia (19 times higher). However, this did not lead to an increased treatment‐related mortality. In addition, there was an eight times higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in patients receiving escalated BEACOPP, but the total number of secondary malignancies did not differ statistically within both treatment groups. Differences regarding overall survival could not be shown, which might be caused by the short follow‐up time (less than five years) of three trials included. Since more than 70% of HL patients survived the first five years due to chemotherapy, the differentiation between regimens might needs more time to become apparent. Thus, a longer follow‐up and the inclusion of the recently closed EORTC 20012 trial will allow a more definitive answer with respect to OS.\n\n【26】Nevertheless, these results can only be extrapolated to adult patients (16 to 60 years of age) with early unfavourable or advanced staged HL. Older patients experience more severe treatment‐related toxicity and a higher mortality during treatment than younger patients, which leads to poorer survival outcome in the elderly. The randomised HD9elderly trial examined BEACOPP baseline compared to COPP/ABVD in patients older than 65 years and showed no statistically significant difference for overall survival (50% overall survival rate at five years in both arms), but an important higher rate of toxic deaths, 21% compared to 8%, after treatment with BEACOPP baseline. Therefore, treatment approaches for elderly patients are different from these for the adults ≤ 60 years and the results of this review are only relevant for adult patients younger than 60 years of age.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To compare azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating uncomplicated enteric fever.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Definition**  \nEnteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid fever) is a potentially fatal systemic infection caused by Gram‐negative bacteria. Typhoid fever is caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi ( _S_ . Typhi) and paratyphoid fever is caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Paratyphi ( _S_ . Paratyphi _) A_ , _B_ , or _C_ . These organisms cause disease specifically in humans. Paratyphoid fever is a far less serious infection with milder symptoms and causes fewer deaths , although it may occasionally become complicated .\n\n【6】**Epidemiology**  \nAn estimated 21.6 million new cases of typhoid fever with about 216,510 deaths occurred globally in 2000. Paratyphoid fever caused about 5.4 million illnesses in the same year . Most cases occur in the middle‐income and low‐income countries where sanitation is poor and water supply is inadequate . Endemic enteric fever is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast and Far East Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and the Mediterranean region . Incidence rates vary across areas. For instance, annual incidence rates of 198 per 100,000 have been reported in the Mekong valley region of Vietnam  and 980 per 100,000 in Delhi, India . In the United States, most infections are linked to international travels to countries where the disease is endemic. A total of 356 cases were reported in 2003 .\n\n【7】The peak incidence occurs in people between 5 and 19 years and young adults . However, in some areas, it is common among children less than five years old . There are several risk factors for the infection such as extremes of age, sickle cell anaemia, a lack of acid in gastric juice as seen in the elderly, and gastric surgery . The mortality rate is about 10% to 15% if untreated and is highest among children less than one year and the elderly .\n\n【8】**Pathogenesis**  \nThe infection is usually transmitted by ingestion of food or water contaminated with faeces from people who have an acute infection, are convalescing, or are chronic carriers. A chronic carrier is defined as someone who excretes _S._ Typhi in stool or urine for more than one year . The severity of the infection is dependent on the initial infective dose, virulence of the organism, and the host immune response . The organisms usually penetrate the intestinal lining from where they multiply in lymphoid tissues, are released into the blood stream and then spread to various body organs most commonly, the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and the gall bladder .\n\n【9】**Clinical features**  \nThe clinical features of uncomplicated enteric fever include progressive intermittent fever, severe headaches, abdominal discomfort, cough, loss of appetite, malaise, vague abdominal tenderness, enlarged liver and/or spleen, and in the fair‐ skinned, rose coloured spots on the chest and abdomen . Complications may include intestinal perforation that may require surgery, intestinal bleeding needing blood transfusion, shock, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), pneumonia, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles), meningitis, and psychosis. They occur in 10% to 15% of people and commonly in those people whose illness has lasted more than two weeks , and usually require admission into hospital.\n\n【10】**Diagnosis**  \nThe definitive diagnosis of enteric fever is the isolation of the organisms from blood or bone marrow. Cultures of bone marrow aspirate are reported to be positive in about 60% to 90% of patients, and organisms can be cultured even when patients have had antibiotics for some days . Stool, urine, intestinal secretions, rectal swabs, and skin snips of rose spots can also be cultured, but these have low yields. Serologic tests, like the agglutination reaction (Widal reaction), are not reliable because of false positive results owing to cross‐reaction with other Salmonella species and a sensitivity of only 70% . Newer methods of diagnosis such as the use of DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction to detect _S. T_ yphi directly in blood are now available but their use in endemic areas is limited .\n\n【11】**Treatment**  \nFor many decades, antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole were used in treating enteric fever . The emergence of multiple‐drug‐resistant (MDR) strains of the organism has changed treatment options. MDR strains (isolates resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole) of _S._ Typhi have been reported from all parts of the world. In Quetta, Pakistan for instance, 69% of _S._ Typhi isolated from blood was MDR  whereas in Vietnam, 89.9% of isolates between 1998 and 2002 were MDR . Resistance was considerably lower in Tajikistan where 27% of isolates were MDR . A cluster of six cases with MDR typhoid has also been reported in South Africa . In Nigeria and Kenya, MDR typhoid is reported as 61%  and 82.4%  respectively. In 1995, 28% of all isolates of _S._ Typhi from humans in the USA were resistant to a wide range of drugs including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines . The incidence of MDR _S._ Typhi in the UK was reported as over 50% in 1999 up from 34% in 1995 and 1.5% six years earlier .\n\n【12】Second‐line antibiotics like the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, perfloxacin), third‐generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime), and azithromycin are often now used for treating MDR typhoid fever. Lately, there have been several reports of fluoroquinolone‐resistant _S._ Typhi . However, there are problems with identifying these strains. _S._ Typhi resistant to nalidixic acid (prototype fluoroquinolone) may not respond to ciprofloxacin despite having minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values within current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory standards (NCCLS) susceptibility range for ciprofloxacin . This means that in vitro susceptibility may not always translate to in vivo efficacy and that there is the risk of treatment failures in those infected with such strains . Quinolone‐resistant strains are reportedly also multiple‐drug resistant , and infection with resistant _S. T_ yphi is associated with increased morbidity and mortality . A Cochrane Review has not conclusively shown fluoroquinolones to be superior to first‐line or second‐line agents in the treatment of enteric fever . Although azithromycin tended to be better for all outcomes except fever clearance time, only two trials with very small pooled sample size were included in the review.\n\n【13】**Azithromycin**  \nAzithromycin, a member of the macrolide group of antibiotics, has been used as an alternative drug for treating typhoid fever. It achieves low intravascular levels, has high intracellular tissue penetration, and a long elimination half life of 72 hours. These properties make for once‐daily administration and reduction in the duration of therapy. The drug is rapidly absorbed from the gut and is well tolerated when used orally . Side effects include allergic reactions, liver damage, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pains, rashes, and arrhythmias. In vitro studies have shown that it is more potent than traditional first‐line drugs and other macrolides against Salmonella species with an average MIC of 8 μg/mL (range 4 to 16) . There are no reports of resistance of S. Typhi to azithromycin, and recent studies have shown that it is effective both clinically and bacteriologically in treating enteric fever even in those caused by MDR strains .\n\n【14】This review therefore aims to assess available evidence on the efficacy and safety of azithromycin as an alternative drug in treating uncomplicated enteric fever.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To compare azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating uncomplicated enteric fever.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Randomized controlled trials.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Children or adults with uncomplicated enteric fever confirmed by culture of _S_ .

These results were influenced by trials of poor quality which contributed excessive weight in the analysis due to their higher rates of severe PVH. When only the two higher quality trials were included, these beneficial effects disappeared for all grades of PVH (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08; two trials; 945 women), and severe grades of PVH (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.83; two trials; 945 women).\n\n【12】No difference was found in the incidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities at paediatric follow up at 18 to 24 months or seven years of age between children born to mothers given prenatal phenobarbital and children not so exposed.  \n\n【13】Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.37; one trial; 576 women).\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】The evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent periventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants or to protect them from neurological disability in childhood.

This can be a cause of brain damage that might lead to disability including cerebral palsy. Phenobarbital may prevent injury to the brain by stabilising blood pressure and blood flow in the brain. Possible adverse effects of phenobarbital for the women include drowsiness, gastrointestinal upset and development of a rash.\n\n【28】Nine trials involving 1752 women were included in the review. The trials with low risk of bias found that phenobarbital given to women immediately prior to a very preterm birth did not decrease the risk of bleeding in the brains of the babies. No differences in child development were found on follow up at 18 to 24 months or at seven years.\n\n【29】Maternal sedation was more likely in women receiving phenobarbital.

Oral steroids are the standard treatment. We have updated this review, which was first published in 2002, because several new treatments have since been tried.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To assess the effects of treatments for bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We updated searches of the following databases to November 2021: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched five trial databases to January 2022, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】RCTs of treatments for immunofluorescence‐confirmed bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】At least two review authors, working independently, evaluated the studies against the review's inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. Using GRADE methodology, we assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome in each comparison. Our primary outcomes were healing of skin lesions and mortality.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We identified 14 RCTs (1442 participants). The main treatment modalities assessed were oral steroids, topical steroids, and the oral anti‐inflammatory antibiotic doxycycline. Most studies reported mortality but adverse events and quality of life were not well reported. We decided to look at the primary outcomes 'disease control' and 'mortality'.\n\n【13】Almost all studies investigated different comparisons; two studies were placebo‐controlled. The results are therefore based on a single study for each comparison except azathioprine. Most studies involved only small numbers of participants. We assessed the risk of bias for all key outcomes as having 'some concerns' or high risk, due to missing data, inappropriate analysis, or insufficient information.\n\n【14】**Clobetasol propionate cream versus oral prednisone**\n\n【15】Compared to oral prednisone, clobetasol propionate cream applied over the whole body probably increases skin healing at day 21 (risk ratio (RR 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.13; 1 study, 341 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Skin healing at 21 days was seen in 99.8% of participants assigned to clobetasol and 92.4% of participants assigned to prednisone. Clobetasol propionate cream applied over the whole body compared to oral prednisone may reduce mortality at one year (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01; 1 study, 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Death occurred in 26.5% (45/170) of participants assigned to clobetasol and 36.3% (62/171) of participants assigned to oral prednisone. This study did not measure quality of life. Clobetasol propionate cream may reduce risk of severe complications by day 21 compared with oral prednisone (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86; 1 study, 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence).\n\n【16】**Mild clobetasol propionate cream regimen (10 to 30 g/day) versus standard clobetasol propionate cream regimen (40 g/day)**\n\n【17】A mild regimen of topical clobetasol propionate applied over the whole body compared to the standard regimen probably does not change skin healing at day 21 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03; 1 study, 312 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Both groups showed complete healing of lesions at day 21 in 98% participants. A mild regimen of topical clobetasol propionate applied over the whole body compared to the standard regimen may not change mortality at one year (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.32; 1 study, 312 participants; low‐certainty evidence), which occurred in 118/312 (37.9%) participants. This study did not measure quality of life. A mild regimen of topical clobetasol propionate applied over the whole body compared to the standard regimen may not change adverse events at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 309 participants; low‐certainty evidence).\n\n【18】**Doxycycline versus prednisolone**\n\n【19】Compared to prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), doxycycline (200 mg/day) induces less skin healing at six weeks (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 1 study, 213 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Complete skin healing was reported in 73.8% of participants assigned to doxycycline and 91.1% assigned to prednisolone. Doxycycline compared to prednisolone probably decreases mortality at one year (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 14; 1 study, 234 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Mortality occurred in 2.4% (3/132) of participants with doxycycline and 9.7% (11/121) with prednisolone. Compared to prednisolone, doxycycline improved quality of life at one year (mean difference 1.8 points lower, which is more favourable on the Dermatology Life Quality Index, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.58 lower; 1 study, 234 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Doxycycline compared to prednisolone probably reduces severe or life‐threatening treatment‐related adverse events at one year (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99; 1 study, 234 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).\n\n【20】**Prednisone plus azathioprine versus prednisone**\n\n【21】It is unclear whether azathioprine plus prednisone compared to prednisone alone affects skin healing or mortality because there was only very low‐certainty evidence from two trials (98 participants). These studies did not measure quality of life. Adverse events were reported in a total of 20/48 (42%) participants assigned to azathioprine plus prednisone and 15/44 (34%) participants assigned to prednisone.\n\n【22】**Nicotinamide plus tetracycline versus prednisone**\n\n【23】It is unclear whether nicotinamide plus tetracycline compared to prednisone affects skin healing or mortality because there was only very low‐certainty evidence from one trial (18 participants). This study did not measure quality of life. Fewer adverse events were reported in the nicotinamide group.\n\n【24】**Methylprednisolone plus azathioprine versus methylprednisolone plus dapsone**\n\n【25】It is unclear whether azathioprine plus methylprednisolone compared to dapsone plus methylprednisolone affects skin healing or mortality because there was only very low‐certainty evidence from one trial (54 participants). This study did not measure quality of life. A total of 18 adverse events were reported in the azathioprine group and 13 in the dapsone group.\n\n【26】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【27】Clobetasol propionate cream applied over the whole body is probably similarly effective as, and may cause less mortality than, oral prednisone for treating bullous pemphigoid. Lower‐dose clobetasol propionate cream applied over the whole body is probably similarly effective as standard‐dose clobetasol propionate cream and has similar mortality. Doxycycline is less effective but causes less mortality than prednisolone for treating bullous pemphigoid. Other treatments need further investigation.\n### PICOs\n\n【28】###### Populatio\n\n【29】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Bullous Pemphigoid\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【30】###### Interventio\n\n【31】###### Compariso\n\n【32】###### Outcom\n\n【33】*   Skin Lesion\n*   Healing\n*   Skin lesion regression\n\n【34】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system mistakes its own tissues as foreign and attacks them. In bullous pemphigoid, this causes blisters on the skin. Bullous pemphigoid usually occurs in the elderly, but may also affect younger people.\n\n【43】**How is bullous pemphigoid treated?**\n\n【44】Until recently, the leading treatment for bullous pemphigoid was oral steroids which suppress inflammation and the body's own immune system. However, given over a long period of time, oral steroids will cause severe adverse (i.e. harmful) effects.\n\n【45】This review assessed studies which investigated the effectiveness of other treatment options for bullous pemphigoid; for example, a steroid cream applied on the skin and the anti‐inflammatory antibiotic medicine, doxycycline.\n\n【46】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【47】We wanted to find out which treatments work best for bullous pemphigoid with respect to the healing of blisters (efficacy) and reduction in adverse effects, such as death.\n\n【48】**What did we do?**\n\n【49】We searched for studies that looked at treatments for bullous pemphigoid. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\n【50】**What did we find?**\n\n【51】We found 14 studies including 1442 people with bullous pemphigoid. The main treatments assessed were oral steroids, topical steroids, and the oral anti‐inflammatory antibiotic doxycycline. Other treatments tested were oral (i.e. taken by mouth) immunosuppressives (medicines that keep your immune system in check) and immunoglobulins (also called antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight germs, for example).\n\n【52】‐ Topical steroid cream, clobetasol propionate, applied over the whole body (40 grams of cream applied per day, with the amount decreased over 12 months) is an effective and safe treatment for bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【53】‐ Treatment with a lower amount of clobetasol propionate cream (10 to 30 grams per day, decreased over 4 months) is equally effective and safe.\n\n【54】‐ Prednisolone, an oral corticosteroid, in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, may be adequate to control disease in most people and reduces adverse effects compared to higher doses of oral corticosteroid.\n\n【55】‐ Initiating treatment with 200 mg/day of doxycycline leads to acceptable blister control compared to oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) and is safer.\n\n【56】‐ A study with 20 participants suggests that nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B <sub>3 </sub> )and tetracycline (an antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of infections) may be an effective alternative to prednisone and may decrease treatment‐associated death.\n\n【57】‐ Adding azathioprine, a drug which suppresses the immune system, to an oral corticosteroid does not improve disease control; it may lead to a reduced need for oral corticosteroid.\n\n【58】‐ Further research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of alternatives to oral steroids (such as dapsone or immunoglobulins), as well as the effectiveness of giving other medicines alongside an oral steroid.\n\n【59】**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n【60】Except for the studies on topical clobetasol cream and doxycycline, the studies included relatively few participants. The methodological quality of these studies was further limited because of unclear methods of allocating people to different treatment groups; lack of masking (participants and researchers knew which treatments were given to which people, which are not good conditions for fair assessment); and the exclusion of people who dropped out of the studies from treatment analysis.\n\n【61】We are confident about the efficacy of initiating treatment with doxycycline and moderately confident about the efficacy of topical clobetasol cream for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid.\n\n【62】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9c8cef12-16c0-405a-afb4-49de78786ef8", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To examine the effects of oral iron supplementation alone or in combination with folic acid provided to women during the first six weeks postpartum on maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells and consequently their oxygen‐carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiologic needs, which vary by age, gender, altitude, smoking, and different stages of pregnancy . Iron deficiency often precedes anaemia and is one of the most common forms of nutritional deficiencies, particularly among vulnerable groups such as women, children and low‐income populations . Iron reserves in the body can deteriorate as a result of low dietary intake or poor absorption of iron, which is often associated with cereal based diets . In addition to iron deficiency, other factors may cause anaemia including blood loss, parasitic infections and deficiencies of vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12, and riboflavin . Haemoglobin concentrations are used to diagnose anaemia, while serum ferritin, an iron storage protein, and serum transferrin, an iron transport protein, are commonly used as indicators of iron status in populations .\n\n【7】The postpartum period, sometimes referred as to puerperium, begins just after childbirth and includes the subsequent six weeks . In normal conditions, maternal iron requirements commonly decline since this nutrient is no longer needed to support fetal and tissue growth and iron losses are reduced by the cessation of menstruation, particularly during prolonged lactation. In addition, only relatively small and decreasing amounts of iron are excreted through breast milk , which is considered a poor source of iron and cannot be altered by maternal supplementation .\n\n【8】Anaemia is one of the most common conditions in women of reproductive age and anaemia during pregnancy has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of postpartum anaemia as iron stores generally tend to remain low several months after delivery, especially if there is augmented blood loss during the delivery and no additional iron intake . There are no global figures on the prevalence of anaemia following childbirth, but it is recognised as a common problem throughout the world . Studies conducted in the United States of America and in some countries in Europe have reported a prevalence of postpartum anaemia ranging from 10% to 30% . The prevalence may be higher in low‐ to middle‐income countries, as suggested by data from different age groups . For example, the global prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women is 42%, with the highest prevalence found in the WHO Africa region and the highest number of affected pregnant women in WHO South‐East Asia region .\n\n【9】It is possible that women suffer from multiple concomitant vitamin and mineral deficiencies, although there is not much information on their metabolism during the postpartum period. For calcium, it has been reported that parity and lactation do not affect the long‐term risks of low bone density, osteoporosis, or fracture ; however, for folate, it has been reported that serum folate concentrations continue to decrease several weeks after delivery, especially when combined with inadequate dietary intakes, and under certain conditions, women may go on to develop megaloblastic anaemia .\n\n【10】The consequences of iron deficiency and anaemia during the postpartum period can be serious and have long‐term health implications for the mother and her child. Mothers with depleted iron reserves at the time of delivery and following child birth may experience fatigue, altered cognition and depressive symptoms . These changes in the mother's emotional and cognitive functioning may in turn affect the interactions with her baby, and have a potentially negative impact on infant behaviour and development . If iron stores are not restored soon after delivery, the negative consequences of postpartum iron deficiency and anaemia may permeate other stages of the reproductive cycle, particularly among those women with short inter‐pregnancy intervals (less than 18 months), leading to continued adverse maternal and infant outcomes .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Oral iron supplementation refers to the delivery of iron compounds directly to the oral cavity, either as a tablet (regular or dispersible), capsule or liquid. This intervention has been proposed as an efficient and effective approach in public health programmes aimed at improving pregnancy outcomes and enhancing maternal and infant health in different age groups .\n\n【13】A dosage of 60 mg of elemental iron plus 400 µg (0.4 mg) of folic acid per day is recommended universally for pregnant women, to be continued for three months postpartum, particularly in regions where the prevalence of anaemia is above 40% . Other international organisations recommend that women who have been identified as having anaemia throughout the third trimester of pregnancy, or who suffer excessive blood loss at delivery or multiple births, should receive supplemental iron up to six weeks postpartum with an oral dose of 60 to 120 mg of elemental iron daily until the anaemia is resolved .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Iron is absorbed by intestinal cell luminal and basal transporters. It is then bound to proteins that transport it to the bone marrow, muscle and other tissue, where it is taken up by specific receptors and utilised for biologic functions or stored . Daily iron supplementation has proven to be effective for increasing haemoglobin concentrations among pregnant and non pregnant women . Some trials suggest that this supplementation regimen could also be effective during the postpartum period although the literature on the contribution of other vitamins and minerals to the women's haematological status and health during the postpartum period is still limited .\n\n【16】The oral consumption of iron tablets may be associated with unpleasant and sometimes distressing side‐effects such as diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting . These symptoms increase in severity according to the amount of elemental iron released and whether or not the supplement is taken on an empty stomach or with a meal. The tolerable upper limits for the intake of iron during pregnancy and lactation has been set in 45 mg/day of elemental iron and is based on the gastrointestinal side‐effects associated with supplementation . Alternative intermittent supplementation regimens such as weekly iron‐folic acid supplementation have been recommended to prevent anaemia in menstruating women . Although their efficacy has not been proven during the postpartum period, they might represent a good alternative to increase iron stores and minimise the negative effects associated with daily supplementation.\n\n【17】In addition to the possible distressing side‐effects, daily iron supplementation may be associated with a reduction of zinc and copper absorption, increased oxidative stress and a higher risk of infections. It is plausible that when either zinc or copper are consumed together with iron, their absorption may be impaired due to competition for the same intestinal absorption pathway, but the results are inconsistent . It has also been suggested that the iron‐rich environment resulting from continued high‐dose iron supplementation may cause cell damage ; however, the clinical significance of this still remains unclear. Finally, it has been proposed that additional iron may exacerbate infections, particularly malaria in areas where it is endemic, as more iron may be available for the parasite's growth, although the mechanisms whereby this may occur are not fully understood . Among pregnant women, some trials have reported an increased risk of infection following iron supplementation but a systematic assessment of the evidence has failed to demonstrate this association .\n\n【18】From the implementation perspective, the period immediately following childbirth may represent a unique opportunity to reach women as they often remain in close contact with healthcare providers. This continuity of care would permit ease of coverage, accessibility, as well as consistency in dosing schedules.\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Iron deficiency and anaemia are important public health problems worldwide, particularly among women of reproductive age. The period following childbirth should not be considered a time of low risk for iron deficiency and anaemia, especially for women living in resource‐poor environments who tend to suffer higher rates of morbidity and mortality associated with anaemia .\n\n【21】Iron supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients has proven to be efficacious during pregnancy and among other age groups, but as yet there has been no systematic assessment of the benefits or harms of this public health intervention following childbirth, to inform policy making and health practitioners. The potential health gains from improved iron status support the systematic investigation and assessment of iron supplementation during what has previously been a neglected period of the lifecycle.\n\n【22】This review contributes to the body of evidence formed by various Cochrane reviews examining iron and folic acid supplementation as a public health intervention in pregnant and non pregnant women . It complements the findings of a previously published review that looked at the oral, intravenous or subcutaneous administration of iron, folic acid, erythropoietin or blood transfusion for therapeutic purposes among women with postpartum anaemia .\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】To examine the effects of oral iron supplementation alone or in combination with folic acid provided to women during the first six weeks postpartum on maternal and infant health outcomes.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】Randomised and quasi‐randomised studies with randomisation at either individual or cluster level. Studies using a cross‐over design will be excluded.\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】Postpartum adolescent or adult women randomised to receive iron supplements during the first six weeks after giving birth.\n\n【31】We will not include trials focusing specifically on women diagnosed with a particular disease (e.g. women with HIV, tuberculosis) nor those studies in which the intervention was given exclusively during pregnancy, even if such trials report outcomes relating to the postnatal period.\n\n【32】#### Types of interventions\n\n【33】We will include interventions involving oral supplements of iron alone or combined with other micronutrients provided on a daily or intermittent basis. Therefore, we will examine the following comparisons.\n\n【34】1.  Any oral supplements containing iron versus no iron.\n\n【35】2.  Any oral supplements containing iron + folic acid versus no iron + folic acid.\n\n【36】3.  Oral supplements with iron alone versus no treatment/placebo.\n\n【37】4.  Oral supplements with iron + folic acid versus no treatment/placebo.\n\n【38】5.  Oral supplements with iron + folic acid versus oral supplements with folic acid alone (without iron).\n\n【39】6.  Oral supplements with iron + folic acid + other vitamins and minerals versus oral supplements with folic acid + other vitamins and minerals (without iron).\n\n【40】7.  Oral supplements with iron + folic acid + other vitamins and minerals versus oral supplements with other vitamins and minerals (without iron + folic acid).\n\n【41】We will include studies that examined interventions where iron supplementation was combined with co‐interventions such as deworming, education or other approaches only if the co‐interventions were the same in both the intervention and comparison groups.\n\n【42】We will exclude studies examining tube feeding, parenteral nutrition or supplementary food‐based interventions such as mass fortification of staple or complementary foods, home fortification with micronutrient powders, lipid‐based supplements or Foodlets tablets, or biofortification.\n\n【43】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【44】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【45】###### Maternal outcomes\n\n【46】1.  Anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) below a cut‐off defined by trialists, taking into account age, altitude and smoking).\\*\n\n【47】2.  Haemoglobin (in g/L).\\*\n\n【48】3.

Hypertension is a commonly measured surrogate marker for non‐fatal and fatal cardiovascular endpoints such as heart attacks and strokes. Clinical trials have suggested that coenzyme Q10 supplementation can effectively lower blood pressure (BP).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the blood pressure lowering effect of coenzyme Q10 in primary hypertension.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 ‐May 2008), EMBASE (1982 ‐ May 2008), and CINAHL (1970 ‐ May 2008) as well as the reference lists of articles were searched for relevant clinical trials in any language.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled parallel or crossover trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of coenzyme Q10 for a duration of at least 3 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】The primary author independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. The second author verified data extraction.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three clinical trials with a total of 96 participants were evaluated for the effects of coenzyme Q10 on blood pressure compared to placebo. Treatment with coenzyme Q10 in subjects with systolic BP (SBP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) > 90 mmHg resulted in mean decreases in SBP of 11 mmHg (95% CI 8, 14) and DBP of 7 mmHg (95% CI 5, 8).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Due to the possible unreliability of some of the included studies, it is uncertain whether or not coenzyme Q10 reduces blood pressure in the long‐term management of primary hypertension.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Serum Creatinine Increased\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Essential Hypertension\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Coenzyme Q10\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Blood Pressure Alteration\n*   Alteration In Heart Rate\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】----------------------\n\n【24】### Coenzyme Q10 for hypertension\n\n【25】Coenzyme Q10 has been studied as a potential treatment for hypertension, a common medical condition. However, there is not enough reliable evidence to show whether or not it can be a useful medication to lower blood pressure. A systematic review was conducted to try and use all available data to answer this question. Databases of clinical trials were searched for any studies that tested the effects of coenzyme Q10 on patients' blood pressure compared to a placebo. The test medications could be added to participants' regular anti‐hypertensive medications or be used alone. Three trials with a total of 96 participants were found in which coenzyme Q10 was used in patients with high blood pressure. The patients took coenzyme Q10 or a placebo daily for up to 8‐12 weeks. Weighted data analysis showed that the systolic blood pressure was reduced by 11 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure was lowered by 7 mmHg compared to placebo. However, there are questions about the reliability of the available studies. Therefore, it is still uncertain if coenzyme Q10 could be a useful hypertension treatment, and more studies are needed.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

For example, the relative risk of improvement for 0.05% tretinoin cream, compared to placebo (3 studies), at 24 weeks, was 1.73 (95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.14). This effect was not seen for 0.001% topical tretinoin (1 study) or 0.01% (3 studies). A dose‐response relationship was evident for both effectiveness and skin irritation.\n\n【13】One small within‐patient study showed benefit from topical ascorbic acid compared with placebo.\n\n【14】Tazarotene (0.01% to 0.1%) and isotretinoin (0.1%) both showed significant improvement over placebo for moderate photodamage (one study each).\n\n【15】There is limited evidence (one trial), to show that the effectiveness of 0.05% tretinoin, is equivalent to the effects of 0.05% and 0.1% tazarotene.\n\n【16】One small study showed greater improvement in upper lip wrinkles with CO <sub>2 </sub> laser technique compared to Baker's phenol chemical peel, at six months.\n\n【17】Three small RCTs comparing CO <sub>2 </sub> laser with dermabrasion found no difference in wrinkle score at four to six months, suggesting that both methods are equally efficacious, but more erythema was reported with the laser.\n\n【18】The effectiveness of other interventions such as hydroxy acids and natural polysaccharides was not clear.\n\n【19】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【20】There is conclusive evidence that topical tretinoin improves the appearance of mild to moderate photodamage on the face and forearms, in the short‐term. However erythema, scaling/dryness, burning/stinging and irritation may be experienced initially.\n\n【21】There is limited evidence that tazarotene and isotretinoin benefit patients with moderate photodamage on the face: both are associated with skin irritation and erythema. The effectiveness of other interventions remains uncertain.\n\n【22】### Treatments for sun‐damaged (photodamaged) skin\n\n【23】Tretinoin cream improves skin changes (fine and coarse wrinkles, roughness, freckles and pigmentation) associated with prolonged sun exposure (photodamage). The greatest improvements occurred with higher concentrations of tretinoin, but at the expense of greater local irritation. Tazarotene and isotretinoin creams are also found to be effective, but again at the expense of skin irritation. More evidence is needed before any recommendations can be made on oral or topical polysaccharides or hydroxy acids.

Several unblinded non‐randomized trials have suggested that the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) prevents the development of neurological sequelae. This has led to the widespread use of HBO in the management of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To examine randomized trials of the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) compared to normobaric oxygen (NBO) for the prevention of neurologic sequelae in patients with acute carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched MEDLINE (1966‐present), EMBASE (1980‐present), and the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, supplemented by a manual review of bibliographies of identified articles and discussion with recognized content experts.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomized controlled trials involving non‐pregnant adults acutely poisoned with carbon monoxide (regardless of severity), with adequate or unclear allocation concealment.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two reviewers independently extracted from each trial information on: the number of randomized patients, types of participants, the dose and duration of the intervention, and the prevalence of neurologic symptoms at follow‐up.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Seven randomized controlled trials of varying quality were identified; one was excluded because it did not evaluate clinical outcomes. Of the six remaining trials, two represent incomplete publications (one interim analysis, one abstract). Of these six trials, four found no benefit of HBO for the reduction of neurologic sequelae, while two others did. Although pooled analysis does not suggest a benefit from HBOT (OR for neurological deficits 0.78, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.12, p=0.18), significant methodologic and statistical heterogeneity was apparent among the trials, and this result should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, design or analysis flaws were evident in all trials. Importantly, the conclusions of one positive trial may have been influenced by failure to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, while interpretation of the other positive trial is hampered by apparent changes in the primary outcome during the course of the trial.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Existing randomized trials do not establish whether the administration of HBO to patients with carbon monoxide poisoning reduces the incidence of adverse neurologic outcomes. Additional research is needed to better define the role, if any, of HBO in the treatment of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. This research question is ideally suited to a multi‐center randomized controlled trial.\n\n【14】### No evidence to support use of hyperbaric oxygen for treatment of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning\n\n【15】Many people are poisoned by carbon monoxide gas, either intentionally (e.g. in suicide attempts) or by accident. Carbon monoxide interferes with oxygen transport in the body, and can also directly damage a variety of organs including the brain. The usual treatment involves removing the affected person from the source of the gas, general supportive care, and administering oxygen which hastens the elimination of carbon monoxide from the body. High pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is only available at a few hospitals, and it is sometimes used to speed this process even further. However, the review of published trials found conflicting, potentially biased, and generally weak evidence regarding the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for the prevention of neurological symptoms.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of self‐management education programmes for people with OA.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint condition affecting primarily the weight‐bearing joints such as the hips, knees, ankles and spine, but may also affect the hands. Worldwide, OA affects approximately 10% of men and 18% of women aged 60 years or older  and incidence increases with age.\n\n【7】The impact of OA includes pain, difficulty in performing activities of daily living, dependency on family and friends for assistance, reduced quality of life, lost productivity and personal economic impacts associated with ongoing care and management . The major costs of OA within the health sector are related to joint replacement, visits to general practitioners (GPs) and specialists, prescription and over the counter medications, and allied health care. As the condition is not reversible, the growing number of people with the condition will result in a greater burden of disease with current estimates indicating OA will be the fourth leading cause of disability by the year 2020 .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】There is support for co‐ordinated delivery of patient self‐management education programmes in order to improve healthcare outcomes for people with OA . Self‐management education programmes are distinct from simple patient education or skills training as they encourage people with chronic disease to take an active role in the management of their own condition. Self‐management education programmes aim to improve outcomes for patients through supporting, not replacing, medical care .\n\n【10】Self‐management education programmes are complex behavioural interventions comprising a package of interventions specifically targeted at patient education and behaviour modification. Programmes vary in the content used to educate patients about their condition and how they can best manage their symptoms. Some programmes specifically focus on managing the chronic condition itself whereas other programmes may take a more holistic approach to managing the overall general wellbeing of the individual. Substantial variation exists in the delivery of self‐management education programmes such as the mode (face to face, internet, telephone), audience (group, individual), duration (single session, several months, ongoing), frequency (once a week, once every two months), and personnel (health professionals, lay leaders).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】As a chronic condition, the pathology associated with joints affected by OA is typically irreversible. Aside from joint replacement, interventions are usually targeted at maintaining or improving life _with_ the condition rather than improving the condition itself. There are a variety of terms in the literature that describe self‐management, including self‐care, self‐monitoring, self‐help and social support . There are also a number of models of self‐management , however the core steps involve: 1) engaging in activities that promote health and prevent adverse sequelae; 2) interacting with health care providers; 3) improved self‐monitoring of physical and emotional status; and 4) managing the effects of illness on a person’s ability to function in important roles and on emotions, self esteem, and relationships with others . The skills required for these tasks include: problem‐solving, decision‐making, finding and utilising resources, forming partnerships with healthcare workers, and taking action .\n\n【13】#### Assessing the impact of self‐management education programmes\n\n【14】Studies of self‐management education programmes have varied widely in their attempts to quantify the potential impact of these programmes on participant health and wellbeing. This has resulted in significant heterogeneity in outcome assessment across studies and has contributed to inconsistencies in reported effectiveness of programmes. Understanding which outcomes are most relevant to assess the effectiveness of self‐management education programmes is required so that programmes can be assessed systematically based on outcomes we know are important to participants. Recent research has been undertaken to identify key indicators of effective self‐management interventions from the patient perspective . Development of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ <sup>TM </sup> ) involved extensive engagement and consultation with consumers and health care professionals regarding the outcomes they consider as valuable and direct benefits of self‐management programmes. Eight independent domains were described and form the basis of the constructs of the questionnaire. Domains identified as key indicators of effective self‐management programmes included: health‐directed behaviour; positive and active engagement in life; emotional well‐being; self‐monitoring and insight; constructive attitudes and approaches; skill and technique acquisition; social integration and support; and health service navigation. The constructs used in the heiQ <sup>TM </sup> have been shown as robust across a range of settings .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】A number of previous systematic reviews and literature reviews have summarised the effects of self‐management programmes  or arthritis patient education interventions  for people with OA or mixed populations (including people with chronic diseases such as OA). However, some of these previous reviews have either: 1) combined data from studies including people with OA and rheumatoid arthritis ;\n\n【17】2) restricted inclusion of studies to those where patients have OA affecting the knee only ;\n\n【18】3) restricted inclusion of studies to those where the comparison intervention was a nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug treatment only ; or\n\n【19】4) did not employ rigorous and systematic methods of searching, appraising and synthesising the evidence that are necessary to produce reliable systematic reviews of the effects of health care interventions .\n\n【20】Existing clinical practice guidelines uniformly recommend self‐management for OA of the hip and knee . In order to consider broad implementation of self‐management education programmes for OA, there needs to be a strong evidence base to support this. Evidence must show that self‐management education programmes improve functional, psychological, and social outcomes for people with OA. Furthermore, it is important to identify any variables that may significantly impact on outcomes of the intervention (eg age, stage of disease and comorbidities) as well as contextual issues around content, settings and methods of delivery of self‐management education programmes. A systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to date would determine whether self‐management education programmes are effective in improving outcomes for people with OA.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To assess the effectiveness of self‐management education programmes for people with OA.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】We will include RCTs that compare outcomes of people with OA assigned to a self‐management education programme to those who did not receive a self‐management educational intervention (ie information only, no treatment, usual care, waiting list control, or alternative interventions that are not considered self‐management education programmes). Studies comparing different self‐management education programmes without an appropriate comparison group (ie no programme) will be excluded. Co‐interventions will be considered, provided the comparison group also receives the same co‐intervention. Quasi‐randomised trials where group assignment were determined using methods other than true randomisation (ie alternate assignment) are also eligible for inclusion.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】We will include studies of people of all age groups diagnosed with OA as defined in the included trials. Studies involving people with conditions other than OA (ie mixed populations) will be included only if outcomes for people with OA are presented separately or if there is a high proportion of participants with OA (90% or greater). We will attempt to contact trial authors to obtain separate data for people with OA if this has not been reported.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We will include structured self‐management education programmes that are judged as being primarily educational and address self‐management of OA, arthritis in general, or living with chronic disease. Programme components that directly address self‐management may include fostering skills in managing OA, such as problem solving, goal setting, decision making, self‐monitoring, coping with the condition, or interventions to manage pain or improve physical and psychological functioning.\n\n【31】Structured programmes delivered by health professionals, lay leaders, or a combination of both will be included irrespective of whether the programme is delivered to a group of participants or on an individual basis. Studies describing interventions for self‐management that are not delivered within a structured format or some form of organised content delivery will be excluded. All modes of delivery will be included such as face‐to‐face or interventions delivered by post, internet, or telephone, provided they incorporate an iterative process of interaction between the participant and programme facilitators. Studies will not be excluded based on the duration or location of self‐management education programmes. We will exclude interventions that are judged as treating the participants as passive recipients of care (eg provision of information alone). Studies focussing solely on exercise will not be included.\n\n【32】Programmes that incorporate education for carers or relatives will also be included provided the intervention is primarily intended for the person with OA.\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】No studies will be excluded based on the outcomes reported. All immediate (up to 6 weeks from the start of the intervention), intermediate (up to and including one year after the intervention), and longer term outcomes (greater than one year after the intervention) will be reported.\n\n【35】##### Major outcomes\n\n【36】Major outcomes include:\n\n【37】*   self‐management of OA (participant's self‐monitoring and insight into living with OA)\n\n【38】*   participant's positive and active engagement in life (including return to work, fulfilling their role within the family)\n\n【39】*   adverse events or withdrawals (where reported reasons for withdrawal are related to the intervention)\n\n【40】##### Minor outcomes\n\n【41】Minor outcomes are those relevant to OA:\n\n【42】*   Pain outcomes\n\n【43】*   Global OA scores (eg WOMAC <sup>TM </sup> Osteoarthritis Index, Lequesne osteoarthritis index global score)\n\n【44】We will also include the following outcomes that are relevant to the impact of self‐management:\n\n【45】*   Function (including walking ability, range of motion)\n\n【46】*   Quality of life (including self‐rated quality of life)\n\n【47】*   Emotional well‐being (including depression, anxiety, stress)\n\n【48】*   Health‐directed behaviour (including adherence, exercise, diet, relaxation)\n\n【49】*   Social integration and support (including social participation, social network, social input)\n\n【50】*   Health service navigation (visits to health professionals, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, length of stay)\n\n【51】*   Skill and technique acquisition (including knowledge about the condition and how symptoms can be managed)\n\n【52】*   Constructive attitude and approaches (including changes in perceived impact of OA on participant's life)\n\n【53】*   Patient satisfaction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of parenteral calcium administration in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Epidemiology**  \nHypocalcemia, as defined by a serum ionized calcium concentration (\\[Ca2+\\]i) less than 1.15 mmol/L, is prevalent in up to 88% of critically ill patients . During homeostasis, \\[Ca2+\\]i is tightly regulated both systemically, as well as, at the cellular level so as to maintain vital cellular and organ physiology, including blood coagulation, muscle contraction, and nerve conduction. Hypocalcemia has been associated with coagulopathy, neuromuscular excitability (for example tetany, laryngospasm), and cardiovascular complications (for example hypotension, decreased cardiac output, cardiac arrythmias). Several epidemiological studies of critically ill patients highlight a direct association between hypocalcemia and mortality; whether this association is causal is unknown. The etiology of hypocalcemia during critical illness is unknown, though most likely a multifactorial consequence of both cellular and hormonal dysfunction. Despite low systemic \\[Ca2+\\]i , intracellular \\[Ca2+\\]i is elevated in liver, aortic smooth muscle, myocardium, blood cells, and brain in experimental models of sepsis or septic patients, in models of ischemia/reperfusion and in severely injured trauma patients . Myocardial dysfunction consequent to sepsis, trauma or ischemia has been correlated with elevated intracellular \\[Ca2+\\]i . Similar dysfunction or cellular injury consequent to elevated cytosolic is observed in skeletal muscle , red blood cells  and the liver . Impaired intracellular calcium handling, common to all these pathologic states, is often cited as the mediator of toxic cell death and subsequent organ dysfunction . It has been hypothesized that persistent elevation of intracellular calcium concentration sustains the septic response after the infection has been eliminated and leads to MOD , and that hypocalcemia could in part be protective . Nevertheless, because of the integral role of calcium in nearly every vital and cellular function, supplementation to normalize serum \\[Ca2+\\]i is recommended .\n\n【6】**Diagnosis and Managment**  \nThough population‐based analyses have established similar threshholds for defining hypocalcemia (\\[Ca2+\\]i less than 1.15 mmol/L); consensus has never been achieved as to the \\[Ca2+\\]i threshold necessitating supplementation (0.65 mmol/L to 1.12 mmol/L). Nevertheless, because of the integral role of calcium in nearly every vital and cellular function, supplementation to normalize serum ionized calcium concentration \\[Ca2+\\]i is recommended . Replacement typically is achieved through parenteral supplementation with either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate, with administration guided by institutional or practitioner preference. Such therapy is thought to be essential in maintaining normal cellular and organ physiology, with emphasis upon calcium's function in cardiovascular and neuromuscular homeostasis.\n\n【7】**Appropriateness of Supplementation**  \nDespite prior studies detailing associations between hypocalcemia and poor outcome, there is substantial evidence that calcium supplementation in critical illness may be deleterious and considerable molecular evidence of calcium's role in perpetuating aberrant inflammatory responses and inducing cell death. No study has determined that the association between hypocalcemia and either multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or mortality is causal, and that this deviation from normality requires therapy . Human studies in both sepsis and trauma note no improvement in outcome with calcium supplementation . Several animal models of sepsis and trauma document worsened mortality and organ dysfunction with calcium replacement,  and others report improvement with calcium antagonism . Clinical trials of calcium supplementation during cardiopulmonary bypass or sepsis document worsened myocardial function and increased myocardial workload with supplementation,  whereas reducing calcium overload improved contractility . Reductions in cellular dysfunction and injury in models of sepsis have been achieved by maintaining low extracellular calcium concentrations or administering calcium antagonists .\n\n【8】**Adverse effects**  \nIn light of the considerable variation in the threshold for calcium replacement, the lack of support for a causal role of hypocalcemia in mortality, and the substantial evidence illustrating calcium supplementation does little to improve, and may in fact worsen, organ dysfunction and mortality, a systematic review is essential to ascertain whether such supplementation for intensive care unit patients imposes harm. No prior sytematic review has been conducted to ascertain whether the evidence supports our current practice patterns of managing hypocalcemia in critically ill patients. Realize that prior tenets of critical care medicine, such as normalizing tidal volumes to treat hypoxemia  and normalizing protein anabolism by administering growth hormone  were definitively demonstrated to increase the risk of death when subjected to the rigors of randomized, controlled trials. In the context of this current evidence, our practice patterns of managing hypocalcemia are of concern. Our perspective of hypocalcemia in critical illness necessitates the same rigorous evaluation that enlightened us to the dangers posed by these earlier axioms of medicine.\n\n【9】Objectives\n----------\n\n【10】To assess the effects of parenteral calcium administration in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit.\n\n【11】Methods\n-------\n\n【12】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【13】#### Types of studies\n\n【14】We will include randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials(CCTs).\n\n【15】#### Types of participants\n\n【16】Participants will be all patients in intensive care units, regardless of gender and age, who are critically ill as defined by admission to an intensive care unit.\n\n【17】#### Types of interventions\n\n【18】(1) Parenteral calcium supplementation(calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) versus no treatment.  \n(2) Parenteral calcium supplementation(calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) versus placebo.\n\n【19】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【20】**_Primary outcome measure_**  \n(1) mortality  \n(2) organ dysfunction defined as defined by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score.  \n\n【21】**_Secondary outcome measures_**  \n(1) ICU  \n(2) hospital mortality  \n(3) costs  \n(4) adverse effects  \n(5) calcium concentration\n\n【22】**Confounders** :  \n(1) admission diagnosis (sepsis, trauma, premature birth, or other);  \n(2) presence of a calcium concentration‐guided supplementation protocol;  \n(3) threshold of hypocalcemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To investigate the effects of hypnosis for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared to standard care and other interventions.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】The International Classification of Diseases describes schizophrenia as a mental illness with fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and inappropriate or blunted mood (affect), in clear consciousness . Although medication is the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, 5‐15% of people continue to experience symptoms in spite of drug treatment . There has recently been increased interest in addressing the effects of psychological and other therapies on the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia when these therapies are added to drug treatment.\n\n【6】The American Psychological Association defines hypnosis as a \"procedure during which a health professional or researcher suggests that a client, patient or subject experience changes in sensations, perceptions, thoughts or behaviour\". The hypnotic context is generally established by an induction procedure. Potentially medical hypnosis could be used alone in the management of schizophrenia. In practice however, hypnosis is a potential adjunct to facilitate and enhance other treatments for schizophrenia. There is ongoing concern and controversy surrounding the use of hypnosis in the management of schizophrenia which centres on whether psychotic patients are hypnotisable  and whether the technique could precipitate or aggravate psychotic symptoms . Some advocate hypnosis as a safe and valuable tool for the treatment of psychotic symptoms  and there are numerous reports in the literature describing the success of hypnotherapy for managing both acute and chronic schizophrenia . In other case reports hypnosis was not noted to be helpful .\n\n【7】There has been a recent increase in the number of health care professionals (especially doctors, psychologists and dentists) interested in the use of hypnosis in a broad range of physical and psychological problems. Most of the descriptions of its use in schizophrenia are with individual patients in North America. It is difficult to estimate how widely hypnosis is currently available. In the UK most therapists work in the private sector.\n\n【8】Technical background  \nPatients respond to hypnosis in different ways. Some describe the experience as an altered state of consciousness whilst others describe it as a normal state of focused attention in which they feel very calm and relaxed. This distinction in experience has given rise to different theories of hypnosis. The 'special state' theorists believe hypnosis is an 'altered state of consciousness' which allows unconscious thoughts and feelings to be accessed. The neo‐disassociation theory  is the current proponent of this model of hypnosis. The 'non state' or 'socio‐cognitive' theorists argue that the hypnotic state is a social behaviour that is a direct by‐product of suggestion. Advocates of this theory propose hypnosis could be due to role enactment  or creative imagination.\n\n【9】There is no agreed framework for administering hypnosis. Traditionally, according to the 'state theory', the procedure involves: i. education, explanation of hypnosis and discussion of common misconceptions; ii. induction procedure, such as eye fixation; iii. deepening techniques, such as progressive muscular relaxation and/or breathing relaxation; iv. therapeutic suggestions, such as guided imagery, anchoring techniques and ego‐strengthening (post‐hypnotic suggestions can also be used especially to facilitate self hypnosis); v. alerting phase, this involves orientation to the surroundings. The 'socio‐cognitive' model of hypnosis does not generally utilise an induction procedure.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To investigate the effects of hypnosis for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses compared to standard care and other interventions.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】All relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double‐blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes  when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference only clearly randomised trials were utilised and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text. Quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】People with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses. For the purposes of this review 'schizophrenia‐like illnesses' are schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, 'chronic/severe mental illness', but, where possible, not bipolar affective disorder or organic related psychoses. Trials included participants of any age, nationality and gender. Trials included participants with any length of illness who were being treated in any treatment setting. Studies were highlighted when they included a preliminary test on individual susceptibility to hypnosis. For the group of trials in which participants were judged to be of high susceptibility the results for primary outcomes were compared with the results of studies were susceptibility was thought not to be high, and again with the results of studies where susceptibility was not recorded. If these data were available the subgroups were added separately but an overall synthesis was still undertaken.\n\n【18】#### Types of interventions\n\n【19】1\\. Hypnosis alone  \nThe techniques used should have involved some element of i. education and testing hypnotic susceptibility, explanation of hypnosis and discussion of common misconceptions; ii. induction procedure, such as using eye fixation; iii. deepening techniques, such as progressive muscular relaxation and/or breathing relaxation; iv. therapeutic suggestions, such as guided imagery, anchoring techniques and ego‐strengthening (post‐hypnotic suggestions can also be used especially to facilitate self hypnosis); and/or v. an alerting phase, involving orientation to the surroundings. In addition, if studies were not explicit as to the elements used in the hypnotic technique but stated that hypnosis was used, these too were be included.\n\n【20】2\\. Hypnosis with medication  \n'Medication' refers to any psychotropic drug treatment.\n\n【21】3\\. Hypnosis with other therapies  \n'Other therapies' refers to talking treatments that are specifically labelled as being from a particular school or approach, e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy, psychodynamic therapy, social skills therapy, and supportive therapy.\n\n【22】4\\. Standard care  \nThe normal level of psychiatric care provided in the area where the trial is being carried out.

{"seq_id": "03798bc2-c455-40f8-930b-835bff430188", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Overview). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To summarize the evidence in Cochrane reviews of the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treatment or prevention of complications experienced by people with SCD.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder, which can lead to life‐threatening complications. People with sickle cell disease experience episodes of severe pain, and other complications including anaemia, end‐organ damage, pulmonary complications, kidney disease, and increased susceptibility to infections and stroke . It is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes . Populations originating from sub‐Saharan Africa, the western hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America), the Middle East, India and parts of the Mediterranean are predominantly affected. Reductions in infant and child mortality and increasing migration from highly affected countries have made this a worldwide problem . Over 12,500 people in the United Kingdom and 100,000 in the USA are estimated suffer from the disease . A recent study estimated that approximately 305,800 babies were born with SCD in 2010, of which two thirds were born in Africa, and this could increase by 25% to approximately 404,200 by 2050 .\n\n【7】The term 'sickle cell disease' refers to all genotypes that cause the clinical syndrome. There are three main types of SCD. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common form of the disease (up to 70% of cases of SCD in people of African origin) and is due to the inheritance of two beta globin S (βS) alleles (haemoglobin (Hb)SS). The second most common genotype (up to 30% of cases in people of African origin) is haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC disease) it is due to the co‐inheritance of the βS and βC alleles and tends to be a more moderate form of the disease. The third major type of SCD occurs when βS is inherited with a β‐thalassaemia allele, causing HbS/β‐thalassaemia. . People who have inherited a thalassaemia null mutation (HbSß°) have a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from sickle cell anaemia, whereas people with HbSβ <sup>+ </sup> thalassaemia have a milder disorder. In high‐income nations, people with SCD are expected to live into their 40's, 50's and beyond, whereas in low‐income countries including some African nations it is estimated that between 50% to 90% of children born with HbSS die before their fifth birthday .\n\n【8】In people with SCD experiencing low oxygen levels, acidity and cellular dehydration, the HbS molecules polymerise and begin to distort the red blood cells taking on the appearance of sickle‐shaped cells. The main determinant of disease severity is the rate and extent of this HbS polymerisation . This is exemplified by co‐inheritance of genetic factors that affect the intracellular HbS or fetal haemoglobin concentration, for example the protective effects of co‐inherited α‐thalassaemia  or hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin . Sickling of red blood cells results in two main events: blockage of blood flow resulting in organ and tissue ischaemia; and haemolytic anaemia . Both of these processes are thought to lead to increased inflammation and an increased tendency to develop a clot . Blockage of blood flow is mediated via a dynamic interaction between sticky HbS containing red cells, the vessel wall, and white cells . Sickle red blood cells also have a shorter lifespan of 10 to 12 days versus 120 days for normal red blood cells due to intravascular and extravascular haemolysis, leading to anaemia . Chronic intravascular haemolysis leads to decreased levels of nitric oxide within the blood, development of pulmonary hypertension and ischaemic strokes .\n\n【9】### Description of the interventions\n\n【10】Individuals with SCD experience a variety of both acute and chronic complications as a result of the disease. Complications may be quite severe and include acute chest syndrome, acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA), acute and chronic pain, ocular or renal complications, chronic leg ulcers, priapism, avascular necrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic respiratory and hepatobiliary complications . The course of the disease is highly variable with some people having a relatively mild course with fewer complications and longer survival and others having frequent severe complications and shortened survival. Blood transfusions are a mainstay of treatment in SCD and 90% of adults will have received at least one red blood cell transfusion .\n\n【11】Red blood cell transfusions can be given to treat complications of SCD, e.g. acute chest syndrome (this often involves a single transfusion episode), or they can be part of a regular long‐term transfusion programme to prevent complications of SCD . People with SCD can be placed on a long‐term transfusion programme to prevent recurrence of a complication they have already experienced or to prevent the first episode of a complication e.g. stroke in children with abnormal transcranial dopplers . Both a single transfusion episode or chronic transfusion programmes can use either a simple transfusion regime or an exchange transfusion regime . In addition to restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) or liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) red cell transfusions, other therapies may include drug therapy as an alternative to red cell transfusions such as hydroxyurea for anaemia, pain and acute chest syndrome; or adjuvant red cell transfusion therapies such as analgesics for pain, oxygen for chest complications and fluid replacement for pain crisis.\n\n【12】Red blood cell transfusions have reduced complications and improved the quality of life in people with SCD; however, they can also cause adverse events that are sometimes serious . The benefits of transfusion therapy must be balanced against risks including infections, iron overload, alloimmunisation, acute or delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions, and increased complexity of compatibility testing .\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Transfusing normal red blood cells to people with SCD who are anaemic, can increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood .\n\n【15】Sickled red blood cells increase blood viscosity (resistance to flow) through intrinsic properties of the sickled cells, as well as through abnormal interactions of these cells with white cells, platelets, the vessel wall, and clotting factors. Transfusion of normal donor red blood cells is used to mitigate these effects  and several regimens are used in current clinical practice. These include 'simple' transfusion in which normal red cells are given to decrease anaemia without removal of the individual's blood. In people with SCD who do not have severe anaemia 'simple' blood transfusions can cause hyperviscosity syndrome because they raise the haemoglobin, but only marginally lower the HbS percentage .\n\n【16】Exchange transfusion involves removing some of the individual's own blood and transfusing allogeneic blood, thereby lowering the concentration of HbS through dilution. This reduces the effects of a given haemoglobin level on blood viscosity. A full exchange transfusion involves a full blood volume exchange by manual or automated apheresis, this allows for rapid lowering of the HbS level to 30 per cent or less, and correction of anaemia. A partial (limited) exchange transfusion refers to manual removal of some of the individual's own blood, this is less effective in lowering the HbS level but is more easily performed when automated exchange is not available. In order to lower the HbS below 30 per cent, repeat partial exchange transfusions may be necessary.\n\n【17】A restrictive (conservative) transfusion policy involves giving a simple transfusion to reach a pre‐specified target haemoglobin.\n\n【18】A liberal (aggressive) transfusion policy involves giving a transfusion to reduce HbS percentage below a pre‐specified threshold. In people with SCD with severe anaemia 'simple' blood transfusions can lead to a significant reduction in HbS percentage without the need for an exchange transfusion. In a trial of people with SCD due to have an operation, 36% of participants randomised to the 'aggressive' transfusion arm (to reduce HbS percentage to 30 or below) were treated with a 'simple' transfusion pre‐operatively .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this overview\n\n【20】For people with SCD red cell transfusions can reduce end‐organ damage and be lifesaving by treating or preventing life‐threatening complications (e.g. treating acute aplastic crisis or preventing strokes in children), but it may also be associated with serious complications. There are many indications for transfusion therapy in SCD; however, because of the inherent risks, an understanding of the evidence for its use for specific SCD complications is required. There is also wide variation in transfusion practices in SCD and some indications for transfusion therapy have been studied in randomised controlled trials and others based on observational studies or anecdotal evidence . Several Cochrane reviews addressing SCD complications such as stroke , acute chest syndrome , chronic chest complications , and pre‐operative transfusions  have been published. Providing an overview of these reviews will make the information more accessible for people with SCD and health professionals.\n\n【21】In this overview we will identify gaps in the evidence base to inform recommendations for new systematic reviews and clinical trials research. We will also summarize evidence on reported outcomes to make recommendations for standardizing outcomes for new research and reviews. We will appraise the reviews and summarize their quality and strength of evidence and consider both common indications for transfusion as well as indications where transfusion is not commonly indicated but may be occasionally used. We will also consider the type of transfusion, restrictive or liberal, that may be most appropriate for a particular complication and whether transfusions are intermittent or chronic and used for prevention or treatment.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To summarize the evidence in Cochrane reviews of the effectiveness and safety of red cell transfusions versus no transfusion, or restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion, for treatment or prevention of complications experienced by people with SCD.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion\n\n【26】#### Types of reviews\n\n【27】We will include Cochrane reviews of randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials published in the _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_ part of _The Cochrane Library,_ that review the use of red cell blood transfusions for treatment or prevention of the various complications of SCD such as stroke, acute chest syndrome, chronic chest complications.\n\n【28】#### Participants\n\n【29】We will include Cochrane reviews of people of all ages with known SCD.\n\n【30】#### Interventions\n\n【31】We will include Cochrane reviews that compare the following.\n\n【32】1.  Red cell transfusions versus no red cell transfusions\n\n【33】2.  Red cell transfusions plus standard care versus standard care (e.g. analgesia, intravenous fluids, oxygen)\n\n【34】3.  Red cell transfusion versus disease‐modifying drug therapy (e.g. hydroxyurea)\n\n【35】4.  Restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) red cell transfusion strategy\n\n【36】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【37】1.  Mortality from any cause\n\n【38】2.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) as a result of sickle cell‐related complications (e.g. neurological, ophthalmological, respiratory, orthopaedic, vascular, hepatic or renal complications, vaso‐occlusive pain crisis, priapism, infections). We plan to report a summary count of total SAEs related to sickle cell‐related complications, as well as reporting the types of complications that make up this summary measure.\n\n【39】3.  Adverse events (serious and non‐serious) associated with transfusions (e.g. acute and delayed transfusion reactions, transfusion‐related acute lung injury, transfusion‐associated circulatory overload, transfusion‐associated dyspnoea, alloimmunisation, iron overload, problems of venous access). We plan to report a summary count of all adverse events related to transfusions, as well as reporting the types of complications that make up this summary measure.\n\n【40】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【41】1.  Other adverse events (AEs) as a result of sickle cell‐related complications.\n\n【42】2.  Red cell transfusion requirement (Number of units or millilitres required or number of red cell transfusion episodes)\n\n【43】3.  Quality of life (using validated instruments)\n\n【44】4.  Hospital length of stay including length of stay in critical care and hospital readmissions\n\n【45】### Search methods for identification of reviews\n\n【46】We will do a broad search of the _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_  using text words, sickle cell disease, blood, transfusion in the title, abstract and keywords and we will also use MeSH descriptors including,'anemia. sickle cell', 'erythrocyte transfusion'. We will focus on retrieving all relevant published systematic reviews and identify published protocols ( _see_ Appendix 1 for _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_ search strategy).\n\n【47】We plan to repeat this search biennially to update the overview in order to include new reviews and updates of included reviews.\n\n【48】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【49】#### Selection of reviews\n\n【50】Two authors will independently evaluate all reviews retrieved in the search for eligibility using the criteria listed in the Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion in the above section. We will resolve conflicts through discussion to arrive at a consensus or by using third party adjudication.\n\n【51】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【52】Two overview authors will independently extract data using the DistillerSR software . Data will be extracted on a form designed to summarise key characteristics of each review. We will abstract data on the objectives of each review, any diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria (e.g. participants, details of intervention, comparison, outcomes, type of trials and length of follow up), date of last search, frequency of updates, number of included trials, number of participants for each comparison and statistical outcome data. We will also include narrative text of the results if meta‐analyses using the Review Manager software are not available .\n\n【53】We will extract data from included reviews where possible, but we will contact the review authors or extract data from the relevant trials ourselves if information is missing or unclear. Data obtained from authors or studies will be integrated with data obtained from the review and the source of the data will be highlighted.\n\n【54】We will report these data in a series of summary tables including a 'Characteristics of included reviews' table, and also report details of the quality assessment of individual reviews in a table, as recommended in chapter 22 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ .\n\n【55】#### Assessment of methodological quality of included reviews\n\n【56】##### Methodological quality of included reviews\n\n【57】Two overview authors will assess the methodological quality of the included reviews using the 11 domains in AMSTAR ( Shea 2007 ; Appendix 2 ) and use these domains to interpret the results of the review. We will not exclude reviews based on their methodological quality. We will not conduct sensitivity analysis to explore the consequences of combining reviews of varying methodological quality because all included reviews are Cochrane reviews we are not expecting significant overlap between comparisons. A recent systematic review of the measurement properties of AMSTAR found that the interrater reliability of AMSTAR was very satisfactory . As more guidance is provided for its use, and additional validity studies that link systematic review methodological quality to the strength of conclusions , we will use AMSTAR in future updates of this overview until a more reliable tool becomes available. AMSTAR domains include:\n\n【58】1.  an _a priori_ design;\n\n【59】2.  duplicate review and data abstraction;\n\n【60】3.  a comprehensive search was performed;\n\n【61】4.  status of publication used as an inclusion criteria;\n\n【62】5.  a list of included and excluded studies provided;\n\n【63】6.  characteristics of included studies provided;\n\n【64】7.  scientific quality was assessed and documented;\n\n【65】8.  scientific quality was used appropriately in formulating conclusions;\n\n【66】9.  appropriate methods were used to combine the findings of trials;\n\n【67】10.  publication bias was assessed;\n\n【68】11.  conflict of interest included.\n\n【69】##### Quality of evidence in included reviews\n\n【70】Two overview authors will assess and summarize the quality of evidence included in the 'Summary of Findings Table' and the 'Risk of Bias' tables according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and recommendations in the _Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ , respectively . Assessments will include information on outcomes across studies and based on trial design, directness of evidence, precision and consistency of results, and publication bias. Where possible we will grade the outcomes based on assessments provided in the original reviews. Differences will be resolved through discussion or third party adjudication.\n\n【71】#### Data synthesis\n\n【72】Our unit of analysis will be the included systematic reviews. We will present all statistical outcome data if available, if this is not possible we will present data as a narrative synthesis. We will report the evidence for each intervention from the reviews using the GRADE approach . Comparisons presented will be determined by the data available in the reviews.\n\n【73】We will include an 'Overview of reviews' table which is in a format similar to the 'Summary of findings' table as recommended in chapter 22 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . These will include the primary outcomes of this overview for each intervention.\n\n【74】Where possible, data from reviews will be classified into subgroups based on:\n\n【75】*   the indication for red cell transfusion is for prevention or treatment of SCD complications;\n\n【76】*   acute or chronic red cell transfusions;\n\n【77】*   restrictive (to increase the total haemoglobin) or liberal (to decrease the haemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion;\n\n【78】*   by age of participants (children, adolescents, adults);\n\n【79】*   patient characteristics (i.e. pregnant, undergoing surgery, type of SCD).\n\n【80】We do not plan to conduct any indirect comparisons or network meta‐analyses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The main objective of this review is to determine the effect of antenatal breast examination(s) on the initiation of breastfeeding.\n\n【3】The secondary objectives of this review are to assess other potential effects of antenatal breast examination, such as providing opportunities to discuss breastfeeding with women and the detection of breast abnormalities.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Breast examination during pregnancy may be performed by a healthcare provider or by the pregnant woman herself. The rationale for antenatal breast examination has included the need to determine whether any problems with breastfeeding could be anticipated, using the time during examination as an opportunity for the healthcare provider to introduce and discuss the importance of breastfeeding, and for the detection of breast cancer during pregnancy. Despite these purported benefits of antenatal breast examination, whether there is evidence that it should be recommended for all pregnant women remains unclear.\n\n【7】Antenatal breast examination to determine whether any problems with breastfeeding could be anticipated typically included identification of the presence of flat or inverted nipples so that breast shells or nipple exercises (for example, Hoffman's exercises) could be prescribed to remedy the situation. Randomised controlled trials, however, have found that these interventions did not affect whether or not a woman was able to successfully breastfeed . Moreover, it was reported that 13% of the women approached during one of the trials who were intending to breastfeed decided not to breastfeed after being told that they had a potential problem . Therefore, antenatal breast examination for the purpose of treating flat or inverted nipples to prepare women for breastfeeding was not only found to be ineffective, but it may also act as a deterrent to breastfeeding. A Cochrane protocol assessing the effectiveness of nipple care on the duration of breastfeeding has been published .\n\n【8】More recently, in developed countries in particular, it has been hypothesised that as more women postpone childbirth until later in life, breast cancer in pregnancy will become an increasing concern . Thus, antenatal breast examination has been recommended as a screening method for breast cancer during pregnancy. In countries where national breast screening programmes are in place, however, it is only routinely offered to women aged 50 and older and usually through mammography rather than breast examination. Furthermore, no evidence has been found to support breast examination by a doctor, nurse or the women themselves as a primary screening technique for breast cancer .\n\n【9】Despite this lack of evidence, breast self examination (BSE) is encouraged and examination by a healthcare provider in the antenatal period continues to be recommended in some countries, such as the USA and Canada . While potential harms from BSE are less obvious, many women may find a clinical breast examination during pregnancy intrusive. In addition, breasts are often tender and swollen during pregnancy making examination difficult and potentially compounding a woman's feelings of uncomfortableness or vulnerability when the examination is conducted by a healthcare provider.\n\n【10】Although it is unclear how common the practice of antenatal breast examination is globally, it is clear that some countries continue to recommend antenatal breast examination. The aim of this review is to examine the effect of antenatal breast examination(s) on the promotion of breastfeeding.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】The main objective of this review is to determine the effect of antenatal breast examination(s) on the initiation of breastfeeding.\n\n【13】The secondary objectives of this review are to assess other potential effects of antenatal breast examination, such as providing opportunities to discuss breastfeeding with women and the detection of breast abnormalities.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】All randomised controlled trials of the effects of antenatal breast examination, with a concurrent comparison group, will be considered for inclusion.

However, this systematic review found only very limited evidence (one small trial) to support the use of one type of antifungal drug over another. Until this uncertainty is resolved with new large trials, clinicians may continue to base their choice of antifungal agent on data extrapolated from studies in older children and adults.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To summarize the effectiveness of interventions to increase the use of screening and brief intervention programmes for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by patients in primary care settings.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Alcohol is a risk factor for a wide range of physical and social harm, with the risk of harm increasing with the volume of alcohol consumption, the frequency of heavy drinking occasions and the volume of alcohol consumed during each drinking occasion . Estimates have suggested that at any one time at least 11% of the adult population in the United States  and at least 30% of the adult population in European countries are drinking alcohol at hazardous or harmful levels .\n\n【6】There is considerable evidence for the efficacy of general practice based screening and brief intervention programmes to reduce the risk of alcohol , with 5‐10 minutes of advice leading to at least a 10% to 16% reduction in alcohol consumption compared with control groups . Although these rates might seem low, they are important because the evidence suggests that such interventions are highly cost effective .\n\n【7】Despite the evidence for the efficacy and the cost effectiveness of brief interventions in primary health care, such interventions are rarely integrated into routine clinical practice , and clinical guidelines  are poorly adhered to . Although a high proportion of general practitioners state that they screen and intervene for alcohol problems , actual screening and intervention rates are low , and patients report that they rarely get asked about alcohol, even in the case of excessive drinkers .\n\n【8】General practitioners have reported that they find managing alcohol problems difficult ( Anderson in press ). They are less active in obtaining information about alcohol from their patients, rate reducing alcohol consumption as less important for health, and rate themselves as less prepared and less effective in advising their patients to reduce alcohol intake than in other areas of clinical prevention, such as tobacco dependence, weight control and promoting physical activity . It is therefore important to identify if it is possible to increase the engagement of primary care professionals specifically in the management of alcohol problems and to identify which strategies are most likely to be effective.\n\n【9】With the notable exception of the World Health Organization collaborative study on the implementation of screening and brief intervention programmes in primary health care , there appears to have been a lack of well‐designed research that examines the effectiveness of different strategies to enhance the engagement of general practitioners in managing alcohol problems . Available studies have suffered from both conceptual flaws (for example, lack of theoretical foundations and failure to incorporate behavioural change models) and technical flaws (for example, lack of control groups and appropriate and consistent outcome measures). Nevertheless, reviews have suggested that training which is skills based and interactional and which provides opportunities for practice and feedback to the trainee generally reports superior results compared to more traditional, static forms of education and training . Broad ranging, multi‐faceted approaches, which also entail structural changes, seem to be more effective than single issue training programs . Similarly, there is some evidence to support the value of on‐site support agents (for example, facilitators) to act as role models, coaches and colleagues in shared care arrangements for dealing with more sensitive and non‐traditional areas of care .\n\n【10】To fill a gap in the evidence base, it is proposed to undertake a systematic review of interventions to engage primary health care providers in the management of alcohol problems. Estimates of the effect sizes of the interventions will be made, predictors of effect will be studied, and, where they are available, cost and cost effectiveness of the interventions will be reported.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】To summarize the effectiveness of interventions to increase the use of screening and brief intervention programmes for hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption by patients in primary care settings.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【15】#### Types of studies\n\n【16】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies (ITSs)\n\n【17】#### Types of participants\n\n【18】The participants will be health care professionals (including physicians, nurses, psychologists, doctors' assistants and receptionists) working in primary health care (including general practice, family practice, health centres, and polyclinics, all of which usually provides first‐contact health care).\n\n【19】#### Types of interventions\n\n【20】The interventions will include those that are exclusively focused on alcohol as well as alcohol related interventions that are part of broader prevention and health promotion activities.\n\n【21】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【22】Objective measurements in the following domains: i) health professional performance including measurement of alcohol intake, screening, counselling, making a follow‐up and referral; and ii) client outcomes including numbers screened, numbers counselled, numbers referred, changes in alcohol consumption over time, numbers drinking within recommended alcohol consumption limits, and physiological measures i.e. reduction in serum gamma glutamyl transferase.

It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment or compared with other pharmacological interventions.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQL), patient‐reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in _italics_ .\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We included eight RCTs (474 randomised participants), which compared oral corticosteroids with placebo or no intervention. All trials only recruited adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All trials reported outcomes at two to three weeks, at the end of the short‐course oral steroid treatment period. Three trials additionally reported outcomes at three to six months. Two of these studies prescribed intranasal steroids to patients in both arms of the trial at the end of the oral steroid treatment period.\n\n【13】**Oral steroids _versus_ placebo or no intervention**\n\n【14】_**Disease‐specific health‐related quality of life**_ was reported by one study. This study reported improved quality of life after treatment (two to three weeks) in the group receiving oral steroids compared with the group who received placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.92 to ‐0.56, 40 participants, modified RSOM‐31), which corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be _low quality_ (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect).\n\n【15】_**Disease severity**_ as measured by patient‐reported symptom scores was reported by two studies, which allowed the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, hyposmia) to be combined into one score. The results at the end of treatment (two to three weeks) showed an improvement in patients receiving oral steroids compared to placebo, both when presented as a mean final value (SMD ‐2.84, 95% CI ‐4.09 to ‐1.59, 22 participants) and as a change from baseline (SMD ‐2.28, 95% CI ‐2.76 to ‐1.80, 114 participants). These correspond to large effect sizes but we assessed the evidence to be _low quality._\n\n【16】One study (114 participants) followed patients for 10 weeks after the two‐week treatment period. All patients in both arms received intranasal steroids at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. The results showed that the initial results after treatment were not sustained (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.15, 114 participants, percentage improvement from baseline). This corresponds to a small effect size and we assessed the evidence to be _low quality._\n\n【17】There was an increase in _**adverse events**_ in people receiving orals steroids compared with placebo for gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.78; 187 participants; three studies) and insomnia (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.95; 187 participants; three studies). There was no significant impact of oral steroids on mood disturbances at the dosage used in the included study (risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 0.55 to 11.41; 40 participants; one study). We assessed the evidence to be _low quality_ due to the lack of definitions of the adverse events and the small number of events or sample size, or both).\n\n【18】**Other comparisons**\n\n【19】No studies that compared short‐course oral steroids with other treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【20】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【21】At the end of the treatment course (two to three weeks) there is an improvement in health‐related quality of life and symptom severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps taking oral corticosteroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding is _low._ At three to six months after the end of the oral steroid treatment period, there is little or no improvement in health‐related quality of life or symptom severity for patients taking an initial course of oral steroids compared with placebo or no treatment.\n\n【22】The data on the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids indicate that there may be an increase in insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances but it is not clear whether there is an increase in mood disturbances. All of the adverse events results are based on _low quality_ evidence.\n\n【23】More research in this area, particularly research evaluating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, longer‐term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.\n\n【24】There is no evidence for oral steroids compared with other treatments.\n### PICOs\n\n【25】###### Populatio\n\n【26】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Nasal Polyp\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Chronic Rhinosinusitis\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【27】###### Interventio\n\n【28】*   Corticosteroids - Otological\n*   Nasal\n*   Prednisone\n*   Oral\n*   Methylprednisolone\n*   Hydrocortisone\n*   Prednisolone\n*   Cortisone\n\n【29】###### Compariso\n\n【30】*   Corticosteroids - Otological\n*   Nasal\n*   Placebo\n\n【31】###### Outcom\n\n【32】*   Rhinorrhea\n*   Nasal Obstruction\n*   Mood disturbance\n*   Facial Pain\n*   Insomnia\n*   Nasal Polyp\n*   Chronic Rhinosinusitis\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Anosmia\n*   Nasal Discharge\n*   Nasal Congestion\n*   Cough\n\n【33】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis experience at least two or more of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks: blocked nose, discharge from their nose or runny nose, pain or pressure in their face and/or a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). Some people will also have nasal polyps, which are grape‐like swellings of the normal nasal lining inside the nasal passage and sinuses.\n\n【39】Short courses of oral corticosteroids are a widely used treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. They work by controlling the inflammatory response and when polyps are present they rapidly reduce the size of the polyps to improve symptoms. The adverse effects of corticosteroids can include insomnia, mood changes and gastrointestinal changes (such as stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting). When given over the longer term, or through many repeated short courses, it is also possible to develop osteoporosis (fragile bones).\n\n【40】**Study characteristics**\n\n【41】This review includes evidence up to 11 August 2015. We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 474 participants. All of the patients were adults who had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All of the studies followed patients until the end of treatment (two to three weeks) and three studies (210 participants) followed up people for three to six months after the initial treatment had ended. Five of the eight reports mentioned how the trial was funded. None of the funding sources were pharmaceutical companies.\n\n【42】**Key results**\n\n【43】At the end of a two‐ or three‐week treatment course, people who took oral steroids may have had a better quality of life, less severe symptoms and smaller nasal polyps than people who had placebo or did not receive any treatment. After three to six months, there was little or no difference in quality of life, symptom severity or nasal polyps between the people who had oral steroids and the people who had placebo or no intervention.\n\n【44】The people who took oral steroids may have had more gastrointestinal disturbances and insomnia than the people who had placebo or no intervention. It is not clear if the people who took oral steroids had more mood disturbances than the people who had placebo or no intervention.\n\n【45】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【46】We judged the quality of the evidence for oral steroids plus intranasal steroids for adults with nasal polyps to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the estimate), as the some of the results are only from one or two studies, which do not have a lot of participants. Most of the trials do not have a high risk of bias, but only people with nasal polyps were included in the review.\n\n【47】--------------\n\n【48】Authors' conclusions\n### Implications for practice\n\n【49】The results of this review, current to August 2015, show that there is low quality evidence (we are uncertain about the estimates) to suggest that, for people with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, adding oral corticosteroids is beneficial in reducing the size of the polyps and probably also in reducing symptom severity when compared to placebo. The quality of the evidence for adverse effects was very low; some studies did not report these well and there were no data on important longer‐term effects. The results for longer‐term outcomes, which are important to determine whether there is sustained benefit, suggest that the difference between the groups becomes smaller, but the evidence is inconclusive due its low quality. No evidence was found for people with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps.\n\n【50】Short‐course oral corticosteroids alone for chronic rhinosinusitis have potential short‐term benefits with tolerated side effects. However, the beneficial effect of a short course of treatment is unlikely to persist, hence the need for additional, ongoing topical treatment. Occasional, intermittent courses of oral corticosteroids may have a place within a long‐term treatment strategy. Clear guidance on how short courses of oral corticosteroids can be used alone or as an adjunct to long‐term topical treatment should be provided for use in both primary and secondary care.\n\n【51】### Implications for research\n\n【52】There is clearly room for more trials with adequate outcomes for the population being addressed to further underline the role of short‐term oral steroids, including trials that assess the choice of agent and dosing/duration. There are two scenarios where further research would be very valuable:\n\n【53】*   Upon entry to secondary care. When patients are initially referred to secondary care, they are likely to have symptoms that have not responded well to the treatment normally prescribed in primary care (intranasal steroids and nasal irrigation). The aim of research would be to determine whether a short course of oral steroid treatment would allow the patient to regain control of their symptoms and whether oral steroids may reduce the need for surgical intervention.\n\n【54】*   As a rescue medication, when patients who are on existing topical treatments have an exacerbation of symptoms related to chronic rhinosinusitis. The aim of the research would be to determine whether a short course of oral steroids would allow the quick relief of symptoms.\n\n【55】Future research should recruit patients with chronic rhinosinusitis diagnosed using the EPOS 2012 criteria and include both patients with and without nasal polyps (stratified randomisation by subgroup). Oral steroids should be given for between one and three weeks at an appropriate dose. The primary outcomes should be relevant to patients and any disease‐specific instruments should be validated in people with chronic rhinosinusitis. Endoscopic evaluation should not be chosen as a primary outcome because the correlation between endoscopic results and patient symptoms is unclear. Adverse events should be defined in the protocol and measured during treatment and in the follow‐up period.\n\n【56】In addition to measuring outcomes at the end of oral corticosteroid treatment, future trials should follow up patients and measure outcomes for at least six months.\n\n【57】This review is one of a suite of reviews of medical treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis, each of which features its own research recommendations. Across all reviews, key features of future research are as follows:\n\n【58】*   Trials should be adequately powered and imbalances in prognostic factors (for example, prior sinus surgery) must be accounted for in the statistical analysis.\n\n【59】*   Study participants should be diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis using the EPOS 2012 criteria and should primarily be recruited based on their symptoms. Different patient phenotypes (that is, those with and without nasal polyps) should be recognised and trials should use stratified randomisation within these subgroups or focus on one or other of the phenotypes.\n\n【60】*   Studies should focus on outcomes that are important to patients and use validated instruments to measure these. Validated chronic rhinosinusitis‐specific health‐related quality of life questionnaires exist, for example the Sino‐Nasal Outcome Test‐22 (SNOT‐22). Patients may find dichotomised outcomes easiest to interpret; for example the percentage of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) or improvement for that outcome. Such MCIDs or cut‐off points should be included in the study protocol and clearly outlined in the methods section.\n\n【61】*   Trials and other high‐quality studies should use consistent outcomes and adhere to reporting guidelines, such as CONSORT, so that results can be compared across future trials. The development of a standardised set of outcomes, or core outcome set, for chronic rhinosinusitis, agreed by researchers, clinicians and patients, will facilitate this process.\n\n【62】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【63】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

The other possible symptoms include facial pain/pressure, reduction or loss of sense of smell (in adults) or cough (in children). Symptoms must have continued for at least 12 weeks. In addition, people must have either mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses as evidenced by a computerised tomography (CT) scan and/or endoscopic signs of at least one of the following: nasal polyps, mucopurulent discharge primarily from middle meatus or oedema/mucosal obstruction primarily in the middle meatus .\n\n【77】Chronic rhinosinusitis represents a common source of ill health; 11% of UK adults reported chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms in a worldwide population study . Symptoms, including nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain, anosmia and sleep disturbance, have a major impact on quality of life, reportedly greater in several domains of the SF‐36 than angina or chronic respiratory disease . Acute exacerbations, inadequate symptom control and respiratory disease exacerbation are common. Complications are rare, but may include visual impairment and intracranial infection.\n\n【78】Two major phenotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis have been identified based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps on examination. Nasal polyps are tumour‐like hyperplastic swellings of the nasal mucosa, most commonly originating from within the ostiomeatal complex . Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is diagnosed when polyps are seen (on direct or endoscopic examination) bilaterally in the middle meatus. The acronym CRSsNP is used for the condition in which no polyps are present.\n\n【79】Although the aetiology of chronic rhinosinusitis is not fully understood, it may involve abnormalities in the host response to irritants, commensal and pathogenic organisms and allergens, obstruction of sinus drainage pathways, abnormalities of normal mucociliary function, loss of the normal mucosal barrier or infection. Two typical profiles may be observed with respect to inflammatory mediators; in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, which is typically associated with nasal polyps, high levels of eosinophils, immunoglobulin E (IgE) and interleukin (IL)‐5 may be found, while in neutrophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, more often associated with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps, neutrophils predominate, with elevated interferon (IFN) gamma, IL‐8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) .\n\n【80】While treatment decisions should be made based on an understanding of the patient's chronic rhinosinusitis phenotype and likely aetiology, in practice treatment may be initiated without knowledge of the polyp status, particularly in primary care. This review (and most of its companion reviews) consider patients with and without polyps together in the initial evaluation of treatment effects. However, subgroup analyses explore potential differences between them .\n\n【81】The most commonly used interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis are used either topically (sprayed into the nose) or systemically (by mouth) and include steroids, antibiotics and saline.\n\n【82】### Description of the intervention\n\n【83】Short courses of oral steroids are widely used in medicine for a variety of inflammatory conditions. In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis they are often used with a view to gaining a rapid improvement in symptoms and to allow improved access for topically applied agents. They are typically given over a seven‐ to 21‐day period and may be at a fixed dose or incorporate a reducing dose over the course. This strategy is thought to reduce the risk of adverse effects . A wide spectrum of adverse events are reported with systemic steroid usage ; however, data on the incidence in association with chronic rhinosinusitis are lacking. While it is possible to extrapolate findings from trials in other diseases, there is a risk that the incidence is disease‐specific; for example, a high incidence of avascular necrosis is seen with high‐dose steroid use in systemic lupus erythematosus, which is in part attributed to the underlying disease process and severity as well as the higher dosages prescribed in severe disease .\n\n【84】Table 1. Summary of the most commonly reported side effects of systemic steroids\n\n| **System**  | **Adverse events**  | **Notes**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Musculoskeletal  | Osteoporosis  | Largely limited to long‐term use Significantly increased risk of fractures with prolonged use  |\n| Musculoskeletal  | Osteonecrosis  | Rare, appears to be dose‐dependent  |\n| Endocrine  | Hyperglycaemia  | Common; dose‐dependent, usually reversible  |\n| Cardiovascular  | Hypertension  | Common; dose‐dependent, usually reversible  |\n| Dermatological  | Striae, bruising  | Dose‐dependent; occurs after > 1 month usage  |\n| Ophthalmological  | Cataracts  | Irreversible; largely related to long‐term usage  |\n| Ophthalmological  | Glaucoma  | High risk with pre‐existing disease  |\n| Gastrointestinal tract  | Peptic ulceration  | Increased risk largely due to concomitant NSAIDs  |\n| Psychological  | Psychosis  | Common; increased risk with dosages > 40 mg/day  |\n\n【86】References: Da Silva 2006 ; Naber 1996 ; Stanbury 1998\n\n【87】NSAIDs: non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs\n\n【88】Adverse effects associated with short‐term oral steroid use are said to include gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia and altered mental states. However, there are few or no published data on the frequency of these effects when short‐term courses are prescribed. Adverse effects associated with long _‐_ term use of oral steroids are also listed in Table 1 .\n\n【89】### How the intervention might work\n\n【90】Short courses of oral steroids are most often used in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The intention is to reduce the inflammation in order to produce a rapid reduction in the size of the polyps, to improve symptoms and allow better penetration of topical treatments into the nasal cavity. They may be used in a similar way for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps, who have severe nasal obstruction or complete anosmia (loss of sense of smell). The initial effect of treatment is expected to be immediate. Any observed improvement may continue, especially if one effect of the intervention is to improve the bio‐availability of an adjunct treatment.\n\n【91】There is, however, a lack of evidence regarding the optimal treatment regimen of oral steroids with respect to indication, dose and duration. The optimum usage of steroids is clinically important as it may reduce the need for surgery by providing good symptomatic control.\n\n【92】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【93】Short courses of oral steroids are widely used either alone or as a form of add‐on therapy in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. This review and a closely related new review of 'Short‐course oral steroids as an adjunct therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis', Head 2016a , update and expand a previous Cochrane review that looked at this treatment in patients with polyps . This review seeks to establish the effectiveness of oral steroids (compared to no treatment or placebo) and their relative effectiveness compared to other commonly used agents for chronic rhinosinusitis (such as intranasal corticosteroids). In contrast, the companion review tries to establish the additional benefits (and harms) of steroids when added on to existing therapies for chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\n【94】This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews looking at common management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis , and we use the same outcome measures across the reviews. We have not included studies designed to evaluate interventions in the immediate peri‐surgical period, which are focused on assessing the impact of the intervention on the surgical procedure or on modifying the post‐surgical results (preventing relapse).\n\n【95】Objectives\nTo assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\n【96】Methods\n### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【97】#### Types of studies\n\n【98】We **included** studies with the following design characteristics:\n\n【99】*   randomised controlled trials, including cluster‐randomised trials and quasi‐randomised trials (cross‐over trials were only to be included if the data from the first phase were available); and\n\n【100】*   patients were followed up for at least two weeks.\n\n【101】We **excluded** studies with the following design characteristics:\n\n【102】*   randomised patients by side of nose (within‐patient controlled) because it is difficult to ensure that the effects of any of the interventions considered can be localised; or\n\n【103】*   perioperative studies, where the sole purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of the intervention on surgical outcome.\n\n【104】#### Types of participants\n\n【105】Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, whether with polyps or without polyps.\n\n【106】We excluded studies that included a majority of patients with:\n\n【107】*   cystic fibrosis;\n\n【108】*   allergic fungal sinusitis/eosinophilic fungal/mucinous rhinosinusitis;\n\n【109】*   aspirin‐exacerbated respiratory disease;\n\n【110】*   antrochoanal polyps (benign polyps originating from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus);\n\n【111】*   malignant polyps;\n\n【112】*   primary ciliary dyskinesia;\n\n【113】*   gross immunodeficiency (congenital or acquired);\n\n【114】*   a history of surgery for nasal polyps within six weeks of entry to the study.\n\n【115】#### Types of interventions\n\n【116】We included all short  courses of oral steroids, regardless of dose.

The choice of agent has also been influenced by the quality of sedation and analgesia as well as by concerns about possible detrimental effects on reproductive outcomes.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness and safety of different methods of conscious sedation and analgesia on pain relief and pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (from their inception to present); the National Research Register and Current Controlled Trials. We searched reference lists of included studies for relevant studies and contacted authors for information on unpublished and ongoing trials. There was no language restriction. The search was updated in July 2012.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Only randomised controlled trials comparing different methods of conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during oocyte recovery were included.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Interventions were classified and analysed under broad categories or strategies of sedation and pain relief to compare different methods and administrative protocols of conscious sedation and analgesia. Outcomes were extracted and the data were pooled when appropriate.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】With this update, nine new studies were identified resulting in a total of 21 trials including 2974 women undergoing oocyte retrieval. These trials compared five different categories of conscious sedation and analgesia: 1) conscious sedation and analgesia versus placebo; 2) conscious sedation and analgesia versus other active interventions such as general and acupuncture anaesthesia; 3) conscious sedation and analgesia plus paracervical block versus other active interventions such as general, spinal and acupuncture anaesthesia; 4) patient‐controlled conscious sedation and analgesia versus physician‐administered conscious sedation and analgesia; and 5) conscious sedation and analgesia with different agents or dosage. Evidence was generally of low quality, mainly due to poor reporting of methods, small sample sizes and inconsistency between the trials.\n\n【12】Conflicting results were shown for women's experience of pain. Compared to conscious sedation alone, more effective pain relief was reported when conscious sedation was combined with electro‐acupuncture: intra‐operative pain mean difference (MD) on 1 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) of 3.00 (95% CI 2.23 to 3.77); post‐operative pain MD in VAS units of 2.10 (95% CI 1.40 to 2.80; N = 61, one trial, low quality evidence); or paracervical block (MD not calculable).\n\n【13】The pooled data of four trials showed a significantly lower intra‐operative pain score with conscious sedation plus paracervical block than with electro‐acupuncture plus paracervical block (MD on 10‐point VAS of ‐0.66; 95% CI ‐0.93 to ‐0.39; N = 781, 4 trials, low quality evidence) with significant statistical heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 76%). Patient‐controlled sedation and analgesia was associated with more intra‐operative pain than physician‐administered sedation and analgesia (MD on 10‐point VAS of 0.60; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.03; N = 379, 4 trials, low quality evidence) with high statistical heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 83%). Post‐operative pain was reported in only nine studies. As different types and dosages of sedative and analgesic agents, as well as administrative protocols and assessment tools, were used in these trials the data should be interpreted with caution.\n\n【14】There was no evidence of a significant difference in pregnancy rate in the 12 studies which assessed this outcome, and pooled data of four trials comparing electro‐acupuncture combined with paracervical block with conscious sedation and analgesia plus paracervical block showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.29; N = 783, 4 trials) for pregnancy. High levels of women's satisfaction were reported for all modalities of conscious sedation and analgesia as assessed in 12 studies. Meta‐analysis of all the studies was not attempted due to considerable heterogeneity.\n\n【15】For the rest of the trials a descriptive summary of the outcomes was presented.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】The evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. The simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. The various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. As women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.\n### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Populatio\n\n【19】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   In Vitro Fertilization\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n\n【20】###### Interventio\n\n【21】*   Conscious Sedation\n*   Administration Of Analgesic\n\n【22】###### Compariso\n\n【23】*   Spinal Anesthesia\n*   Paracervical Block Anesthesia\n*   Patient Controlled Analgesia\n*   Placebo\n*   General Anesthesia\n*   Acupuncture\n*   Sedation\n\n【24】###### Outcom\n\n【25】*   Postoperative Complication\n*   Postoperative Pain\n*   Livebirth\n*   Clinical Pregnancy\n*   Postoperative Nausea And Vomiting\n*   Intraoperative Pain\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There have been concerns that the drugs used for sedation and pain relief may have an adverse effect on pregnancy rates. This review identified 21 randomised controlled trials, involving 2974 women, comparing the effects of five different methods of conscious sedation and pain relief including general anaesthesia. We found insufficient evidence to support any one method as being superior to others in terms of pain relief or pregnancy outcomes. The mainstay of pain relief is the use of opioid drugs. Most of the methods seemed to work well and the effect was usually enhanced by addition of another method such as pain relief with paracervical block, which involves a local anaesthetic agent being injected in the cervix prior to egg retrieval. Women reported a high degree of acceptability and satisfaction associated with the various methods that were assessed in this review. Evidence was generally of low quality, mainly due to poor reporting of methods, small sample sizes and inconsistency between the trials. As women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised.\n\n【29】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Options include intermittent urethral catheterisation, indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation, timed voiding, use of external catheter (for men), drug treatment, augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】The primary objective was to determine the effects of different methods of managing long‐term voiding problems (persisting after three months) with catheters in patients with neurogenic bladder.\n\n【4】Specific hypotheses to be addressed included:  \n1\\. that intermittent catheterisation is better than indwelling catheterisation;  \n2\\. that indwelling urethral catheterisation is better than suprapubic catheterisation;  \n3\\. that external (sheath) catheters are better than indwelling or intermittent urethral catheters;  \n4\\. that external (sheath) catheters are better than suprapubic catheters;  \n5\\. that intermittent catheterisation is better than timed voiding.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register , which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearched journals and conference proceedings. We sought additional trials from other sources such as the reference lists of relevant articles and by contacting consultants in Spinal Cord Injury Centres throughout the United Kingdom.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing methods of using catheters to manage urinary voiding in people with neurogenic bladder.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Abstracts were independently inspected by the reviewers and full papers were obtained where necessary.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Approximately 400 studies were scrutinised. No trials were found that met the inclusion criteria, and five studies were excluded from the review.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Despite a comprehensive search no evidence from randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials was found. It was not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the use of different types of catheter in managing the neurogenic bladder.\n\n【15】### Catheter policies for management of long‐term voiding problems in adults with nerve damage affecting the bladder\n\n【16】People with nerve damage affecting the bladder may have incontinence (leakage of urine) or an inability to empty the bladder (voiding problem). This may cause infections or damage to the kidneys. Treatments include a permanent urinary catheter; using a catheter intermittently whenever the bladder needs to be emptied; an external sheath catheter fitted to the penis; or timed voiding, which involves regular emptying of the bladder at timed intervals. Although all these methods are used in practice, the review found that no randomised trials have been conducted to provide good evidence to suggest which is best and in which circumstances.\n\n【17】--------------\n\n【18】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【19】### Implications for practice\n\n【20】Despite a thorough search for evidence relating to the effectiveness of different catheter policies in adults with neurogenic bladder no evidence was found. This review cannot therefore offer any evidence‐based guidelines for practice.\n\n【21】### Implications for research\n\n【22】Catheter use in persons with neurogenic bladder is heavily influenced by prior surgical or other invasive intervention, by factors such as the dynamic nature of the pathophysiology of the neurogenic bladder, the degree of loss of neurological function, the availability of carers and above all by individual preference. Before proposing that randomised controlled trials be carried out in this area, we recommend that a further systematic review be conducted that would cover surgical and pharmacological interventions in the management of neurogenic bladder.\n\n【23】Background\n----------\n\n【24】Neurogenic bladder comprises any dysfunctional condition of the urinary bladder caused by a spinal cord injury (SCI) or other lesion or disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The prevalence of the condition is unknown, but the estimated annual incidence of acute SCI is 40 per million population . Multiple sclerosis is a common neurological disease. A joint World Health Organization (WHO)/Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF) survey, conducted during 2005 to 2007, estimated a worldwide median prevalence of 30 per 100 000 (range 5‐80) .\n\n【25】SCI primarily affects young males, whereas young women are more likely to develop multiple sclerosis (female : male sex ratio 1 : 4 and 2.5 : 1, respectively). The permanent paralysis that often results leads to major disability and significant economic cost . Life expectancy may be reduced, particularly in the absence of optimal medical care. As well as respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and pressure sores, long‐term consequences of damage to the CNS include urinary tract complications (loss of bladder control leading to infections and impaired renal function). Even in developed countries where those affected have access to advanced treatment and management options, social problems can arise from difficulties in maintaining bladder function.\n\n【26】The effects of SCI on bladder function depend on the location of the injury on the spinal cord. Two types of bladder dysfunction may occur, automatic (hyperreflexic) bladder and flaccid (areflexic) bladder.\n\n【27】### Automatic (hyperreflexic) bladder (detrusor overactivity)\n\n【28】When injury occurs above the reflex voiding centre in the sacral portion of the spinal cord (effectively at T12 or above), hyperreflexic paralysis of the bladder (also known as 'automatic bladder') usually results. The person loses both the sensation that they need to void and their voluntary, co‐ordinated control over the reflex voiding centre. When the bladder becomes sufficiently full for the stretch receptors in the detrusor muscle to be activated, uncontrolled, spontaneous bladder contraction is stimulated through the simple reflex arcs. The automatic bladder often does not empty efficiently. Spasm of the bladder outlet muscle (sphincter) can prevent the complete expulsion of urine, resulting in bladder overextension. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) is a combination of detrusor hyperreflexia and sphincteric hypertonicity. While the latter can be alleviated by sphincterotomy (an operation to cut the external sphincter of the bladder outlet), this can increase the risk of incontinence and compromise sexual function in males.\n\n【29】### Flaccid (areflexic) bladder (acontractile detrusor)\n\n【30】Areflexic or flaccid paralysis of the bladder is usually caused by a lower motor neurone lumbosacral lesion, with damage to the reflex voiding centre in the sacral portion of the spinal cord. Reflex activity and bladder activity are diminished and overdistension of the bladder usually results.\n\n【31】### Management of the neurogenic bladder\n\n【32】Problems arising from detrusor and/or sphincter dysfunction in addition to urinary incontinence can include recurrent kidney infections and high back pressure on the kidneys. Ultimately, both of these can lead to serious renal disease.\n\n【33】Management of the neurogenic bladder, therefore, has the primary objectives of maintaining continence, ensuring low bladder pressure (to avoid renal damage) and avoiding or minimising infection. Management options include intermittent urethral catheterisation, indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation, timed voiding, use of an external catheter (for men), augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion. A number of pharmacological interventions including anticholinergic drugs are also used , particularly in people with multiple sclerosis. The type, site and extent of neurological impairment, and the type of help available, will clearly influence the choice of management option.\n\n【34】Some of the above options have already been or are the subject of other Cochrane reviews . The current review was therefore confined to the use of urinary catheters and external (sheath) catheters by people with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.\n\n【35】The aim of our review was to compare the effectiveness of these different management options for the neurogenic bladder in terms of urinary function (in both the short and long term), but taking account of other factors such as ease of use, comfort and cost, which may influence choice of catheter policy. Provided that a sufficient number of trials of adequate quality has been conducted, the most reliable evidence is likely to come from the consideration of all well‐designed randomised controlled trials.\n\n【36】We hoped that providing an easily accessible, periodically updated, comprehensive systematic review of such trials would help not only to identify optimal practice, but to also highlight gaps in the evidence base.\n\n【37】Objectives\n----------\n\n【38】The primary objective was to determine the effects of different methods of managing long‐term voiding problems (persisting after three months) with catheters in patients with neurogenic bladder.\n\n【39】Specific hypotheses to be addressed included:  \n1\\. that intermittent catheterisation is better than indwelling catheterisation;  \n2\\. that indwelling urethral catheterisation is better than suprapubic catheterisation;  \n3\\. that external (sheath) catheters are better than indwelling or intermittent urethral catheters;  \n4\\. that external (sheath) catheters are better than suprapubic catheters;  \n5\\. that intermittent catheterisation is better than timed voiding.\n\n【40】Methods\n-------\n\n【41】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【42】#### Types of studies\n\n【43】All randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing methods of using catheters to manage urinary voiding in people with neurogenic bladder.\n\n【44】#### Types of participants\n\n【45】Adults in hospitals, nursing homes and the community with neurogenic bladder persisting after three months for whom catheters are an option for long‐term management, whether or not they have had surgery or another invasive procedure.\n\n【46】#### Types of interventions\n\n【47】*   Indwelling urethral catheter\n\n【48】*   Intermittent urethral catheter\n\n【49】*   Indwelling suprapubic catheter\n\n【50】*   Intermittent suprapubic catheter\n\n【51】*   Timed voiding\n\n【52】*   External (sheath) catheter\n\n【53】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【54】The primary outcomes were episodes of urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary tract infection and long‐term renal function.

Date of the most recent search April 2014.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized trials of smoking cessation with follow‐up of at least six months, where at least one arm tested a print‐based self‐help intervention. We defined self help as structured programming for smokers trying to quit without intensive contact with a therapist.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the nature of the self‐help materials, the amount of face‐to‐face contact given to intervention and to control conditions, outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow‐up.\n\n【10】The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow‐up in people smoking at baseline. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates when available. Where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis using a fixed‐effect model.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We identified 74 trials which met the inclusion criteria. Many study reports did not include sufficient detail to judge risk of bias for some domains. Twenty‐eight studies (38%) were judged at high risk of bias for one or more domains but the overall risk of bias across all included studies was judged to be moderate, and unlikely to alter the conclusions.\n\n【13】Thirty‐four trials evaluated the effect of standard, non‐tailored self‐help materials. Pooling 11 of these trials in which there was no face‐to‐face contact and provision of structured self‐help materials was compared to no intervention gave an estimate of benefit that just reached statistical significance (n = 13,241, risk ratio \\[RR\\] 1.19, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 1.04 to 1.37). This analysis excluded two trials with strongly positive outcomes that introduced significant heterogeneity. Six further trials without face‐to‐face contact in which the control group received alternative written materials did not show evidence for an effect of the smoking self‐help materials (n = 7023, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04). When these two subgroups were pooled, there was no longer evidence for a benefit of standard structured materials (n = 20,264, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18). We failed to find evidence of benefit from providing standard self‐help materials when there was brief contact with all participants (5 trials, n = 3866, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42), or face‐to‐face advice for all participants (11 trials, n = 5365, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18).\n\n【14】Thirty‐one trials offered materials tailored for the characteristics of individual smokers, with controls receiving either no materials, or stage matched or non‐tailored materials. Most of the trials used more than one mailing. Pooling these showed a benefit of tailored materials (n = 40,890, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.37) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 32%). The evidence is strongest for the subgroup of nine trials in which tailored materials were compared to no intervention (n = 13,437, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.53), but also supports tailored materials as more helpful than standard materials. Part of this effect could be due to the additional contact or assessment required to obtain individual data, since the subgroup of 10 trials where the number of contacts was matched did not detect an effect (n = 11,024, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20). In two trials including a direct comparison between tailored materials and brief advice from a health care provider, there was no evidence of a difference, but confidence intervals were wide (n = 2992, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49).\n\n【15】Only four studies evaluated self‐help materials as an adjunct to nicotine replacement therapy, with no evidence of additional benefit (n = 2291, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25). A small number of other trials failed to detect benefits from using additional materials or targeted materials, or to find differences between different self‐help programmes.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Standard, print‐based self‐help materials increase quit rates compared to no intervention, but the effect is likely to be small. We did not find evidence that they have an additional benefit when used alongside other interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy. There is evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than non‐tailored materials, although the absolute size of effect is still small. Available evidence tested self‐help interventions in high income countries; further research is needed to investigate their effect in contexts where more intensive support is not available.\n### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Populatio\n\n【19】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Smoker\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Interventio\n\n【21】*   Written information about smoking cessation\n*   Self-care Interventions\n\n【22】###### Compariso\n\n【23】*   Usual Care\n*   Waiting list control\n\n【24】###### Outcom\n\n【25】*   Tobacco abstinence\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【27】### Do printed self‐help materials containing information about how to give up smoking help people to quit\n\n【28】**Background**\n\n【29】We reviewed the evidence that printed materials giving structured advice about how to stop smoking help people to quit. We looked for trials of any type of printed self‐help material which gave structured support and advice about quitting. We also included materials in audio or video format but we did not include internet programmes or other formats. Trials had to include people who smoked, but they did not need to be currently trying to give up. We were interested in the number of people who were not smoking at least 6 months from the time when materials were provided. Some trials mailed materials on more than one occasion. Some trials gathered information about smoking history and habits in order to provide materials which were individually tailored to the characteristics of the smoker (tailored materials). In some trials, there was no face‐to‐face contact, and the materials were the only support. Other trials gave everyone advice and were designed to test whether there was any additional benefit from providing written materials.\n\n【30】**Study characteristics**\n\n【31】This evidence is current to April 2014. We identified 74 studies. Most of them took place in North America or Europe and were conducted in adults. Most studies did not require that people wanted to quit smoking in order to join. Although some studies were judged to be at possible risk of bias, mainly because the papers did not report the methods in detail, this did not affect the overall conclusions from the review.\n\n【32】**Key results**\n\n【33】Based on 11 studies with over 21,000 participants, there was evidence of a small benefit of printed non‐tailored structured self‐help materials when provided without any other contact. The likelihood of quitting was increased by about 20%. If self help was compared to even a brief pamphlet about smoking (6 studies), there was no evidence of additional benefit from structured materials. When self‐help materials were provided in addition to brief face‐to‐face contact (5 studies) or advice (11 studies), there was no longer any evidence of additional benefit compared to the effect of contact or advice alone.\n\n【34】We found 31 trials which provided written materials that were individually tailored. Some studies compared these to no materials and some to non‐tailored materials. There was evidence based on 9 studies with over 13,000 participants that tailored materials were of more benefit than no materials. There was also weaker evidence from an additional 22 studies that tailored materials were of more benefit than non‐tailored materials.\n\n【35】**Conclusions**\n\n【36】The size of benefit from self‐help materials is small, with only about 1 additional successful quitter expected from 100 people receiving materials with no other support. Studies of this type often sent materials to people who were not trying to quit, and the number of successful quitters was low. Most studies also took place in countries where more intensive support was available for people wanting to quit (for example, counselling). People were more likely to make successful quit attempts when they had face‐to‐face support, but in these studies giving materials did not help increase success further. People who choose to use materials may find them helpful, especially if more intensive support is not available to them, but people who want to quit should be encouraged to seek more intensive support if it is available.\n\n【37】--------------\n\n【38】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【39】### Implications for practice\n\n【40】Access to information, in understandable formats, is important for individuals who smoke, as it is for those with other kinds of medical problem. This review examined the specific effect of materials which aimed to provide a structured approach to smoking cessation beyond simple information. Such materials may provide a very small increase in quitting compared to no intervention. We did not find evidence that self‐help materials produce incremental benefits over other minimal interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy. There is increasing evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than no intervention, and more effective than non‐tailored materials, although the absolute increase in quit rates is still small.\n\n【41】### Implications for research\n\n【42】Almost all included studies were conducted in high income countries; future research should examine the effects of print‐based self‐help in contexts where more intensive support may not be available. In addition, future research in this field is likely to focus on ways of further individualizing self‐help materials, delivered in a variety of formats.\n\n【43】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【44】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Globally, tobacco smoking is currently estimated to cause the death of about five million tobacco users a year, but this is expected to rise to over eight million within the next 20 years. More than 80% of these deaths are projected to occur in low‐ and middle‐ income countries . The adverse health effects from tobacco use include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer.\n\n【49】Behavioural strategies to aid smoking cessation range from very brief interventions, such as advice from a physician, to intensive multi‐component programmes. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of brief, therapist‐delivered interventions, such as physician advice , and for the additional effect of more intensive behavioural interventions, such as group therapy , individual counselling  and telephone counselling . However, a major limitation of therapist‐delivered behavioural interventions is that they reach only a small proportion of smokers. Most successful quitters give up on their own . Methods to support otherwise unaided quit attempts therefore have the potential to help a far greater proportion of the smoking population. This is especially the case in lower income countries, where more intensive cessation support may not be available.\n\n【50】The aim of self‐help interventions is to provide some of the benefits of intensive behavioural interventions without the need to attend treatment sessions. Such materials can be disseminated and used on a much wider scale than therapist‐delivered treatment. They therefore represent a bridge between the clinical approach to smoking cessation oriented towards individuals, and public health approaches that target populations . Self‐help programmes were first developed as written materials, primarily delivered in print, but other formats such as videos or audiotapes have also been used. New technologies enable delivery of information and support via the internet and mobile phones; these self‐help formats are evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews .\n\n【51】Previous reviews and versions of this review have found evidence of a small but significant effect of print‐based self‐help interventions. However, new theories and technologies have led to continued interest and research in this field, in particular the ability to tailor materials based on individual characteristics through computer‐based algorithms. Such personalization is the focus of most new research in this field.\n\n【52】The aim of this review is to summarize existing evidence for the older (print‐based, video, and audiotape) forms of self‐help interventions in promoting smoking cessation.\n\n【53】Objectives\n----------\n\n【54】The aims of this review were to determine: the effectiveness of different forms of print‐based self‐help materials, compared with no treatment and with other minimal contact strategies; the effectiveness of adjuncts to print‐based self help, such as computer‐generated feedback, telephone hotlines and pharmacotherapy; and the effectiveness of approaches tailored to the individual compared with non‐tailored materials.\n\n【55】Methods\n-------\n\n【56】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【57】#### Types of studies\n\n【58】Randomized controlled trials with a minimum follow up of six months, where at least one arm consisted of a print‐based self‐help intervention without repeated face‐to‐face therapist contact. We included trials where allocation to treatment was by a quasi‐randomized method but, where appropriate, we used sensitivity analysis to determine whether their inclusion altered the results.\n\n【59】#### Types of participants\n\n【60】Any smokers except pregnant smokers and adolescent smokers. Interventions in pregnant smokers  and in adolescent smokers  have been evaluated in separate Cochrane reviews.\n\n【61】#### Types of interventions\n\n【62】We defined self‐help interventions as any manual or programme to be used by individuals to assist a quit attempt not aided by health professionals, counsellors or group support. This review primarily covers written materials, but information could also have been provided via audio or videotape or similar medium. Interventions designed to be delivered via the internet, or via mobile phone, are covered in separate reviews . Materials could be aimed at smokers in general, could target particular populations of smokers, for example different ages or ethnic groups, or could be tailored to individual smoker characteristics. Brief leaflets on the health effects of smoking were not included ‐ they were considered to be a control intervention if compared to a more substantial manual. Interventions with a single session of minimal face‐to‐face contact for the purpose of supplying the self‐help programme materials were regarded as self help alone. Where a face‐to‐face meeting included discussion of the programme contents we categorized this as brief advice in addition to self‐help materials. We excluded interventions that provided repeated sessions of advice in addition to self‐help materials. Telephone counselling or hotlines as adjuncts to self‐help materials are covered in a separate Cochrane review .\n\n【63】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【64】We use sustained abstinence, or two‐point prevalence, where available. We included studies using either self report of cessation alone or biochemically validated cessation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Morphine, fentanyl, and remifentanil are the opioids most often used in neonates. However, negative impact of opioids on the structure and function of the developing brain has been reported.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To evaluate the benefits and harms of opioids in term or preterm neonates exposed to procedural pain, compared to placebo or no drug, non‐pharmacological intervention, other analgesics or sedatives, other opioids, or the same opioid administered by a different route.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was December 2021.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We included randomized controlled trials conducted in preterm and term infants of a postmenstrual age (PMA) up to 46 weeks and 0 days exposed to procedural pain where opioids were compared to 1) placebo or no drug; 2) non‐pharmacological intervention; 3) other analgesics or sedatives; 4) other opioids; or 5) the same opioid administered by a different route.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were pain assessed with validated methods and any harms. We used a fixed‐effect model with risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, and their confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We included 13 independent studies (enrolling 823 newborn infants): seven studies compared opioids to no treatment or placebo (the main comparison in this review), two studies to oral sweet solution or non‐pharmacological intervention, and five studies (of which two were part of the same study) to other analgesics and sedatives. All studies were performed in a hospital setting.\n\n【13】**Opioids compared to placebo or no drug**\n\n【14】Compared to placebo, opioids probably reduce pain score assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP)/PIPP‐Revised (PIPP‐R) scale during the procedure (MD −2.58, 95% CI −3.12 to −2.03; 199 participants, 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); may reduce Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) during the procedure (MD −1.97, 95% CI −2.46 to −1.48; 102 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence); and may result in little to no difference in pain score assessed with the Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau‐né (DAN) scale one to two hours after the procedure (MD −0.20, 95% CI −2.21 to 1.81; 42 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain score assessed with the PIPP/PIPP‐R scale up to 30 minutes after the procedure (MD 0.14, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.45; 123 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence) or one to two hours after the procedure (MD −0.83, 95% CI −2.42 to 0.75; 54 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported any harms. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of bradycardia (RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.14 to 72.69; 172 participants, 3 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Opioids may result in an increase in episodes of apnea compared to placebo (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.16; 199 participants, 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of hypotension (RR not estimable, risk difference 0.00, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.06; 88 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported parent satisfaction with care provided in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\n【15】**Opioids compared to non‐pharmacological intervention**\n\n【16】The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain score assessed with the Crying Requires oxygen Increased vital signs Expression Sleep (CRIES) scale during the procedure when compared to facilitated tucking (MD −4.62, 95% CI −6.38 to −2.86; 100 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence) or sensorial stimulation (MD 0.32, 95% CI −1.13 to 1.77; 100 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The other main outcomes were not reported.\n\n【17】**Opioids compared to other analgesics or sedatives**\n\n【18】The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain score assessed with the PIPP/PIPP‐R during the procedure (MD −0.29, 95% CI −1.58 to 1.01; 124 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence); up to 30 minutes after the procedure (MD −1.10, 95% CI −2.82 to 0.62; 12 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence); and one to two hours after the procedure (MD −0.17, 95% CI −2.22 to 1.88; 12 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported any harms. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of apnea during (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 12.58; 124 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence) and after the procedure (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.11 to 64.96; 124 participants, 2 studies; very low‐certainty evidence) and on hypotension (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.32 to 5.59; 204 participants, 3 studies; very low‐certainty evidence). The other main outcomes were not reported.\n\n【19】We identified no studies comparing different opioids (e.g. morphine versus fentanyl) or different routes for administration of the same opioid (e.g. morphine enterally versus morphine intravenously).\n\n【20】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【21】Compared to placebo, opioids probably reduce pain score assessed with PIPP/PIPP‐R scale during the procedure; may reduce NIPS during the procedure; and may result in little to no difference in DAN one to two hours after the procedure. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain assessed with other pain scores or at different time points. No studies reported if any harms occurred. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of bradycardia or hypotension. Opioids may result in an increase in episodes of apnea. No studies reported parent satisfaction with care provided in the NICU. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on any outcome when compared to non‐pharmacological interventions or to other analgesics. We identified no studies comparing opioids to other opioids or comparing different routes of administration of the same opioid.\n### PICOs\n\n【22】###### Populatio\n\n【23】*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Procedural Pain\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n\n【24】###### Interventio\n\n【25】*   Opioids\n\n【26】###### Compariso\n\n【27】*   Skin-to-skin contact\n*   Swaddling\n*   Analgesics\n*   Opioids\n*   Music Therapy\n*   Placebo\n*   Sweet solution\n*   Non-nutritive sucking\n*   Sedative\n\n【28】###### Outcom\n\n【29】*   Acute Pain in Newborn Infants\n*   Apnea\n*   Pain\n*   Pulse Rate - Bradycardia\n*   Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates\n*   ABC Scale\n*   Neonatal Infant Pain Scale\n*   Douleur Aigue du Nouveau-ne\n*   Low Blood Pressure\n*   Premature Infant Pain Profile\n*   Behavioural Indicators of Infant Pain\n*   Neonatal, Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【31】### Opioids for managing pain in babies exposed to painful procedures\n\n【32】**Key messages**\n\n【33】• Due to a lack of strong evidence, the benefits and risks of opioids for managing pain in babies exposed to painful procedures are unclear.\n\n【34】• Compared to placebo (a 'dummy' treatment, or sham treatment, that does not contain any medicine but looks identical to the medicine being tested), opioids may reduce pain assessed with certain scales during the procedure, but may not make a difference with other scales one to two hours after the procedure.\n\n【35】• The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on: pain assessed with other pain scores or at different time points, episodes of bradycardia (slow heart rate), or hypotension (low blood pressure). Opioids may increase episodes of breathing stops.\n\n【36】**Why are opioids given to manage pain during procedures in babies?**\n\n【37】Babies (particularly in the first four weeks after birth) are frequently exposed to painful procedures during hospitalization. Similar to adults, they require uninterrupted pain management and control during these procedures. Opioids, a broad group of pain‐relieving medications that work by interacting with opioid receptors in the body's cells, are commonly used in babies.\n\n【38】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【39】We wanted to find out the effect of opioids in babies exposed to painful procedures, compared to:\n\n【40】• no treatment or placebo;\n\n【41】• non‐drug treatments (such as sweet solutions);\n\n【42】• other drugs;\n\n【43】• different types of opioids;\n\n【44】• or same opioid administered by a different route, for example by mouth compared to by injection.\n\n【45】**What did we do?**\n\n【46】We searched for studies looking at the five comparisons described above. We compared and summarized study results and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\n【47】**What did we find?**\n\n【48】We included 13 studies involving a total of 823 babies. The largest study was in 150 babies, and the smallest in 12 babies. All studies were performed in a hospital. Four studies were conducted in India, two each in Italy and the UK, one each in Canada, Finland, Iran, and the USA, and one was an international study conducted in France and the USA.\n\n【49】Seven studies compared opioids to placebo; two studies compared opioids to oral sweet solution or other treatments such as touching the baby's body; and five studies compared opioids to another drug.\n\n【50】Compared to placebo, opioids probably result in a reduction in pain score assessed with certain scales during the procedure, but in little or no difference between groups with other scales one to two hours after the procedure. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain assessed with other pain scores or at different time points. Harms were not reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of bradycardia or hypotension. Opioids may increase episodes of breathing stops. No studies reported parent satisfaction with medical care.\n\n【51】The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on any outcome when compared to other treatments, such as touching the baby's body or giving other drugs.\n\n【52】**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n【53】We are not confident in the evidence because there are not enough studies to be certain about the results of our outcomes. Moreover, it is possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were giving to the babies. Few studies provided data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n【54】**How up‐to‐date is this review?**\n\n【55】We searched for studies up to December 2021.\n\n【56】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The classification of vascular dementia broadly follows three clinico‐pathological processes: multi‐infarct dementia, single strategic infarct dementia and subcortical dementia. Not all victims fulfil strict criteria for dementia and may be significantly cognitively impaired without memory loss and the term vascular cognitive impairment is more useful. Currently, no established standard treatment for vascular cognitive impairment exists. Reductions in acetylcholine and acetyltransferase activity are common to both Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment raising the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors like rivastigmine may be beneficial for the latter.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the efficacy of rivastigmine in the treatment of people with vascular cognitive impairment, vascular dementia or mixed dementia.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register was searched for trials on 7 June 2006 using the terms: rivastigmine, Exelon, \"SDZ ENA 713\", SDZ‐ENA‐713. All major healthcare databases and many ongoing trial databases within the scope of the Group are searched regularly to keep this register up to date.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All unconfounded randomized double‐blind trials comparing rivastigmine with placebo were eligible for inclusion.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】No suitable trials were identified and thus we were unable to extract appropriate data or calculate summary statistics.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We were unable to perform a meta‐analysis given the absence of suitable trials. Other trials relevant to the field were identified and some indication of benefit in several cognitive and non‐cognitive domains was noted.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】From existing trial data there is some evidence of benefit of rivastigmine in vascular cognitive impairment. However, this conclusion is based on studies which had small numbers of patients, which sought to compare rivastigmine to treatments other than placebo or which used data extrapolated _post hoc_ from large studies involving patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors of unclear significance. Large placebo‐controlled, double blind and adequately randomised trials are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. The methodology of such trials should acknowledge the biological and clinical features unique to vascular cognitive impairment and its subtypes.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Vascular Dementia\n*   Mixed Dementia\n*   Mild Cognitive Impairment\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Rivastigmine\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Activities of Daily Living\n*   Cognitive function\n*   Dementia Symptoms - Behavioral And Psychiatric\n*   Safety Finding\n*   Carer Able To Cope\n*   Death\n*   Clinical Finding\n*   Clinical Global Impression\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

They could not be included in this review.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The aim of this review is to compare the effects of home versus hospital care in glucose monitoring for women with GDM on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes and costs of health care.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Gestational diabetes mellitus\n\n【7】Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as _\"carbohydrate intolerance of varying degrees of severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy\"_ ; therefore included in this definition are women with unrecognised pre‐existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes, whose first presentation of the disease is during pregnancy . Many physiological changes occur as a part of normal pregnancy. Maternal metabolic changes include the development of relative insulin resistance and reduced glucose sensitivity, particularly during the second trimester of pregnancy ; these physiological changes facilitate the transport of glucose across the placenta to stimulate adequate fetal growth and development . Some women, however, are predisposed to an excessive maternal insulin resistance and are consequently at risk of hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) and GDM during their pregnancy.\n\n【8】Diagnostic methods for GDM vary, and there are currently no uniformly accepted international diagnostic criteria. The World Health Organization has recommended a 75 g two‐hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation , and in some parts of the world, a 100 g three‐hour OGTT is used. While universal screening has been encouraged due to the lack of identifiable risk factors in many women subsequently diagnosed with GDM, in some countries, screening is only performed for 'high‐risk' women. The effects of different screening tools, programs, protocols or guidelines for GDM is the topic of another Cochrane review .\n\n【9】#### Epidemiology and risk factors\n\n【10】Due to the lack of consistent screening procedures and diagnostic criteria between (and within) countries, different populations of women are diagnosed with GDM in different parts of the world, and reported incidences vary greatly, from 1% to 14% . There is a general consensus however, that the incidence of GDM is increasing worldwide, in line with the increasing rates of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and maternal obesity .\n\n【11】The recent HAPO (Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes) study explored the risks of adverse outcomes associated with different degrees of maternal hyperglycaemia . Following this study, a task force of the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) developed new criteria based on consensus for GDM diagnosis using data from the HAPO study ‐ suggesting GDM diagnosis after the 75 g OGTT when any of the following three thresholds are met or exceeded: fasting plasma glucose: 5.1 mmol/L (92 mg/dL), one‐hour plasma glucose: 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) or two‐hour plasma glucose: 8.5 mmol/L (153 mg/dL) . Studies subsequent to these recommendations have revealed substantial increases in the numbers of women diagnosed with GDM when these criteria are applied . Accordingly, much debate has ensued and continues surrounding the implications, including potential costs, risks and benefits of widespread use of these criteria. For example, in light of these newly proposed diagnostic criteria, in early 2013, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference on GDM diagnosis was convened in the United States . The NIH Consensus Development Conference Statement subsequently recommended that healthcare providers continue to use a two‐step approach (i.e. screening with a 50 g oral glucose challenge test, followed by a diagnostic OGTT for women who meet the screening threshold), as at present there is no evidence to confirm that using the two‐hour OGTT IADPSG criteria to diagnose GDM will lead to clinically significant improvements in health for mothers and their babies, without an increased risk of harms . A number of professional bodies, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, currently support this recommendation .\n\n【12】In addition to obesity (a maternal body mass index of at least 30 kg/m²), a range of risk factors for GDM have been identified, including advancing maternal age, increasing parity and ethnicity , with Indigenous Australians, Polynesians and South Asians (Indians) being regarded as particularly high‐risk groups . Women who have had GDM in a previous pregnancy are also at an increased risk of GDM in their current pregnancy, as are women who have a family history of diabetes .\n\n【13】#### Maternal and fetal complications\n\n【14】Hyperglycaemia has many end‐organ adverse effects and the diagnosis of GDM has implications for both mother and baby. The potential maternal complications of GDM include polyhydramnios due to increased fetal urine production, pre‐eclampsia and caesarean birth . Maternal hyperglycaemia may cause accelerated fetal growth resulting in macrosomic (birthweight of at least 4000 g) or large‐for‐gestational age infants . While caesarean section is often the preferred mode of birth for a macrosomic infant, helping to avoid maternal perineal trauma and infant injury, this mode of birth may also be associated with increased maternal morbidity .\n\n【15】There are well documented fetal and neonatal complications of GDM. Large‐for‐gestational age infants resulting from GDM may be associated with maternal birth trauma, shoulder dystocia and neonatal birth trauma such as nerve palsies and fractures . Fetal hyperinsulinaemia occurring in response to maternal hyperglycaemia in GDM, may be associated with increased rates of neonatal hypoglycaemia . Other potential neonatal complications include neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, hyperbilirubinaemia, polycythaemia and hypocalcaemia .\n\n【16】As GDM is a result of physiological metabolic changes during pregnancy, maternal hyperglycaemia should resolve following birth and does so in the majority of cases. A repeat OGTT is however recommended in the postpartum period to confirm resolution of hyperglycaemia. Repeat testing is also recommended every one to two years in women with normalised glucose tolerance , as an obstetric history of GDM confers an increased risk of type 2 diabetes later in life for both mother and her infant . For example, in a Canadian population‐based study, in a cohort of over 20,000 women who had previously had a diagnosis of GDM, the rate of diabetes development increased over time and was almost 20% by nine years .\n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】#### Home versus hospital glucose monitoring for gestational diabetes mellitus\n\n【19】Management of GDM relies on a multi‐disciplinary team approach to inform and educate the woman and to establish glycaemic control. Blood glucose monitoring is a crucial part in maintaining this control and is generally recommended by obstetric healthcare professionals . Different targets for blood glucose concentrations have been suggested by various international bodies. In Australia and New Zealand the recommended targets have been less than 5.5 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose, less than 8.0 mmol/L for one‐hour postprandial measurements and less than 7.0 mmol/L for two‐hour postprandial measurements . Recently, the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society have made changes to these recommendations: less than 5.3 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose, less than 7.8 mmol/L one‐hour postprandial, and less than 6.7 mmol/L two‐hour postprandial . In the United States the recommended targets have been: less than 5.3 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose, less than 7.8 mmol/L for one‐hour postprandial measurements and less than 6.7 mmol/L for two‐hour postprandial measurements . If concentrations are consistently above these parameters, active treatment is recommended.\n\n【20】Treatment of GDM including lifestyle advice, monitoring of blood glucose, insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemics, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of maternal and perinatal complications (including death, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture, and nerve palsy) without increasing the risk of caesarean section . While the Alwan 2009 Cochrane review, comparing alternative treatments for GDM (including GDM‐specific therapies with routine antenatal care), demonstrated a reduction in maternal and perinatal morbidity with specific treatments such as dietary advice and insulin, the review also highlighted an increased rate of labour induction with active treatment. This review concluded that more research is required to assess the impacts of specific intensive treatments on short‐ and long‐term health outcomes .\n\n【21】The decision to initiate active treatments for the management of GDM, including insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemic agents, relies on the adequate monitoring of blood glucose concentrations, which may be performed in either the home or hospital setting. A consensus on the ideal method, frequency or timing of monitoring however, is yet to be established. With the introduction of home reflectance monitors in the late 1970s, self‐monitoring of blood glucose became possible . Some early benefits of self‐monitoring for pregnant women with insulin‐dependent diabetes were observed, including declines in mean blood glucose concentrations and in the numbers of diabetes‐related hospitalisations . Self‐monitoring of blood glucose in the management of GDM has since become more widely practiced . In a survey of over 1000 obstetrician/gynaecologists in the United States, almost 60% of the respondents reported that all of their GDM patients used self‐monitoring of blood glucose; and over 80% noted that at least three‐quarters of their patients did . Much debate, however, still exists surrounding the usefulness , and particularly regarding the optimal timing and frequency of such self‐monitoring. . For example, in regards to timing, it has been argued that postprandial hyperglycaemia is more predictive of macrosomia than fasting hyperglycaemia ; management based on postprandial monitoring has also been associated with a decreased incidence of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycaemia and caesarean section for shoulder dystocia when compared with preprandial monitoring . Trials investigating treatments for GDM have generally used regular capillary blood glucose testing for monitoring, both in a hospital setting (with weekly testing) and home setting (with frequencies of testing ranging from seven times per day, to five days per week), with monthly glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations also monitored in some trials .\n\n【22】### How the intervention might work\n\n【23】Both home and hospital glucose monitoring are currently employed in the management of GDM, and accordingly both have been utilised in the trials assessing interventions for treating GDM . Home monitoring may be more likely to be well accepted or tolerated, and may allow more frequent and intensive monitoring . Barriers to home monitoring may include the reliance on good adherence by women to the daily regimen, and their ability to use the self‐monitoring equipment appropriately. Glucose monitoring in the hospital care setting may be less frequent (for example, weekly or fortnightly ), but may encourage increased clinical contact and improved surveillance of measurements.\n\n【24】Non‐randomised studies have provided some support for home care in GDM and the more intensive self‐monitoring of blood glucose concentrations that it allows. In a non‐randomised study of 58 women with GDM, infants born to women who had undertaken home self‐monitoring were found to have lower rates of macrosomia compared with those born to women who had weekly in‐hospital two‐hour postprandial capillary glucose monitoring . The reduction of macrosomia was attributed, by the study authors, to the earlier detection of the need for insulin with home monitoring . In a further prospective study of over 2000 women with GDM, women undergoing intensive glucose self‐monitoring (seven times a day) using memory‐based reflectance meters were found to have lower rates of macrosomia, caesarean birth, shoulder dystocia, stillbirth and neonatal intensive care unit days, than women undergoing conventional management .\n\n【25】In addition to the potential health benefits of home care in the management of GDM, home glucose monitoring for women may prove to be more cost‐effective than hospital monitoring; an important public health consideration, given the increasing prevalence of GDM.\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】As GDM may be diagnosed through screening processes and potentially managed with adequate monitoring and appropriate initiation of active treatments , it is of high importance that the most effective and safe monitoring strategies are established. While blood glucose monitoring for women with GDM is widely recommended there is currently no consensus on whether self‐monitoring at home has benefits when compared with hospital glucose monitoring. With the increasing incidence of GDM , the optimal setting for blood glucose monitoring should be determined, with consideration of the public health and resource implications.\n\n【28】Objectives\n----------\n\n【29】The aim of this review is to compare the effects of home versus hospital care in glucose monitoring for women with GDM on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes and costs of health care.\n\n【30】Methods\n-------\n\n【31】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【32】#### Types of studies\n\n【33】All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing home care in glucose monitoring with hospital care in glucose monitoring.

Two‐thirds of survivors have difficulty walking immediately after suffering a stroke, and six months later over 30% still cannot walk without assistance. Overground gait training forms a major part of physical therapy services for chronic stroke patients and is aimed at improving gait function. Overground gait training involves the physical therapist observing and cueing the patient's walking pattern, along with related exercises(it does not include use of high‐technology aids). We reviewed nine studies, with 499 participants, that investigated the effectiveness of overground gait training for improving overall measures of gait function. No evidence was found for a benefit on gait function at the end of the trial, based on the three available studies (269 participants). Other single measures of performance did show significant effects post‐test. Gait speed increased by 0.07 metres per second, based on seven studies with 396 participants. The timed 'up‐and‐go' test improved by 1.81 seconds, and the six‐minute‐walk test increased by 26.06 metres, based on four studies with 181 participants. Even fewer data were available at three‐month follow up. No significant differences in deaths/disabilities or in adverse effects were found between groups. Therefore, we found insufficient evidence to determine if overground physical therapy gait training improves gait function in patients with chronic stroke. The more targeted interventions for overground gait training used in recent studies suggest small and short‐term benefits for performance measures like gait speed, the timed up‐and‐go test, and distance walked in six minutes. Along with the small number of large, high quality, randomised controlled trials, limitations of this review include the wide range of disabilities in the stroke patients involved, the slow rate of recovery for chronic stroke patients, incomplete descriptions of the experimental interventions in studies of community physical therapy that included overground gait training, the blunt nature of the primary variable ‐ gait function, the limited duration of follow up (generally less than four months), and the diverse outcomes measured in the trials. Additional well‐designed randomised controlled trials of sufficient size and quality are needed to clarify the effects of overground physical therapy gait training.\n\n【24】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Further trials are needed to resolve this question and to assess long‐term effects on growth and development.\n\n【25】--------------\n\n【26】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【27】### Implications for practice\n\n【28】The limited available data do not provide evidence that feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with multinutrient fortified breast milk compared with unfortified breast milk affects growth rates during infancy. The effect on long‐term growth and development has not been assessed.\n\n【29】### Implications for research\n\n【30】Given the potential for post‐discharge nutrient fortification of breast milk to affect growth and development in preterm infants, this intervention merits further assessment. Further work is also needed to determine which nutrient groups confer the most important benefits to growth and development. Since fortifying breast milk for infants fed directly from the breast is logistically difficult (and has the potential to interfere with breast feeding), it is important to determine if mothers would support a trial of this intervention. It may be that a trial should first focus on infants who are not able to consume ad libitum quantities of milk directly from the breast, who have low rates of in hospital growth, or who have on‐going additional metabolic requirements, for example, due to chronic lung disease.\n\n【31】Background\n----------\n\n【32】### Description of the condition\n\n【33】Most preterm infants accumulate energy, protein, mineral, and other nutrient deficits by the time of discharge from hospital . At this stage, many preterm infants, especially those born with extremely low birth weight, are substantially growth restricted . Following hospital discharge, demand‐fed preterm infants consume greater volumes of milk than term infants of the same postmenstrual age in order to attain some \"catch up\" growth . Despite this, growth deficits can persist through infancy and beyond . Slow postnatal growth in preterm infants is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in later childhood and with poorer cognitive and educational outcomes . Preterm infants who have accumulated deficits in calcium and phosphate by the time of hospital discharge have a higher risk of low bone mineralisation, metabolic bone disease, and slow skeletal growth compared with infants born at term . Furthermore, concern exists that nutritional deficiency and growth restriction in utero and during early infancy may have consequences for long‐term metabolic and cardiovascular health .\n\n【34】### Description of the intervention\n\n【35】Although human milk is the recommended nutritional source for newborn infants for at least the first six months of postnatal life , unfortified human breast milk may not meet the recommended nutritional needs of growing preterm infants . Feeding preterm infants prior to hospital discharge with expressed human breast milk fortified with energy, protein, and minerals is associated with short‐term increases in rates of weight gain and linear and head growth . Multinutrient breast milk fortifiers contain various amounts of protein, carbohydrate, minerals, and vitamins. These liquid or powder formulations are mixed with expressed breast milk for delivery with the aim of achieving about 5% to 10% nutrient enrichment . However, standard clinical practice has been to cease multinutrient fortification during the period prior to hospital discharge when breast feeding is being established since, following hospital discharge, human milk‐fed preterm infants usually obtain most of their milk directly from the breast.\n\n【36】It is feasible to continue nutritional supplementation for human milk‐fed preterm infants in the post hospital discharge period of early infancy. Multinutrient fortification may be more practical for infants who are fed expressed breast milk (rather than directly from the breast) and may be especially important for infants who receive donated expressed breast milk which may contain lower levels of energy, protein and minerals than maternal expressed breast milk . Mothers who feed their infants directly from the breast may also express breast milk and give at least some fortified feeds via a bottle, cup, or feeding tube. However, concern exists that this \"medicalisation\" of infant feeding might alter the maternal perception that breast milk is the preferred nutrition for her infant and interfere with the continuation of exclusive breast milk feeding.\n\n【37】Another putative disadvantage of multinutrient fortification of breast milk is that increasing the nutrient density and osmolarity of breast milk might interfere with gastric emptying and intestinal peristalsis, resulting in feed intolerance, vomiting or diarrhoea. Observational studies have provided conflicting evidence on these potential adverse effects . The Cochrane review of multinutrient fortification of human milk for preterm infants prior to hospital discharge did not find any evidence of a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects in infants who received fortified milk . There is also concern that excessive protein supplementation may cause metabolic stresses resulting in acidosis or elevated blood urea levels. However, the Cochrane reviews of multinutrient fortification and of protein supplementation of human milk for preterm infants prior to hospital discharge did not find evidence that blood urea rose to levels outwith normal reference ranges . Finally, concern exists that rapid catch‐up growth during early infancy may have metabolic programming effects that increase the long‐term risk of overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease .\n\n【38】### How the intervention might work\n\n【39】In theory, feeding preterm infants following hospital discharge with milk enriched with extra energy, protein, minerals and vitamins may be expected to promote more rapid catch‐up growth. Higher levels of nutritional input during this period may be especially important for infants who are not able to consume ad libitum quantities of milk directly from the breast, who have slow growth, or who have on‐going additional nutritional and metabolic requirements, for example, due to chronic lung disease . However, if preterm infants are fed in response to hunger and satiation cues (ad libitum or demand), they may adjust their volume of intake depending upon the energy‐density of the milk and so consume less nutrient‐fortified milk than if fed with unfortified breast milk. Consequently, infants fed ad libitum with nutrient‐fortified milk may not receive any more nutrients than infants who receive unfortified breast milk.\n\n【40】Furthermore, concern exists that catch‐up growth with accelerated weight gain and crossing of body mass index (BMI) percentiles might be associated with altered fat distribution and related ‘programmed’ metabolic consequences that may increase the risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease . However, any effects of nutritional interventions in early infancy on long‐term health consequences are likely to be much smaller than those of other environmental or genetic factors .\n\n【41】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【42】Uncertainty exists about the balance between the putative benefits and harms of multinutrient fortification of breast milk for preterm infants following hospital discharge. Since this intervention has the potential to affect several major outcomes, an attempt to detect, appraise, and synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed.\n\n【43】Objectives\n----------\n\n【44】To determine the effect of feeding with multinutrient fortified human breast milk versus unfortified breast milk on growth and development in preterm infants following hospital discharge.\n\n【45】Methods\n-------\n\n【46】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【47】#### Types of studies\n\n【48】Controlled trials using random or quasi‐random patient allocation.

Supplementation with electrolytes, iron, vitamins, or trace minerals in addition to only one of the above nutrients was not classified as multinutrient fortification for the purposes of this review. Restrictions to the pre‐discharge feeding regimens were not prespecified. The intervention could have begun up to one week prior to planned discharge from hospital. Trials that randomly assigned infants to begin the study feed more than one week prior to hospital discharge (and then continued the intervention after hospital discharge) were not included in this review. Eligible studies should have planned to allocate the trial intervention for a sufficient period (at least two weeks) to allow measurable effects on growth. Infants in the comparison groups within each study should have received similar care other than the level of fortification of breast milk.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) for graft surveillance after peripheral arterial bypass grafting using autologous vein.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Peripheral arterial stenosis or occlusion can be treated surgically using bypass grafts. Although grafts made of artificial material such as polyester (Dacron) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)  are available their patency rates are inferior to salvaged veins (autologous veins) which, if obtainable, are the conduit of choice for peripheral bypass surgery. The vein for bypass is usually taken from the patient's own leg or arm. However, such bypasses frequently require revision within weeks and an estimated 40% of infrainguinal bypass procedures need additional surgical interventions within five years . Ongoing surveillance of lower limb vein grafts, with duplex ultrasound (DUS), ankle brachial indices (ABI) and sometimes angiography, therefore forms part of routine post‐operative care in most units in order to detect re‐stenosis (conventionally defined as more than 50% vessel narrowing). DUS surveillance is not usually used in prosthetic grafts such as those made of PTFE and polyester (Dracon) as they contain air, which prevents the penetration of ultrasound waves . Those people who are found to have a stenosis in a vein graft can have the critical lesions treated to maintain graft patency before occlusion occurs.\n\n【6】A variety of diagnostic tests can be used to monitor the integrity of the vessel, including DUS, ABI and angiography. DUS, the most commonly used test, allows the assessment of blood flow in the arteries using a probe emitting high frequency (mHz) sound waves. The probe is held at an angle over the skin covering the affected vessel. It detects the peak systolic velocity (PSV), which correlates with the area of greatest stenosis and is expressed as centimetres per second (cm/sec). A second parameter is the velocity ratio (Vr) and together with the PSV can be used to determine the magnitude of the stenosis, with larger stenoses producing higher PSVs . A further consideration is the particular blood vessel affected. Research has found that a PSV of 223 cm/sec is highly sensitive for detecting stenosis of greater than 70% in superficial femoral arteries (SFA) and the popliteal arteries (PA), but this criterion may not be applicable to the tibial vessels. The criterion for a positive test result in the tibial artery (TA) is conventionally considered to be a stenosis greater than 50% .\n\n【7】Surveillance measurement of ABI can be used to demonstrate a reduction in distal arterial pressure which suggests a problem with graft flow and so triggers the need for further investigation such as DUS or angiography. Angiography is one of the tests which may be used as the reference standard test for the diagnosis of arterial disease in the lower limb and may be digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computerised tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). DSA is an invasive procedure involving insertion of a catheter and is associated with adverse events and higher costs . CTA exposes patients to X‐rays and nephrotoxic contrast, and MRA is not suitable for patients with metallic implants such as pacemakers or who suffer from claustrophobia. All are more expensive than DUS.\n\n【8】DUS is non‐invasive, cheaper, and more widely available than all types of angiogram. A systematic review to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DUS might lead to improvements in effective and cost‐effective detection of stenosis after peripheral arterial bypass grafting using autologous veins.\n\n【9】### Target condition being diagnosed\n\n【10】The target condition is arterial stenosis of grafts performed with autologous veins. Stenosis of bypass grafts is usually defined as greater than 50% diameter reduction of arterial lumen, however larger occlusions have been proposed but are not in widespread use. We will use both greater than 50% and greater than 70% stenosis as our target condition.\n\n【11】### Index test(s)\n\n【12】The combination of grey‐scale imaging with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound, known together as duplex ultrasound (DUS), is a non‐invasive method used to image and investigate blood flow in the arteries or veins. Pulsed wave doppler allows gated flow velocity waveform analysis to be performed. There are several supplementary techniques that can be used to achieve additional information about the flow of blood in a vessel. These include colour flow imaging and power doppler.\n\n【13】### Clinical pathway\n\n【14】Post‐operative graft surveillance with DUS usually takes place at regular intervals, starting three months after the bypass procedure and then annually thereafter. Earlier surveillance has been shown to detect blood flow disturbances at earlier time points but the value of this earlier surveillance is unclear as some disturbances in blood flow velocity can resolve spontaneously .\n\n【15】### Rationale\n\n【16】DUS is commonly used in graft surveillance for the detection of stenosis after peripheral arterial bypass grafting and is non‐invasive, convenient and widely available.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To evaluate the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) for graft surveillance after peripheral arterial bypass grafting using autologous vein.\n\n【19】### Secondary objectives\n\n【20】The accuracy of DUS may be affected by the training and experience of the person undertaking the test , the age of the patient, the age of the graft, the type of reference standard used and the year of publication. We shall investigate the first two (background of the person conducting the ultrasound examination and age of patient) as sources of heterogeneity using statistical methods. The remaining factors will be examined graphically. The type of reference standard will also be used in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】The review will include diagnostic cross‐sectional or cohort studies.

In some instances imaging in this context may not be appropriate. For example, current evidence concludes that lumbar spine plain x‐rays for uncomplicated acute low‐back pain are not indicated and this is the recommendation of many back pain clinical guidelines . However, contrary to this, many studies have demonstrated an overutilisation of lumbar spine plain x‐rays for this indication . In other instances, imaging is underutilised. For example, in people with fracture due to minimal trauma or long‐term use of glucocorticoids, bone mineral density testing is indicated to diagnose osteoporosis, but there is evidence that this test is being underutilised .\n\n【7】Inappropriate overuse and underuse of imaging in musculoskeletal disorders has a number of potential adverse outcomes. There may be poorer health outcomes due to inefficient diagnosis and subsequent inappropriate management and also a significant impact on health service resource utilisation. In addition, inappropriate use of imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure of patients. For example, lumbar spine radiographs result in one of the highest cumulative doses of radiation to the reproductive organs of any radiological study . In the case of not performing imaging when it is recommended, for example, a woman may sustain a hip fracture because decreased bone density was not detected and subsequent preventive management was not instituted.\n\n【8】The identification of interventions that improve the appropriate use of imaging for musculoskeletal conditions would be of great value, potentially resulting in improved health outcomes for patients and reduced health care costs. The aim of this systematic review is to identify those interventions that improve appropriate use of imaging and to quantify their effects.\n\n【9】Objectives\n----------\n\n【10】To determine the effects of interventions that aim to improve the appropriate use of imaging for musculoskeletal conditions.

Rebleeding is probably related to dissolution of the blood clot at the site of aneurysm rupture by natural fibrinolytic activity. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to December 2012), and EMBASE (1947 to December 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing studies we searched reference lists and trial registers, performed forward tracking of relevant references and contacted drug companies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised trials comparing oral or intravenous antifibrinolytic drugs (tranexamic acid, epsilon amino‐caproic acid, or an equivalent) with control in people with subarachnoid haemorrhage of suspected or proven aneurysmal cause.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Three review authors assessed trial quality. For the primary outcome we converted the outcome scales between good and poor outcome for the analysis. We scored death from any cause and rates of rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and hydrocephalus per treatment group. We expressed effects as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used random‐effects models for all analyses.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included 10 trials involving 1904 participants. The risk of bias was low in six studies. Four studies were open label and were rated as high risk of performance bias. One of these studies was also rated as high risk for attrition bias. Four trials reported on poor outcome (death, vegetative state, or severe disability) with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.15). All trials reported on death from all causes with a pooled RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.18). In a trial that combined short‐term antifibrinolytic treatment (< 72 hours) with preventative measures for cerebral ischaemia the RR for poor outcome was 0.85 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14). Antifibrinolytic treatment reduced the risk of re‐bleeding reported at the end of follow‐up (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97; 78 per 1000 participants), but there was heterogeneity (I² = 62%) between the trials. The pooled RR for reported cerebral ischaemia was 1.41 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.91, 83 per 1000 participants), again with heterogeneity between the trials (I² = 52%). Antifibrinolytic treatment showed no effect on the reported rate of hydrocephalus in five trials (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The current evidence does not support the use of antifibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, even in those who have concomitant treatment strategies to prevent cerebral ischaemia. Results on short‐term treatment are promising, but not conclusive. Further randomised trials evaluating short‐term antifibrinolytic treatment are needed to evaluate its effectiveness.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Antifibrinolytics\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Persistent Vegetative State\n*   All Cause Mortality\n*   Disability - Severe\n*   Death\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Drugs for preventing blood clot dissolution (antifibrinolytic therapy) to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage\n\n【24】A subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a bleed into the small space between the brain and skull that contains blood vessels that supply the brain (the subarachnoid space). The cause of a bleeding here is usually a rupture of a weak spot in one of these vessels. A SAH is a relatively uncommon type of stroke, but it often occurs at a young age (half the patients are younger than 50 years). The outcome of SAH is often poor: one‐third of people die after the haemorrhage and of those who survive, one‐fifth will require help for everyday activities. An important cause of poor recovery after SAH is a second bleed from the weakened vessel (rebleeding). This is thought to be caused by the dissolving of the blood clot at the original bleeding site that results from natural blood clot dissolving (fibrinolytic) activity. Antifibrinolytic therapy that reduces this activity was introduced as a treatment for reducing rebleeding and therefore for improving recovery after SAH. This review included 10 trials, totaling 1904 participants that investigated the effect of these drugs in people with SAH. Antifibrinolytic treatment does indeed reduce the risk of rebleeding, but does not improve survival or the chance of being independent in everyday activities. This may be due to an increase in one of the other common complications of SAH. We conclude that antifibrinolytic treatment should not routinely be given to people with SAH, but new randomised trials are needed to establish if short‐term treatment might be beneficial.\n\n【25】--------------\n\n【26】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【27】### Implications for practice\n\n【28】Antifibrinolytic treatment does not improve clinical outcome in people after SAH, although it does reduce the risk of rebleeding after SAH. Based on the currently available data, treatment with antifibrinolytic drugs cannot be recommended for people with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a presumed or proven aneurysmal origin.\n\n【29】### Implications for research\n\n【30】The available data suggest that short‐term (less than 72 hours) antifibrinolytic treatment, combined with cerebral ischaemia preventative measures, may reduce rebleeding rates without an increase in the proportion of people with cerebral ischaemia. Thus, short‐term treatment with antifibrinolytic therapy may be effective for people with aneurysmal SAH, but confirmatory evidence is lacking and a possible harmful effect can also not be excluded. Based on these findings new randomised trials of short‐term antifibrinolytic agents versus control in people with SAH are needed. Recently, a new trial comparing ultra early and short antifibrinolytic treatment (less than 24 hours) with control treatment has been registered and is planned .\n\n【31】Background\n----------\n\n【32】### Description of the condition\n\n【33】In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) rebleeding is an important cause of death and disability. Without aneurysm treatment approximately 30% of such people experienced a rebleed within one month of the initial haemorrhage . The rebleeding rate has now been reduced to about 15% because in most people the aneurysm is occluded early after admission . The risk of rebleeding is highest in the first 24 hours after SAH, with a peak in the first six hours . The prognosis after rebleeding is poor: approximately 60% of people who rebleed die and another 30% remain dependent for activities of daily living .\n\n【34】### Description of the intervention\n\n【35】Antifibrinolytic drugs were introduced to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding. These drugs are administered orally or intravenously and block endogenous fibrinolytic activity and could help prevent bleeding.\n\n【36】### How the intervention might work\n\n【37】Dissolution of the blood clot at the site of the ruptured aneurysm is thought to be an important factor in the development of rebleeding. This dissolution probably results from endogenous fibrinolytic activity after SAH. Since antifibrinolytic agents reduce fibrinolytic activity, antifibrinolytic therapy may reduce the occurrence of rebleeding and thereby improve clinical outcome after SAH. However, reducing rebleeding might not automatically improve clinical outcome in all instances. Concerns have been raised that antifibrinolytic therapy might increase the occurrence of cerebral ischaemia. Cerebral ischaemia is a complication of SAH that occurs in about 30% to 40% of people between four and 14 days after SAH. In older trials the beneficial effect of antifibrinolytic treatment (reducing rebleeding) was offset by an increase in cerebral ischaemia, resulting in a neutral effect on outcome .\n\n【38】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【39】In 1967 Gibbs and O'Gorman published the first report on antifibrinolytic treatment in people with SAH . Since then, over 50 studies on antifibrinolytic therapy in aneurysmal SAH have been published. Unfortunately most of these studies are uncontrolled and only a minority of the controlled studies are randomised. Moreover, the results of some of the individual randomised studies contradict each other. Furthermore, as mentioned above, concerns have been raised that antifibrinolytic therapy might increase the occurrence of cerebral ischaemia. In a previous version of this review we found that even in people treated with measures to prevent and reverse cerebral ischaemia (such as administration of nimodipine), clinical outcome was not improved by antifibrinolytic treatment despite a reduction in rebleeding rate. The hypothesis has been posed that, when people with aneurysmal SAH are treated with antifibrinolytic agents, recovery from cerebral ischaemia is impeded by antifibrinolytic treatment. More recently it has been proposed that if antifibrinolytic treatment is discontinued before the period in which cerebral ischaemia typically occurs, the negative effect of antifibrinolytic therapy may be avoided. In this update of a previously published Cochrane review , we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of short‐term antifibrinolytic treatment in people concomitantly treated with measures to prevent or reverse cerebral ischaemia.\n\n【40】Objectives\n----------\n\n【41】To assess the effects of antifibrinolytic treatment in people with aneurysmal SAH.\n\n【42】Methods\n-------\n\n【43】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【44】#### Types of studies\n\n【45】All truly randomised unconfounded trials were eligible in which, after concealed allocation, antifibrinolytic drugs were compared with control treatment (open studies) or placebo (blind studies) in an intention‐to‐treat analysis. We excluded all trials in which allocation to treatment or control group was not concealed (e.g. trials in which people were allocated by means of an open random number list, alternation, or based on date of birth, days of the week, or hospital‐number), since foreknowledge of treatment allocation might lead to biased treatment allocation (i.e. selective enrolment). We also excluded trials in which an intention‐to‐treat analysis was not performed and could not be reconstructed on the basis of published data without a loss of 20% or more of all randomised participants.\n\n【46】#### Types of participants\n\n【47】Trials in which participants were included with clinical symptoms and signs of SAH from a ruptured aneurysm with confirmation of the diagnosis by the presence of subarachnoid blood on computed tomography (CT) scan or on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were eligible for this review.\n\n【48】#### Types of interventions\n\n【49】Antifibrinolytic drugs (e.g. tranexamic acid, epsilon amino‐caproic acid, or equivalent drugs), oral or intravenous, versus control treatment (open studies) or placebo treatment (blind studies). Since the risk of rebleeding is highest during the first two weeks after the initial bleeding, treatment had to start within two weeks after onset of the SAH. Distinction was made between early and short‐term (< 72 hours of onset of symptoms, i.e. before usual timing of onset of cerebral ischaemia) versus long‐term (> 72 hours) treatment duration.\n\n【50】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【51】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【52】The primary outcome measure was 'poor outcome' (death, vegetative state, or severe disability, as assessed either with the Glasgow Outcome Scale or the Modified Rankin Scale) at the end of follow‐up at least three months after SAH. 'Death from all causes' at a minimum of at least three‐weeks follow‐up was our second primary outcome, since most studies only reported on case fatality.\n\n【53】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【54】Secondary outcome measures were the effect of antifibrinolytic treatment on both the rates of reported and CT scan or autopsy confirmed (sensitivity analyses) episodes of rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and hydrocephalus. In this systematic review, we did not evaluate cerebral vasospasm without clinical signs of cerebral ischaemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effect of assistive technologies on reading, educational outcomes and quality of life in children and young people with low vision.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】In 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 161 million people worldwide were visually impaired, with 124 million classified as having low vision and 37 million classified as blind (defined as visual acuity less than 3/60 in the better‐seeing eye . In children, the prevalence of blindness varies from 0.3/1000 in high‐income countries to over 1.0/1000 in low‐ and middle‐income countries, equating to around 1.4 million blind children worldwide . Low vision is about twice as common as childhood blindness, and might affect almost 3 million children worldwide .\n\n【7】The leading causes of low vision in children worldwide are retinal conditions, corneal scarring (vitamin A deficiency, measles, harmful traditional practices), globe anomalies, cataract, optic nerve anomalies, glaucoma, and central nervous system disorders . A recent study in Nepal identified corneal disease as the leading cause of visual impairment, followed by retinal disease and lens pathology. In 46% of children, however, the cause of visual loss could not be identified . In high‐income countries, brain damage sustained around the time of birth has become the leading cause of severe visual impairment . In England and Wales, the most common conditions in children with impaired, but not severely impaired sight, are hereditary retinal conditions or congenital globe abnormalities .  \n\n【8】In the UK, there are an estimated 25,000 children with vision impairment (VI) or severe vision impairment/blindness (SVI/BL) . The cumulative incidence of SVI/BL by 16 years of age is 5.9, and that of VI around 7 per 10,000 live births . About 950 new cases of VI or SVI/BL are diagnosed each year .\n\n【9】Children are considered to have 'low vision' when the corrected visual acuity (VA) is between less than 6/18 and light perception in their better eye, or their visual field is less than 10 degrees from the point of fixation, but they use, or are potentially able to use, vision for the planning or execution, or both, of a task . There is an overlap with the definitions of VI and SVI/BL. The exact definition of childhood blindness is variable, but usually ranges between a best‐corrected visual acuity of less than 6/60 to 3/60 in the better‐seeing eye in a young person age under the age of 15 years .\n\n【10】Visual impairment can result in developmental delay by reducing the range of experiences to which the child is exposed. Early assessment with provision and training of low vision aids (LVAs) is essential to improve functional vision and adaptation to visual impairment, so allowing most children to enter and remain in mainstream schools . In the UK, approximately 70% of children with VI are educated in mainstream schools where the use of LVAs to enable use of printed educational materials is essential . In the developing world, access to enlarged print, or methods to enlarge text (i.e. computers or photocopiers) is more spartan, and magnifiers can be provided as a cheaper and more transportable option for children with low vision. Epidemiological studies in Pakistan have demonstrated that provision of basic magnification aids would permit at least 11% of children currently educated in schools for the blind to be moved to mainstream schooling . This estimate, however, was based on a sample of 1000 children in schools for the blind and was subject to selection bias due to the small percentage of children with low vision currently being educated in special schools in low‐ and middle‐income countries; the overall potential for improvement is significantly higher. In Nepal, optical intervention provided a significant improvement to the vision of 48.2% of children in schools for the blind, enabling those learning braille to learn to read visually, or visually in conjunction with braille . Despite this improvement, however, only 34.8% of children were still using their LVA one year later. Damage or loss was the most common reason reported for cessation of use; however, inadequate instruction and inappropriate setting/lighting were also reported, both of which highlight the vital importance of maintenance of equipment ‐ however basic ‐ and instruction to enable its use .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】A low vision aid (LVA) can be defined as any device that enables a person with low vision to improve visual performance. LVAs can be classified into non‐optical aids (such as improved contrast and lighting), optical aids (magnifiers) and electronic “assistive technologies” (AT). This review will include:\n\n【13】*   Closed circuit television (CCTV) or electronic vision enhancement systems (EVES) which use a camera to project an image onto a screen. These can be desktop (with an integrated monitor), portable and those which plug into a television or other monitor. There are also CCTV devices with a distance camera attached.\n\n【14】*   Computer‐based access technology (for desktops, laptops and tablet computers) including screen readers with speech or braille output and screen magnification.\n\n【15】*   Optical character recognition (OCR) which digitises the written word which can subsequently be used with a screen reader.\n\n【16】Children with a visual impairment may use a combination of the above strategies to achieve different outcomes and thus facilitate access to the educational curriculum. Compared with text enlargement, LVAs may have the additional advantage of providing children and young people with greater independence of access to printed material . However, peer pressure and the fear of “standing out” may reduce the usage of LVAs by children and young people . The use of information technology has become a mainstream part of children’s lives, and children may therefore not view the use of technology as an inhibiting factor in comparison to the use of some optical aids. Many children have access to computer technology in the form of mobile phones, electronic readers (kindle/e‐book reader) and computers (with qwerty keyboards and touch screen), both at home and within the educational environment. Use of such technology can be enabling to children with visual impairments, however access to such technology may require the addition of assistive or adaptive technologies.\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】This review will aim to assess the effect of assistive technologies (ATs) in children with low vision. The use of optical aids in children with low vision is the topic of a separate review . No review will be undertaken for the use of non‐optical aids. Electronic AT provide different levels of support, such as magnification of printed text and text on computer monitors, text‐to‐speech conversion and voice input with subsequent conversion of speech to electronic text. These technologies facilitate the interaction of sight impaired users with written material.\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Improving functional vision in children with vision impairment is important to enable education and personal development and to improve vision‐related quality of life. The previously‐held belief that children with low vision should be treated as children with no vision may in the past have hampered the study and use of LVAs. The WHO identified and highlighted the provision, education and use of LVAs in children as a priority in managing children with vision impairment . Parents or local education authorities may purchase ATs for children and young people to help with specific functional tasks within the classroom environment. Commonly used are CCTV or EVES systems. Usage may be limited by variable acceptance of these devices, technical problems such as time required to set up the equipment in the classroom and to move it between classrooms, battery life and availability of power supply as well as other issues including cost of purchase and maintenance/repair . In adults, a recent Cochrane review described a lack of data regarding the performance of electronic aids and their sustained use, compared to simpler and cheaper optical devices . Whilst there are objective benefits to the use of electronic LVAs, some tasks may be performed just as well with optical aids . There is, however, a lack of data on children and young people, and there is a need for further research into the comparative benefits of different types of visual aids. There is also a lack of agreement and comparative data on relevant outcomes and benefits of LVAs in children and young people. Users, i.e. children and their families and carers, and healthcare providers or commissioners require good quality evidence to make informed choices about allocation of personal, institutional and public resources. Facilitating reading and literacy of children and young people not only optimises individuals’ access to education and employment, but also benefits society. Given the increasing use of computer‐based technology in mainstream schooling, it appears timely to evaluate its usefulness for students with low vision. In addition, initiatives such as the “one laptop per child” program  have demonstrated that it is possible for low‐cost technology to reach children in the developing world. ATs may have an impact on the education of children worldwide. In view of the increasing choice of technologies available, it is important to review evidence on the effect of different ATs available, and to identify outcome measures relevant to children, carers and teachers. The rationale for this review is therefore to critically evaluate information already available from high‐quality trials, and to delineate a framework for future research and practice policies in both developing and developed countries.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To assess the effect of assistive technologies on reading, educational outcomes and quality of life in children and young people with low vision.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in this review. We will consider within‐subject studies, in which the order of presentation of devices was randomised, as quasi‐RCTs. Within‐subject studies are similar in design to conventional cross‐over studies, but instead of offering interventions sequentially, low vision aid (LVA) studies frequently offer these simultaneously and measure outcomes sequentially, in the same session.\n\n【27】Non‐randomised studies may be included in the discussion, but will be excluded from any meta‐analysis.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】We will include trials involving children between the ages of 5 and 16 years with low vision as defined by, or equivalent to, the WHO 1992 definition : “A person with low vision is one who has impairment of visual functioning even after treatment and/or standard refractive correction, and has a visual acuity of less than 6/18 to light perception, or a visual field of less than 10 **°** from the point of fixation, but who uses, or is potentially able to use, vision for the planning and/or execution of a task”.\n\n【30】We will exclude pre‐school age children, as young children tend to hold objects close to their face to achieve magnification, and as LVAs are not usually prescribed to this age group. If LVAs, including electronic aids, are presented to children under the age of five years, the aim is to introduce children to the concept of electronic devices in a playful manner and not actually to improve access to visual information.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We plan to include studies which explore the use of assistive technologies (ATs). These will include all types of closed circuit television/electronic vision enhancement systems (CCTV/EVES) and computer technology including tablet computers and adaptive technologies such as screen readers, screen magnification and optical character recognition (OCR). We will compare the use of ATs with standard optical aids which include distance refractive correction (with appropriate near addition for aphakic (no lens)/pseudophakic (with lens implant) patients) and monocular/binoculars for distance and brightfield magnifiers for near. We will also include studies which compare different types of ATs with each other, without or in addition to conventional optical aids, and those which compare ATs given with or without instructions for use.\n\n【33】A separate Cochrane review will explore the effects of optical aids in the same population . The motivation to split the topic into two reviews lies in the difference of what these technologies try to achieve. Optical aids are prescribed to facilitate reading and access to printed material by providing magnification. Electronic ATs have a broader aim: facilitating access to education, but also to social media and real‐time information available via the internet, for example maps/directions, educational or leisure activities offered in the vicinity etc. As such, a comparison of optical aids with ATs will be limited to outcomes on which both types of devices can have an effect, such as reading and access to educational materials.\n\n【34】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【35】Low vision affects many aspects of a person’s life. Interventions aim to improve one or more different area(s) of difficulty. Outcome areas relevant to low vision include mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), self‐esteem (happiness, mental health), literacy (reading, writing, access to information), visual functioning, use of LVAs, social contact/participation, use of technology, and employment . A recent systematic review of the effectiveness of low vision service provision categorised outcomes into five groups: objective/clinical outcomes, ADL/functional outcomes, vision‐related quality of life (VRQoL), psychological status, and general health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) . Outcome measures for objective outcomes include near visual acuity (VA), distance VA, and reading accuracy, comprehension and speed . A range of questionnaires is available to measure functional outcomes relating to ADL, psychological status, VRQoL and HRQoL, such as the Manchester Low Vision Questionnaire (MLVQ) , the Low Vision Quality of Life Questionnaire (LVQoL) , the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI‐VFQ) , and the Impact of Vision Impairment Profile (IVI) . Only a few tools have been developed and validated for use in children and young people, and even fewer have been developed with focus groups of children and young people. Examples include the Impact of Vision Impairment Profile for Children (IVI\\_C) , the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children (CVAQL) to assess VRQoL , the Functional Vision Questionnaire for Children and Young People with Visual Impairment (FVQ CYP) , and the general health‐related Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory .\n\n【36】The aim of ATs is not to improve all of the above outcomes. Rather they aim to assist with specific visual tasks. In an educational setting they are intended to improve access to written material from the conventional curriculum. They may also be useful for independence in ADL. Outcome measures potentially appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of LVA ATs are therefore those related to vision‐related quality of life as well as measures of visual function related to reading and literacy.\n\n【37】Reading speed may be the most appropriate primary reading‐related outcome, as it evaluates the functional visual effect of the aid. CCTV, electronic reading aids, tablet computers and mobile phones can all be used to scan and enlarge text. Reading performance has been found to be one of the best predictors of patient‐reported visual ability and VRQoL . Reading is an important function in daily life. It is a standard outcome in studies monitoring conditions causing visual impairment and in clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of interventions . Maximum reading speed may be the most commonly‐used outcome in assessing the effect of reading aids, and is the primary outcome explored in a Cochrane review on reading aids for adults with low vision . It is typically stable across a range of print sizes over a certain threshold (critical print size), whereas at smaller print sizes, below the critical print size, the reading speed slows and the reading acuity limit is reached . Using standardised reading charts such as those in the Minnesota Low‐Vision Reading test (MNREAD), a plot of reading speed against font size (adjusted for reading distance and expressed in logMar) can be obtained . Typically, reading speed also slows above a certain magnification due to the restricted field of view and a lack of a proportional increase in the size of saccades (fast movements of the eyes) \n\n【38】The use of different font sizes in various studies is a methodological problem for meta‐analysis. The most recent update of the Cochrane review on reading aids for adults with low vision included only studies assessing reading speed \"when reading ordinary print size\", i.e. 10 to 14 points . However, there is no universal agreement on ordinary print size for children. Books for young readers frequently use a large font size, i.e. 14 points or larger. School textbooks frequently reduce font size as their target audience matures, but there are no standards, and no recommendations as to when 'standard adult font size' (usually 9 to 14 points) should be used.\n\n【39】The type of reading material also influences reading speed. Research studies often use standardised reading charts such as the MNREAD and, more recently, the International Reading Speed Texts (IReST). Repeated, standardised assessment of reading performance requires a collection of texts of similar difficulty. Whilst the MNREAD chart contains single short sentences, IReST consists of 10 paragraphs of text (around 130 words each) and offers the advantage of a longer paragraph, which facilitates more accurate measurement of reading speed and judgement of fluency and mistakes . IReST has been evaluated in a cohort of normal sighted young adults and in patients with age‐related macular degeneration, but has not been validated in children and young people.\n\n【40】In addition to reading performance, literacy outcomes such as reading accuracy and comprehension can give additional functional information. A measure of reading ability used in children with vision impairment is the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability (NARA), currently available in its second edition (NARA II) . This is a comprehensive assessment of reading ability aimed for use with pupils aged 6 to 12 years, and is also recommended for use beyond the age of 12 years in children with sensory impairment. The test material consists of 6 paragraphs that increase in length from 26 to 140 words, and increase in difficulty.The test is designed to assess oral reading ability in terms of reading rate, accuracy and comprehension. Validation data are available for normally sighted individuals, and also for children and young people with visual impairment . There are two parallel versions of the test, which permits the same child to be re‐tested without remembering a previous test and thereby altering the score. The child’s scores are converted into reading ages for accuracy, comprehension and speed. Accuracy is determined by noting reading errors such as mispronunciations, substitutions, refusals, additions, omissions and reversals. Comprehension is measured by asking the child a number of set questions concerning the passage he or she has just read. Reading speed is measured by timing the passages read and converting this into words per minute over the total number of passages read. Results can be plotted as graphs comparing the performance of VI‐students with normal‐sighted age‐matched peers .\n\n【41】All literacy evaluations need to take into account that children are learning to read, i.e. are developing a skill. Children with low vision often read print more slowly and less accurately than normal, sighted peers . Comprehension may also be delayed; this may be linked to general delay in reading development . Other literacy tests used in educational settings, such as the National Foudation for Educational Research (NFER) and Access Reading Test (ART), include access features for children with low vision (enlarged print, braille, extended time), but no data from children with low vision are available.\n\n【42】Usage of ATs is a further important primary outcome measure. ATs are more costly than optical and non‐optical aids. Peer pressure and the fear of 'standing out' may lead to optical aids being used infrequently or abandoned . However as the use of technology is mainstream, the acceptance of technological solutions even with adaptive technologies may be higher than with conventional optical aids. Electronic ATs are regularly provided to children of school age by the Educational Authority to tackle specific functional tasks within the classroom environment. The use of these ATs is limited by the acceptance of these devices by the child, in addition to other practical implementation factors such as the training and support of teachers and support staff and the day to day issues of moving equipment to different locations and equipment maintenance.\n\n【43】Lastly, with a view to costs of purchase and maintenance, useful lifespan of a device is a relevant point. The lifespan of AT may be longer or shorter than that of conventional optical aids; due to their different capabilities including magnification functions, one device may also be useful to the same user for longer despite potential worsening or improvement in visual function.\n\n【44】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【45】*   Maximum reading speed in words per minute using MNREAD, IRest, NARA or NARA I.\n\n【46】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【47】The following outcomes will be assessed using a standardised chart such as MNRead or IReST, or a standardised literacy test such as NARA.\n\n【48】*   Reading accuracy as errors per words read.\n\n【49】*   Reading comprehension as number of correctly answered set questions concerning the text read.\n\n【50】*   Reading acuity in logMar, defined as the smallest print that the child/young person can read without making significant errors.\n\n【51】*   Critical print size, defined as the smallest print that the child/young person can read with maximum speed.\n\n【52】*   Fatigue‐free reading duration in minutes.\n\n【53】The following outcomes will be measured with a different means of assessment (i.e. not standardised chart or literacy test).\n\n【54】*   Acceptance of the LVA, as reflected in usage (days per week, hours per day, at home and at school).\n\n【55】*   Independent learning, i.e. ability to access the curriculum independently, as assessed by questionnaires.\n\n【56】*   VRQoL, evaluated using any validated VRQoL scale for children.\n\n【57】*   HRQoL evaluated using any validated HRQoL scale for children.\n\n【58】*   Useful lifespan of device.\n\n【59】With regard to the time points of evaluation, general child development and, particularly, the development of reading and literacy skills will affect the effect size of interventions at given time points. One would expect an increase in reading speed with time as a younger child learns to read, regardless of LVA use, but using an aid may allow faster development of reading skills. On the other hand, a child’s ability may have improved to a degree over that period of time, just as his/her general development has progressed.\n\n【60】For this review, we will consider the following time points:\n\n【61】*   Primary outcome: 3 and 12 months (+/‐ 3 months) after the intervention and relevant instructions, if any, have been issued, where 3 months is a proof of concept.\n\n【62】*   Secondary outcomes: 12 months (+/‐ 3 months). Useful lifespan of device may exceed the second time point; data will be noted if available.\n\n【63】Ultimate outcomes such as educational attainment, as measured in educational progress, would be desirable, but due to the length of follow‐up required, these are unlikely to be captured in research studies.\n\n【64】###### Adverse outcomes\n\n【65】No adverse outcome is expected, and any adverse effects on visual function would be detected by primary and secondary outcome measures. We will summarise narratively any unexpected adverse outcome reported by study authors.\n\n【66】###### Economic data\n\n【67】No systematic review of economic data will be conducted in this review, but we will report on the unit cost of devices as well as on costs of healthcare personnel involved and overall health service cost for each programme when available in included studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the impact of weight loss interventions, in addition to standard management of endometrial cancer, on overall survival and the frequency of adverse events. Secondary objectives include an assessment of weight loss interventions on endometrial cancer‐specific survival, cardiovascular event frequency, and QoL, stratified according to patient BMI, and patient and tumour characteristics.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Endometrial cancer is a cancer of the lining of the womb and is the fourth most common cancer in women in the developed world  **.** Each year, 9000 new cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed in the UK, and 60,000 in the USA . The incidence of the disease has doubled in the last twenty years, and this trajectory is expected to continue. Endometrial cancer has a generally good prognosis, with eight out of ten women still alive at five years after diagnosis . With more women than ever surviving initial treatment for endometrial cancer, interventions aimed at reducing the risk of disease recurrence and optimising general health in the long term (at least 5 to 10 years following diagnosis) are required.\n\n【7】Endometrial cancer has a strong link with obesity and it is this relationship that is thought to underpin the rising number of cases . As the percentage of the female population who are obese has increased, so has the number of diagnoses of endometrial cancer. Three biological mechanisms, or themes, have been proposed to explain this association: unopposed oestrogen, insulin resistance, and the presence of an inflammatory milieu (tumour environment).\n\n【8】Oestrogen is a potent stimulator of endometrial cell proliferation or turnover, an effect that is normally counteracted by progesterone during the menstrual cycle. Unopposed oestrogen occurs in two different scenarios; if progesterone levels are low because of absent ovulation (anovulation), such as in polycystic ovary syndrome, or if oestrogen levels exceed progesterone levels. This occurs in obese postmenopausal women, when the ovaries no longer produce progesterone, but testosterone, secreted by the ovaries and adrenal glands, is converted into oestrogen by excess fat (adipose) tissue. Unopposed oestrogen is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. It increases the rate of endometrial cell proliferation and thus the accumulation of mutations within key tumour‐promoting genes. Epidemiological studies have confirmed an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with high oestrogen levels .\n\n【9】Insulin is also able to stimulate endometrial cell proliferation, activating many of the pathways shown to be critical to endometrial cancer development. Obese women have higher insulin levels than their normal‐weight counterparts; excess fat tissue reduces the responsiveness of the body to the effects of insulin, so levels increase to compensate. Elevated serum insulin levels have been shown to be present in women with endometrial cancer, compared with those without the disease .\n\n【10】Third, fat tissue produces inflammatory and carcinogenic (cancer promoting) proteins, hence obese women have elevated levels compared with normal‐weight women. Any, or all of these proteins, may be responsible for the increase in endometrial cancer rates seen in this population .\n\n【11】Obesity plays an important role in promoting the development of endometrial cancer, and potentially affects treatment and subsequent survival. The mainstay of treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery to remove the uterus (womb), cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. This may be followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both in some women. Obese women often have other health problems, which can adversely affect their medical fitness to undergo an operation, and increase the risk of complications associated with surgery and radiotherapy. This may lead to compromises in treatment . There is debate in the literature as to whether being overweight or obese has a negative impact on survival. Results from two large cohort studies, in which groups of women with endometrial cancer were followed up, have suggested that obese women, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, are twice as likely to die during this period as women of a healthy weight. This increases to a six‐fold elevation in risk if their BMI is over 40 . However, these studies did not take into account differences in the cancer grade (how abnormal the cells appeared), stage (how far the disease had spread), or the type of treatment received.\n\n【12】When women with endometrial cancer received similar, or standardised treatment, in the context of a randomised controlled trial (RCT), researchers were able to demonstrate that BMI had no impact on the risk of recurrence or overall survival. This was despite a high proportion of obese women having poorer general health . The extra deaths observed in obese women with endometrial cancer may well be unrelated to their cancer. Women with early stage disease are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, for example heart attacks and strokes, as they are to die from their endometrial cancer . Excessive weight gain following diagnosis, and indeed, significant weight loss, may be more important than body mass per se. Data from observational studies demonstrate that large weight gains have a detrimental effect on survival, even after adjustment for other factors that influence prognosis, such as cancer grade and stage . Therefore, measures taken to reduce body weight following treatment for endometrial cancer may be beneficial in improving survival, either by reducing the risk of death from endometrial cancer, or by lowering the chance of dying from other causes, in particular cardiovascular disease.\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】This review will focus on interventions designed to promote weight loss as their primary goal, and will include non‐pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical interventions. These may be used alone, or in combination. Non‐pharmacological or 'lifestyle' interventions are those aimed at reducing nutrient intake and increasing physical activity, through diet and exercise, and may be used alongside psychological interventions such as stress management, stimulus control, and problem solving to induce permanent changes in behaviour. Pharmacological interventions include drugs that act to either reduce fat absorption, the most widely used of which is orlistat, or suppress appetite. Bariatric surgery encompasses procedures designed to limit food intake (e.g. gastric banding), cause malabsorption (e.g. intestinal bypass), or both .\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Weight loss interventions may improve survival by influencing any, or all of the pathways described above that link obesity and endometrial cancer, and have already been shown to be beneficial for survivors of other obesity‐related cancers, including breast and colorectal cancer . Like endometrial cancer, breast cancer also appears to be hormonally driven, and weight loss interventions that have been associated with a loss of 5% or more body weight have been shown to reduce total and free oestradiol levels in women following treatment for this cancer type, which may reduce the risk of disease recurrence . Similarly, weight loss interventions have already been shown to lower levels of both insulin and adiponectin (a marker of insulin resistance), and improve insulin sensitivity in women following treatment for breast cancer . They have also been associated with a reduction in the expression of inflammatory and cancer‐promoting proteins, and this may explain why they reduce the risk of disease recurrence .\n\n【17】In addition to potential improvements in cancer‐specific outcomes, weight loss interventions may also improve overall survival by reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. This shares many of the same risk factors with endometrial cancer, including obesity and high blood pressure, both of which were improved when individuals with breast and colorectal cancer underwent intentional weight loss following treatment . A previous Cochrane review concluded that physical activity may have a positive effect on quality of life (QoL) in multiple different cancers, with reductions in anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and improved emotional well‐being. These results should be interpreted cautiously, as included studies were at risk of considerable bias . In particular, there was a high risk of performance bias (significant differences between groups beyond simply which intervention they received), as due to the nature of the intervention (i.e. exercise), it was not possible to conceal the treatment allocation from the participants and researcher. A proportion of the included studies were also assessed to be at high risk of selectively reporting only some of the outcomes (reporting bias), failing to be transparent in their allocation of participants to treatment groups (allocation bias), and not managing incomplete outcome data appropriately (attrition bias). The differences in exercise regimes tested, meant it was difficult to combine the results to give an overall conclusion.\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】The impact of obesity on women's health has recently been highlighted in a number of high‐profile publications, including the UK Chief Medical Officer's report in December 2015 , and the publication of the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology's themed issue, _Obesity and Reproductive Health_ , in January 2016 . The impact of lifestyle changes, including weight loss, on outcomes following treatment for endometrial cancer was also identified as one of the top ten research priorities in endometrial cancer in the recent James Lind and Womb Cancer Alliance Priority Setting Partnership . Therefore, this review is timely in its aim to establish the availability of evidence about the effects of weight loss interventions on survival and QoL following treatment for endometrial cancer. There have been no previous reviews of this topic, and such information will set the scene for high quality research to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost‐effectiveness of such interventions.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To determine the impact of weight loss interventions, in addition to standard management of endometrial cancer, on overall survival and the frequency of adverse events. Secondary objectives include an assessment of weight loss interventions on endometrial cancer‐specific survival, cardiovascular event frequency, and QoL, stratified according to patient BMI, and patient and tumour characteristics.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】We will only include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are considered the highest level of evidence in clinical trials, to maximise the quality of included studies. We will include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data, to ensure all relevant trials are incorporated.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】We will include trials that enrol women of all ages, who are either overweight (BMI more than 25 kg/m²) or obese (BMI more than 30 kg/m²), and who are currently undergoing, or have been previously treated for endometrial cancer, of any grade, stage, or histological type. Trials will be included regardless of primary treatment modality, i.e. surgery, radiotherapy, hormonal treatment, or a combination. When studies of participants with mixed BMI are identified but subgroup data are not provided, we will contact the study authors to request the subgroup data for overweight and obese participants only. If authors are unable or unwilling to provide these data, the study will not be included in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】We will include studies reporting on interventions designed to promote weight loss as one of their primary stated goals, in any healthcare setting, including community based studies. These will include:\n\n【30】*   Lifestyle interventions, including dietary and physical activity regimes;\n\n【31】*   Behavioural strategies to improve adherence to treatment, which may include self‐monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress management, or stimulus control;\n\n【32】*   Pharmarcological interventions (such as, but not limited to, appetite suppressants, drugs that cause fat malabsorption or serotonin receptor antagonists of any dose, route of delivery, or duration);\n\n【33】*   Surgical interventions (gastric band, sleeve, or bypass procedure).\n\n【34】Any of these interventions will be compared with any other intervention, usual care, or placebo.\n\n【35】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【36】Primary and secondary outcome measures will be described in terms of the effect of the weight loss intervention on survival, body mass index, or QoL, important measures that will help determine whether these interventions should be included in routine clinical practice. Inclusion of these outcomes in the study design will not determine eligibility of the trial for this review.\n\n【37】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【38】The primary outcomes of this review will be:\n\n【39】*   Overall survival; determined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause;\n\n【40】*   Frequency of adverse events, of any nature.\n\n【41】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【42】Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n【43】*   Recurrence‐free survival; length of time from randomisation to recurrence of the disease or death\n\n【44】*   Cancer‐specific survival; length of time from randomisation to death from endometrial cancer\n\n【45】*   Weight loss; amount of weight lost between randomisation and end of study\n\n【46】*   Cardiovascular and metabolic event frequency; particularly the number of strokes, myocardial infarctions, and hospitalisations for heart failure\n\n【47】*   QoL as measured on any validated scale", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We used pre‐prepared data extraction sheets.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We examined 88 reports of 31 trials, published between 1931 and 2010, for inclusion in this review. We included 16 trials, excluded 14, and one is awaiting assessment.\n\n【12】Overall when trial results are pooled, Vitamin A supplementation does not affect the risk of maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.10, 3 studies, Nepal, Ghana,UK ), perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal anaemia, preterm birth or the risk of having a low birthweight baby. Vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of maternal night blindness (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82, 1 trial Nepal). In vitamin A deficient populations and HIV‐positive women, vitamin A supplementation reduces maternal anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.94, 3 trials, Indonesia, Nepal,Tanzania ). There is evidence that vitamin A supplements may reduce maternal clinical infection (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.77, 3 trials, South Africa, Nepal and UK).\n\n【13】In HIV‐positive women vitamin A supplementation given with other micronutrients was associated with fewer low birthweight babies (< 2.5 kg) in the supplemented group in one study (RR 0.67, CI 0.47 to 0.96).\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】The pooled results of two large trials in Nepal and Ghana (with almost 95,000 women) do not currently suggest a role for antenatal vitamin A supplementation to reduce maternal or perinatal mortality. However the populations studied were probably different with regard to baseline vitamin A status and there were problems with follow‐up of women. There is good evidence that antenatal vitamin A supplementation reduces maternal anaemia for women who live in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common or who are HIV‐positive. In addition the available evidence suggests a reduction in maternal infection, but these data are not of a high quality.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Vitamin A\n*   Vitamins, Other Combinations\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Placebo\n*   Vitamins, Other Combinations\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Infection\n*   Premature Delivery\n*   Anemia\n*   Death\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【25】### Vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy for maternal and newborn health outcomes\n\n【26】Vitamin A is a fat‐soluble vitamin derived from the retinoids retinal and retinoic acid, found in liver, kidney, eggs, and dairy produce. Carotenoids are converted to vitamin A in the liver, where vitamin A is stored; beta‐carotene is found in dark or yellow vegetables and carrots. Low dietary fat intake or intestinal infections may interfere with the absorption of vitamin A. Natural retinoids are required for a wide range of biological processes including vision, immune function, bone metabolism and haematopoiesis. In pregnancy, extra vitamin A may be  required. Currently, the WHO and other international agencies recommend routine vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy or at any time during lactation in areas with endemic vitamin A deficiency (where night blindness occurs).\n\n【27】The principal forms used as nutritional supplements are vitamin A palmitate (retinyl palmitate) and vitamin A acetate (retinyl acetate) but carotenoids (most commonly beta‐carotene) and retinoids (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid) can also be used as nutritional supplements. Signs of vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea and a diminished ability to fight infections, especially respiratory and gastroenteric infections.\n\n【28】Findings of this review do not suggest a role for antenatal vitamin A supplementation to reduce maternal or perinatal mortality. There is, however, good evidence that antenatal vitamin A supplementation reduces maternal anaemia in women who live in areas where Vitamin A deficiency is common or who are HIV‐positive. The available evidence suggests a reduction in maternal infection but these data are not of a high quality and further trials would be needed to confirm or refute this.\n\n【29】We included 16 randomised trials where vitamin A was commenced pre‐pregnancy or during pregnancy and in some cases continued into the postnatal period. Seven trials were conducted in Africa, five in Indonesia and one each in India, Nepal, UK and USA. The trials were conducted in populations considered to be vitamin A deficient except for the trials in the USA and UK.\n\n【30】Vitamin A supplementation did not reduce the risk of maternal mortality, perinatal and newborn mortality, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birthweight or newborn anaemia. The risk of maternal anaemia, infection and night blindness was reduced. In one study, for women who were HIV‐positive, the addition of vitamin A to supplements of iron and folate did result in fewer low birthweight babies (less than 2.5 kg at birth). The trials published so far did not report any side effects, adverse events or congenital malformations. The dose of vitamin A given, in combination with additional micronutrients and the duration of supplementation differed in the trials and varied between 5000 IU and 10,000 IU for daily doses, around 200,000 IU vitamin A for weekly supplementation and 200,000 IU vitamin A at time of delivery.\n\n【31】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, evidence that fibrates reduce mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), or overall mortality and morbidity, in the primary prevention of CVD is lacking.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】This Cochrane Review and meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of fibrates versus placebo or usual care or fibrates plus other lipid‐modifying drugs versus other lipid‐modifying drugs alone for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science . We searched four clinical trial registers  with the help of an experienced professional librarian. We searched the databases to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effects of fibrate therapy in the primary prevention of CVD events. We did not impose any language restrictions.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We aimed to include all RCTs comparing the effects of fibrate monotherapy versus placebo or usual care, or fibrates plus other lipid‐modifying drugs versus other lipid‐modifying drugs alone. Included studies had a follow‐up of at least six months for the primary prevention of CVD events. We excluded trials with clofibrate, because it was withdrawn from the market in 2002.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potential study inclusion. Two review authors independently retrieved the full‐text papers and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for aggregate data on primary and secondary outcomes. We tested for heterogeneity with the Cochrane Q‐test and used the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic to measure inconsistency of treatment effects across studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and used the GRADE profiler software (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5 to create 'Summary of findings' tables.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We identified six eligible trials including 16,135 individuals. The mean age of trial populations varied across trials; between 47.3 and 62.3 years. Four trials included individuals with diabetes mellitus type 2 only. The mean treatment duration and follow‐up of participants across trials was 4.8 years. We judged the risks of selection and performance bias to be low; risks of detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias were unclear. Reporting of adverse effects by included trials was very limited; that is why we used discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects as a proxy for adverse effects. Patients treated with fibrates had a reduced risk for the combined primary outcome of CVD death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, or non‐fatal stroke compared to patients on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate‐quality of evidence). For secondary outcomes we found RRs for fibrate therapy compared with placebo of 0.79 for combined coronary heart disease death or non‐fatal myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate‐quality of evidence); 1.01 for overall mortality (95% CI 0.81 to 1.26; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low‐quality of evidence); 1.01 for non‐CVD mortality (95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low‐quality of evidence); and 1.38 for discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects (95% CI 0.71 to 2.68; participants = 4805; studies = 3; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 74%; very low‐quality of evidence). Data on quality of life were not available from any trial. Trials that evaluated fibrates in the background of statins (2 studies) showed no benefits in preventing cardiovascular events.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Moderate‐quality evidence suggests that fibrates lower the risk for cardiovascular and coronary events in primary prevention, but the absolute treatment effects in the primary prevention setting are modest (absolute risk reductions < 1%). There is low‐quality evidence that fibrates have no effect on overall or non‐CVD mortality. Very low‐quality evidence suggests that fibrates are not associated with increased risk for adverse effects.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   At Risk Of Disease\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Fibrates\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n*   Usual Care\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Myocardial Infarction\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Death\n*   Cardiovascular Finding\n*   Albuminuria\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Fibrates for patients without established cardiovascular disease\n\n【24】**Review question**\n\n【25】What are the benefits and harms of using fibrate treatment compared to placebo or usual care for preventing cardiovascular disease in people at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease?\n\n【26】**Background**\n\n【27】Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death, illness, disability, and reduced quality of life in industrialised countries. One of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease is elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C, 'bad' cholesterol). In addition, persons with elevated serum triglycerides and low levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C, 'good' cholesterol) are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease events such as heart attacks or strokes. Fibrates lower serum triglycerides, modestly raise HDL‐C, and modestly lower LDL‐C. Therefore, long‐term therapy with fibrates may help prevent cardiovascular disease events, in particular in combination with statins, for which it has been shown that they substantially lower LDL‐C and reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and overall mortality.\n\n【28】**Study characteristics**\n\n【29】The evidence is current to May 2016. We identified six eligible primary prevention trials including 16,135 individuals without established cardiovascular disease that compared fibrate therapy with placebo or usual care. The mean age of the trial populations varied between 47.3 and 62.3 years; the majority of included individuals had diabetes mellitus type 2. The mean treatment duration and follow‐up of participants across trials was 4.8 years.\n\n【30】**Key results and quality of the evidence**\n\n【31】Moderate‐quality evidence suggests a risk reduction of 16% with fibrate therapy for the combined outcome of death due to cardiovascular disease, heart attack, or stroke. In absolute terms, the risk for this combined outcome in patients with cardiovascular risk factors but without established cardiovascular disease was on average reduced from 5.0% to 4.3% over five years. Moderate‐quality evidence also suggests a risk reduction for fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks with fibrates, but there is low‐quality evidence for no risk reduction for overall mortality or death from non‐CVD with fibrates. Very‐low quality evidence suggests that there is no increased risk for adverse effects with fibrate treatment. The reporting of adverse effects by identified trials was very limited. Data on quality of life were not available from any included study. Trials that evaluated fibrates in the background of statin treatment showed no benefits in preventing cardiovascular events.\n\n【32】--------------\n\n【33】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【34】### Implications for practice\n\n【35】There is moderate‐quality evidence that currently used fibrates lower the risk of a combined outcome of cardiovascular (CVD) death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, or non‐fatal stroke by 16%, and the risk of a combined outcome of coronary heart disease death or non‐fatal myocardial infarction by 21% in the primary prevention of CVD, without increasing or decreasing overall mortality or non‐CVD mortality (low‐quality evidence). Very low‐quality evidence suggested no difference in discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects in the fibrate groups compared to placebo groups. Our sensitivity analysis stratifying studies by presence/absence of additional therapy with statins suggests that the benefits of fibrate therapy may no longer be relevant in the context of background therapy with statins (Analysis 2.4). Nevertheless, the beneficial effects of fibrates in terms of a decreased risk for major CVD events without background therapy with statins appear modest on an absolute scale (≦ 1%). There was insufficient data to analyse fibrate therapy for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy in primary prevention individuals.\n\n【36】The recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK did not recommend fibrates for primary nor secondary prevention of CVD . However, the International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) states that if non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) and triglycerides remain elevated when the low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) goal is achieved, the addition of a fibrate should be considered , although there is no compelling evidence from clinical trials to support this consideration.\n\n【37】### Implications for research\n\n【38】Collected outcome data on CVD events should be reported separately for stroke, fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal myocardial infarction an revascularisation procedures, such as bypass grafts and angioplasty. Further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would be needed to better estimate a potential benefit of fibrate therapy for primary prevention of CVD events on top of statin therapy, and better estimate benefits and harms in non‐diabetic patients, in women, and in elderly individuals. In future primary prevention trials of fibrates, data on diabetic retinopathy (development of new diabetic retinopathy and progression of pre‐existing diabetic retinopathy), and development of albuminuria should be systematically captured, as well as typical known adverse effects of fibrates such as raised serum creatinine, raised serum transaminases, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, venous thrombotic events, gallbladder diseases, and the number of patients discontinuing therapy due to side effects, to achieve more precise estimates for these outcomes. Special attention should be given to the systematic reporting and analysis on most relevant adverse effects, which were rather limited in this review due to inadequate reporting.\n\n【39】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【40】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

With the increasing incidence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the disease burden of CVD may escalate further in the years to come . One of the major risk factors for CVD is elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). In individuals with elevated LDL‐C, 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are considered to be the first choice of pharmacological therapy, since they reduce CVD events and total mortality independently of baseline LDL‐C levels in primary and secondary prevention of CVD . The finding of elevated serum triglycerides and low levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) can identify persons who are at increased risk for CVD, and who might benefit from further lipid‐modifying therapy . Several causes underlie elevated triglycerides and low levels of HDL‐C in the general population: being overweight and obese, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol intake, very high‐carbohydrate diets (> 60% of total energy), type 2 diabetes, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, certain drugs (corticosteroids, protease inhibitors for HIV, beta‐adrenergic blocking agents, estrogens), and genetic factors . When triglyceride levels are ≥ 200 mg/dL, the presence of increased quantities of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins can increase coronary heart disease risk substantially beyond that predicted by LDL‐C alone . In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) identified low levels of HDL‐C (< 40 mg/dL in men, < 45 mg/dL in women) as the second most important coronary risk factor after LDL‐C . However, it remains unclear if therapeutic interventions to raise levels of HDL‐C indeed translate into CVD risk reduction .\n\n【46】### Description of the intervention\n\n【47】Currently available fibrates in North America and/or Europe include: gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, bezafibrate, etofibrate, and ciprofibrate. Clofibrate is no longer in use due to excess mortality . Fibrates are effective for modifying atherogenic dyslipidaemia; i.e. they prominently lower serum triglyceride levels, modestly raise levels of HDL‐C, and modestly lower levels of LDL‐cholesterol . Therefore, they appear to be particularly suitable for prevention of CVD events in people with low levels of HDL‐C and high triglycerides .\n\n【48】Potential side effects or adverse effects from fibrate therapy are increased venous thrombotic events, pancreatitis, reversible rise in creatinine (described with all fibrates except gemfibrozil), rise in homocysteine, and elevations in transaminases, gallbladder disease (since fibrates increase the cholesterol content of bile), and myositis/rhabdomyolysis, in particular for combinations of gemfibrozil with statins .\n\n【49】### How the intervention might work\n\n【50】Improvements in atherogenic dyslipidaemia mainly through reduction of serum triglycerides and modest increase of HDL‐C may result in a reduction of CVD events . The underlying mechanisms are probably fibrate induced changes in gene transcriptions controlling parts of lipid metabolism . Fibrates seem to activate transcription factors, specifically peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs). PPAR activation leads to an increased production of major HDL apolipoproteins and lipoprotein lipase. In addition, fibrates enhance the catabolism of triglycerides through stimulation of cellular fatty acid uptake and conversion to acyl‐CoA derivatives.\n\n【51】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【52】Evidence from systematic reviews that fibrates reduce overall mortality or CVD mortality is lacking, although fibrates reduced non‐fatal coronary events in several previously published meta‐analyses . In the Jun 2010 meta‐analysis that included 18 trials with a total of 45,058 participants, fibrate therapy was associated with a 10% relative risk reduction for major CVD events and a 13% relative risk reduction for coronary events, but was not associated with a risk reduction of stroke. There was no effect of fibrate therapy on the risk of overall mortality or CVD mortality. None of the systematic reviews and meta‐analyses reported separate outcomes for the effect of fibrates in primary or secondary prevention.\n\n【53】The main evidence for clinical benefit comes from placebo controlled trials with older fibrates such as gemfibrozil (for which some safety concerns were raised primarily when used in combination with statin therapy) and clofibrate (which is no longer available due to safety concerns) . The large Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial failed to show a reduction in CVD events when patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with fenofibrate plus statins rather than with statins alone . In the Keene 2014 meta‐analysis, fibrate therapy reduced the risk for non‐fatal myocardial infarction, but this effect was only statistically significant in the trials without statin treatment and not in those with statin treatment. The difference between these subgroups was, however, not significant. Similarly, the Ip 2015 meta‐analysis showed there was not more clinical benefit from statin‐fibrate combination therapy compared with statin monotherapy. Therefore, there remains uncertainty as to whether fibrates alone, or as add‐on therapy to statins, are effective in reducing CVD events in people at increased risk of developing CVD.\n\n【54】The controversy about the benefit of fibrates is also to some extent reflected in the results of a recent population level, observational cohort study using Intercontinental Marketing Services (IMS) Health data of patients prescribed fibrates in the USA and Canada . In this study, authors observed an increase in prescriptions for fibrates (particularly fenofibrate) in the USA during the past decade, while prescriptions for fibrates in Canada remained stable.\n\n【55】Limited healthcare resources demand an unbiased appreciation of the available evidence about the benefit and harm of fibrate therapy. In the USA, annual sales of fibrates total more than USD 1 billion . Since current evidence about the effectiveness of fibrate therapy in the primary prevention of CVD is missing, the results of this Cochrane Review and meta‐analysis will serve as a basis for decision‐making in health care.\n\n【56】In contrast to another Cochrane Review that focuses on the secondary prevention of CVD and stroke , and a currently withdrawn Cochrane Review protocol on the combined therapy of statins and fibrates for individuals with dyslipidaemia , our Cochrane Review and meta‐analysis focuses on the effects of fibrates as monotherapy or as add‐on therapy to other lipid‐modifying drugs for the primary prevention of CVD morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for cardiovascular events.\n\n【57】Objectives\n----------\n\n【58】This Cochrane Review and meta‐analysis aims to evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of fibrates versus placebo or usual care or fibrates plus other lipid‐modifying drugs versus other lipid‐modifying drugs alone for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.\n\n【59】Methods\n-------\n\n【60】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【61】#### Types of studies\n\n【62】We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that documented relevant clinical outcome data and had a length of treatment of at least six months. In order to be included as a primary prevention trial, fewer than 10% of participants were required to have established cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n【63】#### Types of participants\n\n【64】Adults (i.e. individuals older than 18 years of age) at increased risk of CVD events (e.g. individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidaemia, or both) but not established CVD.\n\n【65】#### Types of interventions\n\n【66】*   Fibrate therapy versus placebo or usual care (combination therapy of a fibrate plus statins versus statins alone was considered in a sensitivity analysis).\n\n【67】*   We excluded clofibrate as an intervention, because it is no longer in use. In 1979, clofibrate was withdrawn in some countries and its approval indications were severely restricted in many others due to adverse effects .\n\n【68】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【69】Outcome measures were patient‐relevant clinical outcomes and adverse effects of fibrate therapy.\n\n【70】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【71】*   Combined outcome of major CVD events (CVD death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, or non‐fatal stroke).\n\n【72】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【73】*   Overall mortality.\n\n【74】*   Combined coronary heart disease death (mortality) or non‐fatal myocardial infarction as a composite endpoint.\n\n【75】*   Non‐CVD mortality.\n\n【76】*   Diabetic retinopathy (progression of pre‐existing diabetic retinopathy, development of new diabetic retinopathy according to individual trial definitions).\n\n【77】*   Incidence of albuminuria (incidence of macroalbuminuria, incidence of micro‐ or macroalbuminuria).\n\n【78】*   Patient perceived quality of life.\n\n【79】In addition, we investigated adverse effects of fibrate therapy (especially increases in serum creatinine or liver values (transaminases), myositis/rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, venous thrombotic events, gallbladder diseases, and the number of individuals discontinuing therapy due to adverse effects). Because adverse effects were often not specified as outcomes in included trials, we used discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects as a proxy. We defined the presence or absence of increases in serum creatinine and liver values according to individual trial definitions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9b795846-08ad-4717-82d6-113b3433a935", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Diagnostic test accuracy). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Among the currently validated prehospital stroke scales, what is the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests for the diagnosis of stroke in prehospital screening of patients suspected of having a stroke?\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Worldwide, stroke is the leading cause of death. By 2020, 19 million out of 25 million annual stroke deaths will occur in developing countries. Some 88% of these events are ischemic strokes, with the remainder being hemorrhagic strokes. Stroke is also the leading cause of disability with 30% of stroke survivors requiring life‐long assistance with their activities of daily living, 20% requiring assistance with ambulation, and 16% requiring institutional levels of care . The underlying process of ischemic stroke is thrombi. Thrombi are made up of fibrin, among other components. The fibrin component is the substrate of a medication, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which works to dissolve the thrombus, thereby restoring blood flow through the previously obstructed vessel. Failure to restore blood flow in a timely fashion results in an ischemic stroke, infarction of brain tissue. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are prognosticators for future strokes and also require rapid identification so that physicians can confirm whether or not the symptoms have resolved and then work towards early risk stratification, which has been shown to decrease recurrence . The gold standard for diagnosis of strokes and TIAs is the evaluation by a neurologist upon review of history, physical and a non‐contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【6】Intravenous‐tPA is the only approved treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, utilization of intravenous‐tPA is limited by its time sensitivity, and this medication can only be provided to patients within a window of 0 to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【7】Data from multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intravenous‐tPA treatment in acute stroke have shown that the odds of a favorable outcome at three months increased as onset‐to‐treatment time decreased . Pooled analysis supports this . In an effort to deliver thrombolytics at the earliest time point possible, various streamlined 'stroke code' systems have been developed to decrease the door‐to‐treatment time. The current American Heart Association guideline recommends that the target door‐to‐treatment time be less than 60 minutes. However, this is rarely achieved .\n\n【8】An ideal system for rapid thrombolytic delivery begins with rapid and accurate stroke detection at the time of first contact with medical personnel (i.e. in most cases paramedics). Stroke pathways that include prehospital notification have been demonstrated to reduce door‐to‐treatment time and improve outcomes in patients. A number of prehospital stroke scales have been designed to aid in the early identification of potential stroke by paramedics in the field. This includes the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) , Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS) , Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS)  and the Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST) . It is unclear whether or not a superior stroke scale exists. There is a paucity of head‐to‐head trials of the currently validated stroke scales and there is no meta‐analysis that examines the existing scales and their screening accuracy. These scales are all used in the prehospital or emergency department setting but do not replace the information gathered from the history and physical examination by an attending physician. They are not for use by neurologists but for prehospital stroke staff and, in some studies, for emergency physicians (which this review will explore).\n\n【9】Furthermore, hemorrhagic strokes require rapid assessment, and it is believed that early identification and intervention is associated with signals toward decreased end volume size of hemorrhage . Optimal time of intervention and specific therapy including blood pressure agents and targets  and use of clotting factors ( Flaherty 2014 , in progress) are currently under investigation. Notably, all studies are focused on initiating therapies as soon as possible.\n\n【10】### Target condition being diagnosed\n\n【11】Suspected acute stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)) in all patients who are assessed by prehospital staff including paramedics and emergency medicine technicians. Trauma must not be a primary disease mechanism, but we will not exclude patients with secondary trauma (a fall due to a stroke). In the case of TIAs, it is impossible to know if the neurological deficit has resolved until the patient has been assessed by a neurologist and has had adequate imaging. The presentation of a TIA is analogous on a spectrum of disease that cannot be separated into categories at the time of first contact by the first responding health staff. Furthermore, it is impossible to predict the final outcome of these presentations at the time of first presentation or at the time of a neurologist's examination. Therefore, TIA must be included as a target condition.\n\n【12】### Index test(s)\n\n【13】The index tests are a list of scales comprised of check‐box items from the patient's history of presenting illness, the past medical history, the physical examination and basic laboratory values. These scales have physical examination elements derived from the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, an inpatient assessment of severity of stroke. Emergency responders are trained to be able to elicit all of these data.\n\n【14】The Index tests are prehospital scales for the recognition or, more accurately, the determination of whether the patient is having a stroke or not. The index tests are screening tools and are not meant for diagnosis of any neurological condition. Furthermore, they are not for determining severity of a stroke or type of stroke (ischemic versus hemorrhagic, or subtype of ischemic stroke, anterior versus posterior circulation, versus lacunar). Due to the high incidence of ischemia as the cause of strokes (versus hemorrhagic, see Background ) and the urgency to act on both types of stroke, the field or prehospital environment is not the appropriate setting in the decision tree to separate ischemic from hemorrhagic strokes. This is done by the attending neurologist.\n\n【15】Examples of Index tests are as follows.\n\n【16】*   Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale .\n\n【17】*   Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale .\n\n【18】*   Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale .\n\n【19】*   Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool .\n\n【20】*   Face Arm Speech Test .\n\n【21】These tests are currently the most widely used.\n\n【22】We will extend the review to include any stroke scales with a validation study that meets our inclusion criteria.\n\n【23】### Clinical pathway\n\n【24】The clinical pathway is very simple. When the paramedic, ambulance worker or medical attendant who is first on the scene is suspicious that the patient may be having a stroke, they are to implement a stroke scale in their evaluation of the patient. Thus, the point of first contact between emergency medical responders and the patient is where the index tests are to be implemented. The patients are then brought to an emergency medicine department for further evaluation and clinical work‐up. In the literature, every patient who is assessed with an index test by prehospital staff/emergency responders is then to be assessed by a neurologist at some point prior to having a neurological discharge diagnosis. In this review, even patients with a low or 'negative' score on the index tests are assessed by a neurologist. The path at which they arrive at a non‐stroke diagnosis is beyond the scope of this review. Non‐neurological discharge diagnoses made by non‐neurologists are valid.\n\n【25】#### Alternative test(s)\n\n【26】There are no alternative tests being evaluated in this review. None currently exist for the evaluation of stroke in the prehospital setting. Currently, the index tests are the only tests validated for the recognition of this disease in the prehospital setting.\n\n【27】### Rationale\n\n【28】This study will serve as a review of the screening accuracy of the current available prehospitalization stroke scales. This will serve as the basis of the design of a RCT comparing different stroke scales administered by paramedics.\n\n【29】Objectives\n----------\n\n【30】Among the currently validated prehospital stroke scales, what is the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests for the diagnosis of stroke in prehospital screening of patients suspected of having a stroke?\n\n【31】### Secondary objectives\n\n【32】To assess the influence of the following potential sources of heterogeneity.\n\n【33】*   Patient demographics (e.g. age, gender).\n\n【34】*   Type of event (transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic or hemorrhagic).\n\n【35】*   The definition of TIA used by the study.\n\n【36】*   Level of training of paramedic staff.\n\n【37】*   Items from the methodological quality checklist.\n\n【38】Methods\n-------\n\n【39】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【40】#### Types of studies\n\n【41】We will consider primary diagnostic test accuracy studies if they compare the results of the prehospital stroke screen with the final diagnosis adjudicated by a neurologist using the results from history, physical examination and imaging. We will include only those studies reporting sufficient data to determine diagnostic testing accuracy parameters (2x2 table). We will only include studies that involve one scale versus the reference standard in the same population. We will not include studies using multiple scales versus the reference standard as this would require a protocol for a randomized control model of systematic review.\n\n【42】#### Participants\n\n【43】We will include studies that assess patients, by the use of a stroke scale, presenting to prehospital or emergency settings. The population will be predefined as non‐comatose, non‐trauma patients, with symptom duration under 24 hours at the time of presentation, suspected of either ongoing ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【44】We will not disqualify studies that have a subpopulation of patients with a previous history of stroke, as a previous stroke is a risk factor for future strokes. Participants must be over 18 years of age as this is an inclusion criteria for thrombolytic use.\n\n【45】We will reserve the definition of comatose for patients who present in the field with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 8 and, therefore, require intubation and life‐saving airway management. These maneuvers require neuromuscular blocking agents that will confound serial stroke examinations. We will include patients with a depressed level of consciousness who are protecting their airway, as their examination will not be confounded by medication used for the induction and maintenance of an artifical airway.\n\n【46】Similarly, trauma patients requiring intubation, or who may have significant or multiple fractures, have arguably more pressing medical issues (airway, breathing and circulation compromise) and thus a serial neurological examination or stroke scale will only delay life‐saving treatments. Furthermore, patients with injury mechanisms indicating severe trauma require thorough multisystem evaluation before thrombolytics will be considered due to the potentiality of exacerbating their trauma injuries (hemothorax, subdural hematoma, long bone fractures, splenic, bowel or liver laceration).\n\n【47】#### Index tests\n\n【48】Of further note, the index test must be administered by a paramedic, an emergency medical responder or an emergency physician. There are no limitations on the amount of training the scale administrator has received with the particular stroke scale. Variations in training regiments with these scales (no training to advanced training) will not be grounds for exclusion of studies. We will address the difference in training experience and the variability of experience and knowledge between paramedics and emergency physicians in the investigation of heterogeneity.\n\n【49】#### Target conditions\n\n【50】The target condition is stroke, regardless of its type or severity. An ischemic stroke is defined by irreversible neurological damage due to obstruction of a blood vessel corresponding to the parenchymal territory responsible for the neurological function that is lost. Transient ischemic attack (TIA), by definition, is transient and the neurological deficit reverses without any clinical or radiological evidence of neuronal damage. We will accept studies that have used both the tissue‐based definition of a TIA (negative diffusion weighted imaging study) and the time‐based definition of a TIA (resolution of symptoms in less than 24 hours, but may be diffusion weighted imaging positive).\n\n【51】Intracerebral hemorrhage is a stroke due to a bleed within the brain parenchyma. We will consider the detection of ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes as true positives. We will include patients that present with ongoing neurological symptoms, which eventually resolve after being examined by a neurologist, and fit the definitions described above of TIA.\n\n【52】#### Reference standards\n\n【53】There is no single, 'gold standard' diagnostic test to determine a stroke. Therefore, the following criteria must be met.\n\n【54】1.  The initial diagnosis at time of presentation must have been done by a study‐blinded neurologist who performed the history, physical examination and interpretation of the non‐contrast computed tomography (CT) head and any other imaging. 'Study‐blinded' means that they are unaware of the prehospital assessment. It could alternatively be done by an internist, family physician or an emergency physician with the assistance of a consulting radiologist or neurologist, or both, available in person or by telephone.\n\n【55】2.  The patient must have a documented discharge diagnosis of stroke or 'other', where 'other' could be a neurological diagnosis (excluding a stroke mimic) or a non‐neurological diagnosis. 'Other' can be any medical condition that is determined by a physician where the symptoms that mimic the stroke were accounted for.\n\n【56】3.  The patient's chart must be reviewed by a neurologist and have had the final diagnosis signed off by a neurologist once the evolution of the patient's condition has occurred to the point where they are discharged.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Although some chemotherapies or bio‐therapies have made progress in the remission of this disease, the mortality from gastric cancer remains high. A variety of Chinese medicinal herbs have been used to treat gastric cancer.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicinal herbs in the short‐term remission of advanced or late gastric cancer.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE, EMBASE, AHMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) and CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database) from the first year of the databases to June 2011. We handsearched a number of journals.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised clinical trials of Chinese herbs for advanced or late gastric cancer were included.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently extracted the data, which were analysed using RevMan 5.1 software . For dichotomous data, we estimated the relative risk. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eighty‐five trials with 6857 advanced or late gastric cancer patients were identified for inclusion, most were of low quality and used traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) plus chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone (65 trials). Apart from 23 trials of four different kinds of TCMHs, we could not pool the results because no more than two used the same intervention or outcomes.\n\n【12】TCMHs with or without chemotherapy, in 57 trials, showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of mortality in nine trials, quality of life in 16 trials, rate of remission in 11 trials, and leukopenia in five trials. The pooled results from the four injected TCMHs, Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, but no significant difference in the rate of short‐term remission.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】This review did not provide assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxicity or side effects of chemotherapy, or reducing short‐term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng improved leukopenia when used together with chemotherapy; and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen were of benefit for adverse events in the digestive system caused by chemotherapy. These TCMHs did not improve the rate of short‐term remissions. Large, well designed clinical trials are required urgently before any definite conclusions can be drawn about the value of TCMHs for advanced or late stage gastric cancer.\n\n【15】### Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs for induction of remission in advanced or late gastric cancer\n\n【16】Gastric cancer, one of the malignant tumours in the gastrointestinal tract and with high morbidity among cancers, can easily lead to death once it progresses to an advanced or late stage. There are few interventions which can postpone or stop the malignant course of the illness. However, some kinds of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (TCMHs) have been used as an alternative therapeutic measure to treat many gastric cancer patients in China, and might be effective as an auxiliary therapy for this illness in its advanced or late stages. Our primary investigation showed there was no assured evidence concerning the effectiveness of TCMHs in improving the quality of life or rate of remission, alleviating the toxic and side effects caused by the chemotherapy, or reducing short‐term mortality. Limited, weak evidence showed that four injections of the TCMHs Huachansu, Aidi, Fufangkushen, and Shenqifuzheng showed statistically significant differences for the improvement of leukopenia, and Huachansu, Aidi, and Fufangkushen for adverse events in the digestive system, but no significant differences in the rate of short‐term remission. Most of the included studies were of low quality and valid comparisons were scarce, meaning that more trials are needed for meta‐analysis to draw definite conclusions about their benefits.\n\n【17】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The main investigators of relevant trials were contacted for further information.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (Federation of International Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage III/IV) who were randomly allocated to treatment groups that compared platinum‐based chemotherapy before cytoreductive surgery with platinum‐based chemotherapy following cytoreductive surgery.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in each included trial.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We found 1952 potential titles, with a most recent search date of February 2019, of which five RCTs of varying quality and size met the inclusion criteria. These studies assessed a total of 1713 women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer randomised to NACT followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) or PDS followed by chemotherapy. We pooled results of the three studies where data were available and found little or no difference with regard to overall survival (OS) (1521 women; Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence) or progression‐free survival in four trials where we were able to pool data (1631 women; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; moderate‐certainty evidence).\n\n【12】Adverse events, surgical morbidity and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were poorly and incompletely reported across studies. There may be clinically meaningful differences in favour of NACT compared to PDS with regard to serious adverse effects (SAE grade 3+). These data suggest that NACT may reduce the risk of need for blood transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; four studies,1085 women; low‐certainty evidence), venous thromboembolism (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.90; four studies, 1490 women; low‐certainty evidence), infection (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.56; four studies, 1490 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), compared to PDS. NACT probably reduces the need for stoma formation (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.72; two studies, 581 women; moderate‐certainty evidence) and bowel resection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.92; three studies, 1213 women; moderate‐certainty evidence), as well as reducing postoperative mortality (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54:five studies, 1571 women; moderate‐certainty evidence). QoL on the EORTC QLQ‐C30 scale produced inconsistent and imprecise results in two studies (MD ‐1.34, 95% CI ‐2.36 to ‐0.32; participants = 307; very low‐certainty evidence) and use of the QLQC‐30 and QLQC‐Ov28 in another study (MD 7.60, 95% CI 1.89 to 13.31; participants = 217; very low‐certainty evidence) meant that little could be inferred.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】The available moderate‐certainty evidence suggests there is little or no difference in primary survival outcomes between PDS and NACT. NACT may reduce the risk of serious adverse events, especially those around the time of surgery, and the need for bowel resection and stoma formation. These data will inform women and clinicians and allow treatment to be tailored to the person, taking into account surgical resectability, age, histology, stage and performance status. Data from an unpublished study and ongoing studies are awaited.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Ovarian epithelial cancer\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Chemotherapy\n*   Adjuvant\n*   Interventional Debulking Surgery\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Neo-adjuvant\n*   Chemotherapy\n*   Interventional Debulking Surgery\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Bowel resection\n*   European Organization For Research And Treatment Of Cancer - Quality Of Life Questionnaire\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Overall Survival\n*   Progression-Free Survival\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Death\n*   Stoma\n*   No Evidence Of Neoplasm\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Does giving chemotherapy before surgery improve survival or quality of life for women with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer?\n\n【25】**What is the issue?**  \nEpithelial ovarian cancer, arising from the surface layer of the ovaries or lining of the fallopian tubes, is the seventh most common cancer worldwide in women, and is the most common form of ovarian cancer (approximately 90% of ovarian cancers). Unfortunately, most women with ovarian cancer present at a late stage, when their disease has spread throughout the abdomen. This is because ovarian cancer often arises from the ends of the fallopian tubes, from where single cells can drop out into the abdominal cavity even when the primary tumour is microscopic. These cells circulate around the abdominal cavity in the lubricating peritoneal fluid, implant on other surfaces and grow over time until they cause symptoms. Even then symptoms, such as bloating and bowel disturbance (most commonly constipation), are non‐specific and easily attributed to more common benign conditions. In Europe, just over a third of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis.\n\n【26】Conventional treatment for ovarian cancer involves two modalities of treatment: surgery and chemotherapy. The intention of surgery is to stage the disease (assess where the cancer has spread to) and remove as much of the visible (macroscopic) cancer as possible (known as debulking or cytoreduction), preferably to the point where the surgical team is not able to see any visible residual disease in the abdominal cavity. However, since most women will have widespread disease, surgery alone is unlikely to cure the disease and most will also need chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer uses platinum‐based drugs to treat cells that cannot be removed by surgery (macroscopic disease) or are too small to be seen (microscopic disease). Traditionally chemotherapy was given after surgery. However, chemotherapy can be used before surgery (known as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval debulking surgery (IDS)) with the aim of shrinking the cancer and allowing women to get better prior to undertaking radical surgery.\n\n【27】**What did we do?**  \nWe searched electronic databases on 11 February 2019. We included randomised controlled trials of NACT and IDS versus surgery followed by chemotherapy (primary debulking surgery (PDS) in women diagnosed with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer and pooled study outcome data where appropriate.\n\n【28】**What did we find?**  \nWe found 1952 potential titles. From these we found five studies which met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1713 women with advanced ovarian cancer. We were able to pool data from four studies. These studies compared women who were given chemotherapy prior to surgery (NACT) with women who underwent surgery first (PDS) prior to chemotherapy. We found little or no difference between the two treatments with respect to the time to death or the time to progression of the disease. We found that giving NACT probably reduces the risk of some complications of surgery, but these data were less well reported in the included studies and so we have low certainty about these results. The studies only enrolled women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer i.e. those who had advanced disease; a large proportion of women in this review had very bulky tumours. We are currently awaiting results of two ongoing studies and one unpublished study that will hopefully contribute more evidence to guide clinical practice in this area in the future.\n\n【29】**What does this mean?**  \nOverall, the evidence was of moderate certainty. There is probably little or no difference in how long women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer will survive, if they have chemotherapy or surgery first, where both treatments are planned. NACT may reduce some of the risks of surgery, and probably halves the risk of needing bowel removed and/or the bowel diverted through the abdominal wall via a stoma (a bag attached to the abdominal wall to collect bowel contents). NACT/IDS is an alternative to PDS followed by chemotherapy in women with bulky stage IIIc/IV disease. Individual decisions about which treatment to have first will depend on the individual woman's wishes, how well she is at the time of diagnosis, the risks of surgery and the burden and distribution of disease.\n\n【30】--------------\n\n【31】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【32】### Implications for practice\n\n【33】It is of note that the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) remains an area of extreme controversy in the gynaecological oncology community, despite four studies demonstrating little or no difference in survival outcomes. It is an area which often suffers from a distinct lack of equipoise. This is most often directed as criticism of the results of the included studies, largely based on concerns regarding low rates of optional/macroscopic debulking achieved in Kehoe 2015 and Vergote 2010 , especially. Ongoing studies have been set up to specifically address some of these concerns, although it should be noted that the Fagotti 2016 study achieves excellent debulking rates, but in no small part due to exclusion of higher risk women, both in terms of age and disease status. Analysis of the entire pre‐selected women cohort in terms of optimal/macroscopic debulking rates, would be of interest and more comparable with the women recruited to Kehoe 2015 ; Onda 2016 ; Vergote 2010 . This limits the applicability of the Fagotti 2016 data to the wider population of women with advanced ovarian cancer.\n\n【34】Current evidence is that a combination of chemotherapy and debulking surgery with maximal tolerable effort, is standard treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer. The order of these treatment modalities appears to have little or no difference on survival outcomes for the overall population. These data support the role of PDS as treatment for advanced (stage IIIc/IV) ovarian cancer where achieving a macroscopic debulk can be reasonably expected. NACT may be a reasonable (or preferred) alternative for women with stage IV disease, poor performance status or co‐morbidities. Compared to PDS, NACT may increase the rate of macroscopic cytoreduction, but this does not appear to translate into an increase in OS. One theory why this may be is that cancer regression from NACT may render areas of cancer invisible and these remain unresected , although remains to be proven and removal of microscopic lymph node disease does not improve survival . The existing quality of evidence is of moderate certainty for survival outcomes and low certainty for adverse events and very‐low certainty for quality of life (QoL) outcomes. More, and high‐quality evidence is needed to show which women are most likely to benefit from NACT. One important outcome for women to consider is that NACT reduces the risk by half of needing a stoma following the operation (one stoma saved for every 12 women who have NACT compared to PDS; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome’ (NNTB) = 11.9), which may or may not be reversible later, depending on indication and subsequent response to treatment. NACT also reduces the risk of dying after surgery (one fewer 30‐day postoperative death for every 30.3 women having NACT compared to PDS; NNTB = 30.3); these outcomes were of moderate certainty.\n\n【35】The Leuven selection criteria  may offer a reasonable guide to women selection for PDS versus NACT, although it would be important to validate these criteria in a clinical trial setting.\n\n【36】As far as we are aware, there is, to date, no study that compares NACT/ interval debulking surgery (IDS) with NACT alone, although this review did not specifically search for studies in this area. These data therefore support performing IDS after NACT, provided there is evidence of response to chemotherapy (on imaging CA125 or clinically improved performance status); those with disease refractory to chemotherapy have a very poor prognosis and QoL should be the primary concern in this situation, so they are unlikely to benefit from major surgery.\n\n【37】Interestingly, it would appear that some have interpreted the randomised controlled data (RCT) data as that surgery is not indicated, if a macroscopic debulk is not achievable. This has not been tested in an RCT setting and cannot be extrapolated from the available data. A recent non‐randomised study (NRS), comparing centres with a different surgical ethos, demonstrates that those who have chemotherapy alone and no attempt at debulking surgery do poorly .\n\n【38】Cost‐benefit analyses based on models derived from RCT data, suggest that a NACT strategy offers improved cost‐effectiveness over a one‐year time horizon following initial treatment, although these data will be further informed once OS data are available from all of the included studies in this review and ongoing studies.\n\n【39】### Implications for research\n\n【40】There are currently two ongoing studies ( Mahner 2017 and SUNNY ) and one unpublished RCT . Mahner 2017 aims to address the role of ultra‐radical primary debulking surgery (to achieve higher rates of macroscopic resection) versus NACT/IDS. The results of these studies will hopefully address questions raised by studies with lower optimal and macroscopic debulking rates. Collection of QoL data is an important patient‐centred outcome in advanced ovarian disease, especially if there is minimal difference in survival between treatment options. These were poorly and/or incompletely reported across included studies in this review. Data on rates of stoma formation should also be provided, since women worry about this prior to surgery and it is an important outcome for them.\n\n【41】This review does not address the role of NACT/IDS versus chemotherapy only, without IDS (NACT by definition is followed by other treatment). It can be extrapolated from other studies , that NACT/IDS compared to chemotherapy alone is very likely to improve OS in first‐line treatment. A Cochrane Review  demonstrated improved survival for women who had IDS following PDS, but only where there was no previous maximal debulking attempt by a gynaecological oncologist. In addition, results from the studies included in this review show a strong association between achievement of optimal debulking and an improved prognosis. However, studies of secondary debulking surgery in a recurrent disease setting have not been so clear cut and demonstrate improved survival outcomes, only in women when macroscopic debulking can be achieved, in one study , but not in another . An RCT would be needed to address the value of adding IDS to first‐line chemotherapy treatment versus chemotherapy alone, but is very unlikely to be thought to be ethical, as non‐randomised data strongly support debulking surgery in a primary setting in women who are fit enough to be considered for major surgery .\n\n【42】The Leuven selection criteria  or similar triage tools to determine which women would be better served by PDS or NACT as first treatment for advanced ovarian cancer need to be validated in a clinical trial setting and prognostic selection criteria examined in a prognostic methods review.\n\n【43】An interesting article from one of our excluded studies , examined the role of a women decision‐making tool to help women come to an individual decision regarding intraperitoneal chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. A similar tool to aid shared decision making for timing of primary surgery in advanced ovarian cancer would be extremely valuable.\n\n【44】As yet there has never been a randomised study to address the role of ultra‐radical surgery in ovarian cancer . Data used to support this approach are based on retrospective review of data, often highly selected and at high risk of bias. It would be deemed nonsensical in a chemotherapy study to demonstrate survival curves divided retrospectively into groups based on initial response to treatment, yet this routinely happens in surgical studies. Furthermore, the argument for well‐conducted prospective randomised trials to confirm or refute doctrine in ovarian cancer debulking is supported by the results of the recent LIONS study . This was an area where a large number of non‐randomised studies, including retrospective series, population studies, and re‐analysis of prospective trials, reported an improved survival with systematic lymphadenectomy, as discussed in Eisenhauer 2019 , which is similar to the evidence used to support ultra‐radical surgery. Harter 2019 performed a well‐conducted RCT that compared systematic removal of intra‐abdominal lymph nodes with removal of clinically enlarged nodes only. Women were required to have had otherwise macroscopic debulking achieved and were randomised once this had been achieved, during surgery, to systematic lymphadenectomy or debulking of enlarged nodes. They demonstrated no survival benefit from the additional surgery (hazard ratio (HR) for death 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83 to 1.34; P = 0.65), and those who had systematic lymphadenectomy had clinically meaningful increases in serious postoperative complications, including repeat laparotomy (12.4% versus. 6.5%; P = 0.01) and higher death rates within 60 days of surgery (3.1% versus. 0.9%; P = 0.049). This study adds weight to the need for well‐balanced RCTs to examine the role of surgery. It would be important to include details of all women not included and/or operated on within the study, so that we can compare outcomes at a population level, ascertain how selective the inclusion criteria are for involvement in the study, and how applicable their findings might be to the general population of women with advanced ovarian cancer.\n\n【45】Other questions that remain in first‐line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer include optimal treatment options in more elderly women, since few women over 70 years of age were included in any of the studies included in this review. This population is ill‐served by clinical trials generally and, with an increasingly elderly population in many countries, this is an ever‐expanding cohort of women for who we have little evidence to support recommendations for treatment.\n\n【46】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【47】Summary of findings 1.

In Europe and the UK, just over a third of women with ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis , largely because most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed when the cancer is already at an advanced stage . Symptoms are often vague and of short duration and, as yet, there are no effective screening programmes. In early‐stage disease (Federation of International Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage I/IIa; Table 1 ) radical surgery will cure most women, although a proportion of women benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy . In advanced cancer, even radical surgery cannot remove all microscopic disease and so survival is dependent upon chemo sensitivity. Unfortunately, around 75% of women present when the disease has spread outside the pelvis (FIGO stage III/IV), when surgery alone cannot be curative and the role of surgery is less clear.\n\n【53】Table 1.

The extent of tumour cytoreduction is considered the most important prognostic factor. Griffiths 1975 was the first to report a relationship between the size of residual disease and survival. Meta‐analyses of non‐randomised studies (NRS) have since concurred that survival correlates positively with the extent of tumour debulking achieved . The extent of debulking achievable however, may be directly related to tumour biology, which would strongly bias results from non‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Tumours that have also spread to the para‐aortic or scalene lymph nodes may be less likely to be optimally debulked intra‐abdominally at surgery . Thus, the ability to achieve successful debulking may in part reflect tumour biology. One exploratory analysis of three prospectively randomised trials in advanced ovarian cancer suggested that surgical debulking can partially overcome these biological factors . Other independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were shown to be age, performance status, grade, FIGO stage and histology . Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that routinely removing non‐bulky lymph nodes in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) does not improve survival .\n\n【57】The definition of what constitutes 'optimal' or 'maximal' debulking has changed since the 1980s, originally considered to be no residual tumour deposit of greater than 2 cm in diameter, and more recently as residual tumour of ≤ 1 cm; the current aim is to leave no macroscopic disease (no disease left visible to the naked eye ‐ so called 'complete' or 'R0' surgery) . This is somewhat misleading in advanced ovarian cancer, since in other cancers an \"R0 resection\" indicates that the tumour has been removed with proven microscopically normal margins. In advanced ovarian cancer, due the pattern of spread via the intra‐abdominal cavity, microscopic disease is likely to remain, even after a macroscopic debulk is achieved, hence the terms 'complete' and 'R0' will not be used in this review.\n\n【58】In the past, some investigators had not shown a benefit to maximal debulking in women with high‐volume, advanced disease . However, this may have been because some were very unwell prior to surgery and not fit enough at that stage to withstand a major operation. Vergote 1998 therefore introduced a policy of treating women with primary chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)) or primary debulking surgery (PDS), depending on the extent of the disease and performance status. Following the change in patient management, they reported an overall improvement in survival, despite a reduction in primary debulking rates from 82% to 57%.\n\n【59】The role of so‐called ultra‐radical surgery in ovarian cancer, with extensive surgical effort often involving the upper abdomen, is reviewed elsewhere , and this review does not seek to question the value or extent of surgery, rather its timing in respect to its combination with chemotherapy. A recent paper has demonstrated the importance of the combination of surgery and chemotherapy, with a reduced survival in those who have chemotherapy alone and do not go on to have interval debulking surgery (IDS) .\n\n【60】### Description of the intervention\n\n【61】NACT involves giving chemotherapy before attempting cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer and is a rationale used in other tumour types. It has evolved from the practice of IDS, a secondary attempt at tumour cytoreduction performed after a sub‐optimal attempt at primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy. In a Cochrane Review , IDS performed by gynaecological oncologists secondary to PDS and adjuvant chemotherapy was found to offer no additional survival benefit compared with standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, IDS may improve survival of women in whom primary surgery was not performed with cytoreductive intent by a gynaecological oncologists and who have had suboptimal PDS.\n\n【62】Bristow 2007 reviewed 26 non‐randomised studies (NRS) comparing NACT with PDS and concluded that, while NACT might be a viable option for those unsuitable for an attempt at primary cytoreduction, because of significant comorbidities, current poor performance status or surgically impossible, survival outcomes with NACT may be inferior to PDS. However, this was based on highly selected data, at critical risk of bias, as women with worse disease were more likely to have received NACT/IDS rather than PDS. Thus, platinum‐based NACT may be an alternative to PDS, particularly where complete cytoreduction at PDS is considered unlikely . Tumour resectability depends on the patient's age, disease burden, co‐morbidities, location of metastatic sites, performance status and stage , as well as the skill of the surgical team . Retrospective data suggest that optimal time for IDS may be after three cycles of chemotherapy, followed by a further three cycles, and that delaying to four cycles might worsen OS . However, these data are based on retrospective analysis of NRS data, are therefore at critical risk of bias (women who are doing less well are clinically more likely to have delayed surgery) and, on multivariate analysis, only Eastern Co‐operative Oncology Group performance status correlated with OS (hazard ratio (HR), 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2–2.49; P = 0.001).\n\n【63】The goal of surgery, whether IDS or PDS, should be complete resection of all disease . A review of 21 NRS  found that, compared with PDS, NACT improved the rate of optimal cytoreduction. However, this did not seem to influence survival.\n\n【64】### How the intervention might work\n\n【65】There are several reasons why NACT may be preferable to PDS:\n\n【66】*   NACT may decrease the size and extent of the tumour such that complete resection is more feasible;\n\n【67】*   NACT may improve patient performance status;\n\n【68】*   PDS necessitates hospital admission, whereas chemotherapy can be administered in an outpatient setting and started immediately;\n\n【69】*   PDS delays starting chemotherapy as there is the potential for chemotherapy to interfere with wound healing;\n\n【70】*   if surgery is not curative, residual tumour cells may multiply while the women awaits recovery from surgery.\n\n【71】Concerns about using NACT include the following:\n\n【72】*   NACT delays the removal of the tumour and, thereby, may compromise women's survival;\n\n【73】*   chemotherapy induces fibrosis, which may make complete cytoreduction more difficult;\n\n【74】*   NACT may effectively shrink cancer deposits but leave microscopic disease that is then not surgically removed, whereas the whole deposit might have been removed had it been visible;\n\n【75】*   if too many cycles of NACT are given pre‐surgery, there is a concern regarding the possibility of chemo‐resistance post‐surgery. One meta‐analysis found a negative association between OS and the number of NACT cycles given ;\n\n【76】*   PDS reduces the tumour bulk and number of cancer cells, thereby reducing the chance of developing chemo‐resistance.\n\n【77】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【78】There is considerable controversy in the literature surrounding the use of NACT in advanced ovarian cancer . In one overview, Onda 2011 stated \"NACT is expected to become standard treatment for unselected women with advanced ovarian cancer when favourable results are confirmed by Phase III studies and several problems are resolved\". However, surveys among members of the US Society of Gynecologic Oncology , and the European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology  suggest a large discrepancy in acceptance and use of NACT as a treatment option for advanced ovarian cancer. Many investigators agree that NACT has a place, at the very least, in women with lesions that cannot be optimally resected, or in those too unwell to undergo major surgery at diagnosis . To our knowledge, at least six randomised trials of NACT versus PDS have been underway in the past decade ( Fagotti 2016 ; Kehoe 2015 ; Kumar 2015 ; Mahner 2017 ; Onda 2016 ; Vergote 2010 ;). Since RCTs are the 'gold standard' of evidence‐based medical research, we hope that a review of randomised evidence may clarify what the benefits and risks are of using NACT for women with advanced ovarian cancer, compared with the standard treatment of PDS.\n\n【79】This is a further update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007 due to the need to include further data from completed clinical trials identified as ongoing in previous versions of the review .\n\n【80】Objectives\n----------\n\n【81】To assess whether there is an advantage to treating women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) with chemotherapy before debulking surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)) compared with conventional treatment where chemotherapy follows debulking surgery (primary debulking surgery (PDS)).\n\n【82】Methods\n-------\n\n【83】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【84】#### Types of studies\n\n【85】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【86】#### Types of participants\n\n【87】Women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (FIGO stage III/IV).\n\n【88】#### Types of interventions\n\n【89】Primary debulking surgery (PDS), with the aim of macroscopic resection or optimal debulking (as defined by the investigators), followed by platinum‐based chemotherapy, compared to platinum‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS), with the same aim of resection to the same degree as the PDS group.\n\n【90】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【91】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【92】*   Overall survival (OS): defined as death from any cause from time of randomisation\n\n【93】*   Progression‐free survival (PFS): defined as time free of disease progression or death from time of randomisation\n\n【94】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【95】*   Morbidity/adverse effects classified according to CTCAE 2017 :\n\n【96】    *   direct surgical morbidity (e.g. bladder injury, intestinal obstruction, haematoma, local infection, duration of operation, need for blood transfusion; need for bowel resection and/or stoma formation);\n\n【97】    *   surgically‐related systemic morbidity (e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), chest infection, cardiac events, need for blood transfusion);\n\n【98】    *   recovery, including duration of hospital stay;\n\n【99】    *   toxicity related to chemotherapy; grouped as haematological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skin and neurological toxicity.\n\n【100】*   QoL measured using a validated scale (e.g. QLQ‐C30 , QLQ‐OV28 ).\n\n【101】*   Extent of surgical debulking achieved (e.g. macroscopic, 0.1 to ≤1 cm, >1 cm and combined macroscopic and 0.1 to ≤1 cm, i.e. 'optimal').", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the efficacy and tolerability of melatonin for the treatment of cancer patients.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】According to the most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.6 million people worldwide died from cancer in 2008: 13% of all deaths worldwide . The five most common types of cancer that kill men are (in order of frequency): lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal, whereas the five most common types of cancer that kill women are (in the order of frequency): breast, lung, stomach, colorectal and cervical . Recent research has suggested that melatonin is effective against solid tumours and that through a myriad of signalling cascades that are protective to cells, it may be effective for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer .\n\n【6】### Description of the intervention\n\n【7】The hormone melatonin was first identified in organ extracts from bovine pineal glands in 1958 . It is produced in the pinealocytes from the dietary amino acid precursor, L‐tryptophan. Synthesis and release of melatonin follow a circadian rhythm and are stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light . Although melatonin is primarily promoted as a sleep aid or to help people reduce the effects of jet lag, increasing interest has grown over the last years in using melatonin for people with cancer. Supplemental melatonin is promoted not only to help prevent and treat certain cancers, but also to diminish treatment‐related side effects and cancer symptoms.\n\n【8】### How the intervention might work\n\n【9】Melatonin mediates its effects via distinct membrane receptors. Two major membrane receptors, MT1 and MT2, have been uncovered in virtually every organ including the adrenal gland, arteries and heart, lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, and in lymphocytes . In addition to the membrane‐bound receptors, melatonin also binds to nuclear sites . The signalling mechanisms of melatonin are highly complex and many of the alleged functions are still a matter of debate . Animal and in‐vitro studies indicate that melatonin could inhibit the growth of spontaneous and induced tumours . Some of the proposed mechanisms by which melatonin interferes with the growth of cancer cells are: antiproliferative effects , induction of cell differentiation , down‐regulation of gene expression , modulation of receptor activity in tumour cells , direct free‐radical‐scavenging properties , and induction of antioxidant enzyme gene expression . Further mechanisms that are being discussed are the ability of melatonin to inhibit telomerase activity in cancer cells, thereby making the cells more susceptible to damage and more likely to undergo apoptosis  and its capability to inhibit sirtuins, and more specifically SIRT1. Sirtuins are a group of histone deacetylases which are related to longevity of normal cells and are often up‐regulated in cancer cells. SIRT1 appears to play a critical role in the process of carcinogenesis, especially in age‐related neoplasms .\n\n【10】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【11】A number of trials investigating the effectiveness of melatonin in cancer patients have been undertaken. A systematic review on the efficacy of melatonin on survival at one year in patients with solid tumours included ten randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with melatonin as either sole or adjunct treatment, carried out by one research group in Italy in the period from 1992 to 2003 . Meta‐analysis suggested a consistent positive effect of melatonin at single evening doses of 20 to 40 mg on one‐year survival. Another systematic review on the effect of antioxidant supplementation on toxicity related to chemotherapy included amongst others seven RCTs using melatonin . Results suggested favourable effects on chemotherapy‐ as well as cancer‐related symptoms such as neurotoxicity, myelosuppression, asthenia and cachexia. Authors of a narrative review on various antioxidant supplements in breast cancer therapy counted melatonin among \" agents that show the most promise (...) of enhancing treatment effects\" and which should therefore be given \"priority in trial development\" .\n\n【12】A further two recent systematic reviews investigating melatonin efficacy in cancer have been published . Seely 2011 systematically reviewed the effects of MLT in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, supportive care, and palliative care on 1‐year survival, complete response, partial response, stable disease, and chemotherapy‐associated toxicities. Wang 2012 performed a systematic review of RCTs of melatonin in solid tumour and observed its effect on tumour remission, one‐year survival, and side effects due to radio/chemotherapy. Another systematic review  investigated the effect of melatonin as adjuvant therapy in cancer treatments including several not controlled trials.\n\n【13】All of these reviews are restricted to either a certain group of cancers or focus on a limited number of outcomes or have omitted some randomised clinical trials. Therefore there is a need for an updated and more comprehensive systematic review to investigate the current evidence concerning possible beneficial effects of melatonin in cancer treatments.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To determine the efficacy and tolerability of melatonin for the treatment of cancer patients.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Randomised clinical trials (RCTs).\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Adult patients (18 years or over) with histologically proven cancer disease of any stage.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】Treatment with melatonin alone or in combination with standard antineoplastic therapy (surgery, chemo‐ and/or radiotherapy, hormonal or immune therapy)  \nControl group: No treatment or placebo alone or in combination with standard antineoplastic treatment.\n\n【24】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】Overall survival (OS).\n\n【27】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【28】*   Disease‐free survival (DFS)/progression‐free survival (PFS)\n\n【29】*   *   DFS, also called disease‐free survival time, is defined as length of time after treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer or any other type of cancer\n\n【30】    *   PFS, defined as the length of time during and after the treatment of cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse\n\n【31】*   Tumour response (parameters for response have to be defined or follow standard criteria (WHO , RECIST )\n\n【32】*   *   Complete response (CR), where there is disappearance of all target lesions\n\n【33】    *   Partial response (PR), where there is a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions\n\n【34】    *   Progressive disease (PD), where there is a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions\n\n【35】    *   Stable disease (SD), where there are small changes that do not meet above criteria\n\n【36】*   Adverse events related to antineoplastic treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormonal therapy) of at least grade 3, scored using standardised criteria (CTC version 2 or later) \n\n【37】*   *   Haematological (leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, haemorrhage)\n\n【38】    *   Gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, proctitis, bowel obstruction)\n\n【39】    *   Genitourinary (sexual dysfunction, urinary frequency, haematuria, incontinence, renal failure)\n\n【40】    *   Skin (stomatitis, mucositis, desquamation, alopecia, allergy)\n\n【41】    *   Lymphoedema\n\n【42】    *   Infection\n\n【43】    *   Neurological (peripheral and central)\n\n【44】    *   Pulmonary (dyspnoea)\n\n【45】    *   General (weakness, fatigue, lethargy, malaise)\n\n【46】*   Quality of life as measured by a validated scale\n\n【47】*   Adverse events related to melatonin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Corticosteroids, the mainstay of treatment of acute exacerbations are not effective in the maintenance of remission and its chronic use is limited by numerous adverse events. A number of randomised controlled trials comparing various 5‐ASA agents with either placebo or other drugs have had conflicting results.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of oral 5‐ASA agents for the maintenance of medically‐induced remission in Crohn's disease.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched MEDLINE (1966 to January 2004), EMBASE (1984‐January 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library  and the IBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register.

Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios of relapse rates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】5‐ASA versus placebo  \nIn the main analysis, we used as the denominator the total number of patients randomised. We assumed that participants who dropped out of the study, and on whom there was no post withdrawal information, had relapsed during the study period. Using the fixed effects model, the odds ratio for 6 studies where participants were followed up for 12 months was 1.00 (95%CI, 0.80 to 1.24). Using the random effects model in a sensitivity analysis had little effect on the results with an OR of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.33). For the seventh study where follow up was for 24 months, the odds ratio was 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.90. In further sensitivity analyses, we analysed only participants who completed the study and ignored the dropouts. The odds ratio (fixed effects model) for the 6 studies where follow up was for 12 months was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.96), but using the random effects model, the OR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.02).

There is no current treatment available that completely maintains remission and is without significant side‐effects. 5‐ASA (aminosalicylic acid) preparations are frequently used to maintain remission. This review found no evidence to suggest that 5‐ASA preparations are superior to placebo (no treatment) in maintaining medically‐induced remission. A meta‐analysis was not performed on the occurrence of adverse events because of the different reporting methods used by trials, but incidence of adverse events did not appear to be different between patients receiving 5‐ASA preparations compared with those receiving placebo. In conclusion, there is no evidence that 5‐ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of medically‐induced remission in patients with Crohn's disease.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The effectiveness is seldom examined. Questions have been raised about the assumptions on which such programs are based, e.g., that postpartum women are motivated to use contraception and that they will not return to a health center for family planning advice. Surveys indicate that women may wish to discuss contraception prenatally and after hospital discharge. Nonetheless, two‐thirds of postpartum women may have unmet needs for contraception. In particular, many adolescents become pregnant again within a year a giving birth.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】Assess the effects of educational interventions for postpartum mothers about contraceptive use\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the computerized databases of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and POPLINE. We also searched for current trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. In addition, we examined reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted subject experts to locate additional reports.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomized controlled trials were considered if they evaluated the effectiveness of postpartum education about contraceptive use. The intervention must have started postpartum and have occurred within one month of delivery.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We assessed for inclusion all titles and abstracts identified during the literature searches with no language limitations. The data were abstracted and entered into RevMan. Studies were examined for methodological quality. For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using a fixed‐effect model.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Eight trials met the inclusion criteria. Of four trials with short‐term interventions in the immediate postpartum period, one did not have sufficient data and one was statistically underpowered. The remaining two showed a positive effect on contraceptive use. However, most comparisons did not show an effect in one study and the other had short‐term assessments. Of four multifaceted programs with multiple contacts, two showed fewer pregnancies or births among adolescents in the experimental group that had enhanced services, and a structured home‐visiting program showed more contraceptive use. The effective interventions were conducted in Australia, Nepal, Pakistan, and the USA.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Postpartum education about contraception led to more contraception use and fewer unplanned pregnancies. Both short‐term and multiple‐contact interventions had effects. The former were limited by self‐reported outcomes or showing no effect for many comparisons. The longer‐term interventions were promising and not necessarily more costly than usual care. Health care providers can determine if one of these interventions suits their setting and level of resources.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Postpartum\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Contraception Care Education\n*   Contraception Education\n*   Contraceptive Use Education\n*   Initiation Of Contraception\n*   Lactation Management\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Usual Care\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Postpartum Care\n*   Unplanned Pregnancy\n*   Contraception\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Many women feel that this service is just provided as part of a checklist. Few providers and researchers have looked at how well the counseling works. Some people have questioned the basis for such programs. That is, we do not know if postpartum women want to use family planning or whether they will return to a health center for family planning advice. Surveys suggest that women may wish to discuss family planning before they have the baby and after they leave the hospital. Women may also prefer to talk about family planning along with other issues in mother and child health. In this review, we looked at the effects of educational programs about family planning for postpartum women.\n\n【27】We did computer searches to find randomized trials of postpartum education about family planning. We also wrote to researchers to find other trials. Trials were included if they looked at how much the program affected family planning use. The program must have started postpartum and have occurred within one month of giving birth. We looked at titles and abstracts found during the searches with no language limits. We also looked at the studies for the quality of their research methods. We entered the data into RevMan and used the odds ratio to examine effect.\n\n【28】We found eight trials. Of four trials with short programs, one did not have enough data and the other was a very small study. The other two trials had programs given while the women were still in the hospital. They showed more birth control use for those with the counseling. However, not all measures showed an effect in one study and the other looked at short‐term use. Three of four trials with longer and complex programs made a difference. Two showed fewer pregnancies or births among teenagers in the special group that had extra services. Also, a special home‐visit program showed more birth control use. The long‐term programs were promising and may not always cost more than standard care. The programs that worked well were provided in Australia, Nepal, Pakistan, and the USA. Health care providers can test in their own environment the programs that appear to be appropriate for their population, location, and resources.\n\n【29】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We will review the benefits and harms of enhanced glycemic control for preventing and treating symmetrical sensory and motor diabetic neuropathy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Diabetes mellitus is a disease caused by an abnormality of the body to metabolize glucose properly, either through impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, or both. Before the introduction of insulin and oral medications targeting blood glucose levels, the diagnosis of diabetes heralded early death in Type I (early onset, insulin requiring) disease. It also shortened lifespan in Type II (late onset, not insulin requiring) disease. Furthermore any of a large number of complications compromised general health and quality of life .\n\n【6】Hyperglycemia is diagnostic for diabetes ; the causality and association of hyperglycemia in the many observed complications remains to be fully established.  A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain how hyperglycemia may have myriad effects on the vascular system and multiple organs.  These include, but are not limited to, theories related to advanced glycation products, the polyol pathway, the hexosamine pathway and the protein kinase C pathway .  The elucidation of metabolic disruptions related to hyperglycemia is providing new targets within metabolic pathways for treatment to reduce complications.\n\n【7】Peripheral neuropathy is one of the many complications of diabetes, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Diabetic neuropathy is considered “the presence of symptoms and/or signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after the exclusion of other causes” .  A number of types of autonomic and somatic diabetic neuropathies are recognized , of which peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy is one.  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy may be asymptomatic, clinically evident with either positive (painful) or negative (lack of sensation) symptoms or both, or clinically evident and associated with further complications such as distal weakness, imbalance, foot ulcers, joint destruction (called Charcot arthropathy) and amputations of the lower limbs.\n\n【8】The presence of peripheral diabetic neuropathy is suggested by complaints of numbness and/or pain, usually in a symmetrical distribution and noticed first in the toes. Casual neurological exam performed in an office setting may reveal impairments in sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration or joint position sense.  Quantitative measures of neuropathy may be obtained through quantitative sensory testing (of vibration, thermal and pain thresholds) and nerve conduction studies.  A severity staging system based on neurological exam and more formal testing has been developed by Dyck .  Composite scores incorporating physical exam and sensory testing, such as the Neuropathy Impairment Score developed by Dyck , are predictors of foot ulceration .\n\n【9】The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy at the time of diagnosis (diagnosis by abnormalities in blood glucose levels demonstrated through an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test or elevated levels of fasting or random blood glucose) is close to 10% and may be the presenting complaint that leads to the diagnosis of diabetes.  The prevalence increases to 40 to 50% at 10 years after diagnosis. Highest prevalence of neuropathy is in those people with poorest blood glucose control as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or glycated hemoglobin (GHb) .  The annual incidence of new foot ulcers yearly in a community‐based population in the UK was 2.2% .\n\n【10】Hyperglycemia has been the most visible target for intervention in preventing complications of diabetes.  Prior to the development of insulin, there were trials of diet to control hyperglycemia and prolong life in people with Type I diabetes.  Insulin and oral hypoglycemia agents were developed to target hyperglycemia in Type I and Type II diabetics and are used with varying degrees of success.  The perceived benefits of hyperglycemic control in general led to trials of strict glycemic control and evaluation of individual complications (including peripheral neuropathy). The most well‐known trials are the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial    targeting Type I diabetes and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study  targeting Type II diabetes. Control of hyperglycemia has to be balanced against the risk of hypoglycemic episodes which are associated with their own morbidity.  Presence and progression of peripheral neuropathy has been a secondary outcome in these and other randomized trials of glycemic control and has been a primary outcome in a number of observational studies and trials with regard to glycemic control.  Although there have been non‐systematic reviews of glycemic control, we do not know of a systematic review.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】We will review the benefits and harms of enhanced glycemic control for preventing and treating symmetrical sensory and motor diabetic neuropathy.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【15】#### Types of studies\n\n【16】Randomized controlled trials of enhanced glycemic control for type I and type II diabetes in which the presence or severity of peripheral neuropathy has been measured.\n\n【17】#### Types of participants\n\n【18】Males or females of any age with Type I or Type II diabetes (clearly diagnosed by the accepted standard at the time of the study with criteria so stated in the publication).\n\n【19】#### Types of interventions\n\n【20】Any intervention that enhances glycemic control more than standard care for a period of 12 months or more. Interventions might include more frequent subcutaneous insulin administration, continuous insulin infusion, oral anti‐diabetic agents, lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, or pancreas transplant.\n\n【21】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【22】Change will be analyzed in two ways. Firstly, results will be dichotomised into improved or unchanged versus worse by an amount which will be predefined as being clinically significant for each scale. Where the clinical significance of a scale has been investigated, we will use the definition of the authors of the scale. Where this has not been done, we will stipulate in advance the amount of change on the scale which we will regard as clinically significant. For continuous scales, we will take a clinically significant change as being half a standard deviation of the combined baseline values. Secondly, the results from the two groups will be treated as continuous scales.\n\n【23】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【24】The primary outcome will be change in clinical impairment, as measured by a validated clinical scale in the following order of preference: sensory impairment,strength or a composite score combining either of these clinical features with symptoms or nerve conduction measurements. An example of such a scale is the Neuropathy Impairment Score .\n\n【25】If validated clinical scales have not been used in particular studies,assessment of the primary outcome will not be possible. Nevertheless, studies will still be included in the review if data for secondary outcomes are adequate.We will consider in the Discussion the potential impact of excluding trials which did not include the primary outcome but which showed significant effects on secondary outcomes.\n\n【26】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【27】Secondary outcomes will be change after a treatment period of at least 12 months in:\n\n【28】1.      neuropathic symptoms (measured by change in symptom scales including pain scales);\n\n【29】2.      nerve conduction studies in the following order of preference: peroneal nerve motor conduction velocity (MCV), median nerve MCV, ulnar nerve MCV, peroneal nerve distal compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAP), median CMAP, ulnar CMAP and sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude (SNAP);\n\n【30】3\\. quantitative sensory testing (vibration, pain, temperature) in the lower extremities\n\n【31】4\\. adverse events classified into foot ulcers, amputations, hypoglycemic episodes requiring hospitalization, serious adverse events,  events which prevent continuation with the trial, and other events.\n\n【32】Since adverse events often cannot be considered adequately in randomized controlled trials, we will consider evidence about these from observational cohort studies in the Discussion.\n\n【33】###### Timing of outcome assessments\n\n【34】The primary outcome will be change in clinical impairment after a treatment period of at least 12 months. Outcomes measured after less than 12 months of treatment will not be considered. Where outcomes have been measured after intervals longer than 12 months, we will present the annual rates of worsening for dichotomous outcomes and annual rates of change for continuous outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Primary objective\n\n【3】To compare in head‐to‐head trials the effect of first‐line diuretic drugs versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs on morbidity, mortality and drop‐outs due to adverse drug effects in patients with hypertension.\n\n【4】Secondary objectives\n\n【5】To compare the percentage of patients requiring dose titration, addition of a second or third drug, and switching to other therapy in the same trials.\n\n【6】To compare the blood pressure lowering efficacy in the two groups in the same trials.\n\n【7】--------------\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】One of the major decisions involved in the management of patients with elevated blood pressure is what to choose as first line therapy? The decision should be made primarily on the basis of best available evidence of effectiveness, i.e. the ability of the drug to prevent adverse health outcomes that are important to the patient. Up to the present time the available evidence has not been organized in a way that helps the clinician make that decision.  \nThere have been a number of systematic reviews of the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy but most have combined different first‐line drugs and concentrated on overall effectiveness versus untreated controls  or effectiveness in special groups such as the elderly . When different first‐line drug therapies are lumped together, there is an underlying assumption that the benefits of lowering blood pressure are independent of the drugs which are used and the mechanism by which it is achieved. This assumption has not been proven. It is likely that the pharmacological action by which a drug lowers blood pressure will have effects that are independent of the blood pressure lowering effect. In addition, all blood pressure lowering drugs have other actions. These other actions (both known and unknown) could enhance or negate the effectiveness associated with the decrease in blood pressure.  \nTwo previous reviews have compared first‐line drugs versus placebo and no treatment and concluded that the first‐line class with the best mortality and morbidity evidence is the thiazide diuretics . The best additional evidence to assess that evidence would be to look at head to head randomized trials where first‐line thiazide diuretics are compared to other drug classes. That is the objective of this review. Previous attempts to do this include Collins 1990 who pooled data from first‐line drug‐drug comparison antihypertensive drug trials. However they included only 3 trials comparing thiazides with beta blockers and one of the trials  was not appropriate to make the comparison. The IPPSH 1985 trial compared beta blocker therapy with non beta blocker therapy and both the arms received thiazides, 67% patients in the beta blocker arm and 82% in the non beta blocker arm. Collins 1990 did not include the blood pressure lowering efficacy of the different classes of drugs to assess whether the drugs were comparable in efficacy. More recently Psaty 2003 performed a network meta‐analysis that combined indirect and direct comparisons of different first‐line drug classes and concluded that thiazide diuretics were as good as or better than other drug classes.  \nThis review will build on the previously published review by Wright 1999 and Psaty 2003 to bring them up‐to‐date with the aim of assisting clinicians to choose the best first‐line antihypertensive drug therapy based on the best available evidence of comparative effectiveness and efficacy.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】### Primary objective\n\n【12】To compare in head‐to‐head trials the effect of first‐line diuretic drugs versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs on morbidity, mortality and drop‐outs due to adverse drug effects in patients with hypertension.\n\n【13】### Secondary objectives\n\n【14】To compare the percentage of patients requiring dose titration, addition of a second or third drug, and switching to other therapy in the same trials.\n\n【15】To compare the blood pressure lowering efficacy in the two groups in the same trials.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Study design should meet the following criteria: random allocation to comparative groups, comparative groups must be first‐line antihypertensive drugs in the defined classes of interest. Baseline characteristics must be recorded, morbidity and mortality endpoints must be clearly defined, duration of follow‐up must be at least one year and it must be possible to assess outcomes using an intention‐to‐treat analysis.  \nTrials using other allocation methods such as alternate allocation, week of presentation or retrospective controls will be excluded.\n\n【20】Trials are eligible if they\n\n【21】1.  are randomized.\n\n【22】2.  are of at least of one year duration.\n\n【23】3.  have data that can be assessed by an intention‐to‐treat analysis.\n\n【24】4.  present morbidity and mortality data that compares first‐line diuretics to one or more other first‐line antihypertensive therapies.\n\n【25】5.  are limited to patients with elevated blood pressure (systolic > 139 or diastolic > 89 mm Hg) or separately report outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure thus defined.\n\n【26】The outcomes assessed will be total mortality, total stroke, total coronary heart disease, total cardiovascular events, drop outs due to adverse drug effects, percentage of patients requiring secondary drugs and decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】Participants must have a baseline blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg systolic or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg measured in a standard way on at least 2 occasions. Trials must be limited to patients with elevated blood pressure or separately report outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure as defined above.  \nTrials will not be limited by any other factor or baseline risk. It is assumed that age and co‐morbidities do not affect the relative risk reduction associated with drug treatment.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Treatment should be a clearly defined specific first‐line antihypertensive therapy: thiazide or thiazide‐like or loop diuretics versus beta blockers or calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists or alpha adrenergic blockers or other antihypertensive drugs. The majority (> 70%) of the patients in the treatment group should be taking the first‐line drug class of interest after 1 year. Initial combined therapy with the following drug classes is allowed: potassium sparing diuretics (triamterene, amiloride or spironolactone). Supplemental drugs from other drug classes of interest are only allowed as stepped therapy and only as long as they are not taken by over 50% of the patients. It is assumed that these supplemental drugs do not systematically interact to affect the occurrence of the end points studied. It is also assumed that there are no major differences in the effects of different drugs in the defined classes. All trials comparing two or more specific first‐line antihypertensive therapies will be included irrespective of the dose used.\n\n【31】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【32】We plan to extract information on the following outcome measures:\n\n【33】1.  Total mortality (death from all causes).\n\n【34】2.  Total serious morbidity (patients with at least one serious adverse event).\n\n【35】3.  Total stroke including fatal and non‐fatal strokes.\n\n【36】4.  Total coronary heart disease (CHD) including fatal and non‐fatal myocardial infarction and sudden or rapid cardiac death.\n\n【37】5.  Total cardiovascular events including total stroke and total CHD categories plus congestive heart failure and other significant vascular events such as ruptured aneurysms (does not include angina, transient ischemic attacks, surgical or other procedures or accelerated hypertension).\n\n【38】6.  Percentage of patients requiring dose titration and addition of a second or third drug.\n\n【39】7.  Percentage of patients switching to other antihypertensive therapies.\n\n【40】8.  Patient withdrawal due to adverse events.\n\n【41】9.  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at one year.\n\n【42】When the primary trials do not report outcomes which fit the above definitions, decision will be made based on maximizing the inclusion of the data and maintaining concordance with how the data was handled in previous reviews. It is assumed that the effect of antihypertensive treatment on outcomes is independent of whether elevated blood pressure is defined in terms of systolic or diastolic pressure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】1.  To compare individual active drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) and placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.\n\n【4】2.  To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability.\n\n【5】3.  To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in the network meta‐analyses.\n\n【6】--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes . The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (sensation that the world is unreal) .\n\n【10】Panic disorder first entered diagnostic classification systems in 1980 with the publication of the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ‐ 3rd edition_ (DSM‐III), following observations that patients with panic attacks responded to treatment with imipramine, which is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) . To diagnose panic disorder, further conditions must be met relating to the frequency of attacks, the need for some attacks to come on ‘out of the blue’ rather than in a predictable, externally‐triggered situation, and exclusions where attacks are attributable solely to medical causes or panic‐inducing substances, notably caffeine. DSM‐IV also requires that at least one attack has been followed by: a) persistent concern about having additional attacks; b) worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences; or c) a significant change in behaviour related to the attacks . The core features of panic attacks remained unchanged in DSM‐5 , but in DSM‐5 panic disorder and agoraphobia are no longer linked and are now coded in two diagnoses .\n\n【11】Panic disorder is common in the general population; it occurs in 1% to 4% of people (lifetime prevalence) . In primary care settings, panic has been reported to have a prevalence of around 10% . This is because common mental disorders are more often dealt with in primary care . Its cause is not fully understood and probably there are several reasons why panic occurs. Biological theories incorporate the faulty triggering of an inbuilt anxiety response, possibly a suffocation alarm. Evidence for this comes from biological challenge tests (lactate and carbon dioxide trigger panic in those with the disorder) and from animal experiments and neuroimaging studies in humans that show activation of fear circuits in the brain, such as that involving a part of the brain called periaqueductal grey matter .\n\n【12】About one quarter of people with panic disorder also have agoraphobia . Agoraphobia is defined as anxiety about being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing, or in which help may not be available in the event of having a panic attack . The presence of agoraphobia is associated with increased severity and worse outcome . There are several risk factors that predict the development of agoraphobia in people with panic disorder: female gender, more intense dizziness during a panic attack, cognitive factors, dependent personality traits and social anxiety disorder .\n\n【13】Panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, co‐occurs very frequently with other psychiatric disorders, such as drug dependence, major depression, bipolar I disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, and generalised anxiety disorder . It is estimated that generalised anxiety disorder co‐occurs in 68% of people with panic disorder, whilst 24% to 88% of people with panic disorder have major depression .\n\n【14】### Description of the intervention\n\n【15】This review is focused on antidepressants and benzodiazepines, two pharmacological interventions. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination . The main pharmacological treatments used in panic disorder are antidepressants and benzodiazepines (BDZs). Azapirones, gabapentinoids, anticonvulsants, beta‐blockers and inositol have also been studied but are not a focus of this review.\n\n【16】Historically, pharmacological interventions for panic disorder have been based on the use of older antidepressants, such as mono‐amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) . MAOIs and TCAs are, however, burdened by severe adverse effects, such as dietary restrictions (to avoid hypertensive crisis) for MAOIs; and anticholinergic (e.g. memory problems and confusion), arrhythmogenic (heart rhythm problems) and overall poor tolerability for TCAs . Benzodiazepines (BDZs), particularly high potency ones, have been used as a safer alternative in panic disorder , although they may work less effectively in the long term . Recent guidelines—for example APA 2009 , NICE 2011 , BAP 2014 and Katzman 2014 —consider newer antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, as first‐line treatment for panic disorder, due in part to their more favourable adverse effect profile over older antidepressant groups, MAOIs and TCAs. A meta‐analysis comparing SSRIs and TCAs in panic disorder showed that SSRIs are as effective as TCAs, and are better tolerated , although other studies showed a possible overestimation of the efficacy of SSRIs over older antidepressants in panic disorder .\n\n【17】BDZs have higher incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to antidepressants ; and they may not be effective in treating panic disorder that occur together with depression . In spite of these caveats, it appears that BDZs continue to be widely prescribed for the treatment of panic disorder .\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Antidepressant drugs augment the function of the monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline. Serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) promote the transmission of the neurotransmitter serotonin across brain synapses. They most notably do it in the part of the brain called dorsal raphe nucleus . They prevent reuptake of serotonin into nerve terminals by inhibiting serotonin transporters, thus allowing more serotonin to be available for neurotransmission. In panic disorder, imaging studies have revealed reduced expression of the 5H1A serotonin receptor , which has an inhibitory function, so the increased serotonin throughput may in part serve to overcome this deficit of inhibition. Noradrenergic antidepressants can similarly increase transmission of the catecholamine noradrenaline. Some antidepressants, such as the serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) drugs (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine) and TCAs, can enhance both serotonin and noradrenaline transmission by inhibiting both transporters.\n\n【20】BDZs moderate the gamma‐Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system, which is the brain’s main inhibitory neurotransmitter. They activate the GABA‐A BDZ receptor. This receptor complex contains a chloride channel, opened by agonists, which ultimately reduce anxiety and create sedation. The BDZ binding site communicates only indirectly with the channel, meaning that BDZs are safer than their predecessors, the barbiturates. It is known through imaging studies that the inhibitory GABA system is deficient in panic disorder ; thus BDZs’ ability to activate the GABA‐A BDZ receptor can counteract this. It is likely that both monoamine‐based systems and GABA‐based systems converge, allowing both antidepressants and BDZs to have efficacy in panic disorder despite their differing actions on neurotransmitter systems. One possibility is via serotonergic neurons that modulate GABA input to the part of the brain called periaqueductal grey matter.\n\n【21】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【22】People with panic disorder are profoundly impacted by this condition often experiencing challenges engaging with work, education and social or family life. These challenges not only impact people with panic disorder but also have substantial social and economic costs . Similarly, a recent German study  found that 60% of societal costs associated with panic disorder were due to productivity losses and absences from work. Therefore further information on the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological interventions have the potential to benefit both people with panic disorder and society.\n\n【23】Pharmacological treatments are widely used in clinical practice to treat panic disorder; however, no network meta‐analysis has been conducted recently. To our knowledge, the last meta‐analysis specifically focused on benzodiazepines for panic disorder was published in 1991 ; and the last two meta‐analyses focusing on antidepressants for this condition were published more than 10 years ago and 7 years ago ( Bakker 2002 and Andrisano 2013 respectively). Standard pair‐wise meta‐analyses of psychopharmacological interventions in panic disorder have been published within Cochrane . Other reviews have been published on combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in panic disorder . However, given the complexity of the condition it is very important to carry out a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of the main pharmacological treatment options within the framework of a network meta‐analysis (NMA). NMAs produce estimates of the relative effects between any pair of interventions in the network, and usually yields more precise estimates than a single direct or indirect estimate .\n\n【24】We want to evaluate which treatments, if any, are the most effective and safe. In particular, we aim to assess if the NMA findings are of sufficient validity to help patients, mental health professionals and policy makers identify the best pharmacological treatments for panic disorder, in order to improve clinical practice and patient care. These analyses will also generate suggestions for future research to reduce key uncertainties in the evidence base.\n\n【25】Objectives\n----------\n\n【26】1.  To compare individual active drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) and placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.\n\n【27】2.  To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability.\n\n【28】3.  To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in the network meta‐analyses.\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】We will only include double‐blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing with each other, one of the following drugs  or placebo, in the acute treatment of panic disorder. We will exclude trials in which drugs are used as an augmentation strategy to any other psychotropic drugs. For trials that have a cross‐over design, we will only consider results from the first randomisation period. Cluster‐randomised trials will be included only if intracluster correlation coefficients are reported.\n\n【33】We will exclude:\n\n【34】*   relapse prevention trials;\n\n【35】*   studies in patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder where the effects of treatments are measured after panic attacks have been induced (for example with CO₂ inhalations or lactate infusions);\n\n【36】*   studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at panic disorder concurrently;\n\n【37】*   studies comparing psychosocial interventions; and\n\n【38】*   quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【39】#### Types of participants\n\n【40】The fundamental assumption underpinning a network meta‐analysis is that of consistency/transitivity . We assume that any patient who meets the inclusion criteria below is, in principle, equally likely to have been randomised to any of the eligible interventions examined in this review—that is, that they are 'jointly randomisable' .\n\n【41】##### Participant characteristics\n\n【42】Patients aged 18 or older, of either sex, with a primary diagnosis of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.\n\n【43】##### Diagnosis\n\n【44】Diagnosis will be according to any of the following criteria: DSM‐III‐R; DSM‐IV or the _International Classification of Diseases, 10 edition_ (ICD‐10); DSM‐5. We will not adopt studies using operationalised criteria before DSM‐III‐R because their conceptualisation of panic disorder is substantively different.\n\n【45】##### Comorbidities\n\n【46】When the study eligibility focuses on agoraphobia rather than panic disorder, and is operationally diagnosed according to the above‐named criteria, and when we can safely assume that at least some of the patients experience panic disorder as defined by the above criteria, we will include the study. Considering that over 95% of patients with agoraphobia seen clinically suffer from panic disorder as well , the effect of their inclusion will be examined in a subgroup analysis. We will exclude trials in which all participants have a concurrent primary diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder other than panic disorder or agoraphobia if the focus is not the treatment of panic disorder.

Response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators). We will consider as response the following definitions: “much or very much improved” according to the Clinical Global Impression Change Scale; more than 40% reduction in the Panic Disorder Severity Scale score; or more than 50% reduction in the Fear Questionnaire Agoraphobia Subscale.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the most effective and best‐tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.\n\n【3】To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost‐effectiveness associated with the different management strategies for newly diagnosed glioblastoma among adults aged over 70 years.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Glioblastoma multiforme is a high grade, aggressive primary tumour of the central nervous system with a poor prognosis. The incidence of glioblastoma is increasing and this rise is most rapid in the elderly . Use of the term the ‘elderly' in relation to glioblastoma commonly refers to people over 70 years of age . Age is an important consideration in the treatment of glioblastoma as it is a negative prognostic indicator . Median survival drops from 12 to 18 months for younger people with glioblastoma, to three to six months for older age cohorts . The molecular status of glioblastoma is also an important prognostic factor and several molecular subtypes of glioblastoma have been recognised . One of the most important molecular signatures is O <sup>6 </sup> ‐methylguanine‐DNA‐methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, which has been shown to confer predictive and prognostic benefit . Treatment for glioblastoma is not curative and the natural history of the disease is that patients will relapse after treatment and it will ultimately be a fatal condition . Retrospective studies have shown that older people are less likely to get aggressive, multi‐modality treatment , but people with glioblastoma across all age groups who do get active treatment live longer . Direct healthcare costs for the management of malignant gliomas have been estimated at USD 32,764 per patient (2011 data; Raizer 2015 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】The ‘standard of care' of treatment for patients aged under 70 years of age with glioblastoma consists of surgery, followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) and concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy . This management plan is less often used in the elderly for the following reasons.\n\n【10】*   People over 70 years old were not included in the landmark trial , and a subsequent communication of the results of an exploratory subgroup analysis revealed that the survival benefit in this trial was not statistically significant for subgroup of people aged 66 to 70 years .\n\n【11】*   Shorter radiotherapy courses or chemotherapy alone can lead to better outcomes for the elderly than the standard course of radiotherapy .\n\n【12】*   Treatment toxicity is often greater in the elderly .\n\n【13】*   The shorter predicted survival time for older people with glioblastoma means that they might spend much of this time recovering from the six‐week course of radiotherapy.\n\n【14】Small prospective , and retrospective studies , have shown that, for people aged 65 and over with glioblastoma, maximal debulking (resection) is associated with better survival and a trend to longer time remaining independent versus biopsy alone. Therefore maximal resection, if feasible, is the recommended primary approach to glioblastoma in the elderly . Depending on performance status, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, can then be added. As it remains unclear which treatment is best for glioblastoma in the elderly, participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged . There is little evidence to guide treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in the elderly and approaches are based on retrospective studies .\n\n【15】#### Treatment with either radiotherapy or chemotherapy\n\n【16】A randomised trial of radiotherapy (50 Gy delivered over a period of 5 to 6 weeks) versus best supportive care showed that radiotherapy conferred a 12‐week survival benefit in older people with malignant glioma (malignant glioma encompasses anaplastic glioma, i.e. World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 and 4) . Another randomised trial found that radiotherapy (60 Gy over a period of 6 to 7 weeks) was as effective as intensive (\"dose‐dense\") adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy alone . There is increasing interest in using hypofractionated radiotherapy (radiotherapy delivered over shorter period of time, e.g. 34.0 Gy in 10 fractions over a period of two weeks) for older people with glioblastoma, as it has been found to have similar survival benefits compared to the standard regimen of 60 Gy in 30 fractions over a period of six weeks .\n\n【17】#### Combination treatment\n\n【18】A randomised trial has shown that adding TMZ to hypofractionated radiotherapy for older people with glioblastoma confers a survival advantage compared to hypofractionated radiotherapy alone , but not necessarily for those people with MGMT unmethylated tumours.\n\n【19】### How the intervention might work\n\n【20】Surgery is an important step in the treatment of glioblastoma. Also, there is evidence that surgery improves one‐ and two‐year survival rates compared to biopsy alone . The extent of surgery can be divided into three main categories which have different definitions in the literature: ‘maximal' debulking or gross total resection (GTR), subtotal resection (STR), and biopsy. The role of maximal debulking surgery is to minimise the tumour volume that remains to optimise the impact of subsequent treatment modalities, which are likely to be more effective against small volume tumours .\n\n【21】Radiotherapy is delivered to the primary tumour or the surgical cavity with a margin to account for microscopic spread, patient movement, and set‐up error . One of the most important mechanisms of action of radiation therapy is the promotion of double strand breaks in DNA which, if left unrepaired, will result in cell death . DNA damage is more likely to occur in rapidly dividing cells, such as glioblastoma tumour cells, rather than normal brain which has a slower rate of cellular turn over. This provides the therapeutic index between the tumour and normal surrounding tissue.\n\n【22】Systemic chemotherapy can enhance the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy but is also an effective treatment on its own. The most widely used chemotherapy agent is TMZ, which acts as a DNA alkylating agent . Those tumours with MGMT promoter methylation lack the MGMT enzyme which repairs the cytotoxic damage caused by TMZ, thereby making tumour cells more chemosensitive.\n\n【23】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【24】Is it recognised that treating older people with glioblastoma presents unique challenges and that the standard approach is not always appropriate. There have been several randomised trials in recent years that have tested therapeutic strategies specifically for older people with glioblastoma . Other trials including younger people have also performed subgroup analysis to test if therapeutic benefit is maintained in older people. Due to the variation in age thresholds to define the ‘elderly', performance status, treatment regimens, and molecular subtypes, it has been difficult to translate these individual studies into clinical practice. This is also because the focus of many intervention trials is on survival, which might not be the most important outcome to elderly people with glioblastoma; rather, the quality of the remainder of their life might be their most important consideration.\n\n【25】Selecting the appropriate management strategy for an elderly patient group is important from a quality of life perspective and also has significant resource implications . It has been estimated the average cost for a regimen of temozolomide to treat a person with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is USD 46,693  . It is therefore important to understand the cost and benefits to avoid implementing costly and potentially toxic treatment for little clinical benefit.\n\n【26】Currently there is no clear consensus on how to apply the available evidence to guide treatment of the individual person seen in clinic. A systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomised trials would help to inform the best approach to the treatment of older individuals with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and help to identify research gaps.\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】To determine the most effective and best‐tolerated approaches for the treatment of elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.\n\n【29】To summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs and cost‐effectiveness associated with the different management strategies for newly diagnosed glioblastoma among adults aged over 70 years.\n\n【30】Methods\n-------\n\n【31】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【32】#### Types of studies\n\n【33】*   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for evidence on effectiveness and safety.\n\n【34】*   Full economic evaluations (cost‐effectiveness analyses, cost‐utility analyses, and cost‐benefit analyses) conducted alongside any study design and any model‐based economic evaluations for economic evidence.\n\n【35】#### Types of participants\n\n【36】Elderly people undergoing treatment for histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma. For the purpose of this Cochrane Review, we define ‘elderly' as over the age of 70 years; however, where investigators have defined the ‘elderly' as over 65 years of age, we will include these studies. We will include studies of people of all ages that report subgroup findings for elderly people (over 65 or 70 years of age) provided the participants in the subgroup number more than 20. We will consider including the mixed data if it is clear that 80% or more of participants in the study are over the age of 65 years. Similarly, where the study population includes both grade 3 or 4 gliomas (anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastoma), we will try to obtain separate data for participants with glioblastoma; if this is not possible, we will consider including the study if more than half the study population had glioblastoma.\n\n【37】#### Types of interventions\n\n【38】Interventions to be evaluated alone or in combination with each other versus any of the other interventions include the following.\n\n【39】*   Radiotherapy (standard, hypofractionated, and other techniques).\n\n【40】*   Chemotherapy (TMZ and other types).\n\n【41】We will include all available regimens of radiotherapy and chemotherapy that have been evaluated in randomised trials. If we identify interventions in the included studies of which we are not aware, we will consider including them after we assess their comparability with those interventions named above. We will exclude phase 1 and 2 studies of novel interventions that have been shown to be detrimental and have not been developed further. The anticipated network graph is in Figure 1 .\n\n【42】We will create separate networks according to the type of surgical procedure (GTR, STR, and biopsy only). Within each of these networks we will assume that any participants within the network could be randomised to any of the interventions e.g. an elderly person with histologically confirmed glioblastoma could be equally likely to be randomised to standard radiotherapy, chemotherapy, any combination of these or supportive care.\n\n【43】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【44】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【45】*   Overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause).\n\n【46】*   Quality of life (QoL), as measured using a standardised questionnaire, e.g. the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ‐C30 or QLQ‐BN20 (specific for brain cancer), or the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale (FACT‐G \\[general\\] or FACT‐Br \\[specific for brain cancer\\]).\n\n【47】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【48】*   Progression‐free survival (time from randomisation to disease progression or death from any cause).\n\n【49】*   Severe adverse events, according to standardised scales, e.g. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).\n\n【50】*   Cognitive impairment (objective or subjective), as measured by an overall cognitive function score, as a change‐over‐time score, or reported as individual cognitive function domains, e.g. verbal fluency, processing speed, memory, attention, and executive functioning, using a standardised measurement tool, e.g. Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), EORTC, FACT.\n\n【51】*   Functional impairment or disability, as measured by an overall ability score and/or as a change of ability over time score using a standardised measurement tool, e.g., Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, Neurological Functions Score, EORTC, FACT; or as a categorical outcome as defined by investigators.\n\n【52】*   Fatigue, according to CTCAE, EORTC, or as defined by investigators.\n\n【53】*   Economic outcomes:\n\n【54】    *   Resource use for health care.\n\n【55】    *   Health state utilities.\n\n【56】    *   Costs of health care.\n\n【57】    *   Incremental cost‐effectiveness.\n\n【58】    *   Resource use for health care.\n\n【59】    *   Health state utilities.\n\n【60】    *   Costs of health care.\n\n【61】    *   Incremental cost‐effectiveness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis often have osteoporosis ‐ either postmenopausal or secondary to the liver disease. No systematic review or meta‐analysis has assessed the effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform _,_ and full text searches were conducted until November 2011. Manufacturers and authors were contacted for additional studies during the conductance of the review.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised clinical trials of bisphosphonates in primary biliary cirrhosis compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate, or any other drug.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) and of continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological components were used to assess risk of systematic errors (bias). Trial sequential analysis was also used to control for random errors (play of chance).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Six trials were included. Three trials with 106 participants, of which two trials with high risk of bias, did not demonstrate significant effects of bisphosphonates (etidronate or alendronate) versus placebo or no intervention regarding mortality (RD 0.00; 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.12, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.66, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04). Two trials with 62 participants with high risk of bias compared one bisphosphonate (etidronate or alendronate) versus another (alendronate or ibandronate) and found no significant difference regarding mortality (RD ‐0.03; 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.07, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.18 to 5.06, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04, I² = 0%). Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on liver‐related mortality, liver transplantation, or liver‐related morbidity compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no intervention seem to decrease the urinary amino telopeptides of collagen I (NTx) concentration (MD ‐16.93 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine; 95% CI ‐23.77 to ‐10.10; 2 trials with 88 patients; I² = 0%) and serum osteocalcin (SMD ‐0.81; 95% CI ‐1.22 to ‐0.39; 3 trials with 100 patients; I² = 34 %) concentration. The former result was supported by trial sequential analysis, but not the latter. Alendronate compared with another bisphosphonate (ibandronate) had no significant effect on serum osteocalcin concentration (MD ‐3.61 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐9.41 to 2.18; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%) in a random‐effects meta‐analysis, but it significantly decreased serum osteocalcin (MD ‐4.40 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐6.75 to ‐2.05; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%), the procollagen type I N‐terminal propeptide (MD ‐8.79 ng/ml, 95% CI ‐15.96 to ‐1.63; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 38%), and NTx concentration (MD ‐14.07 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine, 95% CI ‐24.23 to ‐3.90; 2 trials with 46 patients; I²=0%) in a fixed‐effect model. The latter two results were not supported by trial sequential analyses. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients having bisphosphonates withdrawn due to adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention (RD ‐0.04; 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.12; 2 trials with 46 patients; I² = 0%), or another bisphosphonate (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.17; 2 trials with 62 patients; I² = 0%). One trial with 32 participants and with high risk of bias compared etidronate versus sodium fluoride without finding significant difference regarding mortality, fractures, adverse events, or bone mineral density. Etidronate compared with sodium fluoride significantly decreased serum osteocalcin, urinary hydroxyproline, and parathyroid hormone concentration.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】We did not find evidence to support or refute the use of bisphosphonates for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The data seem to indicate a possible positive intervention effect of bisphosphonates on decreasing urinary amino telopeptides of collagen I concentration compared with placebo or no intervention with no risk of random error. There is need for more randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis on patient‐relevant outcomes in primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【14】### Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis\n\n【15】Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of the liver that primarily affects middle‐aged women and is associated with osteoporosis. Low bone mass is an important cause of morbidity in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, leading to an increased risk of fractures, pain, and deformity. Osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis can be due to postmenopausal osteoporosis and secondary osteoporosis due to liver disease\n\n【16】Bisphosphonates, such as etidronate, alendronate, ibandronate, are commonly used drugs for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This review looked at the effect of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Six randomised trials, with 200 participants included, provided information for the review. These trials compared etidronate or alendronate with placebo or no intervention; etidronate or alendronate with alendronate or ibandronate; and etidronate with sodium fluoride.\n\n【17】Having conducted statistical analyses, we found no evidence of effect of any of the aforementioned three bisphosphonates on mortality, fractures, adverse events, quality of life, and bone mineral density in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【18】In order to have evidence on whether bisphosphonates should be used for treating osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis or not, we need large, multi‐centre randomised clinical trials having high methodological quality, ie, low risk of bias, providing long‐term data on benefits and harms that are relevant to the patients.\n\n【19】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective is to determine the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of adenocarcinoma of the small bowel compared to another adjuvant treatment or a placebo or no other adjuvant treatment.  \nThe secondary objective is to identify the most effective type of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Tumors of the small intestine, both benign and malignant, are exceedingly rare. Malignant small bowel tumors account for 0.1‐0.3% of all malignancies . Although the small bowel comprises 75% of the gastrointestinal length, less than 2% of gastrointestinal malignancies arise there . Primary adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of carcinoma of the small bowel, constituting 25% of all small bowel tumors and 39% of all malignant small bowel tumors . Other malignancies include carcinoids, lymphomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as metastases from melanomas, breast, lung and renal cancer .\n\n【6】Adenocarcinomas are mostly distributed proximally in the small bowel, with nearly 80% located in the duodenum or jejunum. Approximately 45% of all adenocarcinomas of the small bowel arise within the duodenum. The jejunum and ileum account for the remaining 55% of small bowel adenocarcinomas .  \nThe most important known risk factor in pathogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma is Crohn Disease . Small bowel adenocarcinoma is also associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, celiac sprue, cystic fibrosis, and peptic ulcer disease . Red meat, smoked and salty foods are known as potential dietary risk factors .  \n\n【7】The clinical presentation and diagnosis of small bowel adenocarcinoma are usually delayed with an average delay of 6‐8 months , primarily because small bowel carcinomas are not amenable to endoscopic examination especially when they are present distal to the duodenum. Most commonly patients are diagnosed after having signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction, but also anemic conditions with positive Hemooccult test leads to the diagnosis . Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel can be detected through an upper gastrointestinal or small bowel follow through series or by a CT scan. Histologic confirmation can be obtained via an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with total duodenoscopy in duodenal lesions, but the diagnosis remains obscure for most distal lesions, and needs a laparotomy to be determined .\n\n【8】Most patients with suspected or established small bowel adenocarcinoma undergo exploration, with high resectability rates at the time of surgery. Surgical intervention in most studies provides a curative resection in 40‐65% of patients,  with reported 5‐year survival rates of 40‐60% for resected tumors versus 15‐30% for non‐resected tumors. Patients with adenocarcinomas in the first or second part of the duodenum require Pancreaticoduodenectomy, whereas patients with adenocarcinomas in the third or fourth part of the duodenum require complete resection with segmental duodenectomy and primary anastomosis. For lesions of jejunum and ileum, wide resection of the involved segment of bowel and its corresponding mesentery. Lymph node metastasis are frequently reported at the time of presentation, and thus a curative resection should generally include a systemic regional Lymphadenectomy, regardless of the primary tumor location .\n\n【9】Role of any post‐operative adjuvant therapy does not seem to be clearly defined in patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel. Radiation therapy is difficult for malignancies of the Jejunum and Ileum, because of the mobile nature of the small bowel mesentery and the difficulties in localising the target field. However, in patients with advanced unresectable duodenal carcinoma, palliative radiation therapy can be of some benefit in controlling chronic blood loss .  \nBecause the rarity of small bowel tumors, the impact of chemotherapy in their management is difficult to interpret, as only few studies have reported the role of adjuvant chemotherapy . A case report of duodenal carcinoma with liver metastases has been published, showing a complete remission with 5‐fluorouracil therapy, and the patient remained well after 30 months of completion of therapy . Another case report of a primary adenocarcinoma of duodenal bulb with extensive hepatic metastasis showed improvement on UFTM chemotherapy for three years .

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared to multiple insulin injections.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long‐term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane Library . For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main Glossary on _The Cochrane Library_ .\n\n【6】The onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus may occur at any age and it is one of the most chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. In adults with type 1 diabetes, vascular complications are a major cause of mortality . The incidence of this disease worldwide varies from 0.1 to 37.4 per 100,000 . In Australia, the incidence is 17.8 per 100,000 and is rising 2‐4% per year . Type 1 diabetes impacts heavily on the lifestyle of the individual as well as their families. Lifelong insulin replacement and monitoring of blood glucose levels are required and patients are prone to acute, subacute and chronic complications of diabetes (that is cardiovascular disease) that are influenced by diabetes control. Moreover, the economic burden is high for the individual, the family, the health care sector and society as a whole, where significant health care costs arise not only at diagnosis but also for subsequent re admissions to hospital .\n\n【7】Since there are no interventions shown to delay or prevent the onset on type 1 diabetes , it is vital that effective treatment regimes are available for optimal management of this disease. Glycaemic control is maintained by replacement of insulin. Insulin is commonly administered subcutaneously where insulin is absorbed and broken down in a series of dissociation steps before reaching the bloodstream. In the bloodstream complexes are formed enabling binding to the insulin receptor for activation of postprandial glucose uptake into the muscle. There are various regimes for insulin administration. Ideally, a patient's insulin replacement regimen needs to provide appropriate basal insulin requirements across 24 hours, sufficient levels to cover food intake, have adequate provision for correction when needed, minimise blood glucose fluctuation and risk of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and achieve short‐term and long‐term targets . Insulin therapy may be in the form of conventional therapy of multiple injections (1 to 4 injections per day) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The multiple injection form of therapy may consist of administering short‐acting, rapid‐acting, intermediate‐acting or long‐acting types of insulin . In contrast, CSII administers a rapid‐acting insulin analogue via an insulin pump programmed to deliver basal rates to match the individual's needs and bolus doses are activated by the patient to cover meals and correct hyperglycaemia. Insulin pumps are worn by the patient externally and insulin is delivered from the pump via insertion of a catheter into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall .\n\n【8】While CSII and multiple insulin injections are both successful methods of insulin therapy, it has been suggested that CSII may be a superior alternative since it allows for the potential to more closely mimic normal physiology. CSII may provide a more efficient mode of insulin delivery to the bloodstream, minimise the risk of hypoglycaemic events and may be more beneficial to those who find it difficult to adhere to a regimen of multiple injections. However, potential adverse events that may arise include pump malfunction, catheter infection, irritation or discomfort .\n\n【9】Only one systematic review comparing multiple injections with CSII has been published . While this review provides an overview of the trials they located, there are some limitations. Firstly, on‐going trial and abstract searches have not been documented, therefore it is possible that relevant studies may have been overlooked. Secondly, important aspects such as the search strategy and methods of trial randomisation have not been documented. We will consider these factors and use specific criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration in our aim to present a comprehensive systematic review to assess the effects of CSII compared to multiple injections. If possible, we will perform a meta‐analysis.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To assess the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared to multiple insulin injections.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】All published and unpublished randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (blind and open, parallel and cross‐over) designed to compare type 1 diabetic participants taking insulin in the form of either continuous infusion or multiple injections.

Ordinarily, the diagnostic criteria for type 1 diabetes mellitus should have been described in the trial. To remain consistent with changes in classification and diagnostic criteria through the years, the diagnosis for defining type 1 diabetic status will be based upon the diagnostic criteria valid at the time of beginning the trial. Acceptable diagnostic criteria will include those described by the National Diabetes Data Group standards , the World Health Organisation , the American Diabetes Association  or by the author of the trial (in these cases, attempts will be made to contact authors to determine specific criteria used to diagnose type 1 diabetes). Differences in diagnostic criteria will be assessed in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【18】#### Types of interventions\n\n【19】Studies comparing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with multiple insulin injections will be considered for inclusion. Insulin preparation and dose of insulin will vary depending on study and individual participants, therefore all insulin preparations and doses will be accepted. Multiple insulin injections will be defined by a minimum of three injections per day.\n\n【20】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【21】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【22】*   glycaemic control (HbA1c, daily mean self monitored blood glucose, post‐prandial and fasting glucose);\n\n【23】*   number of overall, severe and non‐severe hypoglycaemic episodes;\n\n【24】*   quality of life (ideally measured using a validated instrument).\n\n【25】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【26】*   weight;\n\n【27】*   dose of insulin to maintain glycaemic control;\n\n【28】*   number and severity of adverse events (ketoacidosis, local infections);\n\n【29】*   diabetes complications;\n\n【30】*   mortality;\n\n【31】*   costs.\n\n【32】Short (less than or equal to one month), medium (more than one month and less than six months) and longer term (equal or more than to six months) outcome data will be included in the review.\n\n【33】###### POTENTIAL EFFECT MODIFIERS\n\n【34】*   type and duration of self‐management training;\n\n【35】*   compliance;\n\n【36】*   change of medication;\n\n【37】*   type of insulin pump.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Ventilating newborn infants can be challenging due to small tidal volumes, high breathing frequencies, and the use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Mechanical ventilation has several short‐term, as well as long‐term complications. To prevent complications, weaning from the ventilator is started as soon as possible. Weaning aims to support the transfer from full mechanical ventilation support to spontaneous breathing activity.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the efficacy of protocolized versus non‐protocolized ventilator weaning for newborn infants in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, the duration of weaning, and shortening the NICU and hospital length of stay. To determine efficacy in predefined subgroups including: gestational age and birth weight; type of protocol; and type of protocol delivery. To establish whether protocolized weaning is safe and clinically effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of adverse events.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE In‐Process and other Non‐Indexed Citations and OVID MEDLINE (1950 to 31 July 2015); CINAHL (1982 to 31 July 2015); EMBASE (1988 to 31 July 2015); and Web of Science (1990 to 15 July 2015). We did not restrict language of publication. We contacted authors of studies with a subgroup of newborn infants in their study, and experts in the field regarding this subject. In addition, we searched abstracts from conference proceedings, theses, dissertations, and reference lists of all identified studies for further relevant studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomized, quasi‐randomized or cluster‐randomized controlled trials that compared protocolized with non‐protocolized ventilator weaning practices in newborn infants with a gestational age of 24 weeks or more, who were enrolled in the study before the postnatal age of 28 completed days after the expected date of birth.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Four authors, in pairs, independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by electronic searches.

We did not find any randomized, quasi‐randomized or cluster‐randomized controlled trials conducted on weaning from mechanical ventilation in newborn infants. Two randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria on type of study and type of intervention, but only included a proportion of newborns. The study authors could not provide data needed for subgroup analysis; we excluded both studies.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Based on the results of this review, there is no evidence to support or refute the superiority or inferiority of weaning by protocol over non‐protocol weaning on duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in newborn infants.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Term infant (37-41 weeks)\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Preterm Infant\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Weaning From Mechanically Assisted Ventilation\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Weaning From Mechanically Assisted Ventilation\n*   Usual Care\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

However, mechanical ventilation is not without risk, and can cause (permanent) damage to the lungs. For example, the pressure needed to fill the lungs with air may destroy the very fragile air sacs, and result in scaring of the lungs. For this reason, it is important to recognize when a newborn is mature and strong enough to start breathing for himself/herself, and to reduce (wean) the ventilator support. There is, unfortunately, no current agreement on the best way to wean newborns off the ventilator. Researchers have studied the usefulness of standardized protocols to guide the process of weaning off the ventilator in adults and children. In adults, 17 studies of weaning protocols have shown benefit in helping the doctors and nurses wean adults off the ventilator in a safe and timely manner. In children, three studies of weaning protocols have shown they are beneficial in reducing time on the ventilator, but the studies were too few to show harms. As yet, we do not know if weaning protocols in neonates provide benefits or harms. However, these standardized protocols have supplied us with firm evidence for their usefulness in weaning from mechanical ventilation in the care of children.  \n\n【28】**Study characteristics**\n\n【29】The purpose of this review was to look at weaning protocol studies in newborn infants to see if we could draw conclusions on their usefulness for weaning practice in neonatal care.  \n\n【30】**Key results**  \nWe found no studies that involved newborn infants before the 28 <sup>th </sup> day of life. We found two studies with a subpopulation of newborns, but we were not able to extract the data from this subgroup out of the total group studied.  \n\n【31】**Quality of evidence**\n\n【32】There is currently no evidence comparing protocolized and non‐protocolized weaning in newborn infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n【33】--------------\n\n【34】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【35】### Implications for practice\n\n【36】There is no available evidence comparing protocolized or non‐protocolized weaning for reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in newborn infants and hence no implications for practice can be formulated.\n\n【37】### Implications for research\n\n【38】Data from observational studies suggest the use of weaning protocols could reduce the weaning time and duration of mechanical ventilation , but due to the inherent bias in observational studies, better designed prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations. Investigators should consider an adequately powered, multi‐centre, randomized controlled trial using a recognized framework  for developing and evaluating complex interventions. Such a framework provides important guidance on developing the intervention to suit the context (a crucial consideration in ensuring the weaning protocol is specific to the neonatal population). Additionally, evaluation of such a trial should ideally report on context and implementation process factors that can concomitantly impact on trial outcomes . Some intensive care units provide care for both neonates and children; investigators conducting trials in these units should provide clear information on the neonatal/paediatric distribution and, where necessary, provide subgroup analysis of the outcomes.\n\n【39】Background\n----------\n\n【40】### Description of the condition\n\n【41】Mechanical ventilation is a life‐saving intervention for critically ill newborn infants with respiratory failure admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A two‐point cross‐sectional study by the Neovent Study Group in 173 European NICUs included 535 infants (mean gestational age 28 weeks and mean birth weight 1024 grams), and revealed that 85 were conventionally ventilated (defined as all modes of mechanical ventilation except those in which high frequency ventilation is used) _._ Time‐cycled, pressure–limited ventilation was used in 59% of these patients, often (51%) combined with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). Newer conventional ventilation modes, such as volume‐targeted and pressure support ventilation, were used in 9% and 7% of the patients, respectively .\n\n【42】Ventilating newborn infants can be challenging due to small tidal volumes, high breathing frequencies, and the use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes. Mechanical ventilation has several short‐term complications (atelectasis, air leak syndrome, pneumonia) as well as long‐term complications (neurodevelopmental impairments and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)) . BPD, in particular, has been described as a major complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation. BPD has been characterized as an arrest in alveolar and vascular development . Most clinicians use the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Office of Rare Diseases Workshop on BPD categorizations of the severity of BPD assessed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age . This definition of BPD is simply an assessment of oxygen requirements and supplementary ventilator support, and does not evaluate lung mechanics, gas exchange, lung anatomy, or other markers of disease, such as inflammation . In recent decades, BPD has been shown to occur almost exclusively in infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. BPD is a multifactorial disease, in which mechanical ventilation plays an important role . Although the evidence is limited, BPD causes long‐term sequelae. Wheezing and asthma in later life are associated with lung injury that developed due to mechanical ventilation during the neonatal period. The EPICure study found decreased lung function and increased respiratory morbidity into mid‐childhood .\n\n【43】A meta‐analysis concluded that the use of continuous positive airway pressure compared with intubation and mechanical ventilation reduces the risk of BPD in preterm infants . Trittmann 2013 described how one of the strongest predictors of poor neurodevelopmental outcome in extremely preterm neonates is prolonged invasive positive pressure support. There is growing evidence that even a short period of mechanical ventilation will cause an inflammation cascade in the lungs . This evidence suggests that weaning from mechanical ventilation should be done as soon as possible, in order to prevent pulmonary sequelae and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\n【44】In the large European survey by the Neovent Study Group, the reported average duration of invasive ventilation in NICUs was four days , varying according to age and method of ventilation. For example, Reyes 2006 compared SIMV with and without adding pressure support in a cohort of extremely low birth weight infants and reported a median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation of 25 days without, and 20 days with pressure support . Furthermore, since non‐invasive techniques have become more prevalent, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation has decreased significantly .\n\n【45】Adjunctive therapies ( e.g. diuretics, permissive hypercapnia, nutrition, caffeine) to reduce the length of mechanical ventilation and facilitate weaning from the ventilator are being used to optimize the weaning process. The use of postnatal corticosteroids have been described in several reviews and are used extensively, but the optimum dose and time of administration are still unknown .\n\n【46】Three recent Cochrane reviews have concluded that: a synchronized mode of ventilation reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation; volume‐targeted ventilation reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation compared to pressure‐limited ventilation; and high frequency oscillatory ventilation offers no clear advantage over conventional ventilation as an initial ventilation strategy . The most widely used mode of ventilation and weaning in neonates is SIMV .\n\n【47】There is no extensive evidence on the testing of newborn infants for extubation readiness. Up to 40% of newborns under 1000 grams will fail extubation . Two instruments have been described for testing extubation readiness in newborn infants at the end of the weaning process. Use of the minute ventilation test led to a shorter time on a ventilator , and use of the spontaneous breathing test demonstrated fewer extubation failures . Giaccone concluded that there is wide variation in the time window used to define extubation success . We will define extubation failure as reintubation within 24 hours after extubation, although we will collect and report other definitions used by study authors.\n\n【48】A recently published review and conference paper showed that guided weaning from mechanical ventilation is still an important clinical issue in neonatal critical care settings that needs to be addressed . The Ventura 2014 review states that the lack of written protocols causes inertia in weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n【49】### Description of the intervention\n\n【50】Weaning is the gradual reduction of ventilator support and the transfer of respiratory control and the work of breathing back to the patient, eventually resulting in the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Which mode of ventilation facilitates optimal weaning is still under debate. A protocol is defined by the UK National Health Service Institute as, \"descriptions of the steps taken to care for and treat a patient...\" enabling \"...staff to put evidence into practice by addressing the key questions of what should be done, when, where and by whom at a local level\" . Protocolized weaning refers to a standardized process, in accordance with a defined sequential reduction in invasive ventilation. Three general methods are used in weaning protocols an incremental reduction of invasive ventilation support (stepwise reduction protocols) an abrupt interruption of the ventilation support (a spontaneous breathing trial); o a combination of the two. These methods aim to support the safe and quick transfer from full mechanical ventilation support to spontaneous breathing activity, resulting in the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation . Weaning by stepwise reduction involves titration of ventilation according to a patient's physical response and monitored respiratory parameters, such as oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2 </sub> ), blood gas analyses, and chest radiographs. This type of weaning protocol generally specifies criteria indicatin that the patient is ready to start the weaning process when to reduce the amount of ventilator support gradually in a stepwise fashion when to recognize difficulties (complications) and increase ventilator support, an when to extubate the patient. The protocols for spontaneous breathing trials usually includ a set of readiness to wean criteria, followed b a trial of spontaneous breathing on continuous positive airway pressure or minimal pressure support for a prespecified time , an extubation criteria.\n\n【51】A weaning protocol can be written guidance delivered by healthcare professionals or can be supported by a computer algorithm that involves a partial or fully automated closed loop system controlled by the ventilator itself . Automated closed loop systems may improve the titration of mechanical support to the needs of the patients by continuously monitoring the patient's physiological changes and adapting ventilation in response to those changes. There are currently several automated systems commercially available. Examples include Mandatory Minute Ventilation, Adaptive Support Ventilation (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), SmartCare™/PS (Dräger Medical, Lübeck, Germany), Proportional Assist Ventilation, Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (Maquet, Solna, Sweden), and Automode® (Maquet, Solna, Sweden). A fully automated loop controlled ventilator will make the adjustment according to the ventilator's programmed software. In contrast, a written protocol delivered by healthcare professionals requires manual adjustment of the ventilator settings, usually when there is time available to do so.\n\n【52】### How the intervention might work\n\n【53】Traditionally, the weaning process is driven by medical professionals. This requires the availability of a physician to adjust and stop mechanical ventilation based on the patient's weaning progress. There may be considerable variation between physicians due to different experience, skills and weaning procedures. Protocols have been shown to facilitate the weaning process because they are developed by expert clinical groups and based on the best available evidence, which in most cases is better than the decision of an individual clinician. Protocolized weaning potentially eliminates unwanted clinical variation, prevents errors, improves effectiveness and efficiency , and potentially provides better outcomes. Protocols also have the advantage of enabling other healthcare professionals (e.g. nurses and allied health professionals) to participate in the weaning process , thus reducing delays caused by the unavailability of medical staff. Furthermore, weaning protocols have been shown to be beneficial in increasing confidence by providing valuable guidance for junior nursing staff in the weaning process .\n\n【54】If used incorrectly by inexperienced healthcare professionals, there are potential safety issues. There is a risk that the protocol rules may be followed blindly without due concern for the patient's weaning progress and weaning may be accelerated too quickly, resulting in increased reintubation rates. Theoretically, compliance in using the weaning protocol should not be an issue as the intention is that all mechanically ventilated patients need to come off ventilation at some point, and protocols provide guidance to measure and adjust support in accordance with patient need. However, in the hands of relatively inexperienced staff, protocol steps may be delayed due to lack of confidence. For these reasons, implementation of weaning protocols should be accompanied by training and education for all staff involved in the process.\n\n【55】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【56】The use of automated and written weaning protocols in children and adults is increasing worldwide . This has prompted a number of systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on their effectiveness, to evaluate their benefits and harms. In adults, Blackwood 2014 reported that in comparison with usual care, protocolized weaning reduced the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 26% and weaning by 70%. With automated weaning systems in adults and children, Rose 2014 reported a 17% reduction in the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation and a 32% reduction in weaning duration in comparison with non‐automated systems. Both of these reviews reported that protocolized and automated weaning systems were safe, with no significant difference in adverse events compared to non‐automated or non‐protocolized methods. In children, Blackwood 2013b reported limited evidence that protocolized weaning reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning, but with only three trials in this review the evidence is inadequate to show whether achieving shorter ventilation times causes benefit or harm.\n\n【57】In relation to neonates, preliminary observations show promising results. A before and after observational study of the impact of a ventilation weaning protocol on outcomes of 301 premature infants with birth weight < or = 1250 grams, showed a significant decrease in the median duration of mechanical ventilation before, and one year after implementation (18 days \\[IQR 4, 40\\] versus 5 days \\[IQR 1, 17\\], P < 0.05) . Additionally, the first extubation attempt was significantly earlier (5 days \\[IQR 2, 23\\] versus 1.5 days \\[IQR 1, 17\\], P < 0.05), and there was a significantly lower extubation failure rate (40% versus 26%, P < 0.05).\n\n【58】Given the growing interest in optimising the duration of mechanical ventilation, and preventing short‐ and long‐term complications in ventilated neonates, it is important to synthesize the evidence, if available, on weaning and mechanical ventilation to determine the benefits and harms in newborns, in order to provide reliable evidence to guide clinical practice.\n\n【59】This review planned to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize the best current evidence supporting the use of weaning protocols compared with non‐protocolized practice in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in newborn infants.\n\n【60】Objectives\n----------\n\n【61】To assess the efficacy of protocolized versus non‐protocolized ventilator weaning for newborn infants in reducing the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, the duration of weaning, and shortening the NICU and hospital length of stay. To determine efficacy in predefined subgroups including: gestational age and birth weight; type of protocol; and type of protocol delivery. To establish whether protocolized weaning is safe and clinically effective in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation without increasing the risk of adverse events.\n\n【62】Methods\n-------\n\n【63】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【64】#### Types of studies\n\n【65】We included randomized, quasi‐randomized or cluster‐randomized controlled trials that compared protocolized with non‐protocolized ventilator weaning practices.\n\n【66】#### Types of participants\n\n【67】We included studies involving newborn infants with a gestational age of 24 weeks or more who were included in the study before the postnatal age of 28 completed days after the expected date of birth . These children may be cared for in a NICU or paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In studies with mixed samples (children and neonates), we contacted the authors and asked if they could separate the data for analysis in this review. If data separation was not possible, we only included studies with a neonatal sample that constituted more than 75% of the sample in the analysis. Neonates had to have initially been on mechanical ventilation via a nasal or oral endotracheal tube. We excluded studies in which all participants received ventilation exclusively via non‐invasive techniques or tracheostomy.\n\n【68】#### Types of interventions\n\n【69】We included studies comparing protocolized weaning with non‐protocolized weaning practice. For this review protocolized weaning was defined as having used a protocol, delivered by a healthcare professional or automated (computer‐driven), with the intention of removing infants from invasive mechanical ventilation. Non‐protocolized weaning is defined as usual care, i.e. standard practice that incorporated any non‐protocolized practice.\n\n【70】We planned to include all studies regardless of the randomization time point of entry, and consistent with other protocolized weaning reviews , we intended to report the timing of randomization.\n\n【71】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【72】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【73】1.

Preterm infants (subdivided into three groups)\n\n【75】        1.  extremely low birth weight infants (< 1000 grams)\n\n【76】        2.  very low birth weight infants (< 1500 grams)\n\n【77】        3.  preterm infants (either defined as < 2500 grams or based on gestational age less than 36 weeks)\n\n【78】    2.  Term infants.\n\n【79】2.  Total duration of mechanical ventilation per ventilation mode.\n\n【80】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【81】1.  Weaning duration (hours, from randomization to discontinuation of invasive mechanical ventilation).\n\n【82】2.  Mortality (pulmonary‐related or other causes), which includes NICU, hospital, or any follow‐up time point (28 days postmenstrual age or 36 weeks postmenstrual age and at hospital discharge).\n\n【83】3.  NICU and hospital length of stay (days).\n\n【84】4.  Incidence of mechanical ventilation‐correlated morbidity such as: pulmonary interstitial emphysema, air leak syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (based on the classification suggested by Jobe 2001 , and ventilator‐associated pneumonia per 1000 mechanical ventilation days.\n\n【85】5.  Adverse events: number of infants in need of reinitiation of mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of removal, self extubation, or requirement for protracted mechanical ventilation.\n\n【86】6.  Use of non‐invasive ventilation (nasal continuous positive airway pressure, high‐flow nasal canula, oxygen delivery) following extubation (days).\n\n【87】7.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To compare local with general anaesthesia for patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Vitrectomy\n\n【6】Vitrectomy refers to the surgical removal of the vitreous humour (the gelatinous substance that fills the inside of the eye). One common technique involves the insertion of three small (20 or 23 gauge) ports through the area known as the 'pars plana' where the iris meets the sclera of the eye. Pioneered by Machemer in the 1960s , it is a commonly used technique for a wide range of vitreoretinal pathologies such as retinal detachment, diabetic proliferative vitreoretinopathy, macular holes, epiretinal  membranes and non‐clearing vitreous haemorrhage.\n\n【7】### Anaesthesia for vitrectomy surgery\n\n【8】Vitreoretinal surgery, or surgery involving the vitreous and retina, has traditionally been performed under general anaesthesia but local anaesthesia has increased in popularity in recent years. Patients having surgery under general anaesthesia tend to be younger (under 35 years of age) as they are more likely to feel discomfort during local anaesthesia and have more kinesia (eye movement, see Appendix 1 ) . Between 2.7% and 13.8% of patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery have been frightened by intraoperative visual sensations during vitreoretinal surgery under local anaesthesia . An ideal anaesthetic should allow for pain‐free surgery with no systemic or local complications. It should be cost‐effective and should facilitate a stress‐free procedure for surgeon and patient alike .\n\n【9】General anaesthesia causes a reversible loss of consciousness and keeps the patient still. It has a well‐established role when local anaesthetic is deemed unsuitable and is possible in the day case setting . It may also be used because of patient preference or because the procedure is anticipated to be long or painful. However, general anaesthesia decreases turnover and increases costs .\n\n【10】Local anaesthesia is the term used when injections of local anaesthetic drugs are used to block sensation to a very small and specific area of the body, in this case the sensory nerves of the eye. There are four options available for vitrectomy surgery and these are discussed in detail below .\n\n【11】Local anaesthesia allows the patient to remain awake and therefore more able to move the eye, particularly with topical anaesthesia, as this does not affect the extraocular muscles. If the patient should move the eye unexpectedly during an intraocular procedure, an instrument may inadvertently touch a structure within the eye, such as the retina or lens. This may increase the risk of retinal scarring and cataract, respectively. This problem does not arise when general anaesthesia is used.\n\n【12】### Description of the condition\n\n【13】Pars plana vitrectomy is the removal of the vitreous humour in the posterior chamber of the eye through access at the level of the pars plana, where the iris meets the sclera, leaving the retina intact.\n\n【14】### Description of the intervention\n\n【15】General anaesthesia is administered either as an inhaled gas or intravenous injection.\n\n【16】#### _Local anaesthesia_\n\n【17】##### Sub‐Tenon's _a_ naesthesia\n\n【18】Sub‐Tenon's anaesthesia is the administration of anaesthetic underneath the deep lining layer of the eyeball (Tenon's capsule). The anaesthetic can be delivered into the sub‐Tenon's space using a blunt cannula. This requires incising the conjunctiva to gain access to the sub‐Tenon's space. Compared with retrobulbar anaesthesia, there is a reduced risk of perforating the globe, penetrating the optic nerve and injecting into the subarachnoid space, injecting intravascularly and retrobulbar hemorrhage . Supplementation of the block is also simple.\n\n【19】##### Retrobulbar anaesthesia\n\n【20】Retrobulbar anaesthesia is the administration of anaesthetic more posteriorly into the retrobulbar space within the muscle cone. It allows for a longer duration of anaesthesia, up to 45 minutes, and may also increase ocular exposure. The risk of brainstem anaesthesia, retrobulbar haemorrhage and globe perforation in eyes with axial lengths greater than 21 mm are however significantly increased .\n\n【21】##### Topical anaesthesia\n\n【22】Topical anaesthesia is the administration of anaesthetic drops onto the ocular surface. In recent years it has increased in popularity in cataract surgery  as this method is more cost‐effective and provides for more rapid postoperative visual recovery, without diplopia or ptosis. Its role in vitreoretinal surgery has been described  and it has been shown to provide sufficient analgesia in selected patients. This method has not, however, been widely adopted due the longer procedures performed in vitreoretinal surgery and the additional need for systemic sedation and analgesia.\n\n【23】##### Peribulbar anaesthesia\n\n【24】Peribulbar anaesthesia is the administration of anaesthetic outside the orbital muscle cone. Administration is usually via an infraorbital route, which therefore reduces the risk of both intradural injection and intraconal  haemorrhage . It does require the use of a sharp needle, however, and there have been reported cases of vision‐threatening complications including globe rupture with this procedure .\n\n【25】### How the intervention might work\n\n【26】General anaesthetics work at the level of the spinal cord, resulting in relaxation of the muscles, and at different areas of the brain to produce central nervous system depression although the exact mechanism of action has not been ascertained .\n\n【27】Local anaesthetics work by blocking the conduction of nerve impulses. At a cellular level this occurs by blocking sodium channels in the nerve membranes . When sodium is blocked in this way, the nerve cannot conduct an impulse and therefore no sensation can be transmitted.\n\n【28】The attraction of local anaesthesia is that it involves less risk to the patient, fewer side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, and shorter hospital stays, thereby cutting costs.\n\n【29】General anaesthesia means the patient cannot move the eye during surgery, which reduces the risk of inadvertently causing damage to surrounding structures.\n\n【30】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【31】There are currently no guidelines or systematic reviews concerning the most efficacious and safe mode of anaesthesia for patients undergoing vitrectomy surgery. General anaesthesia is the gold standard but it is time consuming and expensive, and bears added intra‐ and postoperative risks, including death. With a move towards day case vitrectomy surgery, local anaesthetic modalities are of paramount importance. A dearth of anaesthetic guidance and unclear literature has lead to a wide variation in practice amongst eye units.\n\n【32】Vitrectomy surgery is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical procedures across the world with over 500,000 vitrectomy surgeries being performed each year, 150,000 in the United States alone in 2005 . With regard to current guidance on best practice the question is particularly topical at this time amongst ophthalmic surgeons and ophthalmic anaesthetists.\n\n【33】It is our intention with this review to assist in the development of a best practice guide. We will review the evidence relevant to the question, in ophthalmic patients undergoing pars planar vitrectomy surgery is local anaesthesia more efficacious than general anaesthesia?\n\n【34】Objectives\n----------\n\n【35】To compare local with general anaesthesia for patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy.\n\n【36】Methods\n-------\n\n【37】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【38】#### Types of studies\n\n【39】We will include all published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different modalities of anaesthesia, either in two eyes of the same patient or in different patients. Blinding of the assessor is preferable, to avoid bias, but we will include studies where this is not the case. Blinding of the patient will not be possible as they will be aware of whether or not they were awake during the operation. We will exclude any combined procedures including phaco‐vitrectomy and scleral buckling .\n\n【40】#### Types of participants\n\n【41】We will include all adult (over 18 years) patients having pars planar vitrectomy surgery under general or local anaesthesia regardless of gender, duration of surgery and indication for vitreoretinal manipulation.\n\n【42】#### Types of interventions\n\n【43】We will study trials comparing the administration of general anaesthesia with sub‐Tenon's, peribulbar, retrobulbar or topical anaesthesia. At least one arm of the included studies must use general anaesthesia and the one other arm must use a mode of local anaesthesia.\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【46】1.  Number of patients with one or more intraoperative adverse events (complications) which may have a lasting effect on the final visual outcome e.g. retinal touch due to patient movement. We will include all adverse effects and later discuss why and how a particular adverse event can be attributed to an anaesthetic technique.\n\n【47】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【48】1.  Number of patients with one or more adverse effects (corneal toxicity due to exposure, lens touch resulting in cataract formation, retinal toxicity including macular oedema, and systemic adverse events with each modality of anaesthesia).\n\n【49】2.  For local anaesthesia, the proportion of patients requiring further application of anaesthetic after the commencement of surgery due to pain. Because of the subjective nature of pain, we will largely limit measures of treatment effect to patient‐reported episodes of intraoperative pain, ideally quantiﬁed on a validated scale. We will measure the number of times additional anaesthesia was required prior to the completion of surgery.\n\n【50】3.  The proportion of patients satisfied with the level of anaesthesia after surgery.\n\n【51】4.  The degree of akinesia during surgery.\n\n【52】5.  The degree of surgical success as measured by visual improvement, patient satisfaction, anatomical restoration, and removal or attenuation of extraphysiological vitreal matter.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Open cholecystectomy has been the gold standard for over 100 years. Small‐incision cholecystectomy is a less frequently used alternative. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced in the 1980s.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of laparoscopic versus small‐incision cholecystectomy for patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched _The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register_ (6 April 2004) _, The Cochrane Library_ , _MEDLINE_ (1966 to January 2004), _EMBASE_ (1980 to January 2004), _Web of Science_ (1988 to January 2004) _,_ and _CINAHL_ (1982 to January 2004) for randomised trials.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All published and unpublished randomised trials in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis comparing any kind of laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus small‐incision or other kind of minimal incision open cholecystectomy. No language limitations were applied.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently performed selection of trials and data extraction. The methodological quality of the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow‐up was evaluated to assess bias risk. Analyses were based on the intention‐to‐treat principle. Authors were requested additional information in case of missing data. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed if appropriate.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Thirteen trials randomised 2337 patients. Methodological quality was relatively high considering the four quality criteria. Total complications of laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy are high: 26.6% versus 22.9%. Total complications (risk difference, random‐effects ‐0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.07 to 0.05), hospital stay (weighted mean difference (WMD), random‐effects ‐0.72 days, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.04), and convalescence were not significantly different. High‐quality trials show a quicker operative time for small‐incision cholecystectomy (WMD, high‐quality trials 'blinding', random‐effects 16.4 minutes, 95% CI 8.9 to 23.8) while low‐quality trials show no significant difference.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent. No differences could be observed in mortality, complications, and postoperative recovery. Small‐incision cholecystectomy has a significantly shorter operative time. Complications in elective cholecystectomy are prevalent.\n\n【14】### Laparoscopic and small‐incision cholecystectomy seem equivalent in complications and recovery, but small‐incision cholecystectomy is quicker to perform\n\n【15】The laparoscopic and the small‐incision cholecystectomy are two alternative minimally invasive techniques for removal of the gallbladder. There are no significant differences in mortality and complications between the two minimal invasive procedures. The laparoscopic and the small‐incision operation should be considered equal apart from a quicker operative time using the small‐incision technique. The complications in both techniques are common.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】1.  To determine whether breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing has beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices.\n\n【3】2.  To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Dysfunctional breathing has been described as chronic or recurrent changes in breathing pattern, causing respiratory and non‐respiratory complaints .  It is an umbrella term that encompasses more traditionally recognised breathing disorders, such as hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) and vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), as well as the more recently identified breathing pattern disturbance (BPD).\n\n【8】Dysfunctional breathing affects almost 10% of the general population. It is more common in women than men and three times more likely in those with asthma .  Whilst there is some debate as to the accuracy of these figures , it is clear that dysfunctional breathing affects a wide range of people, from those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) through to elite athletes.  Apart from the overt symptoms of dyspnoea, chest tightness, sighing and chest pain, people with dysfunctional breathing present with observable alterations in respiratory pattern and rate, which can deviate significantly from the norm.\n\n【9】Much less is known about the condition in children, including its prevalence.  Preliminary data indicate that 5.3% of children with asthma have dysfunctional breathing and that, unlike in adults , it is associated with poorer asthma control .  It is not known, however, what proportion of the general paediatric population is affected and agreement has not been reached on whether dysfunctional breathing in children affects the genders similarly, or if a difference is seen.\n\n【10】Dysfunctional breathing can be a partner to, or separate from, respiratory conditions such as asthma ; this often leads to it being overlooked or misdiagnosed.  Clinical observations indicate that where misdiagnosis of asthma is made, young people receive medications that are either not needed or at a higher dose than is required to control the asthma element of their presentation.  In addition to the unnecessary risks this poses for the child, there are significant implications for health service resources – costly repeat attendances at hospital clinics, emergency departments and general practices could be replaced by the provision of appropriate therapy preventing long‐term sequelae.\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Breathing training is carried out routinely with children in the United Kingdom (UK) and other countries for a variety of respiratory disorders.  There is, however, very little formal guidance for this breathing training in children, and the majority of regimes are taken from the treatment of adults and adapted where necessary depending on the age and ability of the child.  Breathing training is recommended as a first‐line treatment for adults, with or without asthma, who suffer with disordered breathing  but no similar recommendations are available for the management of children.\n\n【13】Courtney 2009 's multi‐dimensional model of dysfunctional breathing, consisting of the three key elements of biochemical, biomechanical and breathing related symptoms, promotes approaches to breathing training from different perspectives. The Buteyko breathing technique (BBT) is a formalised program of breathing retraining based on a hypothesis that biochemical disturbances contribute to dysfunctional breathing. The technique is aimed at 'normalising' carbon dioxide levels by hypoventilation and breath holding techniques .\n\n【14】The Papworth Method and other more modern retraining programs differ from the BBT in that they focus on the biomechanical and breathing related symptoms of dysfunctional breathing. The focus is on normalisation of respiratory pattern with regards to balance between the two compartments of the chest wall (the rib cage and the abdomen) and the respiratory rate .  Diaphragmatic breathing is central to these programs and is often accompanied by education, relaxation and postural correction .\n\n【15】Whichever breathing retraining approach is taken, techniques are commonly consolidated by an individualised home programme tailored to each patient’s needs .\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Breathing retraining programmes encourage patients gradually to alter their breathing pattern with the ultimate goal to restore and maintain a normal diaphragmatic breathing pattern. Emphasis is also placed on reducing respiratory rate and/or tidal volume . Historically it was thought that breathing retraining reprogrammed the respiratory centre to trigger inspiration at a higher level of carbon dioxide, but this is now a source of debate  and the exact mechanism for improvement is currently unknown. It has also been suggested that breathing retraining may work by impacting on the possible neurological and psychological causes of dysfunctional breathing .\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Currently, no systematic review exists evaluating breathing retraining interventions for the management of dysfunctional breathing in children. Whilst treatment opportunities for children with dysfunctional breathing are less freely available than for adults, the core treatments delivered are still centred around breathing retraining even though the breadth and quality of the evidence base is unknown. Performing this systematic review with regard to children will offer insight into the evidence that is available, highlight any significant gaps in the evidence base, and allow the following objectives to be met.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】1.  To determine whether breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing has beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices.\n\n【22】2.  To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】We will include randomised, quasi‐randomised or cluster randomised controlled trials. We will exclude observational studies, case studies and studies utilising a cross‐over design. The cross‐over design is considered inappropriate due to the purported long‐lasting effects of breathing retraining.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】We will include children up to the age of 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of dysfunctional breathing. Children with asthma will not be excluded but will be subject to a subgroup analysis if the data allow. We will exclude any children with symptoms secondary to cardiac or metabolic disease.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We will consider any type of breathing retraining exercise for inclusion in this review. We will include breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing, yoga breathing, Buteyko breathing, biofeedback‐guided breathing modification, and yawn/sigh suppression. We will include programs where exercises are either supervised (by parents and/or a health professional) or unsupervised. We will include relaxation techniques and acute episode management as long as it is clear that breathing exercises were a component of the intervention.\n\n【31】We will exclude any intervention without breathing exercises or where breathing exercises are not key to the intervention.\n\n【32】We will include trials with the following comparisons:\n\n【33】1.  Breathing retraining versus no intervention\n\n【34】2.  Breathing retraining versus another intervention\n\n【35】3.  Breathing retraining in addition to a control intervention versus the control intervention alone\n\n【36】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【37】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【38】The primary outcome measure will be Quality of Life (QOL) (measured by any respiratory disease specific or generic instrument).\n\n【39】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【40】*   Nijmegen questionnaire (whilst not formally validated in paediatrics, this is used in clinical practice as no other validated options currently exist.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the efficacy of air‐modification modalities, (ionisers, vapourisers, humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming), in treating children with non‐specific cough.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Cough is a very common and troublesome symptom of respiratory disease. Non‐specific cough has been defined as non‐productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology , and is common in childhood. The majority of these children have no signs of other current disease processes and, in the absence of research to guide clinical practice, are treated with a variety of therapies. They present a major management problem and cause considerable anxiety to parents.\n\n【6】Treatment of cough is problematic, and many over‐the‐counter medications are readily available and widely used. These include anti‐tussives, mucolytics and anti‐histamines, though there is no good evidence for their effectiveness . Two randomised controlled trials have been carried out on the use of asthma medication, (inhaled salbutamol and corticosteroids), in children with isolated, chronic cough, but neither recommended using these therapies, . Antibiotics are frequently prescribed with variable effect. Difficulties in the interpretation of drug trials lie in the fact that cough usually resolves spontaneously, i.e. the period effect.\n\n【7】Non‐pharmaceutical treatments, to compliment pharmacological therapies, are also very popular. There is a wide variety available and this is a growing market. These include air modifiers, e.g. ionisers, vapourisers, humidifiers, air filters and regular vacuuming and other methods for dust reduction, which are mainly used in the home. Ionisers remove particles from the air, which are likely to include airborne allergens and smoke particles, via electrostatic precipitation. A previous Cochrane review on ionisers in asthma concluded that their use cannot be recommended . One study reviewed showed an increase in the frequency of nighttime cough during the ionisation period and recommended that this be looked at further \\[ Warner 1993 .\\] Many of these therapies are carried out without good evidence for their use. There is a paucity of randomised controlled trials in this area, and many studies in the literature are based on case reports. A systematic review examining the efficacy of air modification modalities for prolonged non‐specific cough in children would be useful.\n\n【8】Objectives\n----------\n\n【9】To determine the efficacy of air‐modification modalities, (ionisers, vapourisers, humidifiers, air filters, regular vacuuming), in treating children with non‐specific cough.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【12】#### Types of studies\n\n【13】All randomised controlled trials comparing air‐modification modalities with a placebo treatment, for any duration.\n\n【14】#### Types of participants\n\n【15】All trials which included children under 18 years of age with prolonged (3 or more weeks) non‐specific cough (dry and non‐productive cough without any other respiratory symptom, sign or systemic illness).

Trials only comparing two or more treatments without a placebo comparison group will not be included.  \nTrials that included the use of other medications or interventions will be included if all participants had equal access to such medications or interventions.  \nThe following interventions will be evaluated;  \na) ionisers (positive and negative)  \nb) vapourisers,  \nc) humidifiers,  \nd) air filters,  \ne) regular vacuuming  \nf) other dust reduction methods (change of carpets, dust covers etc)\n\n【18】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【19】Attempts will be made to obtain data on at least one of the following outcome measures:\n\n【20】Primary outcome:  \na) proportions of participants who were not cured or not substantially improved at follow up (clinical failure).\n\n【21】Secondary outcomes:  \nb) proportions of participants who were not cured at follow up,  \nc) proportions of participants who not substantially improved at follow up,  \nd) mean difference in cough indices (cough diary, cough frequency, cough scores),  \ne) proportions experiencing adverse effects, e.g. behavioural changes, nausea, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity, burns, (side effects),  \nf) proportions experiencing complications e.g. requirement for medication change.\n\n【22】The proportions of participants who failed to improve on treatment and the mean clinical improvement will be determined using the following hierarchy of assessment measures (i.e.. where two or more assessment measures are reported in the same study, the outcome measure that is listed first in the hierarchy will be used).\n\n【23】i) Objective measurements of cough indices (cough frequency, cough receptor sensitivity, cough amplitude).  \nii) Symptomatic (Likert scale, visual analogue scale, level of interference of cough, cough diary) ‐ assessed by the child.  \niii) Symptomatic (Likert scale, visual analogue scale, level of interference of cough, cough diary) ‐ assessed by the parents/carers.  \niv) Symptomatic (Likert scale, visual analogue scale, level of interference of cough, cough diary) ‐ assessed by clinicians.  \nv) Airway markers consistent with infection or inflammation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The use of opioids for neuropathic pain remains controversial. Studies have been small, have yielded equivocal results, and have not established the long‐term profile of benefits and risks for people with neuropathic pain.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To reassess the efficacy and safety of opioid agonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL, on _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE (1966 to Oct week 3, 2012), and EMBASE (1980 to 2012, week 42) for articles in any language, and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles. Searches were originally run in 2005, then again in 2010 and 2012.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which opioid agonists were given to treat central or peripheral neuropathic pain of any etiology. Pain was assessed using validated instruments, and adverse events were reported. We excluded studies in which drugs other than opioid agonists were combined with opioids or opioids were administered epidurally or intrathecally.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently extracted data and included demographic variables, diagnoses, interventions, efficacy, and adverse effects.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Thirty‐one trials met our inclusion criteria, studying 10 different opioids: 23 studies from the original 2006 review and eight additional studies from this updated review.\n\n【12】Seventeen studies (392 participants with neuropathic pain, average 22 participants per study) provided efficacy data for acute exposure to opioids over less than 24 hours. Sixteen reported pain outcomes, with contradictory results; 8/16 reported less pain with opioids than placebo, 2/16 reported that some but not all participants benefited, 5/16 reported no difference, and 1/16 reported equivocal results. Six studies with about 170 participants indicated that mean pain scores with opioid were about 15/100 points less than placebo.\n\n【13】Fourteen studies (845 participants, average 60 participants per study) were of intermediate duration lasting 12 weeks or less; most studies lasted less than six weeks. Most studies used imputation methods for participant withdrawal known to be associated with considerable bias; none used a method known not to be associated with bias. The evidence, therefore, derives from studies predominantly with features likely to overestimate treatment effects, i.e. small size, short duration, and potentially inadequate handling of dropouts. All demonstrated opioid efficacy for spontaneous neuropathic pain. Meta‐analysis demonstrated at least 33% pain relief in 57% of participants receiving an opioid versus 34% of those receiving placebo. The overall point estimate of risk difference was 0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.37, P < 0.0001), translating to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4.0 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.7). When the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief was analyzed, the overall point estimate of risk difference between opioids (47%) and placebo (30%) was 0.17 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.33, P = 0.03), translating to an NNTB of 5.9 (3.0 to 50.0). In the updated review, opioids did not demonstrate improvement in many aspects of emotional or physical functioning, as measured by various validated questionnaires. Constipation was the most common adverse event (34% opioid versus 9% placebo: number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.0; 95% CI 3.0 to 5.6), followed by drowsiness (29% opioid versus 14% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 4.0 to 33.3), nausea (27% opioid versus 9% placebo: NNTH 6.3; 95% CI 4.0 to 12.5), dizziness (22% opioid versus 8% placebo: NNTH 7.1; 95% CI 5.6 to 10.0), and vomiting (12% opioid versus 4% placebo: NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 6.7 to 100.0). More participants withdrew from opioid treatment due to adverse events (13%) than from placebo (4%) (NNTH 12.5; 95% CI 8.3 to 25.0). Conversely, more participants receiving placebo withdrew due to lack of efficacy (12%) versus (2%) receiving opioids (NNTH ‐11.1; 95% CI ‐20.0 to ‐8.3).\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Since the last version of this review, new studies were found providing additional information. Data were reanalyzed but the results did not alter any of our previously published conclusions. Short‐term studies provide only equivocal evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing the intensity of neuropathic pain. Intermediate‐term studies demonstrated significant efficacy of opioids over placebo, but these results are likely to be subject to significant bias because of small size, short duration, and potentially inadequate handling of dropouts. Analgesic efficacy of opioids in chronic neuropathic pain is subject to considerable uncertainty.  Reported adverse events of opioids were common but not life‐threatening. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish unbiased estimates of long‐term efficacy, safety (including addiction potential), and effects on quality of life.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Neuropathic Pain\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Opioids\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Opioids\n*   Placebo\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Pain\n*   Patient Global Impression of Change\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【25】### Opioids for neuropathic pain\n\n【26】Neuropathic pain is pain caused by nerve damage. It is often difficult to diagnose and treat. The use of opioids (strong pain killers such as morphine) to treat neuropathic pain is controversial owing to concerns about addiction and beliefs that this type of pain does not always respond well to opioids. The review looked at short‐term studies lasting less than a day and intermediate‐term trials lasting from several days to 12 weeks. The 31 studies found involved 1237 people with neuropathic pain; most studies were small.\n\n【27】Short‐term studies produced mixed results, with just over half indicating that opioids might be better than a placebo. While intermediate‐term studies all indicated that opioids were better than placebo, most studies were small, most were short, and none used methods known to be unbiased. All these features are likely to make effects of opioids look better in clinical trials than they are in clinical practice. We cannot say whether opioids are better than placebo for neuropathic pain over the long term. Side effects such as constipation, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness were common, but not life‐threatening.\n\n【28】--------------\n\n【29】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【30】### Implications for practice\n\n【31】Short‐term studies provided only equivocal evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing the intensity of neuropathic pain. Intermediate‐term studies demonstrated significant efficacy of opioids over placebo, but these results are likely to be subject to significant bias because of small size, short duration, and unclear, potentially inadequate methods for handling of dropouts. Analgesic efficacy of opioids in chronic neuropathic pain is subject to considerable uncertainty. The difference in outcomes between short‐term and intermediate‐term opioid studies does not support the use of short‐term opioid administration as a predictive tool to decide whether to initiate a trial of opioid therapy. Although our review demonstrated clinically significant efficacy of opioids and an increase in the incidence of commonly‐reported side effects in the intermediate term for neuropathic pain, the participants in the included studies may not reflect those commonly seen in practice. Therefore, issues such as rare but serious adverse events, abuse of medication, or conversely, non‐compliance due to participants' unwillingness to tolerate side effects may not be accurately reflected in our results. Clinicians may be required to assess persons' suitability for a trial of opioid therapy and to monitor progress more rigorously than they would for other pharmacological treatments.\n\n【32】### Implications for research\n\n【33】Our updated and revised meta‐analysis takes the necessary step of showing efficacy for spontaneous pain during opioid treatment for up to three months. A goal of future studies in this area should be to evaluate the true efficacy of opioids for neuropathic pain by means of trials with wider dose ranges rather than fixed‐dose studies. In addition, further RCTs assessing longer‐term efficacy, safety (including addiction potential), and improved quality of life should be undertaken before the value of opioids for management of neuropathic pain is finally established.\n\n【34】Background\n----------\n\n【35】This review is an update of a previously published review in the _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_  on 'Opioids for neuropathic pain'.\n\n【36】### Description of the condition\n\n【37】The percentage of people suffering from neuropathic pain is unknown, but is estimated to be as high as 7% to 8%  in developed nations. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic pain (of which neuropathic pain is a subset) suggest that around 20% of both developed and undeveloped nations' populations are affected . Neuropathic pain may result from a large variety of insults to the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system, including trauma, inflammation, ischemia, and metabolic and neoplastic disorders. Common examples of peripheral neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy and postsurgical neuralgia. Central neuropathic pain includes central post‐stroke pain, pain in multiple sclerosis, and pain after spinal cord injury. The main clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain are continuous or intermittent spontaneous pain, typically described as burning, aching, or shooting in quality, and abnormal sensitivity of the painful site to normally innocuous stimuli such as light touch by garments, running water, or even wind (allodynia) . Neuropathic pain, like many other forms of chronic pain, often has negative effects on quality of life . Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain has generally involved the use of antidepressants or anticonvulsants, but even with the current generation of these drugs, effective analgesia is achieved in less than half of this population .\n\n【38】### Description of the intervention\n\n【39】Opioids are the most effective broad‐spectrum analgesics available and are considered the cornerstone of therapy for moderate‐to‐severe acute pain or pain of similar intensity due to life‐threatening illnesses, but their long‐term use in non‐cancer pain, of which neuropathic pain is a component, is controversial. In the United States, the therapeutic use of opioids in general has risen significantly over the last decade . Despite this, the safety and efficacy of the different opioids in the treatment of neuropathic pain have yet to be established. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of opioids for reducing neuropathic pain have been reported for more than 25 years, yet great variability in trial design in terms of the type of neuropathic pain syndrome treated, the type of opioid administered, and the duration of treatment has yielded contradictory results. Studies that have suggested efficacy have used small study populations, raising questions about the validity of the results.\n\n【40】### How the intervention might work\n\n【41】Opioids provide analgesia by binding to opioid receptors of the mu and kappa class and blocking the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P. Opioid receptors are expressed both centrally and peripherally during the inflammatory response in injured tissue.\n\n【42】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【43】There is a lack of definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of opioids in reducing neuropathic pain in general, and central neuropathic pain in particular. Equally, there are concerns about tolerability of opioids and the potential for abuse, addiction, hormonal abnormalities, dysfunction of the immune system, and, in some cases, paradoxical hyperalgesia with long‐term use . Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【44】Objectives\n----------\n\n【45】We attempted to answer two questions:  \n1) What is the efficacy of opioid agonists in relieving neuropathic pain?  \n2) What is the nature and incidence or severity of adverse effects caused by opioid agonists in people with neuropathic pain?\n\n【46】Methods\n-------\n\n【47】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【48】#### Types of studies\n\n【49】We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this review if opioid agonists (but not partial agonists or agonist‐antagonists) were given to treat central or peripheral neuropathic pain of any etiology. Studies with pain intensity as the primary or secondary outcome were included. Non‐randomized studies and case reports were excluded, as were retrieved trials that presented insufficient data to allow assessment of the outcomes of interest or study quality.\n\n【50】#### Types of participants\n\n【51】We included men and women of all ages and races or ethnicities. We excluded studies in which participants with both neuropathic and other types of pain (e.g. nociceptive) were enrolled and responses of the two groups were not presented separately.\n\n【52】#### Types of interventions\n\n【53】We included studies in which one or more opioid agonists or different doses of the same opioid agonist were compared with placebo, each other, or another class of medication used for neuropathic pain (e.g. antidepressants). We included studies in which drugs were administered by any of the following routes: oral, rectal, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous.\n\n【54】We excluded studies in which: drugs other than opioid agonists were combined with opioids (e.g. codeine with acetaminophen); opioids were administered epidurally or intrathecally, as the epidural route is usually reserved for postoperative/labor pain, and while the intrathecal route is used in neuropathic pain (usually via an implantable pump) such therapy is typically classified as neuro‐modulation rather than analgesia; or if tramadol or tapentadol were used as the active drug, because, although both interact to some degree with opioid receptors, they are not regarded as pure opioid agonists. The efficacy of tramadol in relieving neuropathic pain has been reviewed elsewhere .\n\n【55】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【56】We included participant‐reported measure(s) of pain intensity or pain relief using validated methods.\n\n【57】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【58】In our updated review the primary outcomes we sought were the proportion of participants reporting at least 33% pain reduction from baseline or 50% or more pain reduction from baseline. The selection of these outcomes, as opposed to the primary outcomes in our original review (mean pain intensity difference or mean pain relief) was based on the observation that pain relief tends to be bimodal, rendering mean values less useful. A greater than or equal to 33% (or ≥ 30%) pain reduction from baseline was based upon analyses demonstrating that such a reduction was required for people with chronic pain to perceive a clinically meaningful change in pain intensity . More recent evidence suggests that at least 50% pain relief is clinically significant, because high levels of pain relief are strongly associated with improved fatigue, sleep, depression, work ability and quality of life . While such data are rarely reported in older studies, we anticipated that those studies found in our updated search would report them.\n\n【59】Where studies did not report numbers of participants with at least 33% or 50% improvement, but reported numbers of participants reporting certain categories of global impression of change, e.g. \"much improved\", we translated these categories to equate to either at least 33% pain reduction from baseline or at least 50% pain reduction from baseline .\n\n【60】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【61】We extracted data on the following secondary outcomes:\n\n【62】1.  Pain intensity or pain intensity difference or pain relief using a visual analog scale (VAS) or numerical rating scale (NRS).\n\n【63】2.  Outcomes based on pain questionnaires and quality of life (QoL) measurement instruments, including those recommended as core chronic pain outcome domains  (Multidimensional Pain Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory interference scales, Beck Depression Inventory and Profile of Mood States).\n\n【64】3.  Incidence of adverse events during treatment with opioid or control (intermediate‐term studies only).\n\n【65】4.  Participant dropouts due to adverse events (intermediate‐term studies only).\n\n【66】5.  Participant dropouts due to lack of efficacy (intermediate‐term studies only).\n\n【67】We normalized pain intensity data assessed by means other than a 0 ‐ 100 VAS to such a scale. To do so we either multiplied the original scale employed by an appropriate factor (e.g. by ten if the original scale was a 0 ‐ 10 scale) or by assigning values on a 0 ‐ 100 scale that corresponded to choices on the original assessment scale. For example, if a participant was offered a five‐point scale, selection of the third point was scored as 50 on a 0 ‐ 100 scale (0 = no pain, 1 = 25, 2 = 50, 3 = 75, 4 = 100).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We aim to test the following null hypotheses:\n\n【3】1\\. Wire fixation is not associated with improved outcome.  \n2\\. Fracture of the ulna does not improve the outcome of an associated radial fracture.  \n3\\. Above elbow casts are not associated with lower risk of redisplacement.  \n4\\. Above elbow casts with the elbow in supination are not associated with a lower risk of displacement\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】The outstretched hand is a common protective reflex in humans to break a fall. The upper limb therefore bears the brunt of the axial force in such an event and is at risk of fracture along its length if the force exceeds the strength of the bony skeleton. In children this is most likely to occur at the wrist.\n\n【7】The epidemiology of fracture in children has been reported in detail by Worlock 1986 . The most common mechanism in their study was a fall in or around the house onto an outstretched hand causing a fracture of the distal radius and ulna. These injuries accounted for 35.8% of all fractures in this age group and the annual incidence was estimated to be 16 per 1000 children in the UK.\n\n【8】Fractures of the distal radius have been divided into six categories by Herring 2002 ‐ buckle, greenstick, metaphyseal, distal radial physeal injuries, distal ulnar physeal injuries and Galeazzi fractures. Buckle fractures are incomplete fractures which appear on X‐ray examination to involve compression of only part of the circumference of the cortex of the bone. They are stable injuries and require no more than minimal splintage for pain and discomfort. Greenstick fractures are somewhat similar, involving complete disruption of a segment of cortex with associated plastic deformation of the remaining cortex at that level, which may result in significant deformity. If the amount of deforming force transcends the resistance of both cortices a complete (bicortical) metaphyseal fracture occurs. These are often displaced in all planes creating a deformity requiring reduction and immobilisation.\n\n【9】In growing children, a growth plate (physis) is present at the lower end of each forearm bone. Somewhat commoner in older children, fractures close to the physis of the lower end of the radius account for about 20% of childhood wrist fractures . If displaced, these fractures also require reduction and immobilisation.\n\n【10】Fractures of the distal ulna epiphysis and fractures of the distal radius with disruption of the distal radio‐ulnar joint are rare in children. Neither of these fracture types will be considered in any further detail in this review.\n\n【11】The management of buckle fractures of the distal radius is relatively uncontroversial, involving splintage for symptomatic relief from pain. Some authors have advocated removable wrist supports, with discontinuation of splintage at the parents' discretion .\n\n【12】The controversial issues in the management of distal radius fracture involve what constitutes a degree of fracture displacement and angulation likely to be compensated by remodelling with growth over time, indications for fracture stabilisation with wires or other invasive methods compared with plaster casting alone, details of the position of the arm during immobilisation in a cast, and whether the cast should immobilise the wrist alone or both, the wrist and the elbow.\n\n【13】A recent study suggests that wire fixation should form part of the treatment in the immobilisation of displaced metaphyseal fractures . This has been especially advocated for displaced distal shaft and metaphyseal fractures in which the ulna is either intact or has undergone plastic deformation . Traditionally an above elbow cast in supination has been the accepted form of immobilisation following a displaced distal radial fracture. In a randomised controlled trial Boyer 2002 , found no difference in the residual angular deformity at the fracture site, at the time of union between above elbow casts in supination, pronation or in neutral. In a large retrospective study of 761 distal radial fractures all treated with short arm casts, Chess 1994 reported a 10% rate of significant loss of fracture alignment during immobilisation, these cases correlating well with the quality of moulding of the applied cast.\n\n【14】In summary, distal radius fractures are common throughout childhood from first walking through to adolescence. The anatomical site of the injury determines the degree of deformity accepted and the form of immobilisation traditionally practiced. Controversial areas of management such as the use of wire stabilisation, position of immobilisation and short arm casts will form the focus of this review\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】We aim to test the following null hypotheses:\n\n【17】1\\.

This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2009.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】1\\. To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo.\n\n【4】2\\. To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non‐response to prior treatment.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) was carried out . These registers include reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: EMBASE (1970‐), MEDLINE (1950‐) and PsycINFO (1960‐). Reference lists of all studies and related reviews were screened and key authors contacted.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with acute major depression with psychotic features, as well as RCTs consisting of participants with acute major depression with or without psychotic features, that reported separately on the subgroup of participants with psychotic features.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . Data were entered into RevMan 5.1. We used intention‐to‐treat data. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated. For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs. Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta‐analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis.\n\n【13】We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic.\n\n【14】However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, P = 0.006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003).\n\n【15】Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Psychotic depression is heavily understudied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn. Some evidence indicates that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than either treatment alone or placebo. Evidence is limited for treatment with an antidepressant alone or with an antipsychotic alone.\n### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Populatio\n\n【19】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Psychotic Depression\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Interventio\n\n【21】*   Antipsychotics\n*   Antidepressants\n\n【22】###### Compariso\n\n【23】*   Antipsychotics\n*   Antidepressants\n*   Placebo\n\n【24】###### Outcom\n\n【25】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Depression\n*   Therapeutic Response\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【27】### Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression\n\n【28】Psychotic depression is a severe depression with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations). Uncertainty surrounds the most effective drug treatment for psychotic depression: with an antidepressant alone, with an antipsychotic alone or with the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic.\n\n【29】The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression. We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated drug treatments for psychotic depression. We searched for these trials in a wide‐ranging way. The search identified 3659 studies, but in the end, we found only 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 929 people.\n\n【30】From these trials, we found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic provides more effective treatment for psychotic depression than either treatment alone. However, our confidence in this conclusion is limited because the information came from only a small number of RCTs, which included small numbers of people. In addition, the types of people involved varied between RCTs, and the RCTs differed in design, which means that we cannot confidently generalise their findings.\n\n【31】--------------\n\n【32】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【33】### Implications for practice\n\n【34】Psychotic depression is heavily under‐studied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn. Evidence suggests that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than either treatment alone or placebo. Evidence for treatment with an antidepressant alone or for an antipsychotic alone is lacking.\n\n【35】### Implications for research\n\n【36】Further studies are needed:\n\n【37】1.  to study the efficacy of other combinations of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic. Regarding the antidepressants: combinations with a TCA, with an SSRI or with other newer antidepressants such as mirtazapine; regarding the antipsychotics: combinations with other so called atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, etc.);\n\n【38】2.  to compare the effect of the combination of an antidepressant with antipsychotics with other pharmacological options, such as the augmentation of an antidepressant with lithium or more experimental treatments such as ketamine;\n\n【39】3.  to compare the effect of the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic with ECT; and\n\n【40】4.  to evaluate the efficacy of stepwise approaches or algorithms encompassing the previous steps after each other.\n\n【41】Background\n----------\n\n【42】### Description of the condition\n\n【43】Psychotic depression is a severe condition that is defined as a depressive episode with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations) in the context of a (unipolar) major depressive disorder. Psychotic depression is not uncommon. In the US Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study , 14% of participants who met the criteria for major depression had a history of episodes with psychotic features. In a European general population study, 18.5% of respondents with a major depressive episode had psychotic features; the prevalence of psychotic depression was 0.4% and of non‐psychotic depression 2.0% . In a US study of hospitalised participants with major depression, 25% met the criteria for psychotic depression . Compared with non‐psychotic depression, psychotic depression is marked by greater severity, increased incapacity, a lower likelihood of placebo response, longer duration of episodes and recurrence of psychotic features in subsequent episodes .\n\n【44】### Description of the intervention\n\n【45】Guidelines  recommend electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or pharmacotherapy as treatment for psychotic depression. Pharmacotherapy for psychotic depression could consist of an antipsychotic, an antidepressant or a combination of both. Most guidelines recommend treatment that combines an antidepressant with an antipsychotic ( APA 2010 ; NICE 2009 . However, discussion continues regarding whether the combination of an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant is more effective than monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic . The intervention studied in this review is pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression, especially the question of whether the combination of an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant is more effective than either treatment given as monotherapy.\n\n【46】### How the intervention might work\n\n【47】All antidepressants enhance the activity of serotonin and/or noradrenaline, and some of them (also) dopamine . Most antidepressants achieve this via inhibition of reuptake of these neurotransmitters in the presynaptic neuron (tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)), although some antidepressants have other working mechanisms (e.g. blockade of postsynaptic serotonin‐2 receptors such as mirtazapine or inhibition of their breakdown via inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOIs)). Nevertheless, their noradrenergic and serotonergic effects do not completely explain their efficacy, as these effects occur already within hours after first intake, but it takes days to weeks before antidepressants begin to exert their effects in participants with depression or anxiety .\n\n【48】Almost all antipsychotics (classical as well as atypical antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine) are blockers of the postsynaptic dopamine‐2 receptor, and their therapeutic efficacy is correlated with their affinity for dopamine‐2 receptors in vivo. However, other effects may contribute to their efficacy, such as their affinity for presynaptic serotonin‐1 receptors, postsynaptic serotonin‐2 receptors and histamine receptors, as can be seen with some atypical antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine and quetiapine). Similar to the antidepressants, these effects do not completely explain their efficacy because they also occur already within hours after first intake, but it takes days to weeks for antipsychotics to begin to work .\n\n【49】The traditional view is that antidepressants work against depression and antipsychotics work against psychosis. Therefore, it seems appropriate in psychotic depression to treat the psychotic symptoms with an antipsychotic and the depressive symptoms with an antidepressant. However, when psychotic depression is considered as the most severe form of depression, and when psychosis is viewed as the distal consequence of that severity (as is the case in the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR);_ APA 2000 ), treatment with an antidepressant alone seems logical. On the other hand, treatment with an antipsychotic alone, especially one of the newer atypical antipsychotics with possibly antidepressant effects, cannot be ruled out.\n\n【50】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【51】Clinical practise is characterised by uncertainty as to whether it is most appropriate to start treatment in this patient group with antidepressant monotherapy or with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic because of the potential adverse effects of antipsychotics (especially extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinaemia and the risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain). A previous meta‐analysis did not find a statistically significant difference between TCA monotherapy and combination therapy . However, the findings and conclusions of that meta‐analysis were limited by the inadequate methodology of many of the included studies, which were often retrospective, uncontrolled and/or not randomised. Some international guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of psychotic depression  and those presented in reviews  suggest that one may consider TCA monotherapy before adding an antipsychotic. However, in contrast, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder  and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  recommend initial combination therapy. The same recommendation is made in a review by Coryell . This variation between guidelines reflects the limited evidence on which these guidelines are based. In a review about evidence used in practice guidelines , we concluded that physicians (and patients) should be aware that guidelines for treatment recommendations may be less evidence‐based than asserted, even when it is stated that treatment recommendations are based on the highest level of evidence.\n\n【52】Treatment with a classical antipsychotic alone is not recommended, primarily because of the findings of a study by Spiker , in which treatment with perphenazine alone was less effective than treatment with perphenazine plus amitriptyline. However, the atypical antipsychotics may be worth reconsidering now because of the reduced risk of extrapyramidal side effects and potential antidepressant properties of some of the atypical antipsychotics .\n\n【53】This review is an update of our Cochrane review first published in 2005 . Our conclusion in 2005 was as follows: ''Treatment with an antipsychotic alone is not a good option. Starting with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, as well as starting with an antidepressant alone and adding an antipsychotic if the patient does not respond, both appear to be appropriate options for patients with psychotic depression.''\n\n【54】Since 2005, a few more studies have been conducted, leading to a different conclusion regarding treatment with an antidepressant alone or with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic.\n\n【55】Another important clinical issue is that differences in response to specific treatments may be explained in relation to non‐response to prior treatment(s). Generalising from observations across medical disciplines, it would be expected that patients who did not respond to an adequate treatment will respond less to subsequent treatment. Some data are available on this topic with regard to pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder . Two studies  showed that a greater degree of treatment resistance predicts an inferior response to ECT.\n\n【56】Objectives\n----------\n\n【57】1.  To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo.\n\n【58】2.  To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non‐response to prior treatment.\n\n【59】Methods\n-------\n\n【60】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【61】#### Types of studies\n\n【62】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the pharmacological treatment of participants with acute psychotic depression.\n\n【63】As we expected to identify very few RCTs assessing the treatment of psychotic depression as the primary focus, we decided a priori to also include RCTs assessing the treatment of major depression with or without psychotic features. Effects in the subgroup of participants with psychotic features should then be reported separately, irrespective of whether the subgroup with psychotic features was stratified before randomisation.\n\n【64】No language restrictions were applied for included studies.\n\n【65】#### Types of participants\n\n【66】Participants were of any age in any setting (both inpatients and outpatients) who had a major depressive disorder and a current episode with psychotic features (delusions and/or hallucinations appearing in the context of a full major depressive episode) according to the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM‐III)/DSM, Third Edition, Revised (DSM‐III‐R)/DSM, Fourth Edition (DSM‐IV)/DSM, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR)_  or _International Classification of Diseases (ICD)_ codes for the same.\n\n【67】We also included studies in which participants had comorbidities, as comorbidity was not a reason for exclusion.\n\n【68】As patients with a major depressive episode in the context of a bipolar disorder (bipolar depression) are at increased risk of switching to mania , we intended to include only trials that assessed participants with unipolar depression. If trials had included participants with both unipolar and bipolar depression, we decided a priori to include the trial only when results in the unipolar group were reported separately, or when the percentage of participants with bipolar depression did not exceed 20% of the total study population.\n\n【69】#### Types of interventions\n\n【70】We included any pharmacological treatment of a current (i.e. acute) episode. Treatment had to be given for at least four weeks with the intention of treating the current episode.\n\n【71】Where possible, the following pairwise comparisons were considered.\n\n【72】1.  Antidepressant versus placebo.\n\n【73】2.  Antipsychotic versus placebo.\n\n【74】3.  Antidepressant versus antidepressant.\n\n【75】4.  Antipsychotic versus antipsychotic.\n\n【76】5.  Antidepressant versus antipsychotic.\n\n【77】6.  Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo.\n\n【78】7.  Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo plus antidepressant.\n\n【79】8.  Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo plus antipsychotic.\n\n【80】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【81】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【82】1\\. Efficacy: clinical response of depression based on observer‐rated symptom reduction: reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  or the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  or any other observer depression severity rating scale, or a change score on the Clinical Global Impression‐Change  of 'much improved' or 'very much improved'.\n\n【83】2\\.

Corticosteroids, however, may be associated with adverse effects ranging from hypertension to hyperglycemia, and a more systematic assessment of the efficacy of this therapy is indicated prior to widespread adoption of this practice.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To determine whether corticosteroids are effective in preventing or treating post‐extubation stridor in critically ill infants, children, or adults.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles. The most recent searches were conducted in April 2007.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomized controlled trial comparing administration of corticosteroids by any route with placebo in infants, children, or adults receiving mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube in an intensive care unit.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Ten trials involving 2230 people were included: five in adults, two in neonates, three in children. All but one examined use of steroids for the prevention of post‐extubation stridor; the remaining one concerned treatment of existing post‐extubation stridor in children. Patients were drawn from heterogeneous medical/surgical populations. Dexamethasone given intravenously at least once prior to extubation was the most common steroid regimen utilized (uniformly in neonates and children). In neonates the two studies found heterogeneous results, but there was an overall non significant reduction in post extubation stridor (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.32). This decrease was seen only in the study on high‐risk patients treated with multiple doses of steroids around the time of extubation. In children, the two studies were clinically heterogeneous. One study included children with underlying airway abnormalities and the other excluded this group. Prophylactic corticosteroids tended to reduce reintubation and significantly reduced post‐extubation stridor in the study that included children with underlying airway abnormalities (N = 62) but not in the study that excluded these children (N = 153). In five adult studies (total N = 1873), there was a non significant trend for prophylactic corticosteroid administration to reduce the risk of re‐intubation (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.39) and post extubation stridor (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.19). These reductions were largely due to two studies that utilized repeated doses of methylprednisolone 12 to 24 hours prior to extubation. Side effects were uncommon and could not be aggregated.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not proven effective for neonates, children or adults.

After it is taken out (extubation), the airways can be swollen (inflamed). This swelling can make it hard to breathe, cause stridor (a more severe form of wheezing), and the tube may need to be replaced. Corticosteroids are anti‐inflammatory drugs that might reduce this swelling. The review of 10 trials involving 2230 people found that using corticosteroids to prevent (or treat) stridor after extubation has not been proven overall effective for babies, children, or adults. However, some trials do show benefits and this intervention does merit further study.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This damages the spleen, which may become enlarged leading to splenic sequestration crises. These crises consist of abdominal pain, rapid heart rate and other symptoms. Such an attack can be fatal without prompt treatment. All or part of the spleen (splenectomy) is often removed after a person has survived such a crisis to try and prevent another one. This surgery may leave the individual at a higher risk of infection. We looked for trials which compared surgery to blood transfusions. We found no trials to provide reliable evidence about the risks or benefits of splenectomy for people with sickle cell disease after splenic sequestration. There is a need for a trial to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes. There are no trials included in the review and we have not identified any relevant trials up to December 2012.

Therefore, the research evidence on which to base clinical decisions is limited to case series and other less robust trials.\n\n【33】We have not identified any relevant trials up to December 2012. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new trials are published.\n\n【34】### Implications for research\n\n【35】This systematic review has identified the need for a well‐designed, adequately‐powered RCT to assess the benefits and risks of splenectomy compared to transfusion programmes, as a means of improving survival and decreasing mortality from ASS in people with SCD.\n\n【36】Background\n----------\n\n【37】### Description of the condition\n\n【38】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a generic term for a group of inherited genetic disorders of haemoglobin, the oxygen‐carrying protein contained in red blood cells. Under low oxygen tension the abnormal haemoglobin polymerises, distorting the red blood cells into a sickle shape. This sickling has two effects; firstly the sickled cells block small blood vessels resulting in tissue damage; and secondly the sickled cells are easily removed from circulation, resulting in anaemia. Common complications of SCD include increased severity of infections, pain episodes, stroke, kidney failure, chest infections and lung damage (acute sickle chest syndrome). In addition, growth and development may be delayed .  \n\n【39】Sickle cell disease was originally a disease of African, Indian, and Middle Eastern heritage because the carrier state affords protection against severe malaria; but migration has now made it a global problem . The inheritance is in an autosomal recessive pattern, so individuals with SCD have inherited abnormal genes from both parents. The inheritance of the gene for sickle haemoglobin may be combined with those for other structurally abnormal haemoglobins, such as haemoglobin C, and also with abnormalities of haemoglobin production, such as beta thalassaemia.\n\n【40】Splenic sequestration occurs when red blood cells become entrapped in the spleen, which enlarges, pooling and then destroying the red blood cells. It is defined clinically as a fall of two grams per decilitre (g/dl) or more in blood haemoglobin concentration from the persons' normal levels, and an enlarging spleen . Splenic sequestration crisis can be either acute or chronic. An acute splenic sequestration (ASS) is when splenic sequestration occurs rapidly. It manifests clinically as abdominal pain and distension, pallor, weakness, breathlessness, and rapid heart rate . Chronic sequestration (hypersplenism) has a gradual onset and can follow an attack of ASS .\n\n【41】The incidence of ASS in homozygous SCD is highest in young children, ranging from 7% to 30% in children up to two years of age . After infection, ASS is the second most common cause of death in the first decade of life accounting for between 15% to 44% of deaths in this period . The first attack can occur in infants as young as five weeks , but attacks are uncommon after puberty. Most cases are seen in individuals with homozygous SS, but have also been reported in S beta thalassaemia and SC. Mortality can be reduced by the early detection of SCD by neonatal screening, followed by parental education (to detect splenic enlargement and pallor) and by early clinical intervention .\n\n【42】Acute splenic sequestration crisis is a medical emergency that requires the immediate restoration of blood volume, usually with red cell transfusions. ASS recurs in about 50% of survivors of the first attack with diminishing intervals between subsequent crises . The mortality rate of the survivors who suffer a recurrence is approximately 20% . Due to the frequency of recurrences, both long‐term blood transfusion therapy and the surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) have been used as methods to prevent further ASS and death .\n\n【43】Although transfusions have been used to reduce the frequency of attacks of ASS, they are expensive, time‐consuming, and are associated with adverse effects including development of antibodies to red blood cells (alloimmunization), iron overload, transmission of blood‐borne infections such as hepatitis and HIV, and allergic reactions .\n\n【44】### Description of the intervention\n\n【45】Splenectomy (full, partial, and embolisation) is also used to prevent ASS. The advantages of having a splenectomy include stopping blood transfusions and the absence of discomfort from mechanical pressure of the enlarged spleen . The main objection to performing a splenectomy in young children with SCD is the increased risk of infection. The risk of septicaemia after splenectomy is approximately 2% overall, 4% in children less than four years of age, and can be 30% or more in children in the first year of life . Current United Kingdom (UK) guidelines recommend that people who have had a splenectomy should receive lifelong prophylactic penicillin, and be given pneumococcal vaccine before surgery with boosters every three years after splenectomy. _Haemophilus influenzae_ ( _H. influenzae_ ) type b and meningococcal vaccines have also been recommended . There is also concern that children living in malaria endemic regions have an increased risk of malarial attacks following a splenectomy . The fear of loss of the immune protection the spleen gives to the body and of having to undergo surgery are disincentives for splenectomy. Partial splenectomies are performed as an alternative in children in order to try and retain some immune competence, which would otherwise have been lost . Other problems associated with partial or full splenectomy include: the risk of having recurrences of ASS in the remnant spleen; and anaesthetic and surgical complications, such as left lower lung collapse.\n\n【46】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【47】As there is continuing debate over the risks and benefits of splenectomy compared to repeated exchange transfusion as strategies to avoid recurrent attacks of ASS, we have reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of both full and partial splenectomy to prevent recurrence of ASS in people with SCD.\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】To determine whether a full or partial splenectomy, by whatever means, performed to prevent acute splenic sequestration improved survival and decreased morbidity in people with SCD, as compared with regular blood transfusion.\n\n【50】Methods\n-------\n\n【51】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【52】#### Types of studies\n\n【53】Randomized (RCT) or quasi‐randomized trials.

{"seq_id": "0f0a7ea7-c714-452c-9ddb-d3cb73fae98e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】In this systematic review we aim to measure the effects of occupational therapy interventions (provided directly by an occupational therapist or under the supervision of an occupational therapist) targeted at improving, restoring and maintaining independence in ADL (to include both self‐care and leisure activities) among stroke survivors residing in long‐term institutional care termed collectively as 'care homes' (care homes, residential homes, nursing homes, aged‐care facilities, long‐term care institutions, and older peoples homes). As a secondary outcome we will also evaluate occupational therapy interventions aimed at reducing complications such as depression and low mood.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】This review will evaluate occupational therapy interventions directed at reducing dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) for people with stroke residing in care homes.\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Stroke is a worldwide problem. In the UK, stroke is the third main cause of death  and the largest cause of adult disability . Every year in England alone, approximately 110,000 people have a stroke . In the USA, around 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke each year, ranking stroke the fourth biggest cause of death . In Australia, stroke is the second biggest killer after heart disease , with an estimated 60,000 new and recurrent strokes each year . Worldwide, there are approximately 15.3 million strokes occurring annually, with stroke accounting for around 10% of all deaths . Globally, there are an estimated 30 million people living with stroke, most of whom have residual disabilities . This makes stroke a leading cause of adult disability worldwide  and a major contributor to the global burden of disease .\n\n【8】The main encumbrance of stroke is survival with disability, dementia, depression, epilepsy, falls, and other such complications . Around 80% of stroke survivors have motor impairment . This may result in residual mobility problems  and loss of capability in ADL that restricts their ability to resume their previous lifestyle. Around half of those who survive a stroke are left dependent on others for help in everyday activities , which may persist for the rest of their lives. Three‐quarters of those affected by stroke are over the age of 65 . For some stroke survivors it is possible to return home from hospital with informal support from family or organised care from health and social services. However, in the UK approximately 10% to 11% of stroke survivors are admitted directly from acute care into a care home setting after their stroke . The proportion of stroke patients discharged to a care home for the first time after stroke has declined from 13% in 2006 . The percentage of patients newly admitted to care homes are similar between the three nations involved in the Royal College of Physician's (RCP’s) National Sentinel Stroke Clinical Audit, with 10% in England, 10% in Wales, and 9% in Northern Ireland . Data for Scotland is not included in the RCP National Sentinel Stroke Clinical Audit. Scotland has been collecting national data about stroke care since 2002 and has published this information in the Scottish Stroke Care Audit report since 2005 . However, the report does not contain data on the discharge destinations of stroke survivors.\n\n【9】It is estimated that around 20% to 25% of all care home residents in the USA  and UK  have had a stroke, and stroke is reported to be the second most common cause of disability after dementia in a UK nursing home population . A US study by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Boston reported that 26% of ischaemic stroke survivors from the Framingham cohort study, involving 5209 participants from the population of Massachusetts, were institutionalised in a care home with nursing care at six months after stroke . The Australian National Stroke Audit  reported that of the 3548 patients audited, 338 (11%) were discharged to a care home following their stroke. Stroke survivors who reside in care homes are more physically and cognitively impaired and therefore more dependent than those living in their own homes ( Bowman 2004 . A cross‐sectional study using a US population‐based data set of 53,829 care home residents with stroke described these stroke survivors as a clinically complex population of frail elderly persons with a high prevalence of comorbid conditions .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Occupational therapy aims to help people reach their maximum level of function and independence in all aspects of daily living . Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by enabling individuals to accomplish things that will enhance their ability to participate, or by modifying the environment to better support participation, in daily life . Occupational therapists define occupation as much more than an individual’s chosen career. Occupation refers to every activity that people engage in during everyday life. The focus of this review will be on the effectiveness of occupational therapy for increasing independence in ADL. ADL include personal care activities such as washing, dressing, grooming, toileting, and feeding and 'extended' ADL leisure activities such as gardening, crafts, reading, and other purposeful activities in which people choose to participate. This review will focus on occupational therapy interventions for ADL for stroke survivors residing in care homes.\n\n【12】For the purpose of this review, the term 'care home' will include homes with and without nursing care and will include various public and private institutions, sometimes referred to as 'residential homes', 'nursing homes', 'rest homes', 'old people's homes', or 'long‐term care institutions'. We will define a care home using the definition in two previous reviews  as a setting that provides overnight accommodation and communal living facilities for long‐term care; and provides nursing or personal care, or both, for people with illness, disability or dependence. We will include care homes from all funding models (private, charitable, not‐for‐profit and government owned).\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】The interventions provided by an occupational therapist in a care home setting may vary but the focus of the intended outcome will be to increase, restore or maintain independence in performing ADL (including self‐care tasks and recreational and leisure activities), increase comfort and safety, and prevent stroke‐related complications. Possible occupational therapy interventions were defined in a systematic review of occupational therapy for stroke patients , and may include:\n\n【15】1.  the provision of equipment and adaptations to the environment, and instruction in the use of assistive devices ;\n\n【16】2.  individual resident training of daily living skills such as washing and dressing ;\n\n【17】3.  individual resident training of sensory‐motor functions such as grasp and release ;\n\n【18】4.  individual resident training of cognitive functions such as memory and visual scanning ;\n\n【19】5.  provision of splints to achieve increased range of movement and reduce contractures in the hand ; and\n\n【20】6.  education and training of primary caregivers (care home staff) and family in areas such as correct moving and handling procedures.\n\n【21】There is evidence that occupational therapy can specifically target the consequences of stroke by aiming to improve independence in ADL and improving the ergonomics of the environment. A Cochrane systematic review and meta‐analysis  of nine trials, involving 1258 participants, of occupational therapy provision to stroke patients in the community specifically focusing on personal ADL only, showed increased performance and a reduction in the risk of poor outcomes such as death, deterioration or dependency in personal ADL. For every 100 people who received occupational therapy intervention, 11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 30) were spared a poor outcome. Although this Cochrane systematic review did not purposely exclude studies with participants who were care home residents, one‐third of the trials included in the review and meta‐analysis did exclude patients who were resident in, or were to be discharged to, a residential or nursing home . Only one of the nine trials included in the review and meta‐analysis  involved delivering an occupational therapy intervention specifically to care home residents with stroke within a care home setting.\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Three‐quarters of strokes occur in people over the age of 65  and there is a predicted increase in this age group of the population over the coming decade, inevitably leading to a rise in demand for care home placements. Residents of care homes have been reported to have complex healthcare needs, reflecting multiple long‐term conditions with significant disability and frailty . The adverse consequences of stroke may include high dependency in self‐care ability, falls, pain, pressure ulcers and emotional distress . Stroke survivors residing in care homes are likely to be amongst the most disabled, dependent and vulnerable of stroke survivors, yet few care home residents receive rehabilitation .\n\n【24】Despite evidence of the efficacy of occupational therapy in improving independence in personal ADL and preventing deterioration, it has been estimated that as few as 3% of care home residents in the UK have access to occupational therapy provision  compared with 93% in the Netherlands . The prevalence of therapy (occupational and physical) in care homes with nursing input across the world was investigated over a decade ago and reported to be 11% in the USA, 14% in Italy, 23% in Denmark, 30% in Japan, and rising to 31% in Iceland . One plausible reason for this variation in therapy provision may be due to variations in the size and facilities of care homes between the different countries. For example, the average care home in the UK has around 30 beds , compared with an average of over 160 beds in the Netherlands . The question of whether or not we are comparing similar phenomena is critical for international comparisons . If care homes in the Netherlands more closely resemble intermediate care, respite‐oriented facilities or rehabilitation wards than typical UK care homes, it would be unfair to draw such comparisons on occupational therapy provision between the two nations. In 1985 the percentage of older persons (aged over 65 years) living in care homes with nursing care was comparable between Australia (4.4%), Canada (4.2%), the Netherlands (3%), Norway (4.8%), and the USA (4.6%). However, care homes with nursing care varied in their role and function. The percentage of older persons residing in care homes without nursing care was less comparable between countries; for example 0.9% of older people in the USA reside in care homes without nursing care compared with 9% of older people in the Netherlands residing in this type of care home without nursing input .\n\n【25】It is not known whether the same benefits of occupational therapy found amongst community‐dwelling stroke survivors  would be seen in the care home population with stroke who have a high prevalence of immobility, incontinence, and confusion . Stroke survivors living in care homes (with and without nursing care) are more likely to also have comorbidities such as dementia (38% of residents), arthritis, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, deafness, depression, fractures and blindness . Overall, 75% of care home residents are classified as being severely disabled . Assistance is required with at least one self‐care task in 57% of women and 48% of men in UK care homes . In addition to disability levels, stroke survivors living in care homes differ from those able to remain in their own homes in that they have very small personal living space (as little as 10 metres <sup>2 </sup> in area) , and much of their day is likely to be spent in homogenous facilities including shared toilets and bathrooms and shared living areas such as a communal lounge and dining area . Most equipment required to complete daily activities is also likely to be shared with other residents rather than being specific to each resident’s needs. Care home residents are required to live as part of a small community usually with shared daily routines such as meal times and time‐tabled activities. In contrast, those with stroke living in their own homes are likely to have more freedom and choice over their daily routine. Clearly the care home population with stroke differs to the stroke population living in their own homes and a review is needed that examines the benefits of occupational therapy provided to this specific group.\n\n【26】A Cochrane systematic review of rehabilitation for older people in long‐term care concluded that the provision of physical rehabilitation interventions to long‐term care residents is worthwhile and safe, reducing disability with few adverse events . This was a narrative review as a meta‐analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures used in the included studies. This review examined physical rehabilitation defined as 'all interventions which primarily aim to maintain or improve physical function, rather than those relating to personal care or nursing needs'. They also excluded interventions that addressed cognitive deficits or mood disorders unless they also aimed to improve the physical state . No review has examined the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions targeted specifically at improving and maintaining independence in ADL after stroke for those residing in care homes.\n\n【27】The 'My Home Life' document  states that occupational therapy can improve older people’s everyday functioning and their quality of life  and that the consequences of a lack of occupational therapy input in care homes can lead to unnecessary dependency and high rates of immobility‐related complications . Despite evidence in support of the benefits of purposeful and meaningful activity  (a key philosophy of occupational therapy), historically the level of physical activity and positive stimulation in care home residents has been low . Recent studies report that care home residents spend as much as 63% of their day on non‐therapeutic activities, such as sitting passively doing nothing, and not interacting with others . In one pilot observational study involving residents from an 18‐bed local authority residential home in England , the residents were observed to be \"busy doing nothing\" with residents sitting (either with their eyes open or closed) for 97% of observations. It is known that inactivity and immobility is associated with further deterioration of function  and the care home population with stroke are more likely to have additional complications as compared with stroke survivors living in their own homes.\n\n【28】In the UK there is currently no requirement for care home staff to have stroke‐specific training. A recent review by the Care Quality Commission  (the independent regulator of health care and adult social care services in England) reported concerns around the levels of staff knowledge and skill in stroke care. The review reported that whilst local stroke pathways (policies setting out how care should be delivered) are in place across England, only 32% of the stroke pathways specifically cover people who have had a stroke and are residing in care homes . Similarly, the National Clinical Guideline for Stroke  include more than 300 recommendations to improve the care of people who have had a stroke in the UK, but only 16 relate to the care given to patients more than six months after stroke . There are no UK guidelines relating to the longer‐term stroke specialist rehabilitation required in order to meet the complex needs of those with stroke residing in UK care homes. Similarly, such specific guidelines are absent from the Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management . A Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association  reported a need to educate nursing and other members of the interdisciplinary team about the potential for recovery in the later or more chronic phases of stroke care. In addition, the importance of access to relevant health professionals for those living in care homes has been emphasised .\n\n【29】It could be argued that the care home population has the greatest need for ongoing therapy and rehabilitation post‐stroke because they have such high levels of dependency and comorbidities and low levels of activity, yet an inequitable level of therapy provision currently exists compared with those living at home. Commissioners, however, require evidence to support the effectiveness of longer‐term rehabilitation therapies in order to commission the provision of such stroke services and, at present, such evidence is lacking. The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence available, specifically concerning the benefits of occupational therapy interventions aimed towards increasing independence in ADL (including both personal and extended ADL) for people with stroke, residing in care homes.\n\n【30】Objectives\n----------\n\n【31】In this systematic review we aim to measure the effects of occupational therapy interventions (provided directly by an occupational therapist or under the supervision of an occupational therapist) targeted at improving, restoring and maintaining independence in ADL (to include both self‐care and leisure activities) among stroke survivors residing in long‐term institutional care termed collectively as 'care homes' (care homes, residential homes, nursing homes, aged‐care facilities, long‐term care institutions, and older peoples homes). As a secondary outcome we will also evaluate occupational therapy interventions aimed at reducing complications such as depression and low mood.\n\n【32】Methods\n-------\n\n【33】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【34】#### Types of studies\n\n【35】We will include all studies that are randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster‐RCTs, which evaluate occupational therapy interventions with the specific aim of facilitating, restoring or maintaining independent function in any ADL (or that aim to reduce complications) for stroke survivors (or that include a defined subgroup of stroke survivors) who permanently reside in a care home, with or without nursing care. We will include studies that compare interventions provided by a qualified occupational therapist, or by an occupational therapy assistant under the direction of a qualified occupational therapist, with standard care (that is, routine care that residents usually receive or no intervention). We will also include studies that compare occupational therapy interventions targeting ADL with usual care interventions, or studies which compare different types of occupational therapy interventions with each other.\n\n【36】We will exclude quasi‐randomised trials using, for example, alternate days of the week as the method of randomisation to eliminate the possibility of systematic bias affecting the outcomes . Where trials are described in a way that implies that the study was randomised, and where the demographic details of each group's participants are similar, we will include the trial and undertake sensitivity analysis in the presence or absence of these data.\n\n【37】We will include cross‐over studies, but we will only include data from the first phase of cross‐over studies in the meta analysis.\n\n【38】#### Types of participants\n\n【39】We will include studies that recruited people with a clinical diagnosis of stroke regardless of their age, sex, gender, time since stroke onset or ethnic group, and those with multiple diagnoses, as long as they permanently reside in a care home. We will exclude trials of mixed aetiology, where the percentage of participants with stroke is less than 50%.\n\n【40】We will define stroke as a focal neurological deficit caused by cerebrovascular disease (confirmation of the clinical diagnosis using imaging will not be compulsory).\n\n【41】Within the European Union different definitions of long‐term care coexist . Definitions used by the member states vary in the identification of the care recipient and in defining the services provided . In this review we will use the term 'care home' to include various public and private institutions caring for the dependent elderly such as 'residential homes', 'nursing homes', 'rest homes', 'old people's homes', and 'long‐term care institutions'. We will define a care home, using the definition from two previous Cochrane reviews , as providing:\n\n【42】*   communal living facilities for long‐term care;\n\n【43】*   overnight accommodation;\n\n【44】*   nursing or personal care;\n\n【45】*   for people with illness, disability or dependence.\n\n【46】We will include care homes from all funding models (private, charitable, not‐for‐profit and government owned).\n\n【47】#### Types of interventions\n\n【48】1.  We will include all occupational therapy and therapy‐based interventions (delivered at either an individual or group basis) provided directly by a qualified occupational therapist, or by an occupational therapy assistant under the direction of a qualified occupational therapist, that aim to increase or maintain occupational performance, independence, and increase function in ADL ('personal' ADL or 'extended' ADL, or both).\n\n【49】2.  We will define standard care as the routine care that residents usually receive whilst residing in a care home.\n\n【50】3.  We will only include any trials that include occupational therapy as part of a multidisciplinary team intervention, where the occupational therapy component of the intervention can be clearly identified and extracted from the results.\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【53】1.  Performance in ADL at the end of scheduled follow‐up. (Where both personal ADL outcomes and extended ADL outcomes are available, we will use personal ADL outcome data).\n\n【54】2.  Death or a poor outcome. We will define a poor outcome as deterioration in ability to perform ADL (a drop in ADL score).\n\n【55】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【56】1.  Performance in ADL at the end of intervention. (Where both personal ADL outcomes and extended ADL outcomes are available, we will use personal ADL outcome data).\n\n【57】2.  Global quality of life.\n\n【58】3.  Mobility.\n\n【59】4.  Mood.\n\n【60】5.  Global cognition (e.g. attention, memory, perceptual skills, problem‐solving).\n\n【61】6.  Admission to hospital or other higher dependency institution.\n\n【62】7.  Adverse events (e.g. falls, new pressure sores, new contractures).\n\n【63】8.  Satisfaction with care.\n\n【64】9.  Health economic outcomes.\n\n【65】We will aim to record the outcomes that are likely to reflect the domains targeted by occupational therapy interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the efficacy of _w_ Mel _‐_ , _w_ MelPop _‐_ , and _w_ AlbB‐carrying _Aedes_ species deployments for preventing dengue virus infection.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Dengue is a mosquito‐borne viral infectious disease which is endemic in over 100 countries . The dengue virus (DENV) is a single positive‐stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the _Flaviviridae_ family, which is spread through the bite of female _Aedes aegypti_ ( _Ae aegypti_ ) mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes polynesiensis.Aedes_ mosquitoes are vectors for several viruses as well as DENV, including yellow fever virus, chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Zika virus. The risk of infection is present in all areas inhabited by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, particularly in tropical climates.\n\n【8】A study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection, and 70% of the actual burden of disease is in Asia . Since the 1960s, there has been a 30‐fold increase in global dengue incidence . The geographic expansion of DENV infection has resulted in increased frequency and severity of the disease. While 80% of dengue infections are mild and asymptomatic, the number of reported deaths rose from 960 in 2000 to 4032 in 2015, mostly affecting younger age groups .\n\n【9】Dengue is caused by four distinct serotypes of DENV that are closely related (DENV‐1, DENV‐2, DENV‐3, and DENV‐4). Infection and recovery from a specific serotype provides lifelong immunity to that serotype; however, cross‐immunity to other serotypes is partial and temporary . One in 20 people with dengue can go on to develop severe dengue ( Alexander 2011 _)._ Those who develop severe dengue usually go through three phases: febrile, recovery, and critical. The critical phase is associated with clinically significant plasma leakage leading to shock; haemorrhage due to low platelet count and coagulopathy; and severe organ impairment such as hepatitis, encephalitis, or myocarditis . Early recognition is crucial to clinical management as it allows for the identification of people who are likely to progress to severe dengue, and the adoption of timely and appropriate interventions . Managing severe dengue effectively reduces mortality to less than 1% .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】#### Background\n\n【12】_Wolbachia_ is a genus of gram‐negative intracellular bacterial endosymbiont that is found in over 60% of all arthropod species . The bacterium is associated with phenotypic manipulations in host species, meaning it is able to modify characteristics of the host. Specifically, it can decrease vectors' fitness (ability to survive and mate) and reproductive capacities and increase their resistance to arthropod‐borne viruses. _Wolbachia_ is maternally inherited, and its potential use in vector control is based on two strategies: population suppression and population replacement. Both strategies are driven by one of the most prominent features imposed by _Wolbachia_ on their host: cytoplasmic incompatibility, a phenomenon that results in sperm and eggs being unable to form viable offspring. This may be unidirectional (only one _Wolbachia_ strain is involved during mating) or bidirectional (two different individuals carry different strains of _Wolbachia_ ). Unidirectional and bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility both drive the population suppression strategy. Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility may also drive the population replacement strategy when _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying females are present. Infected eggs can be fertilized by sperm from any male, whereas uninfected eggs can only be fertilized by sperm from uninfected males. Therefore, infected females will produce a greater number of offspring than uninfected females, and because _Wolbachia_ is only inherited maternally, the frequency of infection increases with each generation.\n\n【13】#### Potential impact on dengue transmission\n\n【14】The introduction of _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ species presents a promising vector control strategy. Studies exploring the properties of different _Wolbachia_ infections in insect hosts have identified both life‐shortening and antiviral effects of _Wolbachia_ in _Drosophila melanogaster_ . These properties of _Wolbachia_ constitute a potential vector control strategy for dengue, as well as for other vector‐borne diseases, as they may reduce the ability of vectors to carry viruses that cause vector‐borne disease in humans or reduce the fitness of the vectors themselves; in both cases, the result is a reduction in viral transmission. To explore this possibility, experimental studies have investigated transfection of vectors with strains of _Wolbachia_ through embryo microinjection and adult microinjection . In this review, we will focus on strains of _Wolbachia_ that have been demonstrated to stably transinfect vectors of DENV with a potential effect on dengue transmission; that is, strains of _Wolbachia_ that can infect _Aedes_ mosquitoes and be passed on to their progeny and cause a disadvantage in vector fitness or ability to be infected with DENV, with the potential to reduce DENV transmission in humans.\n\n【15】#### Stable transfection of _Aedes_\n\n【16】Studies have shown that the _Wolbachia_ strains _w_ MelPop, _w_ Mel, and _w_ AlbB can achieve stable transfection of _Aedes_ mosquitoes with a potential effect on dengue transmission.\n\n【17】Experimental transfection of _Ae aegypti_ with _w_ MelPop demonstrated the life‐shortening effect of _Wolbachia_ in the dengue vector, with around a 50% reduction in adult female lifespan . To explore the hypotheses that this _Wolbachia_ strain may alter vector competence for arboviruses, investigators transfected _Ae aegypti_ with _w_ MelPop and exposed them to dengue and chikungunya viruses . This demonstrated a reduced ability for arboviruses to establish infection in _w_ MelPop‐carrying _Ae aegypti,_ potentially due to competition for host cell components and upregulation of immune effector genes . Experimental investigations continued to explore the properties of _Wolbachia‐_ carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes to identify the _Wolbachia_ strain most suitable for a dengue prevention strategy. According to Walker 2011 , _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Ae aegypti_ displays reproductive phenotype cytoplasmic incompatibility with minimal apparent fitness costs and high maternal transmission, providing optimal phenotypic effects for invasion. The same study demonstrated the ability of _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ to provide protection against DENV in _Ae aegypti._ Blagrove 2013 evidenced the infection of _Aedes albopictus_ with _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ by bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, demonstrating a promising new method to prevent or reduce dengue. Other studies have shown that the _w_ AlbB strain of _Wolbachia_ can induce a viral inhibitory effect against DENV in _Ae aegypti_ and _Aedes polynesiensis_ mosquitoes . Johnson 2015 provides a detailed summary of the effects of _Wolbachia_ strains on vectors for mosquito‐borne disease. Table 1 summarizes evidence of the effect of _Wolbachia_ on dengue vectors.\n\n【18】Table 1. Evidence of stable transfection of dengue vectors with Wolbachia\n\n| **Mosquito species**  | **_Wolbachia_ strain**  |\n| --- | --- |\n| _Aedes aegypti_  | _w_ MelPop _, w_ Mel _, w_ AlbB  |\n| _Aedes albopictus_  | _w_ Mel  |\n| _Aedes polynesiensis_  | _w_ AlbB  |\n\n【20】Table adapted from Johnson 2015\n\n【21】The deployment of _Wolbachia_ carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes into dengue‐endemic areas is a potential strategy to prevent dengue transmission and infection in humans. Releases of female _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying mosquitoes would facilitate the spread of _Wolbachia_ infection throughout the wild _Aedes_ population by the mechanism of unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, and reduce the ability of the wild vector population to carry DENV and transmit the infection.\n\n【22】#### Existing evidence of _Wolbachia_ as a vector control strategy\n\n【23】Researchers have piloted vector control strategies utilising _Wolbachia_ in several global locations inhabited by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, including Singapore, Puerto Rico, Texas, California, Colombia, and Brazil .\n\n【24】In Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has released male _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes and used the population suppression strategy for dengue prevention. _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying male mosquitoes mate with uninfected female mosquitoes, resulting in unhatched eggs and a reduced mosquito population . In some towns, this has resulted in up to 98% reduction in _Ae aegypti_ populations, and sites with at least one year of releases have reported 88% fewer dengue cases than areas with no releases .\n\n【25】Experimental studies in Australia have demonstrated the effect of the population replacement strategy on _Ae aegypti_ using the _w_ Mel strain of _Wolbachia_ . The number and frequency of _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying mosquito deployments varied from one to two releases per week for a duration of between five and 23 weeks . Deployments were typically discontinued when the frequency of _Wolbachia_ in field‐caught mosquitoes exceeded 50% for a period of more than two weeks, at which point it was expected that the frequency of infection would increase self‐sustainably without further deployments. However, some studies implement a higher _Wolbachia_ infection threshold before discontinuation of _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying mosquito deployments. Across the experimental sites, short‐term releases of between five and 23 weeks with either eggs or adult mosquitoes resulted in the establishment of _Wolbachia_ in mosquito populations . An analysis of case notifications data prior to and after mosquito deployments indicated a 96% reduction in dengue incidence in _Wolbachia_ ‐treated populations . Ovitrapping data after the initial implementation of _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ deployments showed that the frequency of _Wolbachia_ infection in the _Ae aegypti_ population was above 0.96 at all release areas, meaning infection was stable in the vector population .\n\n【26】### How the intervention might work\n\n【27】Experimental transfection of _Aedes_ mosquitoes with certain _Wolbachia_ strains has demonstrated strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, shown no effect on egg viability (meaning the strain is more likely to persist in wild populations), and reduced vector competence to carry arbovirus infections . _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes can be periodically deployed into populated areas, either as adult mosquitoes or at the larval stage, where they mate with the wild population. The population replacement strategy involves releasing both male and female _Wolbachia‐_ carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes to pass _Wolbachia_ on to _Aedes_ offspring, meaning the prevalence of the _Wolbachia_ infection in the vector population continuously increases. As levels of _Wolbachia_ transfection increase, the capacity of the _Aedes_ population to transmit arboviral infections such as DENV infection decreases, and the risk of disease outbreak also decreases. Conservative modelling estimates of _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Ae aegypti_ deployments in a large human population suggest that _Wolbachia_ could lead to an immediate and long‐term reduction in dengue, nearing elimination . Currently, the World Mosquito Program facilitates dengue prevention programmes globally using the _w_ Mel _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying mosquito replacement strategy . The population suppression strategy involves releasing non‐biting male _Wolbachia‐_ carrying mosquitoes, resulting in incompatible mating with uninfected females and a reduction in the mosquito population. This is the strategy used in Singapore .\n\n【28】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【29】Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito‐borne disease with 60 million cases of infection recorded in 2019, an increase of 30 million since 1990 . Although the incidence of the disease is growing rapidly in middle‐high socio‐demographic index (SDI) regions, dengue remains most prevalent and most fatal in low‐ and middle‐income countries .\n\n【30】Vector control is an important component of dengue prevention programmes, and the WHO recommends integrated vector control strategies, including targeted residual spraying, larval control, and personal protective measures . Most approaches are expensive and need teams that understand the characteristics of the vector and people in the local area . Methods that do not rely on insecticide are becoming more important, as resistance to all four classes of insecticide has been reported in _Aedes_ arbovirus vectors in the Americas, Asia, and Africa . Effective integrated vector control is difficult to achieve in resource‐limited endemic countries. In urban centres, vector control strategies are hampered by urbanization, building design, and inadequate water supply management . The WHO encourages city planners, environmentalists, and engineers to work together in urban environmental mosquito control, but in practice this is difficult to implement . Research evidence is limited, and one systematic review found only two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of dengue vector control to reduce dengue incidence .\n\n【31】Vaccines for long‐lasting protection against all four dengue viruses are in development following the success of a live‐attenuated vaccine against closely related Japanese encephalitis virus . Dengvaxia (CYD‐TDV), developed by Sanofi‐Pasteur, was the first approved vaccine for dengue, licenced in 2015 for use in individuals aged nine to 45 years living in endemic areas, and currently approved in 20 countries . Analyses of the long‐term safety of this vaccine have demonstrated inconsistent efficacy and safety in seropositive and seronegative individuals, with a lower vaccine efficacy and increased risk of hospitalization and severe dengue in seronegative individuals . These results have led to considerable vaccine hesitancy, particularly in the Philippines, which was the first and only country to introduce Dengvaxia to their public vaccination programme: after 830,000 children had received at least one dose, Philippine policymakers suspended the vaccine . In 2017, a SAGE working group on dengue vaccines recommended that countries considering introducing a dengue vaccination programme should implement a pre‐vaccine screening strategy to determine the serostatus of individuals and ensure only seropositive individuals are included in the programme . As a result, use of vaccines for dengue is currently limited in favour of alternative dengue prevention methods.\n\n【32】Researchers are exploring the possibility of using the endosymbiotic bacteria _Wolbachia_ as an innovative dengue prevention strategy . One analysis of early observational studies on _w_ Mel‐ _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Ae aegypti_ deployments conducted in Australia demonstrated a protective efficacy of more than 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84% to 99%; 2 studies) against cases of dengue fever . One controlled interrupted time series study conducted in Indonesia also demonstrated an adjusted protective efficacy of 73% (95% CI 49% to 89%) for monthly incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever .\n\n【33】A systematic review of well‐conducted RCTs investigating _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ deployments will provide an evidence‐based summary of the efficacy of this intervention for the prevention of DENV infection.\n\n【34】Objectives\n----------\n\n【35】To assess the efficacy of _w_ Mel _‐_ , _w_ MelPop _‐_ , and _w_ AlbB‐carrying _Aedes_ species deployments for preventing dengue virus infection.\n\n【36】Methods\n-------\n\n【37】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【38】#### Types of studies\n\n【39】We will include RCTs, including cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs), as they have the best trial design for evaluating the efficacy of interventions .\n\n【40】#### Types of participants\n\n【41】Adults and children living in endemic and epidemic‐prone areas where DENV infection is prevalent.\n\n【42】#### Types of interventions\n\n【43】##### Intervention\n\n【44】_w_ Mel‐, _w_ MelPop _‐_ , and _w_ AlbB‐carrying _Aedes_ deployments plus any local existing mosquito‐control measures. Any cointerventions should be balanced across the control and intervention arms. Based on existing evidence on stable _Wolbachia_ infections in transinfected hosts, we will only include studies investigating specific combinations of _Wolbachia_ and _Aedes_ , as outlined in Table 1 .\n\n【45】##### Control\n\n【46】Any local existing mosquito‐control measures, including individual‐, household‐, and community‐level interventions. Such interventions may include, but are not limited to, education programmes, reduction in larval source habitats, insecticide spraying, Abate temephos, and bed net use.\n\n【47】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【48】We will assess the outcome measures at all time points up to longest follow‐up. We will group the time points as short‐term (up to 12 months after final deployment) and long‐term (more than 12 months after final deployment). The outcomes listed are outcomes of interest and will not be used as criteria for study inclusion.\n\n【49】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【50】###### Epidemiological outcomes\n\n【51】*   Virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) case incidence (local, imported, or both) confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) or enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\n【52】*   Prevalence of DENV infection\n\n【53】###### Entomological outcomes\n\n【54】*   Prevalence of dengue DNA in the mosquito population\n\n【55】*   Mosquito density (for population suppression strategy)\n\n【56】*   Prevalence of _Wolbachia‐_ carrying mosquitoes (for population replacement strategy)\n\n【57】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【58】###### Epidemiological outcomes\n\n【59】*   Notified DF or DHF cases (suspected or confirmed, based on self‐reporting or clinical examination)\n\n【60】###### Entomological outcomes\n\n【61】*   Spatial distribution of _Wolbachia_ ‐infected mosquitoes\n\n【62】###### Clinical outcomes\n\n【63】*   All‐cause mortality\n\n【64】*   Hospitalizations due to DF or DHF\n\n【65】*   Adverse events potentially related to _Wolbachia_ ‐carrying _Aedes_ deployments\n\n【66】###### Other outcomes (narrative description)\n\n【67】*   Community acceptability\n\n【68】*   Cost and resources", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, epidemiological studies and meta‐analyses of predictive studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of psychosocial and psychological variables. While interventions based on these variables may be effective treatment strategies, theoretically they may also be used in pregnancy and the early postpartum period to prevent postpartum depression.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】Primary: to assess the effect of diverse psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum care to reduce the risk of developing postpartum depression. Secondary: to examin the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial and psychological interventions the effectiveness of individual versus group‐based interventions the effects of intervention onset and duration, an whether interventions are more effective in women selected with specific risk factors.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register , the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), EMBASE (1980 to 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to 2004). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of acceptable quality comparing a psychosocial or psychological intervention with usual antenatal, intrapartum, or postpartum care.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Both reviewers participated in the evaluation of methodological quality and data extraction. Additional information was sought from several trial researchers. Results are presented using relative risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for continuous data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Fifteen trials, involving over 7600 women, were included. Overall, women who received a psychosocial intervention were equally likely to develop postpartum depression as those receiving standard care (relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.02). One promising intervention appears to be the provision of intensive postpartum support provided by public health nurses or midwives (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84). Identifying mothers 'at‐risk' assisted the prevention of postpartum depression (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89). Interventions with only a postnatal component appeared to be more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than interventions that also incorporated an antenatal component. While individually‐based interventions may be more effective (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) than those that are group‐based, women who received multiple‐contact intervention were just as likely to experience postpartum depression as those who received a single‐contact intervention.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Overall psychosocial interventions do not reduce the numbers of women who develop postpartum depression. However, a promising intervention is the provision of intensive, professionally‐based postpartum support.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Mother Delivered\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Telephone Follow-up\n*   Educational Psychotherapy\n*   Debriefing Therapy\n*   Interpersonal Psychotherapy\n*   Encounter Group Therapy\n*   Specific Patient Counseling Session\n*   Postnatal Depression Counseling\n*   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\n*   Home Visit\n*   Supportive Counseling\n*   Social Interaction Encouragement\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Usual Care\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Postpartum Depression\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There is also evidence supporting interventions that are initiated in the postnatal period that do not include an antenatal component. Finally, interventions targeting 'at‐risk' mothers may be more beneficial than those including a general maternal population. Many questions remain unanswered and additional research is needed.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effects of pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Weight gain and schizophrenia\n\n【7】The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as an 'abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health'. A person who has a body mass index (BMI) of over 25 is overweight and those with a BMI of over 30 are obese . Weight gain and obesity are common problems for people with schizophrenia, a problem that has been exacerbated more recently with the increased use of second generation antipsychotics, many of which are associated with the risk of weight gain and metabolic disturbance . The prevalence of obesity in people with schizophrenia has been reported to be anywhere from 1.5 to 4 times higher than the general population . For people with schizophrenia, there is a marked increase in standardised mortality ratios for both natural and unnatural causes of death and much of this increment may be attributed to the increased prevalence of coronary heart disease risk , and related obesity in this population . The significance and recognition of this prevalence and its impact on premature mortality and morbidity has led to the development of consensus statements on its management . Despite this, evidence from a systematic review suggests that the all‐cause standardised mortality ratio between persons with schizophrenia and general population has risen steadily since the 1970s .\n\n【8】#### Antipsychotic medication and weight gain in schizophrenia\n\n【9】It is difficult to identify the relative contributions of disease‐specific factors such as genetics, the side effects of medications, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical inactivity on the prevalence of obesity in schizophrenia. In the seminal meta‐analysis highlighting atypical‐antipsychotic related weight gain, every antipsychotic medication except ziprasidone and molindone were associated with some degree of weight increase after just 10 weeks of treatment . The effects were greatest with olanzapine and clozapine which increased body weight by approximately 4 to 4.5 kilograms, followed by risperidone (mean weight gain 2 kg). Notably, these data were assembled from chronic populations characterised by many years of exposure to medications and illness‐related effects. What has become clearer is that factors related to illness chronicity likely result in an underestimation of the impact of antipsychotics on weight gain, and an overestimation of differences between agents. Collectively, data involving both short‐term and long‐term evidence comparing olanzapine or risperidone in chronic patients to those experiencing a first episode, demonstrate a three to four times larger magnitude of weight gain in those early on in the illness . Furthermore, no antipsychotic medication appears to be devoid of weight gain risk in patients with little prior antipsychotic exposure. For example, one 12‐week cohort study enrolling antipsychotic‐naive youth assigned to aripiprazole, quetiapine or olanzapine, demonstrated substantial weight gain not only with olanzapine (average 8.5 kg), but also with risperidone, quetipaine as well as aripiprazole . Interestingly, data in previously medication unexposed individuals also suggests that agents classified as being metabolically neutral may exhibit a more delayed onset of weight gain, with treatments differing by pattern, and not always the final amount of weight increase . Taken together, these emerging data highlight the susceptibility, particularly of first episode patients, to antipsychotic‐related weight gain. This highlights the case for early effective strategies to decrease metabolic risk accrual which may occur early in the treatment of the illness.\n\n【10】**Mechanisms of weight gain in schizophrenia**\n\n【11】To date, there is no consensus on what pharmacological factors may be involved in this weight gain particularly regarding the newer antipsychotics. As reviewed elsewhere , a range of potential weight‐inducing mechanisms such as dopaminergic blockage; increased appetite due to the interaction of antipsychotic medication with dopamine, serotonin, and histamine neuronal receptors; increased leptin; and increases in systemic levels of various cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors could be implicated. Whether gender influences antipsychotic‐related weight gain susceptibility remains a topic of debate; while there are clinical data suggesting that women may be more susceptible to atypical antipsychotic‐associated weight gain , others have failed to demonstrate this . The weight gain story may be further complicated through genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms, which may modulate risk. In this regard, among others, dopamine, serotonin, and leptin gene polymorphisms have emerged as genetic candidates for antipsychotic‐related cardiometabolic side effects . In addition, it is important to note that obesity was commonly reported before antipsychotics were widely introduced . Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia also have a poor diet  and a physically inactive lifestyle  and these lifestyle factors will contribute to weight gain. However, pharmacological intervention strategies may still treat or minimise weight gain associated with poor lifestyle.\n\n【12】#### Health effects of obesity\n\n【13】Obesity doubles the risk of all‐cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, increases the risk of some cancers, musculoskeletal problems and loss of function, and carries negative psychological consequences . Being an obese or overweight adult is associated with increases in early mortality and large decreases in life expectancy, and these decreases are similar to those seen with smoking . The burden of obesity in schizophrenia will be at least comparable in terms of premature mortality and morbidity, and is likely to have important deleterious effects on mortality and health .\n\n【14】Growing evidence in non‐psychiatric populations also suggests that obesity can be associated with structural brain changes, brain perfusion changes and cognitive deficits , with observations supporting some similarities to those noted in schizophrenia .The clinical implications of being overweight or obese on cognitive function in addition to the deficits observed in schizophrenia, remains a relatively unexplored area of research. Preliminary evidence has linked cognitive impairment in schizophrenia to metabolic dysfunction , which might in turn might suggest that interventions to reduce obesity and cardiometabolic risk could have dual salutary benefits on cardiovascular outcomes and illness‐related functional disability.\n\n【15】Quality of life is further reduced for people with schizophrenia with a high BMI  and those gaining weight . Furthermore, Weiden et al.  reported a significant, positive association between obesity, subjective distress from weight gain and medication non‐compliance in a sample of people with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia face the combined challenges of living with the illness, and for many, additional obesity and related illnesses. This combination is a major public health problem  and carries considerable human cost. Recognition of this has led to growing concern with how best to intervene .\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】**Treatment of obesity in the general population**\n\n【18】The treatment of obesity consists of non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Guidelines state that non‐pharmacological interventions should always be used before, and then in conjunction with the latter . In terms of non‐pharmacological interventions, strategies can combine diet, exercise and psychological/behavioural components, and will be reviewed in a concurrent Cochrane review . Bariatric surgery could be considered as a treatment option for patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> or greater, and who have failed an adequate lifestyle modification programme (with or without adjunctive pharmacological therapy) .\n\n【19】Approved anti‐obesity medications can be divided into three broad categories . The first includes inhibitors of intestinal fat absorption (e.g., orlistat). The second acts to suppress appetite, increase satiety, or increase thermogenesis by modifying central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin (e.g., sibutramine). A third acts as an inhibitor of the endocannabinoid system (e.g., rimonabant). A Cochrane review  of long‐term interventions reported that compared with placebo, orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5 to 3.2 kg), sibutramine by 4.2 kg (95% CI 3.6 to 4.7 kg), and rimonabant by 4.7 kg (95% CI 4.1 to 5.3 kg). Patients on active drug therapy were significantly more likely to achieve 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds. Another meta‐analysis of anti‐obesity agents found that average weight losses compared with placebo were modest and never exceeded 4 kg for any one agent . In 2012, the FDA approved two new anti‐obesity drugs ‐ lorcaserin which is a selective agonist of 5‐hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5‐HT2C) and phentermine–topiramate controlled‐release (CR) .\n\n【20】Overall, existing evidence suggests that even effective treatments for adult obesity only produce modest weight loss (approximately 2‐5 kg) compared to no treatment or usual care. Given such modest weight loss in studies in the adult population, it might be expected that interventions may be difficult for people with schizophrenia given the range of social and cognitive difficulties associated with the illness. Another implication is that the best treatment of obesity is its prevention. However, modest weight loss is a worthwhile outcome of interventions. There is evidence that loss of body weight by as little as 5% to 10% may reduce some of the health risks associated with adult obesity . Furthermore, sustained changes in health behaviours as a result of such interventions, e.g., increased levels of physical activity, may reduce risk of mortality and morbidity independent of any weight loss . Increasing levels of physical activity are also associated with a range of mental health benefits in this population .\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】Pharmacological interventions may operate on a range of potential mechanisms such as suppressing appetite, increasing satiety, or increasing thermogenesis by modifying central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.\n\n【23】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【24】We believe there is a sufficient volume of material to split the previous Cochrane review  into separate reviews focusing on behavioural and pharmacological interventions independently. There are at least seven systematic reviews examining either behavioural interventions , pharmacological interventions , or both . This Cochrane review updates and extends these recent reviews by focusing on evidence from randomised controlled trials. We are interested in identifying and including all randomised controlled trials of pharmacological agents to reduce or prevent excess weight, regardless of aetiology, in all people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses.\n\n【25】Objectives\n----------\n\n【26】To determine the effects of pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【27】Methods\n-------\n\n【28】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【29】#### Types of studies\n\n【30】All relevant randomised controlled trials. If a trial is described as 'double blind' but implies randomisation, we will include such trials in a sensitivity analysis . If their inclusion does not result in a substantive difference, they will remain in the analyses. If their inclusion does result in important clinically significant but not necessarily statistically significant differences, we will not add the data from these lower quality studies to the results of the better trials, but will present such data within a subcategory. We will exclude quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by alternate days of the week.\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】People diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses (such as schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and delusional disorder) using any criteria. Trials will not be excluded due to age, nationality or sex of participants. Trials will be included regardless of the length of the participant's illness, stage of illness, treatment setting, current clinical state, or symptom cluster.\n\n【33】#### Types of interventions\n\n【34】Weight loss (treatment) and weight maintenance (prevention) studies evaluating adjunctive pharmacological interventions will be included in this review. To be included in the review, the primary outcome of the trial has to be weight loss or maintenance. All types of pharmacological interventions will be considered for inclusion. Typically, interventions require participants to add a single pharmacological agent in addition to their prescribed medication routine. Pharmacological agents may be currently licensed for weight loss, an off‐label therapy, withdrawn from the market, or an isolated nutritive supplement. Occasionally off‐label adjunct agents may be a second antipsychotic intended to modify the effect of the primary antipsychotic due to unique pharmacological properties (e.g. partial D <sub>2 </sub> receptor agonist in aripiprazole), which in turn, may improve weight management. In addition, some studies may combine a pharmacological intervention with a behavioural intervention (i.e. diet and/or exercise). Only those interventions that compare such a combined intervention strategy with a behavioural intervention alone will be considered in order to assess the additive effect of using a pharmacological adjunct.\n\n【35】As such, studies will be considered based on the following subcategories.\n\n【36】##### 1\\. Prevention of Weight Gain\n\n【37】1.1 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments ‐ currently licensed for use as a weight loss agent (e.g. orlistat, lorcaserin, topiramate)\n\n【38】1.2 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments ‐ off‐label therapy (e.g. fluoxetine, metformin)\n\n【39】1.2.1 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments ‐ off‐label therapy, addition of an antipsychotic (e.g. aripiprazole)\n\n【40】1.3 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments ‐ withdrawn from the market (e.g. fenfluramine, phenylpropanolamine, sibutramine)\n\n【41】1.4 Pharmacological adjunctive treatments ‐ supplements and alternative medicines (e.g. vitamin supplements, fatty acid supplements)\n\n【42】1.5 Pharmacological adjunct plus behavioural intervention versus behavioural intervention alone\n\n【43】1.6 Standard care\n\n【44】We defined this as care that a person would normally receive had they not been included in the research trial.\n\n【45】##### 2\\.

There has been concern that excessive uncontrolled use of beta‐2 agonists might have contributed to rises in asthma mortality seen in some countries. International consensus guidelines now generally recommend using short‐acting beta‐2 agonists only for relief of symptoms on an as needed basis.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of using short‐acting inhaled beta‐2 agonists regularly or only on demand in asthmatic adults and children on indices of asthma control.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Searches were carried out of the Cochrane Airways Group \"Asthma and Wheez\\* RCT\" register in 1997, 1999 and 2002.

The control group consisted of matching placebo inhaled regularly, with an inhaled bronchodilator for 'rescue use'.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were extracted and quality assessments were made by both reviewers. Parallel group and cross‐over trials were analysed separately.

In this update 15 studies were added to the 34 trials which met the entry criteria for the first version in 2000. No clinically or statistically significant differences were found in airway calibre measurements. The regular treatment groups required less rescue medication, ‐0.80 puffs/24 hours (95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐1.30) and ‐0.42 puffs/daytime (95% CI ‐0.12 to ‐0.72), and had fewer days with asthma symptoms, ‐6.7% (95% CI ‐2.7 to ‐10.7). There was no significant difference in the odds ratio for the occurrence of at least one major asthma exacerbation either in parallel group or cross over studies.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】In general, these results support current guidelines, although it has given reassuring evidence against concerns over regular use of inhaled short‐acting beta‐2 agonists.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Asthma\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Selective Beta-2-adrenoreceptor Agonists - Systemic\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Asthma Daytime Symptoms\n*   Asthma Night-time Symptoms\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Lung function test\n*   Asthma exacerbation\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Inhaled short acting beta‐2 agonists, such as salbutamol or terbutaline, are commonly used as bronchodilators to relieve these symptoms.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To evaluate the benefits and harms of denosumab, compared to placebo or other active comparators, for preventing fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture . Osteoporosis results in fractures that can lead to acute pain, loss of function, decreased quality of life (QoL), and even death . In addition, osteoporosis is associated with a substantial economic burden. The direct cost of incident osteoporotic fractures in the European Union (EU) in 2019 was € 36.3 billion . Thus, it is clear that osteoporosis can have a negative impact on both individual health status and society.\n\n【8】Osteoporosis is further classified into primary and secondary osteoporosis. Primary osteoporosis is caused by ageing and menopause, while secondary osteoporosis includes osteoporosis caused by endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperparathyroidism), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. coeliac disease), rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), other medical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease), and medications (e.g. glucocorticoids) . Among these conditions, menopause is the most common cause of osteoporosis .\n\n【9】Postmenopausal osteoporosis is caused by bone loss due to postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency. Women aged 50 years or above are at high risk of developing postmenopausal osteoporosis , and ethnicity might also play a role in the prevalence rates . The common sites of postmenopausal fractures are the proximal femur and vertebral fractures .\n\n【10】The ageing population worldwide is leading to an increase in the prevalence of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The following information and forecasts regarding population ageing and the living arrangements of the elderly were given in the World Population Ageing 2017 Report, an annual publication by the United Nations (UN) . In 2017, the global population aged 60 years or over was 962 million. The number of elderly aged 60 years or above is expected to double by 2050, reaching nearly 2.1 billion; two‐thirds of the world’s elderly currently live in low‐income or middle‐income areas, where the numbers are growing even faster than that in high‐income regions. It is expected that nearly 8 out of 10 of the world’s elderly will be living in low‐income and middle‐income regions in 2050 . Based on these data, the worldwide prevalence of postmenopausal osteoporosis is expected to increase further.\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Pharmacological agents for managing osteoporosis are classified as antiresorptive or anabolic agents. Antiresorptive agents work by suppressing osteoclastic mediated bone breakdown and bone turnover (i.e. denosumab, bisphosphonates, vitamin D, or calcium). Anabolic agents promote new bone formation by activation of osteoblasts and bone remodeling. Both types of pharmacological agents have been proven to improve bone mineral density and reduce the fractures (i.e. strontium ranelate, teriparatide) .\n\n【13】Among the numerous therapeutic agents for osteoporosis, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and denosumab have all shown notable effectiveness in the prevention of fractures . Denosumab and bisphosphonates are strongly recommended for reducing the risk of femoral and vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis . Furthermore, bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and denosumab are strongly recommended for people with a high risk of fractures . Moreover, romosozumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to sclerostin, has been developed recently and this new pharmacological agent has also attracted considerable attention .\n\n【14】Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor‐κB ligand (RANKL), a cytokine that is essential for the formation and function of osteoclasts (the cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue). In 2010, denosumab was approved for people with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Since then, the FDA has expanded the indications for denosumab . Denosumab is injected subcutaneously once every 6 months. Patient adherence to denosumab has been reported to be better than with bisphosphonates . Numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of denosumab have been conducted since then .\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Postmenopausal osteoporosis is caused by decreased secretion of oestrogen after menopause. Oestrogen directly inhibits osteoclast differentiation and maturation. Moreover, oestrogen inhibits osteoclast activity by suppressing the expression of RANKL produced by mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. Therefore, a postmenopausal reduction in oestrogen secretion induces osteoclast activation, accelerates bone resorption (the absorption into the circulatory system of cells by osteoclasts), and reduces bone density .\n\n【17】By binding to RANKL, denosumab prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. The prevention of RANKL‐RANK interaction is expected to lead to decreased bone resorption .\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】It has been more than 10 years since denosumab was approved by the FDA. Safety profile of denosumab remains unclear, and it has been noted that the use of denosumab might be associated with increased risk of short‐term harms, such as hypocalcaemia (low level of calcium in the blood), and long‐term harms due to the effects of osteoclast suppression (i.e. osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral shaft fracture, serious infections, cardiovascular events, and malignancy) . Although rare and long‐term harms might cause concerns, this review aims at assessing only the harms found in RCTs, which generally occur in short‐term cases. Although several meta‐analyses have shown that denosumab might reduce the incident fractures , these reports did not perform in‐depth analysis on adverse events associated with the treatment of denosumab.\n\n【20】The World Health Organization (WHO) considers fracture probabilities and other clinical information to be more useful than reliance on bone mineral density (BMD) alone, therefore, this review will assess the efficacy of fracture prevention in women with and without a prior history of fragility fractures . A comprehensive systematic review using robust Cochrane methodology with an aim to fully explore both benefits and harms profiles of denosumab for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis is thus warranted.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To evaluate the benefits and harms of denosumab, compared to placebo or other active comparators, for preventing fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】We will include individually randomised, parallel‐group trials, cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials that evaluated the clinical benefits and harms of denosumab compared to placebo or another active drug in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. We will include studies reported as full text, those published as abstracts only, as well as unpublished data. There will be no language restrictions imposed.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】We will include postmenopausal women of all ages. We will exclude trials in which the primary target population are those with secondary osteoporosis, such as patients with rheumatoid arthritis, those receiving hormone therapy, and those receiving glucocorticoids.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We will consider all regimens of delivering denosumab as subcutaneous injections, with dosage of 40 mg to 80 mg denosumab every 4 to 8 months. We will only analyse the arms using denosumab with the dosage of 40 mg to 80 mg every 4 to 8 months.\n\n【31】Our specific treatment comparisons are as follows:\n\n【32】*   denosumab versus placebo; and\n\n【33】*   denosumab versus bisphosphonates.\n\n【34】We will synthesise the above comparisons separately. We will include the following co‐interventions if they are applied equally in both study arms:\n\n【35】*   vitamin D;\n\n【36】*   calcium supplementation; or\n\n【37】*   teriparatide.\n\n【38】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【39】##### Major outcomes\n\n【40】1.  Incident hip fractures.\n\n【41】2.  Incident symptomatic vertebral fractures.\n\n【42】3.  Incident other (not hip or vertebral) fractures (e.g. wrist, humeral head).\n\n【43】4.  Disability as measured by osteoporosis‐specific or generic measures.\n\n【44】5.  Total number of adverse events.\n\n【45】6.  Number of study withdrawals due to adverse events.\n\n【46】7.  Number of serious adverse events.\n\n【47】##### Minor outcomes\n\n【48】1.  Radiographic (asymptomatic) vertebral fractures. Although there is no widely accepted definition or cut‐off value for radiographic vertebral fractures that are based on clinically meaningful outcomes, we will extract these data including the definitions used in individual trials.\n\n【49】2.  Pain intensity (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS)).\n\n【50】3.  Quality of life (QoL), as assessed by osteoporosis‐specific or generic measures.\n\n【51】We will conduct the main analysis based on outcomes assessed between 6 months and 1 year. Secondary analysis will be based on data greater than 1 year to 2 years, and then yearly thereafter if available.\n\n【52】For the above fracture outcomes, we will use newly developed fractures, and we will define fracture outcomes based on radiographic confirmation or other diagnostic images such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or through medical records. We will define incident fractures as the number of participants who experienced at least one incident fracture.\n\n【53】For disability as measured by osteoporosis‐specific measures of QoL, we will include data from the Osteoporosis Functional Disability Questionnaire (OFDQ) . For disability as measured by generic measures of QoL, we will include data from the Medical Outcomes Study 36‐Item Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36) physical function component  and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) .\n\n【54】For QoL as assessed by osteoporosis‐specific measures, we will include data from the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ) ; Mini‐Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini‐OQLQ) ; Japanese Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JOQOL) ;16‐item Assessment of Health‐Related Quality of Life in Osteoporosis (ECOS‐16) ; Quality of Life Questionnaire in Osteoporosis (QUALIOSTTM) ; Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) ; 41‐item QUALEFFO (QUALEFFO‐41) ; 31‐item QUALEFFO (QUALEFFO‐31) ; Osteoporosis‐Targeted Quality of Life Questionnaire (OPTQoL) ; Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire (OPAQ) ; OPAQ‐2 ; and OPAQ‐Short Version (OPAQ‐SV) . For QoL as assessed by generic measures, we will include data from the SF‐36 mental health component .\n\n【55】For the above QoL outcomes, we will evaluate QoL based on the mean change of scores from the baseline from validated QoL measurement scales. To our knowledge, there are currently no minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) defined in the literature for the QoL outcomes in the population with postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【56】For the above QoL or disability outcomes, when trials report the results for more than one QoL or disability measurement, we will create a hierarchy based on the properties of the measurement reported to determine which measurements should be extracted and synthesised .\n\n【57】For the above adverse events, we will define adverse events as the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. We will define the serious adverse events based on judgement in the primary studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies were carried out using validated checklists. Where possible analysis was carried out according to the \"intention to treat\" principles.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】21 studies were included in the review (1293 participants). Ten studies compare methadone with adrenergic agonists showing no clinical difference of the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment and degree of discomfort. Six studies compare different methadone reduction schedules, showing that different types of methadone withdrawal schedule produce different responses in terms of time course and severity of withdrawal.  \nTwo studies compare methadone with other opioid agonists, showing that methadyl acetate performed similarly to methadone on most process and outcome measures, while methadone reduced severity of withdrawal and had fewer drop‐outs than propoxyphene. One stuy compare chlordiazepoxide versus methadone, showing similar results in terms of overall effectiveness. Comparing methadone with placebo (one study) more severe withdrawal and more drop outs were found in the placebo group.  \nThe results indicate that the medications used in the included studies are similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by subjects differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. Improvements were achieved when other services such as counseling and other supporting services were offered contemporaneously with detoxification.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to duration, design and treatment objectives, impairing the application of meta‐analysis. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use.\n\n【15】----------------------\n\n【16】Tapered methadone is one of many different pharmacological treatments offered for detoxification from opioid dependence. Tapered methadone seems to be useful and causes less side effects than other medicated detoxification methods, also the rate of completion is higher. Nevertheless, the rates of relapse to opioid use following opioid withdrawal are high. In fact opioid detoxification is not in itself a treatment for dependence since it does not promote deep changes in order to prevent relapses.\n\n【17】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Given the potential for nutrient fortification to affect growth and development, this intervention may merit further assessment. Since fortifying breast milk for infants fed directly from the breast is logistically difficult (and has the potential to interfere with breast‐feeding), it would be important to determine if mothers would support a trial of this intervention. It may be that a trial should first focus on infants who are not able to consume ad libitum quantities of breast milk directly from the breast, who have poor growth or nutritional status, or who have on‐going additional metabolic requirements.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Low Birth Weight Infant\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Breast Milk\n*   Nutrient supplementation\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Breast Milk\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Body Mass Index\n*   Body Composition\n*   Cognitive Developmental Delay\n*   Growth\n*   Hearing impairment\n*   Visual Impairment\n*   Developmental Delay\n*   Skinfold Measurement\n*   Neurodevelopmental Delay\n*   Educational Problem\n*   Head Circumference\n*   Weight Gain\n*   Height and growth measurements\n*   Cerebral Palsy\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Research also indicates that both delinquent youth and youth who join gangs often show a wide range of deficient or distorted social‐cognitive processes compared to non‐delinquent peers. Cognitive‐behavioural interventions are designed to address cognitive deficits in order to reduce maladaptive or dysfunctional behaviour, and studies have documented their positive impact on a number of behavioural and psychological disorders among children and youth.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effectiveness of cognitive‐behavioural interventions for preventing youth gang involvement for children and young people (ages 7‐16).\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, ASSIA, CINAHL, CJA, Dissertations Abstracts A, EMBASE, ERIC, IBSS, LILACs, LexisNexis Butterworths, NCJR Service Abstracts Database, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts, to April 2007.

One was excluded following personal communication with investigators. One citation, of a large randomised prevention trial, awaits assessment; personal communication with study authors yielded unpublished reports addressing gang outcomes, but insufficient detail precluded determining inclusion status. Seven remaining reports were excluded as irrelevant because they were narrative reviews or descriptions of programs without evaluations, did not address a gang prevention programme, or did not address a gang prevention program that included a cognitive‐behavioural intervention.

Research also has found that both delinquent youth and youth who join gangs often show a range of negative thoughts, feelings and beliefs compared to non‐delinquent peers. Cognitive‐behavioural interventions, designed to address these deficits, have had a positive impact on a variety of behavioural and psychological disorders among children and youth. This systematic review was designed to assess the effectiveness of such cognitive‐behavioural interventions for preventing youth gang involvement. A three‐part search strategy found no randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of cognitive‐behavioural interventions for gang prevention; four excluded studies examining the impact of Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) were of too poor a quality to be included in analysis. The only possible conclusions from this review, therefore, are the urgent need for additional primary evaluations of cognitive‐behavioural interventions for gang prevention and the importance of high standards required of the research conducted to provide meaningful findings that can guide future programmes and policies.\n\n【23】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

For non‐prostate cancer outcomes, randomized trials were included if: they were at least 6 months in duration published after 1999.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】The primary outcome was prostate cancer period‐prevalence \"for‐cause.\" \"For‐cause\" was defined as prostate cancer clinically detected based on symptoms, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or detected as a result of an abnormal prostate specific antigen value. Trials were categorized as long (> 2 year), mid (1 to 2 years) and short (< 1 year) term.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Nine trials reported prostate cancer period‐prevalence. Three trials using finasteride lasted four years or longer but only one (the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial) was specifically designed to assess the impact of 5ARI on prostate cancer period‐prevalence. The mean age of enrollees was 64.6 years, 91% were white, mean PSA was 2.1 ng/mL. For‐cause prostate cancers comprised 54% of all cancers detected. Finasteride was associated with a 26% relative risk reduction in prostate cancers detected for‐cause among all randomized subjects (relative risk 0.74 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83); absolute risk reduction = 1.4% (3.5% versus 4.9%). Six trials assessed prostate cancers detected overall with a pooled 26% relative reduction favoring 5ARI (relative risk 0.74 (95% CI 0.55 to1.00); 2.9% absolute reduction (6.3% versus 9.2%). Reductions were observed regardless of age, race or family history of prostate cancer but not among men with baseline PSA > 4.0 ng/mL. A greater number of high Gleason score tumors (7 to 10 or 8 to 10) occurred in men on finasteride in the PCPT. Impaired sexual or erectile function or endocrine effects were more common with finasteride than placebo.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors reduce prostate cancer risk but may increase the risk of high‐grade disease in men who are undergoing regular screening for prostate cancer using prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination. Effects are consistent across race, family history and age and possibly 5ARI but were limited to men with baseline PSA values < 4.0 ng/mL. The impact of 5ARI on absolute or relative rates of prostate cancer in men who are not being regularly screened is not clear. Information is inadequate to assess the impact of 5ARI on mortality.\n\n【14】### Five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitor drugs, such as finasteride or dutasteride, reduce the risk prostate cancer in men who have routine prostate cancer screening\n\n【15】Five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitor drugs have potential as chemopreventive agents. Reduction of prostate cancer was similar between racial groups, age groups (aged 65 years or older compared to younger age groups) and those with or without a family history of prostate cancer. Reduction of prostate cancer was limited to men who had a baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) values less than 4.0 ng/mL. However, use of five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors may also increase the risk of high‐grade prostate cancer in men undergoing prostate cancer screening. Future research is needed to determine if the use of five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors can reduce prostate cancer in men who are not being regularly screened for prostate cancer. Future studies should also determine whether five‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors can reduce death and prostate cancer death and further evaluate the risk of developing high‐grade prostate cancer.\n\n【16】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess whether interventions designed to improve access to smoking cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness and interventions designed to help adults experiencing homelessness to quit smoking lead to increased engagement and tobacco abstinence. To also assess whether smoking cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness affect substance use and mental health.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Tobacco use is disproportionately concentrated among low‐income populations, with rates exceeding that of the general population at least two‐fold . Among low‐income populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, estimated smoking prevalence ranges between 60% and 80% . Individuals with severe mental health disorders and/or substance use disorders who belong to racial/ethnic minority groups, who are older, or who self‐identify as a gender and sexual minority are disproportionately represented in populations experiencing homelessness . The prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders is high among people experiencing homelessness. A systematic review concluded that the most common mental health disorders among this population were drug (range 5% to 54%) and alcohol dependence (range 8% to 58%), and that the prevalence of psychosis (range 3% to 42%) was as high as that of depression (range 0% to 59%) . These populations carry a high burden of tobacco use and tobacco‐related morbidity and mortality . Persons experiencing homelessness are three to five times more likely to die prematurely than those who are not homeless , and tobacco‐related chronic diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among those aged 45 and older . Among younger homeless‐experienced adults (< 45 years), the incidence of tobacco‐related chronic diseases is three times higher than the incidence in age‐matched non‐homeless adults .\n\n【7】Persons experiencing homelessness have distinctive tobacco use behaviors associated with low income, substance use comorbidities, and housing instability that affect their likelihood of successfully quitting. Epidemiological studies of tobacco use among this population have shown that most adults experiencing homelessness initiate smoking before the age of 16 . Average daily cigarette consumption is between 10 and 13 cigarettes per day, and more than one‐third smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking . People experiencing homelessness have high rates of concurrent use of alternative tobacco products such as little cigars, smokeless tobacco, and e‐cigarettes . They also engage in high‐risk smoking practices including exposure compensation when reducing cigarettes smoked per day and smoking cigarette butts . Smoking norms include sharing or \"bumming\" cigarettes, and these practices may reduce the effects of policy interventions such as increased taxes . Individuals experiencing homelessness face significant barriers to cessation, including disproportionately high rates of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can lead to positive associations with smoking . Smoking cessation is challenging for people who have to navigate the stressors of homelessness , high levels of nicotine dependence, and limited access to smoking cessation treatment and smoke‐free living environments . Integrating tobacco dependence treatment into existing services for homeless‐experienced adults remains challenging . Staff members may not support quit attempts , and homeless‐experienced adults do not have consistent access to services or information technologies used to improve access to cessation interventions .\n\n【8】Despite these challenges, over 40% of adults experiencing homelessness report making a quit attempt in the past year . A majority relapse to smoking, with estimates of the quit ratio (i.e. the ratio of former‐to‐ever smokers) between 9% and 13% compared to 50% in the general population .\n\n【9】Homeless populations have been historically neglected in population‐wide tobacco control efforts; however, there has been increasing interest in studying the correlates of tobacco use and cessation behaviors for these populations and in discovering how these individuals may differ from the general population . Typically high levels of nicotine dependence among adults experiencing homelessness are associated with low likelihood of quitting . Proximity to a shelter during the week after a quit attempt has been associated with higher risk of relapse, thought to occur because of increased exposure to environmental cues to smoking . In contrast, staying in a shelter, as opposed to on the street, has been associated with quitting smoking , possibly due to exposure to shelter‐based smoke‐free policies. Studies have shown that engaging in smoking cessation does not adversely affect substance use behaviors , and has increased the number of days abstinent from alcohol . More recent research efforts such as have focused on designing interventions to reduce smoking initiation among youth experiencing homelessness , and to improve quit rates among adults experiencing homelessness .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Interventions designed to support people to stop smoking can work to motivate people to attempt to stop smoking (\"cessation induction\"), or to support people who have already decided to stop to achieve abstinence (\"aid to cessation\"). In this review, we will include both types of interventions. Many people who are homeless face barriers to using regular services, such as healthcare services, through which cessation support is available. The availability of support to assist a quit attempt can itself create motivation to quit . Thus one possible intervention to support people experiencing homelessness is to provide bespoke cessation services that can operate both to make quitting seem more desirable and to provide treatment for those who are attempting to stop smoking.\n\n【12】The combination of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy \\[NRT\\], bupropion, or varenicline) is the gold standard for individually tailored smoking cessation treatment in the general population . However, a vast majority of quit attempts made by people experiencing homelessness are unassisted . Preference for cessation aids may vary by cigarette consumption, with light smokers (0 to 10 cigarettes per day) preferring counseling over medication, in contrast to moderate/heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes per day) .\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Cessation induction interventions directed at smokers who are not ready to quit rely on pharmacological, behavioral, or combination interventions to increase motivation and intention to quit, with an eventual goal of abstinence. Interventions may include nicotine therapy sampling to induce practice quit attempts, as described in Carpenter 2011 , or motivational interviewing to induce cessation‐related behaviors among smokers who are not motivated to quit, as examined in Catley 2016 .\n\n【15】Tobacco dependence treatment can provide motivation and support for change through pharmacotherapy , counseling , financial incentives , or a combination of these . Pharmacotherapy can reduce the urge to smoke and can decrease nicotine withdrawal symptoms via NRT, varenicline, or bupropion ; counseling can provide support and motivation to make and continue with quit attempts . For individuals with severe tobacco dependence, such as people experiencing homelessness, multi‐component interventions that include behavioral counseling, combination pharmacotherapy, and other adjunctive methods such as financial incentives ‐ as discussed in Businelle 2014b, Baggett 2017, and Rash 2018 ‐ or mobile support ‐ as offered in Carpenter 2015 ‐ may be beneficial. However, as many quit attempts are unassisted, more may need to be done to remove barriers and facilitate access to cessation support for smokers who are homeless.\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】People experiencing homelessness have unique tobacco use characteristics, including higher likelihood of irregular smoking patterns, reduced exposure to clean indoor air policies, and reliance on \"used\" cigarettes . They receive limited support for cessation from service providers . Many countries have identified homeless‐experienced adults as a high‐risk group in need of targeted interventions . Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of mortality among adults experiencing homelessness . Past efforts to promote tobacco cessation among this population have yielded mixed results that make it difficult to assess which types of tobacco dependence treatments promote abstinence. Our findings will synthesize evidence to date and will identify interventions that increase quit attempts and abstinence, as well as improve access to treatment, for this vulnerable population. We will also explore whether cessation interventions affect mental health or substance use outcomes among this population.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To assess whether interventions designed to improve access to smoking cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness and interventions designed to help adults experiencing homelessness to quit smoking lead to increased engagement and tobacco abstinence. To also assess whether smoking cessation interventions for adults experiencing homelessness affect substance use and mental health.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs, with no exclusions based on language of publication or publication status.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】Participants will include homeless and unstably housed adults (> 18 years of age). This will be defined by criteria specified by individual studies; however we envisage that participants will meet one or more of the following criteria for homelessness .\n\n【26】1.  Individuals and families who do not have a fixed, regular, and adequate night‐time residence, including individuals who live in emergency shelters for homeless individuals and families, and those who live in places not meant for human habitation.\n\n【27】2.  Individuals and families who will imminently lose their main night‐time residence.\n\n【28】3.  Unaccompanied young adults and families with children and young people who meet other definitions of homelessness.\n\n【29】4.  Individuals and families who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life‐threatening conditions that relate to violence against an individual or family member.\n\n【30】5.  Individuals and families who live in transitional shelters or housing programs.\n\n【31】6.  Individuals and families who are temporarily living with family or friends.\n\n【32】7.  Individuals and families who are living in overcrowded conditions.\n\n【33】Participants must also be tobacco users who may or may not be motivated to quit.\n\n【34】#### Types of interventions\n\n【35】We will include in our review any interventions that:\n\n【36】1.  focus on increasing motivation to quit, building capacity (e.g. providing education or training to provide cessation support to staff working with people who are homeless), or improving access to tobacco cessation services in clinical and non‐clinical settings for homeless adults;\n\n【37】2.  aim to help people making a quit attempt to achieve abstinence, including but not limited to behavioral support, tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies, contingency management, and app‐based interventions; or\n\n【38】3.  focus on transitions to long‐term nicotine use that do not involve combustible tobacco.\n\n【39】Control groups may receive no intervention or 'usual care', as defined by individual studies.\n\n【40】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【41】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【42】1.  Tobacco abstinence (given the paucity of data on long‐term cessation outcomes among people experiencing homelessness, we will also assess short‐term cessation outcomes), assessed at three time points\n\n【43】    1.  Short‐term abstinence: < three months after quit day\n\n【44】    2.  Medium‐term abstinence: ≥ three months and < six months after quit day\n\n【45】    3.  Long‐term abstinence: ≥ six months after quit day\n\n【46】We will conduct separate analyses for each time point. We will use the strictest definition of abstinence used by the study, with preference for continuous or prolonged (allowing a grace period for slips) abstinence over point prevalence abstinence. When possible, we will extract biochemically verified rates (e.g. breath carbon monoxide, urinary/saliva cotinine) over self‐report. We will assess abstinence on an intention‐to‐treat basis, using the number of people randomized as the denominator.\n\n【47】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【48】1.  Number of participants receiving treatment\n\n【49】2.  Number of people making at least one quit attempt as defined by included studies\n\n【50】3.  Abstinence from alcohol and other drugs as defined by self‐reported drug use or through biochemical validation (or both), at the longest follow‐up period reported in the study\n\n【51】4.

Interventions to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication have been evaluated in randomised trials but it is unclear which interventions are effective.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with high blood pressure\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】All‐language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in April 2002.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】RCTs of interventions to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication in adults with essential hypertension in primary care, with adherence to medication and blood pressure control as outcomes\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included 38 studies testing 58 different interventions and containing data on 15519 patients. The studies were conducted in nine countries between 1975 and 2000. The duration of follow‐up ranged from two to 60 months. Due to heterogeneity between studies in terms of interventions and the methods used to measure adherence, we did not pool the results. Simplifying dosing regimens increased adherence in seven out of nine studies, with a relative increase in adherence of 8 per cent to 19.6 per cent. Motivational strategies were successful in 10 out of 24 studies with generally small increases in adherence up to a maximum of 23 per cent. Complex interventions involving more than one technique increased adherence in eight out of 18 studies, ranging from 5 per cent to a maximum of 41 per cent. Patient education alone seemed largely unsuccessful.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy, although there is less evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising, but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed RCTs.\n\n【14】### What interventions improve adherence to treatment in patients with high blood pressure in ambulatory settings\n\n【15】High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, and drug treatment of high blood pressure can substantially reduce this risk. However, the control of high blood pressure in the community is far from optimal. One of the major reasons for this is that patients with high blood pressure often fail to take their medication as prescribed. A number of interventions have been tested that aim to help patients take their medication but it is still uncertain how effective they are.\n\n【16】This review evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to help patients with taking blood pressure lowering medication. We included studies in adult patients with a diagnosis of high blood pressure in a community setting and assessed interventions that aimed to increase adherence to blood pressure lowering medication. The outcomes assessed were adherence to medication and blood pressure changes.\n\n【17】For many interventions it is difficult to draw any real conclusions due to weaknesses of the included studies. However, reducing the number of daily doses appears to be effective in increasing adherence to blood pressure lowering medication and should be tried as a first line strategy although there is little evidence of an effect on blood pressure reduction. Some motivational strategies and complex interventions appear promising but we need more evidence on their effect through carefully designed randomised controlled trials to confirm these findings.\n\n【18】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Unfortunately, this may not always be possible, as there are numerous reasons why a newborn infant may not be able to breastfeed and, as a result, require supplemental feeding. Currently, there are a variety of ways in which newborn infants can receive supplemental feeds. Traditionally, bottles and nasogastric tubes have been used; however, more recently, cup feeding has become a popular practice in many nurseries in an attempt to improve breastfeeding rates. There is no consistency to guide the choice of supplementation.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effects of cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding on weight gain and achievement of successful breastfeeding in newborn infants who are unable to fully breastfeed.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , CINAHL (1982 ‐ April 2006) and MEDLINE (1966 ‐ April 2006).\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing cup feeding to other forms of enteral feeding for the supplementation of newborn infants.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Quality assessments and data extraction for included trials were conducted independently by the review authors. Outcomes reported from these studies were: weight gain, proportion not breastfeeding at hospital discharge, proportion not feeding at three months of age, proportion not feeding at six months of age, proportion not fully feeding at hospital discharge, proportion not fully breastfeeding at three months of age, proportion not fully breastfeeding at six months of age, average time per feed (minutes), length of stay and physiological events of instability such as bradycardia, apnea, and low oxygen saturation. For continuous variables such as weight gain, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were reported. For categorical outcomes such as mortality, the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were reported.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Four studies were eligible for inclusion. The experimental intervention was cup feeding and the control intervention was bottle feeding in all four studies included in this review. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of not breastfeeding at hospital discharge in three included studies (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62, 1.09) and not breastfeeding at three months in two included studies (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76, 1.03) or six months for the one study that reported this outcome (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78, 1.05). There was a statistically significant difference in not fully breastfeeding at hospital discharge (from three included studies) in favour of cup feeding (typical RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61, 0.92). However, this was not statistically significant at three months (one study, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.88, 1.58) or six months (one study, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.89, 1.92). There was no statistically significant difference in weight gain from one study that reported this outcome (MD ‐0.60, 95% CI ‐3.21, 2.01). In the one study that assessed it, there was a significantly increased length of hospital stay in the cup fed infants \\[mean difference between groups was 10.1 days (95% CI 3.9, 16.3)\\]. Time to full breastfeeding was not assessed in any study.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Cup feeding cannot be recommended over bottle feeding as a supplement to breastfeeding because it confers no significant benefit in maintaining breastfeeding beyond hospital discharge and carries the unacceptable consequence of a longer stay in hospital.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Term infant (37-41 weeks)\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Breastfeeding Problem In The Newborn\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Infant Formula\n*   Enteral Feeding\n*   Infant Drinking/feeding Cup\n*   Giving Expressed Breast Milk\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Infant Formula\n*   Enteral Feeding\n*   Giving Expressed Breast Milk\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Hospitalization\n*   Breastfeeding Problem In The Newborn\n*   Weight Gain\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

We wanted to identify the best way of offering feeds to babies when mothers are unable to breastfeed, or initially have difficulty with breastfeeding. Alternative feeding methods include using a cup, bottle or feeding tube. Four included studies compared cup and bottle feeding: the results of three of these studies demonstrate that infants who were cup fed were more likely to be exclusively breastfed at hospital discharge. However, at three and six months, there was no difference in the number of infants fully or partially breastfeeding, whether initially fed by cup, bottle or feeding tube. The results of one study demonstrated that those infants feed by cup spent approximately ten days longer in hospital. Therefore, based on available evidence, we cannot recommend cup feeding.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy on adults with hypertension‐induced left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Hypertension is one of the most important contributors to heart disease and stroke, which together are one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality . Estimates of the overall prevalence of hypertension in adults are greatly influenced by the cutpoint established to categorize it, varying from 30% to 46% . Hypertension is commonly defined as values greater than or equal to 140 mmHg systolic blood pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure, or both .\n\n【7】An increase of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure is associated with a two‐fold difference in the mortality rate for stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and other vascular causes . One of the clinical effects of hypertension is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) , which describes the changes in the heart ventricular myocardium in response to increased demand for energy. These changes are called cardiac remodeling which, in addition to achieving greater functionality, can also lead to clinical cardiopathy . When left untreated, LVH evolves over time as a chronic condition, which can result in a clinically relevant heart failure in the medium‐ or long‐term. LVH can be diagnosed by electrocardiography criteria , echocardiography criteria , or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging criteria .\n\n【8】LVH prevalence in people with hypertension varies between 36% according to more restrictive diagnostic criteria and 41% according to less conservative ones . Factors influencing left ventricular geometry in people with hypertension include among others: a) severity, duration and rapidity of onset of the increased pressure load; b) the volume load; c) age, ethnicity and sex; d) comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and valvular heart disease; and e) genetic factors . Black people with hypertension are more likely than whites with hypertension to develop concentric LVH . Women with hypertension are more likely than men with hypertension to develop concentric LVH .\n\n【9】LVH is considered to be the most potent predictor of morbidity and overall mortality in the hypertensive population, and an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, sudden death, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke . Severity of the LVH is in turn associated to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease . Mortality of individuals with LVH is three to four times higher than of those without LVH .\n\n【10】Prevention or regression of left ventricular geometric changes with blood pressure control is an effective way of decreasing future adverse cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension . Indeed, current guidelines recommend treating hypertensive patients with LVH with antihypertensives . In this regard, a stricter blood presure control is advocated in people at higher risk, such as those with LVH . Pharmacotherapy should be selected on an individual basis, taking into account that people with certain associated pathologies will benefit more from particular classes of drugs.\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】A large number of drugs are currently available for lowering blood pressure .\n\n【13】*   Antihypertensives (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical (ATC) classification code: C02).\n\n【14】*   Diuretics (ATC code: C03).\n\n【15】*   Beta‐blocking agents (ATC code: C07).\n\n【16】*   Calcium channel blockers (ATC code: C08).\n\n【17】*   Agents acting on the Renin‐Angiotensin system (ATC code: C09).\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Cardiac adaptation in response to pressure overload in conditions such as hypertension, usually turns into an increase in left ventricular mass influenced by various physiological and pathological stimuli , triggering in the myocyte an increase in force‐generating units (sarcomeres). The implication is that mechanical input transduces into biochemical events that modify gene transcription in the nucleus. The parallel addition of sarcomeres causes an increase in myocyte width, which in turn increases wall thickness; thus an increase in pressure can be offset .\n\n【20】Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is only one of many structural alterations in hypertensive heart disease. Fibroblasts undergo hyperplasia and conversion to myofibroblasts, along with hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Noncellular elements related to myocardial remodeling include expansion of interstitial and perivascular collagen that make up the extracellular matrix. Changes in intramyocardial capillary density and arteriolar thickening compound ischaemia in the hearts of people with hypertension. These remodeling events are orchestrated via effects of biomechanical stress on the extracellular matrix that, in turn, signals stretch‐activated ion channels leading to intracellular transmission of signals to the nucleus, upregulating hypertrophic gene expression. Similar transduction occurs from cytokine signalling via intracellular calcium handling to myocardial transformation. In the short‐term, increasing wall thickness in proportion to increased pressure helps to normalize myocardial stress. However, long‐term outcomes clearly worsen with progressive hypertrophy, with increasing left ventricular mass index translating to commensurate increases in adverse cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality .\n\n【21】Regression of left ventricular mass is based on a reduction of wall thickness by all of the antihypertensive drug classes . LVH regression may be due to a decrease in both the myocyte volume and the fibrosis in the interstitium by afterload reduction as the main mechanism . Different drug classes may have different effects on the magnitude of left ventricular mass reduction . If the findings of this Cochrane Review suggest differences between different drug classes, we will discuss the possible explanation for the differences.\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Reviews comparing different antihypertensive drug classess in LVH regression are inconsistent and they do not analyse the repercusion on cardiovascular events or mortality . A systematic review and meta‐analysis published in 2010 obtained that regression of echocardiographic LVH in hypertension was associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events . However, since then management of LVH has changed and to date, no systematic review assessing the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy in hypertension‐induced LVH has been undertaken using Cochrane methodology.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy on adults with hypertension‐induced left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】Randomized controlled trials with at least 12 months' follow‐up that analyse at least one primary outcome (all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular events, or total serious adverse events)\n\n【30】#### Types of participants\n\n【31】Adults (18 years of age or older) with high blood pressure with LVH caused by hypertension.\n\n【32】In the case of clinical trials that include patients in whom the cause of the LVH is not specified and with coexisting pathologies other than hypertension that can lead to LVH (e.g. aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular septal defect, or infiltrative cardiac processes such as Fabry disease and Danon disease), we will select and include subgroups of patients with both LVH and hypertension without other alternative causes of LVH.\n\n【33】We will identify these specific subgroups of patients through individual patient data of the studies. If we cannot obtain individual patient data, we will include the studies if greater than or equal to 80% of the participants have LVH and hypertension without other possible causes of LVH. In the case of studies that do not explicitly provide data regarding the cause of the LVH or when this can not be inferred from the participants´ baseline characteristics, we will include these studies. We will perform a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies with no specific information regarding the cause of the LVH.\n\n【34】#### Types of interventions\n\n【35】##### Intervention\n\n【36】Antihypertensive pharmacological therapy (monotherapy or in combination):\n\n【37】*   Antihipertensives.\n\n【38】*   Diuretics.\n\n【39】*   Beta‐blocking agents.\n\n【40】*   Calcium channel blockers.\n\n【41】*   Agents acting on Renin‐Angiotensin system.\n\n【42】##### Control\n\n【43】Placebo or no treatment.\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【46】*   All‐cause mortality.\n\n【47】*   Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction (fatal or non‐fatal), stroke (fatal or non‐fatal), or atrial fibrillation).\n\n【48】*   Total serious adverse events.

It has been suggested that low glycaemic index (GI) or low glycaemic load (GL) diets may stimulate greater weight loss than higher GI/GL diets or other weight reduction diets. The previous version of this review, published in 2007, found mainly short‐term intervention studies. Since then, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with longer‐term follow‐up have become available, warranting an update of this review.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets on weight loss in people with overweight or obesity.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, one other database, and two clinical trials registers from their inception to 25 May 2022. We did not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included RCTs with a minimum duration of eight weeks comparing low GI/GL diets to higher GI/GL diets or any other diets in people with overweight or obesity.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We used standard Cochrane methods. We conducted two main comparisons: low GI/GL diets versus higher GI/GL diets and low GI/GL diets versus any other diet. Our main outcomes included change in body weight and body mass index, adverse events, health‐related quality of life, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】In this updated review, we included 10 studies (1210 participants); nine were newly‐identified studies. We included only one study from the previous version of this review, following a revision of inclusion criteria. We listed five studies as 'awaiting classification' and one study as 'ongoing'. Of the 10 included studies, seven compared low GI/GL diets (233 participants) with higher GI/GL diets (222 participants) and three studies compared low GI/GL diets (379 participants) with any other diet (376 participants). One study included children (50 participants); one study included adults aged over 65 years (24 participants); the remaining studies included adults (1136 participants). The duration of the interventions varied from eight weeks to 18 months. All trials had an unclear or high risk of bias across several domains.\n\n【12】**Low GI/GL diets versus higher GI/GL diets**\n\n【13】Low GI/GL diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight compared to higher GI/GL diets (mean difference (MD) ‐0.82 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.92 to 0.28; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 52%; 7 studies, 403 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Evidence from four studies reporting change in body mass index (BMI) indicated low GI/GL diets may result in little to no difference in change in BMI compared to higher GI/GL diets (MD ‐0.45 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> , 95% CI ‐1.02 to 0.12; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 22%; 186 participants; low‐certainty evidence)at the end of the study periods. One study assessing participants' mood indicated that low GI/GL diets may improve mood compared to higher GI/GL diets, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐3.5, 95% CI ‐9.33 to 2.33; 42 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Two studies assessing adverse events did not report any adverse events; we judged this outcome to have very low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on all‐cause mortality.\n\n【14】For the secondary outcomes, low GI/GL diets may result in little to no difference in fat mass compared to higher GI/GL diets (MD ‐0.86 kg, 95% CI ‐1.52 to ‐0.20; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 6%; 6 studies, 295 participants; low certainty‐evidence). Similarly, low GI/GL diets may result in little to no difference in fasting blood glucose level compared to higher GI/GL diets (MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.21; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; 6 studies, 344 participants; low‐certainty evidence).\n\n【15】**Low GI/GL diets versus any other diet**\n\n【16】Low GI/GL diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight compared to other diets (MD ‐1.24 kg, 95% CI ‐2.82 to 0.34; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 70%; 3 studies, 723 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that low GI/GL diets probably result in little to no difference in change in BMI compared to other diets (MD ‐0.30 kg in favour of low GI/GL diets, 95% CI ‐0.59 to ‐0.01; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; 2 studies, 650 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Two adverse events were reported in one study: one was not related to the intervention, and the other, an eating disorder, may have been related to the intervention. Another study reported 11 adverse events, including hypoglycaemia following an oral glucose tolerance test. The same study reported seven serious adverse events, including kidney stones and diverticulitis. We judged this outcome to have low‐certainty evidence. No studies reported on health‐related quality of life or all‐cause mortality.\n\n【17】For the secondary outcomes, none of the studies reported on fat mass. Low GI/GL diets probably do not reduce fasting blood glucose level compared to other diets (MD 0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.12; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; 3 studies, 732 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】The current evidence indicates there may be little to no difference for all main outcomes between low GI/GL diets versus higher GI/GL diets or any other diet. There is insufficient information to draw firm conclusions about the effect of low GI/GL diets on people with overweight or obesity. Most studies had a small sample size, with only a few participants in each comparison group. We rated the certainty of the evidence as moderate to very low. More well‐designed and adequately‐powered studies are needed. They should follow a standardised intervention protocol, adopt objective outcome measurement since blinding may be difficult to achieve, and make efforts to minimise loss to follow‐up.

This may cause the body to produce less insulin, which could lead to weight loss.\n\n【35】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【36】We wanted to evaluate the effects of following these diets in people with overweight or obesity. We checked the effects on weight, quality of life, side effects, and death.\n\n【37】**What did we do?**  \nWe looked for studies that compared the effects of these diets in adults with overweight or obesity with other diets, including high glycaemic index or high glycaemic load diets (diets that would produce a higher peak in blood sugar). The studies had to have a follow‐up of at least 8 weeks.\n\n【38】**What did we find?**\n\n【39】We included 10 studies with 1210 people (4.1% of participants were children and 1.9% were adults over 65 years old). Half of the studies were carried out in the USA, and there was one study each in Australia, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, and Spain.\n\n【40】**Main results**\n\n【41】_Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets compared to higher glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets_\n\n【42】Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight. Results indicated that a low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diet may improve mood, but the actual effect is likely substantially different from the estimate of the effect. None of the participants experienced unwanted or harmful effects. None of the studies reported on deaths.\n\n【43】_Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets compared to any other diets_\n\n【44】Low glycaemic index or glycaemic load diets likely result in little to no difference in body weight change compared to other diets. Participants in the studies reported experiencing unwanted effects, including eating disorders, kidney stones, and diverticulitis (infection or inflammation of pouches that can form in your intestines; the pouches are called diverticula). These effects may or may not have been caused by the intervention. None of the studies for this comparison reported on participants' quality of life or deaths.\n\n【45】**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n【46】We were most certain about the findings related to weight, but there were greater uncertainties for other results. Not all studies reported what happened regarding participants' quality of life and deaths, and most of the studies were very small. Also, participants in many studies knew which diets they received, which might have influenced how they lived during the study and how the study outcomes were measured.\n\n【47】**How up to date is this review?**\n\n【48】The evidence is up to date to May 2022.\n\n【49】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There is also a substantial reduction in the risk recurrence of further fits (seven trials 1441 women; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.57). There were few differences in any other measures of outcome, except for fewer Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (two trials 597 babies; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94) and fewer babies with a length of stay in special care baby unit more than seven days (three trials 631 babies; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95) associated with magnesium sulphate.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Magnesium sulphate appears to be substantially more effective than diazepam for treatment of eclampsia.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Eclampsia\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Magnesium Sulfate\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Diazepam\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Stroke\n*   Premature Delivery\n*   Stillbirth\n*   Death\n*   Seizure\n*   Neonatal Death\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

A few of these women have fits or convulsions (eclampsia), either in pregnancy or shortly after birth. Some of these women die, particularly those in income‐poor countries. The review of trials found that magnesium sulphate was more effective than diazepam in reducing death and other problems for women.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The main aim of this review will be to assess the effects of changing practitioner empathy or patient expectations for all conditions. The main objective is to conduct a systematic review of randomised trials where the intervention involves manipulating either (a) practitioner empathy or (b) patient expectations, or (c) both.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Communication between patients and practitioners lies at the heart of medicine, being a component of every step in healthcare provision from initial diagnosis to follow up care. Unfortunately the administrative load of general practitioners (family practitioners) and other healthcare professionals can present a barrier to effective practitioner‐patient communication. Some general practitioners claim that 25% of their time is spent filling out forms , while many healthcare practitioners report a need to improve their training in communication skills . The potential for communication interventions to improve outcomes and reduce harms is also reflected in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, United Kingdom) recommendations to use psychological interventions for people with long‐term conditions , and in the recent General Medical Council (GMC, United Kingdom) emphasis on the power and value of good communication  as well as National Institutes of Health (NIH, United States) calls for improved communication and compassion . Although medical student empathy seems to decline throughout medical school , communication skills can be taught and improved .\n\n【6】Two aspects of patient‐practitioner communication whose effects on patient outcomes are strongly supported by evidence, both from epidemiological and basic science studies, are practitioner empathy and the communication of expectations to patients .\n\n【7】Specifically, patient expectancies about the response of a treatment have been theorised to directly impact patients’ health outcomes . Response expectancies are future‐oriented cognitions about the occurrence of emotions such as anxiety or depression as well as symptoms such as pain . For example the patients might be told that a treatment is effective and expect a positive response . Positive response expectancies are believed to improve outcomes, and negative response expectancies are believed to make outcomes worse . Negative outcomes due to negative response expectancies are commonly referred to as 'nocebo' effects . Positive (or negative) expectancies could also be induced without a treatment, for example after a healthcare practitioner informs them about a positive (or negative) prognosis.\n\n【8】Empathy has been conceptualised in diverse ways including as a behaviour, a personality trait, an affect and a cognition . In this review we will take a broader perspective that acknowledges clinical empathy as complex and multidimensional . The broader definition of empathy is guided by Mercer 2002 , and views empathy as an ability to\n\n【9】1.  understand the patient’s situation, perspective and feelings (and their attached meanings);\n\n【10】2.  communicate that understanding and check its accuracy; and\n\n【11】3.  act on that understanding with the patient in a helpful (therapeutic) way.\n\n【12】However, as Mercer 2002 argues, any single definition of clinical empathy is unlikely to incorporate all aspects of empathy relevant to all possible clinical encounters. Therefore studies will be included in this review if they attempt to alter any aspect of clinical empathy as defined above. This approach is similar to that of related empirical studies of empathy effects , which take empathy to mean generally engaging, sympathetic, attentive, warm, friendly, and supportive verbal and nonverbal communication.\n\n【13】Practitioner empathy and patient expectations are distinct, yet discussions with our patient representative lead us to suspect they are closely related. Patient representatives we have met pointed out that a non‐empathetic practitioner attempting to induce positive expectations could make a patient feel as if they should feel better but at the same time make the patient feel alienated and not well cared for. Similarly, unrealistically positive expectations might not benefit patients, since evidence suggests that patients desire honesty, even about bad news . Patients also desire hope  so it may be important for empathy to be accompanied by somewhat positive messages. It follows from the likely connection between empathy and expectations that it is useful to study these two aspects of the patient/practitioner relationship in the context of the same review.\n\n【14】### Description of the condition\n\n【15】We will examine the potential effects of modifying empathy and expectations in consultations with people regardless of their clinical condition(s). Investigating all clinical conditions is important because the mechanisms of action for empathy and expectations suggest they affect multiple conditions simultaneously . For example, empathy and positive expectations are suspected to reduce anxiety and stress  which in turn could reduce pain, depression, and various other conditions . Improving practitioner empathy and inducing positive patient expectations can also affect overall wellbeing . In fact, some of the studies we identified tested the combined effects of altering both empathy and expectations . In addition, patient satisfaction surveys (in patients with a variety of conditions) consistently show that patients consider 'emotional support, empathy, and respect' to be among the most important aspects of care, and at the same time note room for improvement in this area regardless of the condition .\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】We will consider two related but distinct patient/practitioner communication interventions in this review:\n\n【18】1.  interventions aimed at changing practitioner empathy; and\n\n【19】2.  interventions aimed at changing patient expectations.\n\n【20】We will also consider interventions aimed at changing both practitioner empathy and patient expectations together.\n\n【21】We will only include studies in which the communication between patients and practitioners occurs face‐to‐face. We will include simple and more complex interventions. A simple intervention might be one in which doctors are asked to vary a simple sentence. For example, a doctor might say that a treatment will certainly be very effective, compared with saying that the treatment might or might not work . More complex interventions involve more extensive training programs such as three 60 minute empathy and relational skills training sessions , or a semi‐structured interview with a patient designed to empathetically induce positive expectations . The more complex interventions sometimes involve comprehensive training and education about the neurobiological basis of empathy and expectations, aim to increase awareness of patients' emotions, improve understanding about the effects of various emotions, and teach specific skills to enhance empathy . We have listed several examples of the types of interventions on which this review will focus in Table 1 and Table 2 .\n\n【22】Table 1. Examples of interventions to change provider empathy\n\n| **Study**  | **Intervention**  | **Main outcomes**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sjölin 1994  | Empathetic, reflective feedback to patient  | Pain during mammography  |\n| Vangronsveld 2012  | Empathetic care (validation)  | Back pain  |\n| Smith 1995  | Intensive empathy training  | Patient satisfaction  |\n| Riess 2012  | Empathy training  | Patient ratings of physician empathy  |\n| Little 2015  | Non‐verbal empathy training  | Patient satisfaction  |\n\n【24】Table 2.

Interventions that are compared with neutral or negative controls will be considered effective if they demonstrate superiority to the control, whereas interventions compared with other interventions need only demonstrate non‐inferiority. This is because the active treatment itself has generally demonstrated additional benefits over and above a sham or no treatment control .\n\n【27】### How the intervention might work\n\n【28】The mechanisms explaining how interventions for enhancing practitioner empathy and changing patient expectations may operate are complex.\n\n【29】#### Mechanisms explaining how positive expectations may improve healthcare outcomes\n\n【30】Inducing positive expectations has been shown in some studies to activate the brain's reward mechanisms (increased dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens), as well as activate the endogenous opioid system to treat pain . The effects of influencing patients’ expectations on physiological outcomes has been most extensively documented in the field of pain research where an expectation of pain relief has been found to activate neurological systems involved in regulating pain . Conversely, negative expectations have been shown to adversely affect health, most notably by increasing pain . In addition to conscious expectancy, expectation effects can be induced by classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is the body's subconscious reaction to a stimulus such as a visit to a healthcare practitioner whether or not the patient consciously expects a positive outcome. Numerous studies in animals and humans have demonstrated ways in which the immune system can be conditioned . In one study subjects repeatedly consumed a flavoured coloured drink containing an immunosuppressant for three days. Then after five days off they were given the same flavoured drink, but with a placebo instead of the immunosuppressant. Because they had been conditioned to associate immunosuppressant with the flavoured drink, the placebo had a similar immunosuppressive effect to the actual drug when compared with control subjects . Hence if patients' immune systems are repeatedly activated after visiting their practitioner, their subconscious conditioning could lead to positive effects following any clinical encounter. This could partly explain the outcomes in the studies of changing patient expectations. Some evidence suggests that positive expectations might reduce stress and anxiety , which in turn appears to reduce pain, anxiety, depression, and a variety of other conditions . While some anxiety or stress is necessary to enhance performance and focus, about half of American working adults claim to be concerned that they have too much stress . Under stress, or the 'fight or flight' response , the body produces hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol , which, in turn, have numerous downstream affects on the body's immune system , pain , fatigue levels , neurodegenerative disorders , cardiovascular disease , wound healing , mental health , mortality , and a variety of other disorders . Evidence from the basic sciences , as well as clinical trials indicates that physician empathy  and positive expectations  could reduce stress and anxiety, and thus are likely to help treat numerous stress‐related conditions.\n\n【31】#### Mechanism of action of modifying practitioner empathy\n\n【32】Jani 2012 proposes that patients are more likely to provide accurate and sufficient information about their symptoms and concerns to empathetic practitioners. This, in turn, may allow the practitioner to make more accurate diagnoses and provide more appropriate treatment. An empathetic practitioner could also be better able to personalise and perhaps individualise care. Studies suggest that empathetic practitioners can reduce stress  and thus possibly mitigate the negative health effects of stress .\n\n【33】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【34】The growing body of systematic review evidence showing that enhanced practitioner empathy and positive patient expectations can enhance treatment for a range of clinical conditions includes:\n\n【35】*   Crow 1999 found that enhancing positive patient expectations improved symptoms.\n\n【36】*   Di Blasi 2001 reported that 'context factors' (including practitioner empathy and patient expectations) enhanced patient care.\n\n【37】*   Griffin 2004 and Kelley 2014 showed that empathy training for doctors improved healthcare outcomes.\n\n【38】*   Derksen 2013 and Kelm 2014 found that empathy training for doctors within general practice (family medicine) and medical students could improve outcomes.\n\n【39】All of these studies included a variety of methods for changing practitioner expectations and patient expectations. None restricted their analysis to a specific condition, and all showed benefits across a range of conditions. The most recent systematic review investigated the effects of all context factors (including, but not limited to, practitioner empathy and positive patient expectations) for treating pain . The authors of the review concluded that context factors were beneficial for enhancing the care of pain. However, existing reviews have limitations. Some included non‐randomised trials , making their results potentially more prone to bias than those of RCTs . Others lacked focus on specific aspects of patient‐practitioner communication , or focused on specific ailments such as pain . Most importantly, the only review that studied the effects of both empathy and expectations within the same review is out of date , being almost 15 years old. Our preliminary searches have identified several randomised trials of changing empathy and expectations published since the 2001 systematic review , meaning that a substantial recent evidence base exists in addition to what has been reviewed previously. The World Medical Association (WMA) notes that chronic diseases, many of which are accompanied by pain, anxiety, and depression, are the leading cause of death in developed and developing countries . These problems become more acute if we consider that the population of the world is ageing, with 14% of the US and 17% of the UK population being over 65 (and this proportion is increasing) . Chronic pain, depression, and anxiety are very common in this multi‐morbid population, almost 50% of the patients with three long‐term conditions suffer from anxiety or depression while over 80% suffer from pain . As a result there is a high demand for interventions to improve outcomes in these and other populations experiencing depression, anxiety and pain. This review is also important for reducing potential harms. Lack of focus on practitioner communication skills seems to cause practitioners to frequently fail to respond positively to subtle patient clues about their emotional state  and commonly misdiagnose anxiety and depression . Moreover, poor practitioner communication creates barriers to the potentially positive effects of the therapeutic relationship  and increases the likelihood of litigation . Based on this evidence it seems possible that for some mild conditions (such as mild to moderate pain, anxiety, or depression) empathy and positive expectations could either be used as a stand‐alone treatment or to enhance the benefits of other drug and non‐drug treatments, sometimes even allowing practitioners to reduce treatment doses, or improving quality of life. Studies also show that improving practitioner empathy can increase patient satisfaction .\n\n【40】However, not all of the evidence is positive. In some more recent, higher quality randomised trials positive expectations were not shown to produce any benefit. For example Dutt‐Gupta 2007 , and Petersen 2014 studied the effects of modifying empathy and expectations on the experience of pain. In these studies practitioners were randomised to either provide a positive suggestion (such as \"this needle won't hurt\") or a neutral control (where no positive or negative suggestions were provided). These studies failed to show statistically significant reductions in patient pain after healthcare practitioners gave patients positive suggestions. There is also insufficient evidence to be able to conclude whether modifying practitioner empathy or patient expectations affect some conditions more than others. Hence while a growing body of evidence suggests that changing expectations and empathy are beneficial for numerous conditions, many uncertainties remain and a definitive review is required of the evidence in this area.\n\n【41】This review is related but different from several other recent Cochrane reviews.\n\n【42】*   Dwamena 2012 investigated randomised trials of patient‐centred care. Their key criterion for including studies within their review was shared decision making about treatment decisions. While shared decision‐making may be an effective way of optimising patient expectations and improving patient perceptions of practitioner empathy, it is not the only way to increase empathy. Moreover for the group of patients who do not want to engage in a shared decision, the adoption of shared decision‐making might not be an empathetic option. Some patients may prefer that a professional healthcare practitioner provide clear guidance. In these cases shared decision‐making could reduce empathy because it disregards these patients' desires.\n\n【43】*   Hróbjartsson 2010 investigated randomised trials comparing outcomes in placebo groups with outcomes in untreated groups. While it is likely that improvement in placebo groups is at least partly caused by enhanced practitioner empathy and patient expectations, placebo groups also receive a sham intervention. Our review does not require that a sham intervention be given as part of the treatment, and indeed many of the studies our preliminary analysis has identified do not involve a sham intervention.\n\n【44】*   Akl 2011 investigated the effects of positive versus negative framing of messages about prognosis (for example \"the chance of survival with cancer is 2/3\" versus \"the chance of mortality with cancer is 1/3\"). While positive framing is one way of enhancing expectations, it is not the only way, and indeed the Akl 2011 review did not include any of the studies we identified in our preliminary analysis. There are also large differences between positive framing and empathy.\n\n【45】Objectives\n----------\n\n【46】The main aim of this review will be to assess the effects of changing practitioner empathy or patient expectations for all conditions. The main objective is to conduct a systematic review of randomised trials where the intervention involves manipulating either (a) practitioner empathy or (b) patient expectations, or (c) both.\n\n【47】Methods\n-------\n\n【48】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【49】#### Types of studies\n\n【50】We will include randomised trials (including cluster randomised trials) only.\n\n【51】#### Types of participants\n\n【52】We will include studies including participants who were aged 12 years or older, and were involved in a face‐to‐face interaction with a healthcare practitioner (such as a physician, nurse, or allied health professional). We will include studies of both conventional as well as complementary and alternative practices.\n\n【53】#### Types of interventions\n\n【54】To be considered for inclusion in this review an intervention must involve strategies designed to change practitioner empathy _and/ or_ strategies designed to modify patient expectations.\n\n【55】We will include studies in which the intervention was compared with:\n\n【56】*   a neutral (usual care or sham) comparison group;\n\n【57】*   a negative comparison group (receiving a strategy to reduce empathy and/ or produce negative patient expectations); or\n\n【58】*   another intervention to enhance empathy and/or encourage positive patient expectations.\n\n【59】The intervention could be very simple or more complex . We will describe the complex interventions in detail in the results section of our review.We will include studies of both positive interventions (those designed to improve practitioner empathy or make patient expectations more positive) as well as negative interventions (those designed to reduce practitioner empathy or make patient expectations more negative). Since the direction of the effect in the negative expectations is likely to be the opposite of the direction of the effect in positive interventions, we will separate the positive and negative interventions in our analysis. Failing to separate the interventions could lead to the effects cancelling out in spite of the fact that positive interventions could have positive effects and negative interventions could have negative effects. To reflect the variety of communication styles within clinical practice, we will combine interventions that were compared with a neutral (standard care without attempting to manipulate practitioner empathy or patient expectations/sham intervention) or a negative intervention (designed to reduce practitioner empathy or produce negative patient expectations). However we will investigate the differential effects of these comparisons by excluding studies that compared positive interventions with negative control interventions in a subgroup analysis. We will consider and analyse separately studies in which the intervention involved attempts to induce negative expectations about outcomes in patients and (if we find such studies) interventions aimed at making practitioners less empathetic. This is because some studies indicate that negative patient expectations can cause 'nocebo' effects, which are negative outcomes produced by negative beliefs and expectations . We will exclude studies where the communication is between a healthcare practitioner and a carer (for example because the patient has dementia). We will include clinical (where the intervention was introduced as part of routine care) but not laboratory (where the intervention was introduced in a more artificial environment, for example experimental pain) studies. We will exclude studies in which interpreters were used because the translator could have influenced the communication.\n\n【60】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【61】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【62】1.  Physical health outcomes.\n\n【63】2.  Psychological outcomes.\n\n【64】3.  Harms.\n\n【65】For all primary outcomes, we will choose the primary physical health outcome for the main clinical condition as reported by the study authors. In studies of more than one condition, we will report data on all conditions. We will select the primary physical health outcome which has been identified by the publication authors. Where no primary outcome has been identified, we will select the one specified in the sample size calculation. If there are no sample size calculations, we will select the outcome judged by two clinician authors (GL, PL) working independently to be most clinically relevant. For example longer‐term follow up (weeks or months) is more likely to be clinically relevant than more immediate outcomes (hours or days). If there the two authors cannot reach agreement about the most clinically relevant physical health outcome, input from our patient representative will be sought.\n\n【66】For all primary outcomes, we will also assess the effects of positive and negative interventions in separate comparisons.\n\n【67】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【68】In addition, since effective practitioner‐patient communication could have global health effects (such as patient satisfaction, quality of life) we will also collect data about three secondary outcomes.\n\n【69】1.  Patient satisfaction.\n\n【70】2.  Quality of life.\n\n【71】3.  Cost‐effectiveness.\n\n【72】###### Timing of outcome assessment\n\n【73】Where outcomes were collected at more than one time point, we will choose the time point reported as primary by study authors. Where study authors did not state the primary time point we will choose the one most relevant to patients and provide a rationale. Longer‐term follow up (months rather than weeks) is more likely to be clinically relevant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of infliximab for induction of remission in patients with active CD.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic idiopathic disease characterized by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although symptoms can vary, patients commonly present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and weight loss. CD is not limited to the intestine. Between 25% to 70% of patients experience extraintestinal manifestations such as arthritis, osteoporosis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, oral aphthous stomatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and primary sclerosing cholangitis . While CD may present at any age, the peak ages of diagnosis are in the second and third decades of life .\n\n【7】In North America, the annual incidence of CD ranges from 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 person‐years, with a prevalence between 26 to 199 cases per 100, 000 persons . Although the precise etiology of CD remains unknown, it is believed that a genetic predisposition combined with exogenous (intestinal flora) and endogenous (epithelial cell function and immune cell function) factors contribute to the development of inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. This dysregulated inflammatory response creates an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti‐inflammatory mediators. Available CD therapies attempt to attenuate the resulting inflammatory response .\n\n【8】Since CD is characterized by alternating states of active and quiescent disease, the therapeutic goal is to induce and maintain the remission of symptoms. Treatment guidelines recommend a sequential step‐up approach which focuses on treating the acute disease (i.e. inducing clinical remission) and maintaining response . At the bottom of the treatment pyramid are medications such as 5‐aminosalicylate drugs, antibiotics, and glucocorticoids, which may be less effective but are associated with limited systemic toxicity. In a step‐up fashion, non‐responders are subsequently treated with more aggressive, potentially toxic medications including immunosuppressives (i.e. azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) as well as biological drugs (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, natalizumab and vedolizumab) in an attempt to induce and maintain remission .\n\n【9】Administering potent anti‐inflammatory medications earlier in the disease course can lead to superior results as compared to giving the same treatment after patients have failed standard first line therapies . This top‐down approach involves aggressive treatment with the early use of immunosuppressives and biological agents with the aim of avoiding complications (i.e. stricturing and penetrating disease), surgery, reducing hospitalizations and improving overall quality of life . The top‐down approach involves high up‐front medication costs, and may lead to over‐treatment and avoidable adverse events in patients with mild CD . Although preliminary data suggest that the top‐down approach is effective in high risk patients, determining who is at high risk is problematic given the lack of validated risk predictors .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Infliximab is a human‐mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that works against tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α). By binding and neutralizing TNF‐α, which is found in high levels in the blood serum, mucosa and stool of patients with CD, infliximab is able to render this cytokine biologically inactive .\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】Cytokines, which are intercellular mediators, control the inflammatory process in CD . Chronic local inflammation occurs as a result of mucosal overproduction of pro‐inflammatory cytokines . One of several pro‐inflammatory mediators, TNF‐α plays a key role in numerous inflammatory processes including CD, rheumatoid arthritis, and other granulomatous diseases . Drugs that inhibit TNF‐α, including infliximab are termed TNF‐α antagonists.\n\n【14】In patients with CD, the local effects of infliximab on inflamed bowel mucosa lead to a reduction in TNF‐α expressing cells within four weeks of starting treatment. Compared to patients treated with placebo, the colonic lamina propria of patients treated with infliximab demonstrates a > 50% reduction of cells that produce TNF‐α including CD4+, CD8+, CD68+ monocytes, and macrophages . Treatment with infliximab also leads to a reduction in the number of IFN gamma and TNF‐α producing mononuclear cells in the lamina propria of CD patients . Infliximab reduces the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM‐1 and LFA‐1) . Along with histological repair, infliximab appears to be effective for achieving endoscopic healing, which is correlated with a reduction in disease activity as shown by D'Haens 1999 .\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Conventional treatment options for patients with active CD include systemic corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone, prednisolone), locally acting corticosteroids (e.g. budesonide), aminosalicylates (e.g. sulfasalazine), and immunosuppressives (e.g. azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, methotrexate) However, corticosteroid resistance develops in 16% to 20% of patients with active CD , and many patients do not respond to aminosalicylates and immunosuppressives. The discovery of biologic agents was a turning point in the management of CD. Although biologics can provide rapid and effective clinical response, mucosal healing, improved quality of life, and reduced need for surgery, whether these drugs are a cost‐effective choice is debated .\n\n【17】Infliximab is a promising therapeutic option for patients with moderate to severe active CD who fail to respond to conventional therapy or have fistulizing disease. The ACCENT‐I and ACCENT‐II trials suggest that infliximab is effective for inducing and maintaining remission . ACCENT‐I demonstrated that scheduled infliximab treatment may be more effective than sporadic treatment, and it can lead to a greater probability of mucosal healing and decreased hospital admissions .\n\n【18】Although a previous Cochrane systematic review assessed the efficacy and safety of anti‐TNF‐α antagonists for induction of remission in Crohn’s disease , this review will focus on Infliximab. It will provide an up to date summary of the efficacy and safety of Infliximab used for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of infliximab for induction of remission in patients with active CD.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomized controlled trials will be considered for inclusion.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Adults (>18 years of age) with active CD based on conventional clinical, histological, or endoscopic criteria will be considered for inclusion.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】Studies that compare infliximab to a placebo or an active comparator will be considered for inclusion.\n\n【29】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who failed to achieve clinical remission (as defined by the included studies).\n\n【32】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【33】Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients who failed to achieve endoscopic remission (as defined by the included studies), histologic remission (as defined by the included studies), endoscopic and clinical remission (as defined by the included studies), clinical response (as defined by the included studies), endoscopic response (as defined by the included studies), histologic response (as defined by the included studies), adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】The objective of this review is to assess the effects of community and home‐based exercise interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Hypertension (elevated blood pressure) is a global public health concern, affecting more than one billion people globally . Hypertension is an important risk factor for non‐communicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease, which are associated with high morbidity and mortality . Untreated, hypertension can lead to heart failure, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, chronic kidney disease, retinal haemorrhage, visual impairment, and vascular dementia . Diseases arising from hypertension reduce people's functional capacity and quality of life, and reduced functional capacity often results in a concomitant reduction in social and economic activity. Further, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that complications of hypertension cause the deaths of 9.4 million people every year, accounting for at least 45% of deaths due to ischaemic heart disease and 51% of deaths due to cerebrovascular disease .\n\n【8】Hypertension is traditionally measured manually using a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, or more recently using an automated sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure is liable to change, so a diagnosis of hypertension is made only if blood pressure is demonstrated to be high at repeated measurements. Blood pressure is usually measured as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure, that is the highest measured pressure in arteries when the heart is at the peak of contraction to expel blood from the ventricles (during systole) over the lowest measured pressure when the heart is at maximal relaxation to draw blood in to the ventricles (in diastole).\n\n【9】The WHO defines hypertension as systolic blood pressure of 140 millimetres of mercury (mmHg) or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more (or both) . More detailed classifications of hypertension vary between countries. The current Australian classifications of hypertension are as follows.\n\n【10】*   Grade 1 (mild): systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg to 159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg to 99 mmHg\n\n【11】*   Grade 2 (moderate): systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg to 179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg to 109 mmHg\n\n【12】*   Grade 3 (severe): systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or more and/or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or more\n\n【13】*   Isolated systolic hypertension: systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg \n\n【14】Revised American guidelines released in November 2017 lowered the threshold for diagnosis of hypertension to 130/80 mmHg , a level that under previous classification criteria would be \"borderline\" or \"pre‐hypertensive\" . The European guidelines are, however, aligned with the WHO criteria .\n\n【15】Hypertension is considered to be a disease of lifestyle and is at least partly modifiable by increased physical activity (particularly aerobic exercise), smoking reduction or cessation, and reduced dietary intake of salt and alcohol . Diseases of lifestyle may be anticipated to be highly prevalent in wealthy countries where food is available in abundance and physical activity is reduced through the use of labour‐saving devices. However, high prevailing levels of hypertension are also observed in countries where Western lifestyles (i.e. high‐fat, high‐protein diets; abundant food; low levels of incidental physical activity) are viewed as favourable and as evidence of increasing wealth. Hypertension is particularly prevalent in the African region (27%), with some variation by country . In a national South African survey, an estimated 59% of black Africans visiting general practices had hypertension . However, these data are of limited use to determine actual care need, potential care costs, or burden of disease on the healthcare system because many South Africans report going without medical care due to living in resource‐limited communities .\n\n【16】The WHO 2011 status report on non‐communicable diseases included prevalence estimates of hypertension using data gathered in 2008. In several African countries, prevalence was around 40% (Botswana: 40.8%; Namibia: 43.4%; South Africa: 42.4%, though this was slightly higher in men (43.4%) than women (41.4%); Tanzania: 39.2%; Zambia: 40.1%; and Zimbabwe: 39%). Limited healthcare resources, as well as social influences that compromise care seeking and disease tracking (e.g. civil unrest, war), mean that for some countries, prevalence estimates could not be made (e.g. Burkina Faso; Sudan) . In the most recent WHO 2018 report on non‐communicable diseases , prevalence estimates for raised blood pressure were revised, showing reduced hypertension prevalence in Africa (Botswana: 23%; Central African Republic: 25%; Kenya: 20%; Namibia: 22%; Niger: 27%; Nigeria: 18%; South Africa: 24%; Tanzania: 21%; Zambia: 20%; Zimbabwe: 20%). These revised data give room to question the validity of the 2008 data in the WHO 2011 report. Regardless of the precise values, there are high prevailing levels of hypertension in Africa.\n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】Evidence from high income  countries indicates that lifestyle modifications can be employed to reduce hypertension and that in early hypertension (Grade 1 or mild hypertension) such interventions are likely to be adopted with the greatest ease, identifiable benefit, and least risk . For example, engaging in regular aerobic physical activity such as brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week, for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, has the potential to reduce systolic blood pressure by 4 to 9 mmHg ; and reducing body mass from overweight to a healthy range by means of limited calorie intake and adequate daily physical activity has the potential to reduce systolic blood pressure by 5 to 20 mmHg for every 10 kg body mass reduction . A more recent meta‐analysis reported that the effect of structured exercise interventions on systolic blood pressure still remain under‐studied .\n\n【19】Although regular physical activity is a recognised, available, affordable approach to manage (reduce) hypertension, levels of inactivity remain very high. The WHO recommends that children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes of moderate‐ to vigorous‐intensity physical activity daily and that adults aged up to 64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate‐intensity physical activity, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous‐intensity physical activity, throughout the week. In addition, muscle strengthening exercise should be included two days per week . The WHO estimates that globally, one in four adults, and four in five adolescents, are not physically active enough to achieve health benefits . \"Physical inactivity\" is defined by the WHO as not meeting the WHO recommendations for physical activity .\n\n【20】South Africa is the country with the highest level of physical inactivity in Africa; 37% of South Africans (48% of women, 26% of men) report undertaking insufficient levels of physical activity. Several other African countries show similar behaviour patterns, but inactivity varies considerably across Africa (Botswana: 20%; Central African Republic: 13%; Kenya: 14%; Namibia: 31%; Niger: 21%; Nigeria: 25%; Tanzania: 6%; Zambia: 20%; Zimbabwe: 25%), with considerable disparity between urban and rural dwellers, and between men and women .\n\n【21】Although several studies have investigated physical activity in the African context, most measures have used subjective questionnaires, an approach limited by reporting bias because participants provide answers that conform to socially desirable expectations . Results from an unpublished study at North‐West University indicates that people from low‐resource communities in the North‐West Province of South Africa have limited knowledge about hypertension and the role of regular physical activity as a potential intervention strategy .\n\n【22】Current management guidelines for hypertension include a strong recommendation that lifestyle advice is offered to all patients , whilst considering the diverse context from low‐ to middle‐income countries and high‐income countries . A review undertaken by a South African research team, commissioned by the WHO, identified \"what works\" by way of community interventions for promoting a healthy diet and physical activity . Home and community‐based interventions are likely to be more available and affordable for people in resource‐limited communities than are supervised and practitioner‐led interventions.\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】A selection of factors that give rise to hypertension include atherosclerosis (the build‐up of plaque in arteries), insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (abnormal levels of lipids (fats) in the blood), an increase in sympathetic drive, and a decrease in beta cholinergic receptor sensitivity; these factors can be influenced by exercise. Regular exercise at intensities of between 65% and 85% of heart rate reserve is documented to produce physiological adaptations in the vascular system, leading to a reduction in peripheral resistance . Vasodilatation (widening of blood vessels) has been observed due to an increase in the formation of nitric oxide (NO); this causes a decrease in peripheral resistance which results in a hypotensive effect (lowering of the blood pressure) that can last up to 22 hours following a single training session .\n\n【25】Regular aerobic exercise improves blood pressure through central and peripheral vasodilation, reduction in inflammatory markers, reactive hyperaemia (temporary increase in blood flow), reduced body fat, improved control of glucose and lipids (thus regulating insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia), reduced stress, and increased relaxation (which leads to decreased sympathetic drive and improved autonomic regulation) . These physiological benefits may reduce mortality and morbidity as well as reduce hypertension itself . Improved physiological functioning may improve health‐related quality of life, which may, in turn, improve the economic activity of individuals .\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Reduction in hypertension is likely to reduce pathological diseases caused by high blood pressure, which have substantial morbidity and mortality. The WHO summarised the global health concern of hypertension as follows.\n\n【28】\"Hypertension is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms…. Raised blood pressure is a serious warning sign that significant lifestyle changes are urgently needed. It disproportionately affects populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries where health systems are weak.... Addressing behavioural risk factors, e.g. unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity, can prevent hypertension. ... Integrated non‐communicable disease programmes implemented through a primary health care approach are an affordable and sustainable way for countries to tackle hypertension.\" \n\n【29】There are high prevailing levels of hypertension in Africa, concurrent with resource limitations in many communities, which raises sustainability questions regarding long‐term drug therapies . The ongoing costs of pharmaceuticals may make these interventions prohibitive, particularly if limited to prescription only, which adds the cost of clinical consultations to the costs of the medicines themselves. Further, the use of pharmacotherapy in control of hypertension is open to some conjecture. A 2012 Cochrane Review identified that pharmacotherapy provided no demonstrable benefits in the management of mild hypertension . Across four included trials there were no demonstrable benefits in mortality or morbidity from pharmacotherapy alone, but 9% of participants discontinued pharmacotherapy due to adverse events.  Inconsistencies in findings from interventions with pharmacotherapy indicate that alternative interventions should be considered \n\n【30】A recent meta‐analyses of 391 randomised controlled trials found that aerobic and strength training exercises are as effective as medication for lowering systolic blood pressure . Home‐based and community‐based interventions are likely to be more available and affordable for people with hypertension in resource‐limited communities. A 2005 WHO review of best practices to promote physical activity in developing countries included recommendations to raise awareness of the importance and benefits of physical activity, educate the population, conduct local programmes, build capacity, create supportive environments, and give recognition to those who are physically active . A further review undertaken by a South African research team, commissioned by the WHO, reviewed \"what works\" by way of community interventions for promoting a healthy diet and physical activity: community‐level interventions were highly regarded, but neither of these larger‐scale reviews specifically measured the effects of physical activity to change health outcomes . Rather, \"what worked\" was defined as interventions that were \"stickable\", that is, interventions that produced compliance. As a first step, these reviews were important; an intervention cannot possibly be effective if it is not sufficiently undertaken, maintained, or completed. Our Cochrane Review will add to the existing body of knowledge by determining whether community and home‐based exercise interventions are effective for reducing a measurable risk factor for serious diseases (i.e. hypertension).\n\n【31】We will collate known data on community and home‐based physical activity interventions for the reduction of blood pressure, to determine which interventions are the most effective and safest. This information is important to allow community leaders and individuals in resource‐limited environments to make evidence‐based choices about interventions and care‐seeking for hypertension. If there are insufficient trials or data from which to draw firm conclusions, the review will be used for recommendations to researchers on the design and development of future intervention studies.\n\n【32】We will limit our review to community and home‐based exercise interventions only, excluding trials of interventions in specialised laboratories or gymnasium facilities, to ensure that the results are applicable to resource‐limited settings such as those found in many African countries. Our review is important because it will inform clinicians as to whether the outcomes of accessible, affordable community and home‐based interventions are comparable with less accessible, more expensive, structured, supervised exercise. Further, our review could assist healthcare professionals to design appropriate exercise management plans for hypertensive adults in low‐resource communities. This information may also be used in influencing policy to drive the appointment of clinical exercise physiologists in low‐resource communities to oversee exercise interventions for health outcomes.\n\n【33】Objectives\n----------\n\n【34】The objective of this review is to assess the effects of community and home‐based exercise interventions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.\n\n【35】Methods\n-------\n\n【36】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【37】#### Types of studies\n\n【38】We will include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examine the effects of exercise for the prevention or treatment of hypertension. We will include parallel and cross‐over trials, and cluster‐RCTs, using either non‐intervention or active controls.\n\n【39】We will include all trials in which hypertension is defined according to published diagnostic criteria. Trials with vague definitions of hypertension (e.g. 'high blood', 'blood pressure'), without measured diagnostic criteria, will not be considered. Trials which define hypertension according to incomplete or partial diagnostic criteria will be included, and notes will be provided to identify possible weaknesses in selection.\n\n【40】We will seek trials comparing the following.\n\n【41】*   Community or home‐based exercise (resistance or aerobic) versus no exercise or wait‐list control\n\n【42】*   Community or home‐based exercise versus practitioner‐supervised exercise\n\n【43】*   Community or home‐based exercise versus active control (i.e. pharmacological management or dietary modification)\n\n【44】Studies in which community or home‐based exercise is used adjunctive to other therapies, such as pharmacological management or dietary modification, will be included if the effect of the exercise intervention alone can be determined. Studies in which hypertension is part of a broader diagnosis (such as type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease) will be included if the effect of interventions on blood pressure are reported.\n\n【45】We will exclude cross‐over trials without pre‐cross‐over data, due to the carry‐over effect of exercise interventions and the impossibility of a wash‐out period.\n\n【46】#### Types of participants\n\n【47】We will include trials with adult participants (aged 18 years or more) without regard to race or gender. Studies in children, and studies of hypertension or pre‐eclampsia in pregnant women, will be excluded. Treatment trials will include participants with diagnosed hypertension of any severity and duration, treated or not treated with anti‐hypertensive medication, assessed in primary care, outpatient, or community settings.\n\n【48】#### Types of interventions\n\n【49】We will consider trials that employ home‐based exercise interventions (e.g. walking, unsupervised gym training, incidental activities) and community‐based exercise interventions (e.g. community sport, recreation, and traditional dancing) for the purpose of preventing or reducing blood pressure. Because hypertension is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management, we will not limit studies by duration of intervention.\n\n【50】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【51】Outcome measures considered will be consistent with those used across Cochrane Hypertension systematic reviews of interventions. To assess the effects of exercise for the prevention or treatment of hypertension, we will extract data on the following.\n\n【52】*   Measurements of blood pressure in both intervention and comparator groups\n\n【53】*   Incidence (i.e. new cases) of hypertension in both intervention and comparator groups\n\n【54】*   Prevalence (i.e. continuing cases) of hypertension in both intervention and comparator groups\n\n【55】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【56】*   Change in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured in mmHg\n\n【57】*   Change in mean arterial pressure, measured in mmHg\n\n【58】*   Adverse events, measured as counts of mortality, or participants reporting any adverse event, or withdrawal due to adverse events\n\n【59】A primary outcome measure of hypertension is a criterion for inclusion; studies that do not include at least one primary outcome measure of hypertension will be excluded.\n\n【60】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【61】*   The proportion of participants achieving target blood pressure, as defined by each trial's investigators\n\n【62】*   Incidence (new cases) of hypertension identified within the period of a trial, measured as counts\n\n【63】*   Prevalence (continuing cases) of hypertension identified within the period of a trial, measured as counts\n\n【64】*   Change in anti‐hypertensive medication use, measured as change in a regular dose\n\n【65】*   Change in categorical classification of hypertension, as defined by the investigators of each trial\n\n【66】We will not extract data for the following (however, where possible, we will include notes on these factors as confounders or covariates).\n\n【67】*   Cardiovascular risk factors e.g. family history, smoking, alcohol consumption\n\n【68】*   Changes in medications known to alter cardiovascular function e.g. anti‐retrovirals, glucocorticoids\n\n【69】*   Standardised measures of cardiovascular fitness e.g. VO <sub>2 </sub> peak (maximal oxygen consumption during incremental exercise that does not plateau), VO <sub>2 </sub> max (the point where oxygen uptake no longer increase with an increase in workload)\n\n【70】*   Body composition e.g. body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio\n\n【71】*   Blood markers related to cardiovascular physiology\n\n【72】*   Use of other medications\n\n【73】*   Cardiovascular imaging e.g. Doppler ultrasound, angiography\n\n【74】*   Electrocardiogram (ECG) data\n\n【75】*   Quality of life", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness and safety of pain‐relieving agents for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Infant crying as an expression of discomfort can be for various reasons, from benign conditions to life‐threatening illness. Heine 2006 suggested that fewer than 5% of distressed infants have identifiable medical explanations for their crying. Infantile colic, which is excessive crying in the first few months of life, is a common but poorly understood and often frustrating problem for parents and carers and it is frequently a reason for consultations with paediatricians and community nurses .\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Infantile colic represents a clinical condition with reported incidence rates that vary widely from 3% to 40% of infants . It is characterised by inconsolable crying, fussing and irritability in an otherwise healthy newborn during the first three months of life. Infant crying typically tends to occur in the evening and usually increases at six weeks of age, with drawing up of the legs, tension of the body, flushing of the face, bowel movements, meteorism and bloating. The diagnosis is clinical and the most often cited definition is based on the rule of three, that is, unexplained episodes of paroxysmal crying for more than three hours per day for three days per week for at least three weeks . Many other definitions are available, reflecting different conditions with other risk factors . The condition shows a wide range of clinical manifestations and can be graded as mild, moderate or severe, but there is no consensus for this classification. The natural history of infantile colic is favourable and symptoms gradually disappear by three months of age.\n\n【8】It has been suggested that both biological components (food hypersensitivity/allergy and gut dysmotility) and behavioural factors (psychological and social) could play a role in developing colic . It seems that certain infants are predisposed to visceral hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia in the first weeks of life.\n\n【9】The available evidence suggests that infantile colic might have several independent causes .\n\n【10】*   Carbohydrate malabsorption, in particular lactose intolerance associated to a relative lactase deficiency .\n\n【11】*   Food hypersensitivity (cow's milk allergy) . Colic might represent an early manifestation of food allergy, though studies investigating a link between infant colic and atopy have been conflicting . About 25% of infants with moderate or severe symptoms have cow’s milk‐dependent colic that improves after a few days of a hypoallergenic diet. Therefore, in bottle‐fed babies, a one‐week trial with a formula milk based on whey or casein has been recommended .\n\n【12】*   Feeding disorder, that is, disorganised feeding behaviour and lower responsiveness during feeding interaction with mother .\n\n【13】*   Dismotility. Some authors have suggested that transient dysregulation of the nervous system during development may cause intestinal hypermotility in infants with colic and the predominance of the parasympathetic as well as the sympathetic nervous system has also been investigated .\n\n【14】*   Gut microflora. Lehtonen 1994 first hypothesised that infantile colic may arise from an aberrant gut microbial composition in the first months of life that affects the intestinal fatty acid profile. The role of a peculiar intestinal lactobacilli and also coliform colonisation pattern has been proposed in the aetiopathogenesis of the condition . More recently, Rhoads demonstrated that gut inflammation and an altered, less diverse fecal flora are seen in infants with colic .\n\n【15】*   Psychological factors, such as personality disturbance in the child or less than optimal parent–infant interaction .\n\n【16】*   Data suggest that infants who suffer from colic have higher rate of night wakening and less nocturnal sleep . Colic may be associated with a disruption and delay in maturation of circadian rhythm and sleep‐wake organisation, which resolve when colic disappears; however, the effects of colic on sleep are still controversial .\n\n【17】*   Other recent hypotheses, such as hormone alterations  and maternal smoking , still need confirmation.\n\n【18】Infantile colic is a clinical entity with a wide range of presentations and outcomes. Paediatricians have to exclude other underlying diseases with a medical examination and prevent feeding disorders. Then, considering the favourable clinical course of the condition, safe and well‐tolerated strategies should be adopted .\n\n【19】### Description of the intervention\n\n【20】This review examines the effectiveness and safety of the following pain‐relieving agents: dicyclomine hydrochloride, cimetropium bromide, phytoterapic agents (that is, herbal formulations) and simethicone. The development of visceral pain in infancy is a highly complex process and has important implications for analgesic policy and clinical management. These agents are aimed at reducing gastrointestinal discomfort, which has been theoretically linked with infantile colic.\n\n【21】Dicyclomine hydrochloride is an anticholinergic drug with antispasmodic activity, used to relax muscles in the wall of the gut and prevent spasms. Despite some findings of effectiveness in infantile colic, adverse effects were reported in about 5% of the treated infants. Drowsiness, diarrhoea and constipation were most commonly reported, but severe adverse effects such as apnoea, breathing difficulties, seizures and coma have also occurred . For this reason, the use of anticholinergic drugs for infants below six months old is contraindicated .\n\n【22】Cimetropium bromide is an antimuscarinic compound derivative of belladonna with considerable penetration in blood‐brain barrier. It shows competitive, surmountable antagonism of muscarine receptors of visceral smooth muscle and direct myolytic activity . Cimetropium bromide has been well tolerated in infants when administered at the tested dosage. The only side effect registered has been increased sleepiness that might be related to pain resolution and not to central nervous system effects .\n\n【23】In addition to conventional therapies, the anticholinergic and antiadrenergic activity of some herbal formulations, such as fennel, lemon balm and camomile, have also been proposed .\n\n【24】Simethicone, silicone latex, a defoaming agent, is an alternative pharmacological agent that acts as a detergent to reduce surface tension of bubbles in the intestinal tract and enables abdominal gas to be expelled more easily. It is safe and may reduce meterorism .\n\n【25】### How the intervention might work\n\n【26】The potential remedies for the management of infantile colic operate with different mechanisms of action; however, the ultimate goal is to relieve pain.\n\n【27】Studies performed many years ago stated that most cases of infantile colic could be explained by colonic hyperperistalsis and increased rectal pressure. In particular, the early literature refers to colic as 'hypertonia of infancy'. Predominance of the parasympathetic as well as the sympathetic nervous system has also been investigated. Indeed, the gastrointestinal tract contains a wide variety of hormones involved in the regulation of intestinal motility (that is, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin, motilin  and ghrelin). Lothe 1990 hypothesised that motilin, whose serum levels were increased in infants who developed colic, might play a central role in the aetiopathogenesis of the condition because of its activity in enhancing gastric emptying with increased small‐bowel peristalsis and decreased transit time. In another study, colicky infants presented higher serum levels of motilin and ghrelin compared to their healthy counterparts, suggesting that ghrelin may also be implicated in promoting abnormal hyperperistalsis . These concepts supported the hypothesis of beneficial effects from drugs with antispasmodic effects, such as dicyclomine hydrochloride, cimetropium bromide and some herbal formulations. Dicyclomine, which relaxes muscles in the wall of the gut and prevents spasms, has been used in the treatment of infantile colic based on the assumption that spasms of intestinal smooth muscle cause colic symptoms . Cimetropium bromide may reduce intestinal sensitivity and hypermotility through its competitive antagonism of muscarine receptors of the visceral smooth muscles and myolytic activity . Fennel, lemon balm and camomile may be effective in the treatment of infantile colic because of their anticholinergic and antiadrenergic activity. In particular, in animal models the upper gastrointestinal transit has been influenced after the oral administration of a herbal formulation containing extracts from _Matricaria recutita_ flowers (camomile), _Foeniculum vulgare_ (fennel) and the aerial parts of _Melissa officinalis_ (lemon balm) .\n\n【28】Excessive intraintestinal air load, aerophagia and pain, which are characteristic symptoms of colic crying, may be related to the increased production of gas in the lower bowel . Treem 1994 suggested that colicky infants produce large amounts of gas probably by colonic bacterial fermentation of malabsorbed dietary carbohydrate and that they are relieved of symptoms by the passage of gas. Simethicone decreases abdominal distension and discomfort due to excessive gas production through the dispersion of gas bubbles from the gastrointestinal tract. In this way, it has been studied as treatment for colicky infants postulating that physical signs during colic episodes, such as bearing down and passage of flatulence, suggest excessive gas .\n\n【29】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【30】Infantile colic is a frequent but poorly understood and often distressing problem for parents and carers. The favourable clinical course, the range of ways in which it manifests itself and the day‐to‐day variability of crying time suggest that a well‐tolerated, multifactorial and graded strategy should be adopted.\n\n【31】There have been two systematic reviews focusing on therapeutic interventions for colic , but they are now well out of date. A more recent review was published in 2011, but did not include herbal formulations . Ultimately, specific guidelines for treatment of infants with colic are needed.\n\n【32】Objectives\n----------\n\n【33】To assess the effectiveness and safety of pain‐relieving agents for reducing colic in infants less than four months of age.\n\n【34】Methods\n-------\n\n【35】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【36】#### Types of studies\n\n【37】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials.\n\n【38】#### Types of participants\n\n【39】Infants younger than four months of age suffering from infantile colic diagnosed by a paediatrician. Infantile colic is defined as a prolonged period of crying for no apparent reason in an otherwise healthy infant. The classical definition is based on the rule of three, that is, unexplained episodes of paroxysmal crying for more than three hours a day for three days a week for at least three weeks . However, as there is no consensus on the criteria for crying excessively, we will accept all definitions of excessive crying for inclusion in this review. We will exclude studies of infants with crying of normal duration. Both breast‐fed and bottle‐fed infants will be eligible.\n\n【40】#### Types of interventions\n\n【41】We will include dicyclomine, cimetropium bromide, herbal formulations and simethicone as types of interventions. The agents could be compared to placebo or no treatment. We will also include studies that compare two different agents against each other, analysing these separately.\n\n【42】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【43】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【44】1.  Reduction in crying duration (post‐treatment versus baseline)\\* (data available may be continuous, for example, hours per day, or dichotomous, for example, reduction under a threshold defined by trialists)\n\n【45】2.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We will evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of infections in patients with haematological malignancies with respect to the duration of infections, study mortality, infection‐related mortality, adverse events, infection and duration of hospitalisation.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Infections in haematological malignancies such as leukaemia or lymphoma are often very severe and may be life‐threatening . Infections may be due to the nature of the underlying malignancy or caused through treatment. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or acute leukaemia, for example, may have hypogammaglobulinaemia due to pancytopenia, increasing the risk of infections. Chemotherapy treatment often leads to neutropenia . The severity and duration of neutropenia is directly related to the risk of infection . Fever in neutropenic patients (that is febrile neutropenia) is therefore considered an infection until proven otherwise. Indeed, infections are a very important cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients with fever . The mortality caused by an infection through chemotherapy‐related neutropenia is considered to be less than 5% . However, In the case of sepsis or septic shock mortality is about 30% to 50% .\n\n【7】Most infections caused by viral, bacterial or fungal influences  occur in the respiratory organs, the intestinal tract and the urinary passages . Because of the high risk of life‐threatening bacterial infections, most patients with haematological malignancies and fever are treated with a broad‐spectrum bacterial antibiotic promptly . For patients who remain febrile despite broad‐spectrum antibacterial treatment, empirical antifungal therapy continues to be the standard of care just as for neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies .\n\n【8】While prophylactic treatment of infections is common and effective in high risk patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with recurrent infections and CLL or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), prophylaxis does not prevent all infections. Due to the high mortality associated with infections, more effective treatments are required. Intravenous immunoglobulin may be such a treatment.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), also called intravenous gamma globulin (IVGG), is a human antibody plasma product pooled from blood (3000 to 10,000 donations). Concentrated polyclonal immunoglobulin has been purified by a chemical and physical process. IVIG contains concentrated (unspecific) gamma globulin (IgG) and only trace amounts of IgA and IgM . In comparison to standard IVIG, an (intravenous) immunoglobulin preparation enriched with IgM and IgA (also called IgMA) has been proposed for cases of severe bacterial infection and of sepsis. The additional beneficial effect of IgMA may consist of the neutralisation of endotoxin .\n\n【11】Intravenous immunoglobulin has been used since the early 1980s as a substitutive treatment of primary and secondary antibody deficiencies . IVIG is recommended for the treatment of the following cancer‐related infections :\n\n【12】*   for patients with profound hypogammaglobulinaemia (often seen, for example, in multiple myeloma, chronic lymphatic leukaemia),\n\n【13】*   in combination with ganciclovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia.\n\n【14】Furthermore, it is also used for a number of treatments of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases  and neuropathy .\n\n【15】The dosage of IVIG depends on the indication. In patients with severe infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia, 50 to 300 mg/kg are given based on the patient's tolerance .\n\n【16】Although IVIG therapy is considered to be relatively safe, there are many mild side effects that are commonly associated with IVIG. These are headache, malaise, nausea, low‐grade fever, urticaria, arthralgia and myalgia . Mild symptoms can be prevented as a result of premedication with analgesics, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and H1 antihistamines . Although rare, the serious and potentially fatal adverse effects include anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis, acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and other thrombotic complications . Many of the serious adverse events have occurred in patients who are subject to significant risk factors or underlying disease states. Some authors recommend screening for these through a complete medical evaluation and medical history .\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】In general, two mechanisms of action are described for therapeutic effects of immunoglobulins, immunomodulation and replacement of missing immunoglobulins. While immunomodulation is the assumed effect in autoimmune diseases , a replacement of immunoglobulins is considered the main mechanism in the treatment of infections. In patients with primary or, as in the case of many patients with haematological malignancies, secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia, replacement of immunoglobulins may decrease the duration of infections and reduce serious complications. IVIG is not however effective in preventing infections in patients with haematological malignancies .\n\n【19】A randomised controlled trial (RCT) that included neutropenic adult patients with sepsis syndrome to examine IVIG compared to human albumin showed no statistically significant difference regarding 60‐day mortality, with 29.6% in the IVIG group versus 34.7% in the human albumin group . Another RCT included children with leukaemia who had neutropenia and fever to investigate antibiotics plus IVIG compared to antibiotics alone. It showed that the duration of fever was significantly shorter in the IGIV group . Furthermore, IVIG has shown in a meta‐analysis to reduce infection‐related mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock . This was not true for infections in neonates  and was unclear for the treatment of cancer‐related mucositis .\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】Infections are often severe in patients receiving haematological malignancy treatment and they are associated with a high mortality rate. While IVIG has been shown to be effective in (unselected) patients with sepsis, it remains unclear whether IVIG is beneficial in patients with haematological malignancies and, if yes, in which severity of infections. A number of randomised trials have shown a trend towards lower infection‐related mortality in patients with infections and haematological malignancies who received IVIG compared to patients without IVIG ; neither was statistically significant. A systematic review will clarify the potential benefit of IVIG in patients with haematological malignancies and fever or sepsis.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】We will evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of infections in patients with haematological malignancies with respect to the duration of infections, study mortality, infection‐related mortality, adverse events, infection and duration of hospitalisation.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】We will consider only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as the primary studies in this review and meta‐analysis. We will include both full text and abstract publications. Randomisation is the best way to prevent systematic differences between baseline characteristics of participants in the two relevant intervention groups in terms of both known and unknown (or unmeasured) confounders . We will not include cross‐over studies or quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】We will include studies concerning adult patients (that is at least 18 years of age) with any haematological malignancy with febrile neutropenia or any infection, including sepsis. The authors will accept the definitions of febrile neutropenia and infection given by the authors of the studies. If trials consist of patients with different malignancies, data from the haematological malignancy subgroup will be used. If subgroup data for haematological malignancy patients are not provided after contacting the author of the trial, the trial will be excluded if less than 80% of patients have haematological malignancies.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】We will include the following interventions in the review:\n\n【32】*   experimental intervention, any type of IVIG;\n\n【33】*   control interventions, placebo or no treatment.\n\n【34】We will consider the following comparison:\n\n【35】*   any type of IVIG versus no treatment or placebo.\n\n【36】We will accept any placebo treatment without known antimicrobial efficacy as a control (for example serum albumin). Additional treatment such as supportive care (for example blood products, granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) and antibiotics) has to be equal in both arms except for the use of IVIG. We will conduct separate analyses for patients with chemotherapy, patients with allogeneic stem cell transplantation and with autologous stem cell transplantation.\n\n【37】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【38】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【39】*   On trial mortality (longest follow‐up available)\n\n【40】*   Duration of infections or of febrile neutropenia\n\n【41】We will accept any definition of infections or febrile neutropenia given by the authors. A dichotomous outcome is chosen for mortality as the duration of the trials (or of an infection) is so short that a time‐to‐event outcome does not have any advantages.\n\n【42】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【43】*   Overall survival\n\n【44】*   Tumor progression or disease free survival (caused by immune modulation)\n\n【45】*   Rate of antibiotic use\n\n【46】*   Use of external respirator (days) in an intensive care unit\n\n【47】*   Adverse events (such as graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD), secondary infections (e.g. fungal infections), contamination with hepatitis or HIV)\n\n【48】*   Infection‐related mortality\n\n【49】*   Duration of hospitalisation\n\n【50】For the duration of hospitalisation, the authors point out that this assumes patients to be inpatients. This is expected to restrict the number of trials in analyses of this outcome.\n\n【51】Furthermore, we will assess different doses and time schedules of IVIG.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To asses the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot develops within the venous system, typically in the lower limbs. The characteristic symptoms are limb pain and edema but often DVT is asymptomatic. The risk of developing DVT depends on multiple factors including a previous history of DVT, immobilization, increasing age, surgery, trauma, and any hypercoagulable state. Deep vein thrombosis of the deep calf veins is referred to as distal thrombosis; thrombosis at, or above the popliteal vein is considered to be proximal DVT. Distal DVT becomes important if it extends proximally (up to 28%) , and can increase the chance of developing pulmonary embolism (PE) (up to 56 %) . Ten per cent of symptomatic pulmonary embolisms may be fatal . Other complications of DVT include the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (cumulative incidence 3.8 % at two years) ; post‐thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (20% to 50 %)  characterized by chronic persistent pain, swelling, and other signs in the affected limb; increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism; and venous ulcers (5% to 10%) .\n\n【6】Clinical diagnosis of DVT may be difficult in the absence of symptoms and consequently it is often under diagnosed (50 % of DVT cases are symptomatic) . The clinical significance of those who are not diagnosed remains unknown. Sonography is used as a diagnostic method with moderate sensitivity and specificity for DVT. Phlebography is the gold standard diagnostic method for DVT. It has good specificity and sensitivity, but it is difficult to justify its use as a screening method in a low risk population.\n\n【7】Orthopedic surgery increases the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Knee arthroscopy is a frequently performed surgical procedure in orthopedics, traditionally carried out on a young population, but this indication is now extending to older patients. Arthroscopically‐assisted surgery may be used for the treatment of a variety of pathologies with different technical requirements for example, washout, meniscectomy (removal of cartilage from the knee joint), anterior/posterior cruciate ligament repairment, lateral release, chondroplasty (repair of cartilage), articular debridement (removal of dead or infected material), synovial resection, and tibial plateau fractures. Some of these may be considered minimally‐invasive procedures; other procedures necessitate tourniquet use, extended surgical time, and cause more soft tissue and bone damage. General anesthesia, subarachnoid blockade, femoral blockade, intrarticular or combined anesthesia may be performed, each carrying independent risks.\n\n【8】The incidence of DVT in patients who undergo venographically‐screened, knee arthroscopy, is reported to be as high as 17.9% . Nevertheless, some studies report an incidence of clinically diagnosed DVT of 0.6 % . When ultrasound is performed, other studies report an incidence of 4.1% , and 15.6 % .\n\n【9】Surgeons agree that thromboprophylaxis should be use in moderate and high risk patients who undergo surgery. Graduated elastic stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression are mechanical devices used to prevent DVT, the latter often used in patients immobilized in bed. There are different opinions about what pharmacologic prophylaxis should be used in knee arthroscopy, depending on the incidence in each trial.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To asses the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), whether blinded or not (i.e. double blinded, single blinded or unblinded).\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】Males and females over 18 years old undergoing knee arthroscopy.

Adjunctive pharmacological interventions may be necessary to help manage antipsychotic‐induced weight gain. This review splits and updates a previous Cochrane Review that focused on both pharmacological and behavioural approaches to this problem.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for preventing antipsychotic‐induced weight gain in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】The Cochrane Schizophrenia Information Specialist searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's Register of Trials on 10 February 2021. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined any adjunctive pharmacological intervention for preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia‐like illnesses who use antipsychotic medications.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. For continuous outcomes, we combined mean differences (MD) in endpoint and change data in the analysis. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge certainty of evidence and create summary of findings tables. The primary outcomes for this review were clinically important change in weight, clinically important change in body mass index (BMI), leaving the study early, compliance with treatment, and frequency of nausea. The included studies rarely reported these outcomes, so, post hoc, we added two new outcomes, average endpoint/change in weight and average endpoint/change in BMI.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Seventeen RCTs, with a total of 1388 participants, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Five studies investigated metformin, three topiramate, three H2 antagonists, three monoamine modulators, and one each investigated monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin and samidorphan. The comparator in all studies was placebo or no treatment (i.e. standard care alone). We synthesised all studies in a quantitative meta‐analysis. Most studies inadequately reported their methods of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. The resulting risk of bias and often small sample sizes limited the overall certainty of the evidence. Only one reboxetine study reported the primary outcome, number of participants with clinically important change in weight. Fewer people in the treatment condition experienced weight gains of more than 5% and more than 7% of their bodyweight than those in the placebo group (> 5% weight gain RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.65; 1 study, 43 participants; > 7% weight gain RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83; 1 study, 43 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). No studies reported the primary outcomes, 'clinically important change in BMI', or 'compliance with treatment'. However, several studies reported 'average endpoint/change in body weight' or 'average endpoint/change in BMI'.\n\n【12】Metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain (MD −4.03 kg, 95% CI −5.78 to −2.28; 4 studies, 131 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and BMI increase (MD −1.63 kg/m2, 95% CI −2.96 to −0.29; 5 studies, 227 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Other agents that may be slightly effective in preventing weight gain include H2 antagonists such as nizatidine, famotidine and ranitidine (MD −1.32 kg, 95% CI −2.09 to −0.56; 3 studies, 248 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and monoamine modulators such as reboxetine and fluoxetine (weight: MD −1.89 kg, 95% CI −3.31 to −0.47; 3 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence; BMI: MD −0.66 kg/m2, 95% CI −1.05 to −0.26; 3 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Topiramate did not appear effective in preventing weight gain (MD −4.82 kg, 95% CI −9.99 to 0.35; 3 studies, 168 participants; very low‐certainty evidence _)_ . For all agents, there was no difference between groups in terms of individuals leaving the study or reports of nausea. However, the results of these outcomes are uncertain given the very low‐certainty evidence.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain. Interpretation of this result and those for other agents, is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, and short study duration. In future, we need studies that are adequately powered and with longer treatment durations to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for managing weight gain.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Schizophrenic Related Disorders\n*   Schizophrenia\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Drug Therapy\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Usual Care\n*   Behavioral Therapy\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Body weight\n*   Nausea\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### How effective are medications given alongside antipsychotics at preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia?\n\n【25】**Key messages**\n\n【26】‐ Metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain caused by antipsychotics.\n\n【27】‐ H2 antagonists and monoamine modulators may be slightly effective in preventing weight gain caused by antipsychotics.\n\n【28】‐ Future studies should include more people and evaluate them for longer.\n\n【29】**What are antipsychotics?**\n\n【30】Antipsychotics are medications used to treat symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations, delusions and agitation. They are often used to treat people with schizophrenia. Examples of antipsychotics are haloperidol (Haldol), chlorpromazine (Thorazine), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and risperidone (Risperdal).\n\n【31】**Schizophrenia and weight gain**\n\n【32】People with schizophrenia are twice as likely as the general population to be overweight, perhaps due to a poor diet and an inactive lifestyle. Excess weight can lead to other health conditions, such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\n【33】Unfortunately, an unwanted effect of antipsychotics is weight gain. Sometimes, people with schizophrenia are given medications alongside antipsychotics (‘add‐on’ medications) to prevent this additional weight gain. These add‐on medications may stop people feeling hungry or help them feel full. Usually, they are medications developed for other purposes, such as metformin, which is a medicine to treat diabetes, and fluoxetine, which is an antidepressant.\n\n【34】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【35】We wanted to find out whether add‐on medications to prevent weight gain caused by antipsychotics were effective in people with schizophrenia.\n\n【36】**What did we do?**\n\n【37】We searched for studies that examined any medicine given alongside antipsychotics to prevent weight gain in people with schizophrenia. Study participants could be any age or sex but had to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a schizophrenia‐like illness. They had to be chosen at random to receive either the weight‐prevention medicine, or a placebo (a dummy medicine) or no add‐on medicine (standard treatment).\n\n【38】We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.\n\n【39】**What did we find?**\n\n【40】We found 17 studies with 1388 people that examined the effects of add‐on medications to prevent weight gain caused by antipsychotics. The add‐on medications were metformin, topiramate, H2 antagonists, monoamine modulators, monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin, and samidorphan. Studies were short, lasting between 6 and 24 weeks.

It results from a sudden pull on the arm, usually by an adult or taller person, which pulls the radius through the annular ligament, resulting in subluxation (partial dislocation) of the radial head. The child experiences sudden acute pain and loss of function in the affected arm. Pulled elbow is usually treated by manual reduction of the subluxed radial head. Various manoeuvres can be applied. Most textbooks recommend supination of the forearm, as opposed to pronation and other approaches. It is unclear which manoeuvre is most successful.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The objective of this review is to compare the effectiveness and painfulness of the different methods used to manipulate pulled elbow in young children.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, clinical trial registers and reference lists of articles. Date of last search: January 2009.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Any randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating manipulative interventions for pulled elbow were included. Our primary outcome was failure at the first attempt, necessitating further treatment.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two review authors independently evaluated trials for inclusion and, for the included trials, independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Three trials with 313 participants, all younger than seven years old, were included. All three trials compared pronation versus supination. The methodological quality of all three trials was low because of incomplete reporting and high risk of bias resulting from lack of assessor blinding. Pronation resulted in statistically significantly less failure than supination (risk ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.87). Pain perception was reported by two trials but data were unavailable for pooling. Both studies concluded that the pronation technique was less painful than the supination technique.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】There is limited evidence from three small low‐quality trials that the pronation method might be more effective and less painful than the supination method for manipulating pulled elbow in young children. However, only a small difference in effectiveness was found. We recommend that a high quality randomised trial be performed to strengthen the evidence.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Pulled Elbow\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Reduction Procedure\n*   Manual Reduction\n*   Manipulation Of Elbow Joint\n*   Manipulation Of Elbow - Non-surgical\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Pain\n*   Treatment Failure\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】----------------------\n\n【24】### Different methods of manipulation for reducing pulled elbow in young children\n\n【25】Pulled elbow is a dislocation of the elbow joint in a young child which is usually caused by an adult, or taller person, suddenly pulling or tugging on the child's arm when it is straight; or when a child pulls away from an adult impulsively. The child immediately complains of pain and cannot use their arm.  \n\n【26】Treatment usually consists of manipulating the arm to get the bones of the elbow back into their correct position. It is usually treated by manual intervention. In the typical manoeuvre, called supination, the forearm is twisted or rotated outwards (palm of child’s hand faces upwards), sometimes followed by bending of the elbow. While this has become standard practice, it is not always successful. Other methods, particularly the use of pronation, where the forearm is twisted or rotated inwards (palm of child’s hand faces downwards), have also been used. These methods are generally safe, although bruising can occur and they can be painful.\n\n【27】Evidence from three small, low quality trials involving a total of 313 participants indicates that the pronation method (with the hand downward) is more successful in repositioning and less painful for children with a pulled elbow.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine which NNRTI—EFV or NVP—is more effective in terms of viral load suppression when given in combination with two NRTIs as part of initial ARV combination therapy for HIV infection in adults and children.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】A total of 33.2 million people were living with HIV in 2007, and 22.5 million of this number were living in sub‐Saharan Africa . In countries with the financial resources and healthcare infrastructure to support HIV treatment, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality among the HIV‐infected population .\n\n【6】For countries with limited resources, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a public health approach to antiretroviral treatment to improve access, simplify clinical decision making, standardize regimens, and standardize monitoring, management of toxicity, and drug interactions .\n\n【7】The WHO model list of essential medicines describes the following three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs used for treatment and prevention of HIV infection: nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Ritonavir, a synergistic enhancer, is recommended for use as a pharmacological booster to enhance the effects of PIs, and not as an antiretroviral drug in its own right .\n\n【8】The International AIDS Society (IAS) ‐ USA recommends that the initial treatment regimen should include two NRTIs and efavirenz (EFV) or a boosted PI . The WHO recommends that for low‐resource settings, initial ARV therapy should include two NRTIs and one NNRTI, which can be either nevirapine (NVP) or EFV . Delavirdine (DLV), another NNRTI, is not included in the core list of essential medicines published in March 2007 by the WHO.\n\n【9】For HIV‐infected infants with no exposure to maternal or infant NNRTIs, or whose exposure to maternal or infant ARV treatment is unknown, standard NVP‐containing triple‐drug therapy should be started. For HIV‐infected infants with a history of exposure to single‐dose NVP or to NNRTIs containing maternal ARV therapy or preventive ARV regimens, a PI‐based triple ARV therapy regimen should be started. Where PIs are not available, affordable, or feasible, NVP‐based therapy should be used . Efavirenz has not been studied adequately in children under the age of 3 years or among children weighing less than 13 kg.\n\n【10】For any initial regimen, the potency, durability of efficacy, ease of administration and storage, tolerability, and toxicity must be balanced with cost and availability .\n\n【11】Apart from the high cost of PIs, the pill burden, and the dietary constraints, they are linked to serious, long‐term metabolic disorders, most notably an increased risk of lipodystrophy and hyperlipidaemia . A meta‐analysis of 12 trials revealed that NNRTI‐based regimens were better at virologic suppression than PI‐based regimens .\n\n【12】The NNRTIs have a more favourable adverse effect profile than PI’s, are less expensive, and are easier to administer. They also are more cost effective .The main disadvantage of this group is that a single mutation may confer resistance to the entire class of NNRTIs because cross‐resistance among agents of this class is nearly universal .\n\n【13】Nevirapine may be responsible for severe or fatal hepatotoxicity and a rash which may present in severe form as Stevens Johnson syndrome, but it is the NNRTI of choice for pregnant women because EFV may be teratogenic. It also may cause a rash or symptoms within the central nervous system (CNS), such as dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, drowsiness, nightmares, hallucinations, and poor concentration .\n\n【14】The authors of a previous systematic review which compared EFV to NVP in three ‐drug regimens concluded that their short‐term efficacy (42 to 52 weeks) was identical . The authors did not address other issues, such as adherence and clinical evolution.\n\n【15】Providing evidence on the more appropriate choice of NNRTI in terms of efficacy, durability, and tolerability is important to patients, caregivers, and policy makers all over the world. With such evidence, the cost and availability of each drug then could be evaluated on a secondary basis.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To determine which NNRTI—EFV or NVP—is more effective in terms of viral load suppression when given in combination with two NRTIs as part of initial ARV combination therapy for HIV infection in adults and children.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】*   Randomised controlled trials\n\n【22】*   Observational cohort studies\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Adults and children infected with HIV and without prior exposure to ARV therapy. Women who have received short courses of NNRTIs for the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV will be included. Owing to the paucity of knowledge on the effects of EFV in children under 3 years, this age group will not be included.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】We will consider triple‐drug ARV combination regimens for initial therapy that contain two NRTIs plus either EFV or NVP at any dose (EFV + 2NRTIs versus NVP + 2NRTIs). The NRTIs in each combination need not be specified, but if specified, they must be the same in both arms. Trials with additional arms will be included, but only the EFV‐ and NVP‐containing arms will be evaluated in the review.\n\n【27】We will compare the therapeutic efficacy of triple‐drug regimens containing EFV and NVP using plasma HIV RNA concentration as a surrogate marker for clinical progression.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the benefits and harms of rigid dressings versus soft dressings for treating transtibial amputations.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Lower limb amputation can result from non‐traumatic causes (e.g. dysvascular disease, malignancy and congenital deficiencies) or traumatic causes (e.g. war injuries and work accidents) . Amongst these causes, dysvascular disease is most common and includes diseases such as diabetes and peripheral vascular disease . The incidence of lower limb amputation is estimated to be 24 per 100,000 in the USA , and 26 per 100,000 in the UK . These estimates increase in people with diabetes, and estimates range from 410 to 3100 per 100,000 in the USA and from 147 to 248 per 100,000 in the UK . Trauma is the second most common cause of limb loss , and accounts for 16% of amputations in the USA , and 7% to 9% of amputations in the UK . Approximately half of all lower limb amputations are transtibial (below the knee) amputations .\n\n【7】Poor outcomes are commonly reported post‐lower limb amputation. High mortality rates have been reported in patients with non‐traumatic amputations, with almost 50% dying within one year and 70% dying within three years, mostly due to underlying co morbidities (e.g. heart failure, renal failure, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) . The rate of hospital readmission within 30 days ranges from 10% to 30%, with a large proportion readmitted due to wound complications and stump revisions . In patients with traumatic amputations, half have been reported to have substantial disability at two‐year and seven‐year follow‐up . Rehospitalisation rates were similar at less than 30%, with 34% developing wound infections and 15% requiring revision . Consequently, the cost of acute and post‐acute care of an initial episode of amputation is high, costing more than USD 8.3 billion yearly in the USA . In the UK, up to GBP 985 million is spent on care related to foot ulcers and amputations .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Two main types of dressings can be applied after a transtibial amputation. These dressings include soft and rigid dressings. These dressings differ from local wound dressings (e.g. hydrogel dressings, negative wound therapy, honey, aloe vera) in that they are applied with a degree of compression in order to reduce stump swelling in preparation for prosthetic fitting in transtibial amputations . Soft dressings (e.g. elastic or crepe bandages) are the conventional choice of dressings due to their low cost and easy applicability . However, rigid dressings have grown in popularity due to the belief that a hard exterior provides greater compression, greater reduction in swelling and hence faster wound healing and shorter time to prosthetic fitting . Rigid dressings are the intervention of interest in this systematic review and include the following variations ;\n\n【10】#### Non‐removable rigid dressings\n\n【11】These are multi‐layered dressings made out of gauze pads and bandages, cotton/woollen/synthetic fibre stump socks and a plaster of Paris cast. Dressings are moulded up to the thigh level of the stump with the knee immobilised in full extension. The earliest report of their use is in 1961 . These dressings are sometimes combined with an immediate postoperative prosthesis . Plaster of Paris casts are also sometimes replaced with a prefabricated plastic dressing held by neoprene and Velcro straps .\n\n【12】#### Removable rigid dressings\n\n【13】These are similar to non‐removable rigid dressings except they do not include the knee so it is free to flex. Use of a removable rigid dressing was first reported in 1979 . The main advantages of a removable rigid dressing over a non‐removable rigid dressing is that it allows frequent observation of the wound and does not require another cast to be made. If stump volume decreases, socks can be added to the cast and the cast placed back on the stump . The removable rigid dressings may increase susceptibility to knee flexion contractures because the knee is not held in extension. In order to keep the knee extended and minimise the chances of knee flexion contractures, the use of pouches on patients' wheelchairs , or custom‐made removable bivalved rigid shells have also been suggested . Plaster of Paris casts are also sometimes replaced with a fibreglass/synthetic cast for a lighter cast .\n\n【14】#### Immediate postoperative prostheses\n\n【15】These allow for early weight‐bearing on the stump. These prostheses can vary in terms of their top or bottom parts. The top part surrounding the stump can come in either a custom‐made plaster of Paris cast , or prefabricated pneumatic air bladder/air splint , or prefabricated plastic dressing held by neoprene and Velcro straps . The bottom part that is in contact with the ground can be either a metal cylinder , or an adjustable aluminium pylon attached to an artificial foot .\n\n【16】#### Others\n\n【17】These include combinations of the above (e.g. non‐removable rigid dressings and immediate postoperative prostheses) or dressings and prostheses that are not yet described. These include the Sterishield Controlled Environment Unit (CEU) and semi‐rigid dressings. The CEU consists of a sterile transparent pneumatic plastic cylinder, which allows the flow of warm filtered air through the system but does not allow weight‐bearing . Semi‐rigid dressings consist of a bandage imbedded with Unna paste developed by a dermatologist in 1883 to treat ulcers. The Unna paste is made of zinc oxide, calamine, gelatin and glycerine and forms a semi‐rigid inextensible dressing .\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】The main postulated benefits of rigid dressings over soft dressings are:\n\n【20】*   greater reduction in swelling via application of more consistent pressure around the stump ; and\n\n【21】*   greater protection of the stump from trauma due to the hard surface of a rigid dressing .\n\n【22】These factors are believed to lead to faster wound healing, reduced risk of wound infection/breakdown, reduced pain, shorter time to prosthetic fitting and reduced length of stay in the hospital .\n\n【23】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【24】There is uncertainty about the most appropriate and effective type of dressings following transtibial amputations. Several reviews have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of rigid dressings in improving outcomes in transtibial amputations though only two were systematic reviews . Of these two systematic reviews, one review was published more than a decade ago , and one only investigated the efficacy of rigid dressings on one outcome (i.e. time from amputation to prosthetic fitting) . Despite being the first meta‐analysis to be conducted on the literature, Churilov 2014 drew the conclusion to support rigid dressings without consideration of the inconsistency and imprecision of the results from the studies included in the systematic review. Several amputee care guidelines have also recommended the use of rigid dressings for transtibial amputations , though these recommendations are largely based on poorly conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, case‐control studies and retrospective audits. Due to the skepticism surrounding the quality of evidence on rigid dressings and the belief that rigid dressings can lead to wound breakdowns in some patients with poor skin integrity, there remains wide variation in practice concerning dressings in transtibial amputations . It is therefore important to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous systematic review to summarise recent evidence on the benefits and harms of rigid dressings in transtibial amputations.\n\n【25】Objectives\n----------\n\n【26】To assess the benefits and harms of rigid dressings versus soft dressings for treating transtibial amputations.\n\n【27】Methods\n-------\n\n【28】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【29】#### Types of studies\n\n【30】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. The latter includes studies with quasi‐randomised allocation procedures, such as alternation, hospital record number or date of birth .\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】People of all ages with transtibial amputations due to all causes including dysvascular disease (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease), trauma and cancer.\n\n【33】#### Types of interventions\n\n【34】*   Rigid dressings (intervention), which include non‐removable rigid dressings, removable rigid dressings, immediate postoperative prostheses and others;\n\n【35】*   soft dressings (comparison), which include crepe bandaging and elastic/compression bandaging.\n\n【36】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【37】##### Timing of outcome measures\n\n【38】Outcomes could be obtained at any time point following amputation. We will group outcomes according to the time since amputation:\n\n【39】*   short‐term outcomes: outcomes obtained less than one month since amputation;\n\n【40】*   medium‐term outcomes: outcomes obtained between one to three months of amputation;\n\n【41】*   long‐term outcomes: outcomes obtained after three months of amputation.\n\n【42】We will present dichotomous and continuous outcomes as short‐term, medium‐term and long‐term outcomes. We will present time‐to‐event outcomes at the median or mean follow‐up reported by the authors. We will use our judgement as to whether statistical pooling within these outcomes is appropriate.\n\n【43】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【44】*   Wound healing measured as time from amputation to wound healing and proportion of wounds healed;\n\n【45】*   complications/adverse events measured as proportion of skin‐related complications/adverse events (e.g. wound infections/breakdowns/stump revisions/further amputations/pressure areas), proportion of non skin‐related complications/adverse events (e.g. deaths, chest infections, falls, pain) and severity of pain on the visual analogue scale.\n\n【46】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【47】*   Prescription of prosthetics measured as time from amputation to first prosthetic fit/cast;\n\n【48】*   physical function measured as time to independent ambulation, proportion of participants mobilising independently and functional assessment scales (e.g. Functional Independence Measure scale);\n\n【49】*   length of hospital stay measured as time from hospital admission to discharge;\n\n【50】*   patient comfort measured with a validated scale used to measure patient’s ease, comfort or satisfaction with the dressing;\n\n【51】*   quality of life data measured with generic or wound‐specific questionnaires;\n\n【52】*   cost measured as any cost relating to dressings or other resources (e.g. personnel costs).\n\n【53】*   swelling measured as girth measurements or any other measures of stump volume reported by study authors. (We note that swelling is a potential surrogate outcome for other outcomes such as wound healing, physical function and length of hospital stay. Conclusions regarding efficacy of rigid dressings will not be based on swelling).\n\n【54】We anticipate that study authors will define wound healing in different ways . We will not try to enforce a single definition of wound healing across all trials but instead we will extract data according to each authors’ definition of wound healing. We will also align our methods of data extraction and data analysis/synthesis of wound outcomes with previous Cochrane systematic reviews on wound healing for consistency . We have covered these methods further in the sections on Data extraction and management , Measures of treatment effect , Unit of analysis issues and Data synthesis .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of routine blood cultures in addition to urine cultures as part of the management of pyelonephritis in pregnancy to improve outcomes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Pyelonephritis in pregnancy\n\n【7】Urinary tract infections are common during pregnancy. These include asymptomatic bacteriuria, acute cystitis, and acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is diagnosed with a quantitative urine specimen culture. Bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided urine specimens with isolation of the same bacterial strain in quantitative counts of at least 10 <sup>5 </sup> colony forming units (cfu)/ml or a single catheterised urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of at least 10² cfu/ml . Acute cystitis is a lower urinary tract infection, characterised by dysuria, urgency and frequency. Acute pyelonephritis is one of the most serious complications among urinary tract infections in pregnancy. Acute pyelonephritis is an upper urinary tract infection involving the renal pelvis, calcies, and parenchyma. Clinical manifestations include fever, nausea/vomiting, or flank pain with or without cystitis symptoms.\n\n【8】During pregnancy, anatomical and physiological changes occur in the urinary tract including dilation of renal pelvis and ureter, displacement of the bladder, and mechanical compression of the ureters by the uterus . As a result, urinary stasis and vesicoureteral reflux predispose the patient to acute pyelonephritis.\n\n【9】#### Incidence and risks of pyelonephritis in pregnancy\n\n【10】Acute pyelonephritis occurs 1% to 2% during pregnancy . It was demonstrated that pyelonephritis is the second most common reason for hospitalisation not related to delivery . In addition, pyelonephritis is the leading cause of septic shock during pregnancy .\n\n【11】The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria varies from 2% to 10%  to 30% to 70%  during pregnancy. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is well‐known to increase the risk of developing acute pyelonephritis among pregnant women by 20‐ to 30‐fold, compared with women without bacteriuria . If asymptomatic bacteriuria is left untreated, approximately 25% of infected pregnant women will develop symptomatic urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis .\n\n【12】Among pregnant women with pyelonephritis, approximately 10% to 20% of those were found to have concurrent bacteraemia. In recent studies, 15% (21/137 cases) , 9%, (35/388 cases) , and 17% (30/172 cases)  were reported to have positive blood cultures with acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.\n\n【13】#### Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes due to urinary tract infections during pregnancy\n\n【14】Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria are more likely to have premature delivery and low birthweight. Therefore, the 2005 Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines and 2007 Cochrane Review have recommended to treat all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria . Acute pyelonephritis may also be related to premature delivery and low birthweight , although its association is not clear at present. Jacobsson 2002 indicated that urosepsis may be related to an increased incidence of cerebral palsy among preterm infants.\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】The general approach to pregnant women with pyelonephritis includes hospitalisation, obtaining both urine and blood cultures, and administering intravenous antimicrobial agents . Previous randomised studies showed that ampicillin and gentamicin or cefazolin or ceftriaxone were effective as empirical therapy for this condition . If patients do not respond to the initial antimicrobial therapy, urine or blood cultures and their susceptibility testing results guide to the appropriate alternative therapy. Recent studies, however, have reported limited usefulness of urine and blood cultures. MacMillan 1991 and Wing 2000 demonstrated that the management of pyelonephritis in pregnancy only using pretreatment urine cultures without blood cultures may be safe and effective without compromising patient care. They argued that since organisms isolated from blood cultures are the same as those from the urine, there is little further information to change management. In these studies, most changes in antimicrobial therapy were made on the basis of clinical response, not the susceptibility testing results. Only a few cases required a change in therapy after the blood culture results were available.\n\n【17】From the practical standpoint, there are three different strategies to manage pyelonephritis during pregnancy . First, treat patients with pyelonephritis in pregnancy routinely obtaining both urine and blood cultures. Second, treat them only based on urine cultures without blood cultures. Third, for low‐risk patients, urine and blood cultures are obtained only if a clinical response is not observed within 48 hours. From an economic point of view, Wing 2000 also estimated that as of 1999, $15 million would be saved annually if only urine cultures without blood cultures were obtained among patients with pyelonephritis in pregnancy in the United States.\n\n【18】### How the intervention might work\n\n【19】Blood cultures determine the presence of bacteraemia and are useful especially in patients with risk factors for endocarditis  and complicated pyelonephritis, such as diabetes, immunosuppression, urolithiasis, urologic, anatomic or functional abnormalities, and renal diseases. Blood cultures may optimise antimicrobial therapy with appropriate selection of agents and duration of therapy. Accordingly, blood cultures would improve outcomes among pregnant women with pyelonephritis and provide a more cost‐effective approach to these patients.\n\n【20】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【21】Medical costs overall have been increasing in most countries. If blood cultures are omitted during the routine management of patients with pyelonephritis in pregnancy, potential medical cost savings would be enormous. It is also useful to determine the factors which lead to patient management blood cultures in addition to urine cultures among patients with pyelonephritis in pregnancy. Moreover, there are many pregnant women in resource‐limited countries where routine blood cultures may not be available . Increasing antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriacae, such as _E. coli_ has been of concern globally . Therefore, it is important to compare the outcomes among patients with pyelonephritis in pregnancy who are treated with or without blood cultures in addition to urine cultures.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy and safety of daclizumab for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that leads to demyelination in the central nervous system. MS may cause potentially almost any neurological symptom, such as visual loss, double vision, motor weakness, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, sensory loss, sphincter dysfunction and cognitive impairment . A secondary progressive phase (SPMS) follows an exacerbating and remitting course (RRMS) in some 80% of relapsing patients within 2 decades .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Based on new insights into the pathophysiology of this immune disease, a number of novel selective immunotherapies are currently in clinical development. These new monoclonal antibody treatments target specific cell populations, including B cells, T cells, immune cell migration into the brain, and the inflammation associated with MS. By selectively targeting individual cell populations rather than all of the immune system cells, these novel agents might provide improved safety profiles and enhanced efficacy .\n\n【9】Daclizumab (Zenapax) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks the interleukin‐2 receptor alpha subunit (IL‐2R‐alpha chain; CD25) expressed on activated T cells leading to the inhibition of T‐cell expansion, thus strongly reduces brain inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Another mechanism is significant expansion of CD56 (bright) natural killer (NK) cells that in turn inhibit T‐cell survival .\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】Results of four open‐label studies of intravenous daclizumab in patients with active forms of either RRMS or SPMS have suggested beneficial effects of daclizumab for both add‐on and monotherapy protocols as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical outcomes. Very recently, results of a first randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicentre study (CHOICE) of daclizumab given subcutaneously in addition to IFNB in patients with active, relapsing forms of the disease have been presented. Remarkablely, anti‐CD25 treatment appears to be effective in patients with ongoing disease activity as regards clinical and MRI outcomes. Moreover, there are no severe safety concerns arising from clinical testing so far .\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】No systematic review currently exists in the peer‐reviewed literature that focuses on daclizumab for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To assess the efficacy and safety of daclizumab for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】All randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating daclizumab, alone or combined to other treatments, versus placebo, or any other treatment for patients with RRMS.

{"seq_id": "28e76bb0-8131-4a7a-bf8d-5b24883cf8ae", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n### Background\n\n【1】Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin ‐ the prohormone of calcitonin ‐ has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all‐cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI‐specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow‐up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re‐hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI‐associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow‐up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow‐up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients.\n\n【10】For the two co‐primary endpoints of all‐cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed‐effect. The different trials were added as random‐effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, ‐3.47, 95% CI ‐3.78 to ‐3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high‐quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non‐European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost‐effectiveness by considering country‐specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Acute Respiratory Tract Infection\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Antibacterials For Systemic Use\n*   Calcitonin Measurement\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Antibacterials For Systemic Use\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   Adverse Drug Reaction\n*   Treatment Failure\n*   Death\n*   Antibiotic Therapy\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Procalcitonin testing to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections\n\n【25】Unnecessary antibiotic use significantly contributes to increasing bacterial resistance, medical costs and the risk of drug‐related adverse events. The blood marker procalcitonin increases in bacterial infections and decreases when patients recover from the infection. Hence, procalcitonin may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with a clinical suspicion of infection. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that such a strategy works, particularly in patients with an infection of the respiratory tract. However, most of these individual studies did not include enough patients to allow for a conclusive assessment about safety (low statistical power). Thus, the risk for mortality and severe complications associated with procalcitonin‐guided decision making remained unclear.\n\n【26】This systematic review included individual patient data from 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 4211 participants. When looking at these combined data, we found no increased risk for all‐cause mortality or treatment failure when procalcitonin was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in participants with acute respiratory infections compared to control participants. However, we found a consistent reduction of antibiotic use, mainly due to lower prescription rates in primary care and lower duration of antibiotic courses in emergency department and intensive care unit patients. This analysis is limited to adult patients with respiratory infections excluding patients who were immuno‐compromised (i.e. HIV positive, those receiving immuno‐suppressive therapies or chemotherapy). Most trials were conducted in Europe and China and similar studies in other countries including the United States are warranted.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the clinical effects of clozapine compared with olanzapine for the treatment of people with schizophrenia and related disorders\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling mental illness which involves a complex set of disturbances associated with abnormalities of brain structure and function, that affects about one per cent of the population . It is characterised by a combination of positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder), negative symptoms (loss of mental energy and efficiency, such as limited emotional expression, apathy, social withdrawal, and poverty of thought and speech), and cognitive impairment (affects executive functioning, verbal memory, and attention) .\n\n【7】Typically, the prodromal phase of schizophrenia emerges in the early adolescent years and patients experience a decline in cognitive and social functioning, which precedes the onset of a first episode of psychosis (where the person's perception of reality is altered significantly and often involves experience of delusions and hallucinations). It is not until the first episode is presented in late adolescence or early adulthood, that a person is referred for specialist consultation .\n\n【8】Schizophrenia, like most psychiatric diagnoses, remains a syndromic concept. The use of operational criteria, such as those incorporated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐5) ( DSM‐V ) and the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD‐10 ) ( ICD‐10 ) of the World Health Organization, have provided a reliable diagnostic approach for clinicians, and they are the classifications that are, in the main, currently being used .\n\n【9】Schizophrenia concerns not only the patients themselves but also their family members who assume their care. It is one of the health problems that contributes most to the global burden of diseases due to the early onset and the frequent chronicity leading not only to individual burden but to high levels of social burden and cost as well .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】A large number of antipsychotics (typical and atypical) are available for the treatment of schizophrenia or related disorders and are considered the mainstay treatment .\n\n【12】Since the discovery of chlorpromazine, first‐generation or typical antipsychotics, although effective in treating positive symptoms as well as preventing psychotic relapse, can produce neurological adverse effects (e.g. extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia) with long‐term exposition . The latter represents a major limitation of typical antipsychotics treatment since it can lead to discontinuation and relapse. These older medications have also shown minimal benefit on negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and cognitive deficits .\n\n【13】Atypical antipsychotics were developed with the aim of finding new drugs with equal or better efficacy and tolerability than typical antipsychotics. Clozapine was the first atypical antipsychotic developed to demonstrate superiority over other antipsychotics for people with treatment‐refractory schizophrenia , and which may ameliorate (or at least not worsen) some of the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia . However, it can produce severe adverse effects e.g. hematological disorders such as agranulocytosis (reduction in the number of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils), which restricts its use. After clozapine, a considerable number of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, asenapine and zotepine, were developed . All demonstrate effectiveness for treating schizophrenia, but do not have the serious hematological side effects of clozapine . Nevertheless, some side effects that may be related to their use include weight gain, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, prolongation of QTc interval, myocarditis, sexual side effects, extrapyramidal side effects and cataracts .\n\n【14】Clozapine, is a restricted atypical drug by the US Food and DRug Administration (FDA) that requires a periodic hematological monitoring. It is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in people whose symptoms are not controlled with standard antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine is also used in people with recurrent suicidal behaviour associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .\n\n【15】A safe therapeutic dosage range for clozapine has not been clearly established due to variation in individual response . However, a dose range between 200 mg/day to 600 mg/day have shown to be effective with plasma levels between 300 ng/mL to 700 ng/mL. Clozapine is available only for oral administration .\n\n【16】Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has shown to be effective with doses of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day with plasma levels in a range from 8 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL . It is available for oral and intramuscular (short‐ and long‐acting injection) administration . Olanzapine oral is indicated for schizophrenia and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved for treatment of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】The mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotics is not completely clear. The hypothesis most widely accepted and supported by studies is Fast‐Off‐D2 antipsychotics that is related with loose binding to the D2 receptor . Clozapine exhibits a transient occupancy of 72 % of striatal D2 receptors at two hours after administration, which quickly reduces, reaching a 30% level at 24 hours after administration .\n\n【19】Clozapine also has multiple sites of action , with modest affinity to dopamine D4 and lower affinity for D1 receptors, but a high affinity for serotonin 5‐HT <sub>2A </sub> receptors. It also has affinity H <sub>1 </sub> histaminergic, M1muscarinic, α‐adrenergic receptors and other serotonin receptors .\n\n【20】Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, olanzapine has shown that its dissociation from D2 receptors is much slower than clozapine , since it presents moderate affinity by receptor; both drugs reach their thresholds of effectiveness only when their D2 occupancy reaches 65%. Since olanzapine could exceed this threshold in a dose‐dependent fashion, it gives rise to extrapyramidal side effects .\n\n【21】Olanzapine has a slightly different binding site affinity than clozapine . It shares a high affinity with 5‐HT <sub>2A, </sub> receptor than D2 receptor . Also, it presents different affinities for other serotoninergic receptors, α‐adrenergic receptors, muscarinic M1–M5 receptors, and histamine H1 receptors .\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Antispychotics are the mainstay treatment for people with schizophrenia or related disorders . A wide range of antipsychotics are available with varied clinical effectiveness and associated side effects. Systematic reviews for direct antipsychotic comparisons are needed to provide high‐quality evidence to aid the decision‐making process for clinicians and service users. According to evidence obtained from a systematic review that compared clozapine versus other atypical antipsychotics differences were found between clozapine and olanzapine . It seems that clozapine produces a lower increase of prolactin levels than olanzapine. On the other hand, clozapine is associated with a higher frequency of leukopenia (reduced white blood cell count), hypersalivation, sedation and seizures. No clear differences were observed between clozapine and olanzapine with regard to the incidence of metabolic effects and weight gain, which are some of the side effects olanzapine is closely associated with. However, the validity and application of the findings of this comparison is limited due to the fact that the attrition rate of participants in the included clinical trials was over 40%, which weakens the validity of the findings and limits their interpretation. Additionally, most trials were performed short term, which is not ideal to judge treatments in a chronic illness such as schizophrenia. The search for this review was carried out over 10 years ago and updating it could result in the inclusion of new studies and provide more robust and useful evidence.\n\n【24】It should be noted that this proposed Cochrane Review is a split and update of Asenjo 2010 , with the aim to create a family of Cochrane Reviews investigating the effects of clozapine that will populate a future overview of this topic area .\n\n【25】Table 1.

We will include trials that are only described as 'double‐blind' ‐ in which randomisation is implied in a Sensitivity analysis . We will exclude quasi‐randomised studies, such as those that allocate intervention by alternate days of the week.

Clozapine: oral formulation, any dose\n\n【38】##### 2\\. Olanzapine: oral formulation, any dose\n\n【39】Clozapine is available only for oral administration, olanzapine is available in both oral and injection form. Since, different routes of administration can affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of drugs our review will only include oral forms. Other Cochrane Reviews will assess the effects of the injection form of olanzapine .\n\n【40】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【41】We aim to divide all outcomes into short term (less than or equal to six months), medium term (seven to 12 months) and long term (over 12 months).\n\n【42】We will endeavour to report binary outcomes recording clinically meaningful degrees of change (e.g. global impression of much improved, or more than 50% improvement on a rating scale ‐ as defined within the trials) before any others. Thereafter, we will list other binary outcomes and then those that are continuous.\n\n【43】For continuous data, we will consider all relevant scales used by the trials, but only include useable data from valid scales .\n\n【44】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【45】###### 1\\.

These tables provide outcome‐specific information concerning the overall certainty of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes we rate as important to patient care and decision making. We aim to select the following main outcomes for inclusion in the 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n【74】1.  Global state: clinically important change (as defined by individual studies)\n\n【75】2.  Global state: relapse (as defined by the individual studies)\n\n【76】3.  Adverse effects/events: clinically important specific effects: metabolic\n\n【77】4.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To identify and appraise all the comparative studies evaluating the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly aged 65 years and over, irrespective of setting.  \nTo assess the effectiveness of vaccines on preventing influenza, influenza‐like illness, hospital admissions, complications and mortality in the elderly.  \nTo document the types and frequency of adverse effects associated with influenza vaccines in the elderly.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Influenza, commonly called 'flu', is an acute respiratory illness that affects the upper and/or lower parts of the respiratory tract and is caused by an influenza virus, usually of type A or B. The most common symptoms of uncomplicated influenza are an abrupt onset of fever, shivering, headache, muscle ache and a dry cough. The complications of influenza are mainly respiratory; in the elderly these include acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. These illnesses may require hospitalisation and can be life‐threatening especially in 'high‐risk' people, for example the elderly and people suffering from chronic heart disease.\n\n【6】The virus is efficiently transmitted between individuals through droplets of aerosols generated by coughs and sneezes. The virus in the aerosols subsequently infects cells in the lining of the breathing passages and viral replication occurs within four to six hours. Besides influenza viruses, other respiratory infections may cause influenza‐like illnesses. Infections with a rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus or parainfluenza virus may induce a disease that can be mistaken for influenza as they are frequently associated with similar symptoms.\n\n【7】The influenza virus is composed of a lipid envelope around a ribonucleic acid (RNA) core. On the envelope are two powerful antigens: neuraminidase (N antigen) and hemagglutinin (H antigen). Hemagglutinin is an enzyme that facilitates the entry of the virus into cells of the respiratory epithelium, while neuraminidase facilitates the release of newly produced viral particles from infected cells. The influenza virus has a marked propensity to mutate its external antigenic composition to escape the hosts' immune defences. Given this extreme mutability, a classification of viral subtype A based on H and N typing has been introduced. Additionally, strains are classified on the basis of antigenic type of the nucleoprotein core (A, B), geographical location of first isolation, strain serial number and year of isolation.\n\n【8】Pandemics are caused by so‐called antigenic shift (a major change in H configuration with or without a concomitant change in N and perhaps viral alteration of tissue tropism) leading to the appearance of a new subtype against which there is little circulating natural immunity. Minor changes in viral antigenic configurations, known as 'drift', cause local or more circumscribed epidemics.  \n\n【9】Influenza epidemics occur virtually every year, although the extent and severity of such epidemics vary widely. The most frequent, extensive and severe outbreaks are caused by the influenza A virus. Illness and death from influenza outbreaks continue to be substantial. In the interpandemic period, death occurs primarily in individuals with underlying diseases who have been characterised as being 'high risk' for complications of influenza. It is estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of people around the world get influenza each year. During major epidemics, the attack rate of influenza may be as high as 50%.\n\n【10】Influenza is an important public health problem in the industrialised world. It is associated with increased general practice consultation rates, hospital admissions  and excess deaths . It must also be considered in terms of increased days lost to absence from work and school, health care planning and influenza pandemic planning. The burden is unequally divided according to the type of populations affected, setting and viral circulation. In children and healthy adults the consequences of influenza are mainly productivity losses due to absenteeism by parents and affected persons . For the elderly in the community the burden is more likely to involve repeated primary healthcare contacts, hospital admissions and deaths . Probably due to high viral circulation and ease of spread, the elderly in institutions are thought to have the highest burden, with death and acute respiratory symptoms caused by influenza exacerbating chronic pathologies. The risk of complications (such as cardiac and respiratory diseases) is greatest in people aged 65 years or more and in individuals with underlying diseases. Death is also more frequent in the very old .  \n\n【11】Efforts to prevent or treat influenza have had their mainstay in two separate approaches: vaccines and antivirals (mainly amantadine, rimantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors). The effects of these antivirals are the topics of separate reviews. Current influenza vaccines are of three types:  \n(1) whole virion vaccines, which consist of complete viruses that have been 'killed' or inactivated, so that they are not infectious but retain their strain‐specific antigenic properties;  \n(2) subunit virion vaccines, which are made of surface antigens (H and N) only;  \n(3) split virion vaccines in which the viral structure is broken up by a disrupting agent. These vaccines contain both surface and internal antigens.  \nIn addition a variety of non‐European manufacturers produce live attenuated vaccines. Traditionally whole virion vaccines are thought to be the less well tolerated because of the presence of a lipid stratum on the surface of the viral particles (a remnant of the host cell membrane coating the virion when budding from the host cell). Influenza vaccines are produced world‐wide. A list of producers and products is currently available at the World Health Organization's (WHO) web site .\n\n【12】Periodic antigenic drifts and shifts pose problems for vaccine production and procurement. The WHO has established a worldwide surveillance system allowing identification and isolation of viral strains circulating in the different parts of the globe. Annually in February, the WHO recommends through a committee, the strains to be included in the vaccine for the forthcoming 'season', based on the circulating strain. Individual governments may or may not follow the WHO recommendations. Australia, New Zealand and more recently South Africa follow their own recommendations for vaccine content. Surveillance and early identification thus play a central part in the composition of the vaccine.\n\n【13】Traditionally, influenza vaccines have been targeted to the elderly and those at serious risk of complications. Despite clear theoretical advantages in the use of vaccines, their uptake has been patchy. The current low level of influenza vaccine uptake in targeted populations may reflect uncertainty regarding vaccine effectiveness on the part of primary care and public health practitioners and health policy decision makers.  \n\n【14】Efforts to prevent the yearly spread of influenza have had muted success. Vaccines are the mainstay of prevention and up to now immunisation campaigns and coverage have concentrated on those aged 65 years or over. Recently, however, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended the immunisation of children  and the Centers for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is considering the introduction of routine childhood immunisation . The Canadian regions of Ontario and Yukon have undertaken mass immunisation (B Duvall, personal communication). In a non‐pandemic situation, given the availability of vaccines the choice of preventive strategy appears to lie in immunisation of selected population categories (i.e. the elderly, people with chronic pathologies, healthcare workers), or of the whole population. In a pandemic year the choice may lie in multiple interventions, with vaccines and antivirals providing the mainstay of interventions.\n\n【15】Rational decision making in the prevention of influenza is complicated by the absence of reliable forecasts of impact of the virus and uncertainties about the effects of the vaccines in different age groups. The only recent systematic review of the effects of influenza vaccines in healthy adults has confirmed the precision of the WHO strain‐matching vaccine manufacturing process and a marked difference between the efficacy (ability to prevent influenza) and effectiveness (ability to prevent influenza‐like‐illness) of the vaccines .\n\n【16】There are Cochrane reviews assessing the effects of influenza vaccines in people affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , and cystic fibrosis . No Cochrane review assessing the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly population (institutionalised and in the community) is available. Presently there are only two non‐Cochrane systematic reviews of the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly. Gross 1995 is now nearly a decade old. Its conclusions may be affected by the lack of inclusion of recent evidence. Vu 2002 shows several methodological weaknesses which are likely to undermine the authors' conclusion (for example the exclusion of studies with denominators smaller than 30 and quantitative pooling of studies of different design).\n\n【17】An accurate assessment of the effects (efficacy, effectiveness and safety profile) of influenza vaccines is essential to allow rational choice between alternative strategies.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To identify and appraise all the comparative studies evaluating the effects of influenza vaccines in the elderly aged 65 years and over, irrespective of setting.  \nTo assess the effectiveness of vaccines on preventing influenza, influenza‐like illness, hospital admissions, complications and mortality in the elderly.  \nTo document the types and frequency of adverse effects associated with influenza vaccines in the elderly.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】We will consider randomised, quasi‐randomised, cohort and case‐control studies.

The main outcome measure was an estimate of the impact of trials from the grey literature on the pooled effect estimates of the meta‐analyses.

All five studies showed that published trials showed an overall greater treatment effect than grey trials. This difference was statistically significant in one of the five studies. Data could be combined for three of the five studies. This showed that, on average, published trials showed a 9% greater treatment effect than grey trials (ratio of odds ratios for grey versus published trials 1.09; 95% CI 1.03‐1.16). Overall there were more published trials included in the meta‐analyses than grey trials (median 224 (IQR 108‐365) versus 45(IQR 40‐102)). Published trials had more participants on average. The most common types of grey literature were abstracts (55%) and unpublished data (30%).

They showed that trials found in the published literature tend to be larger and show larger effects of a health care intervention than those trials found in the grey literature. There was limited evidence to show whether grey trials are of poorer methodological quality than published trials. This means that those carrying out systematic reviews need to search for trials in both the published and grey literature in order to help minimise the effects of publication bias in their review.\n\n【18】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of _Helicobacter pylori_ ( _H. pylori_ ) eradication on iron deficiency, using data from randomized controlled trials.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】_Helicobacter pylori_ ( _H. pylori_ ) is a spiral Gram‐negative bacterium that is known to be an etiological agent of several gastric and other diseases. Infection with _H.pylori_ is estimated to affect more than 50% of all humankind . Infection with _H. pylori_ is typically acquired early in life, and once acquired becomes a lifelong infection. Infection by _H. pylori_ is a major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric malignancy. Ford 2006 reported in their Cochrane review that antibiotics for _H. pylori_ confer a significant benefit in preventing the recurrence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers. Many reports have demonstrated that _H. pylori_ plays an important role in gastric malignancy, with the result that in 1994 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) categorized infection with _H. pylori_ as a definite group I carcinogen. _H. pylori_ is the only bacterium known to cause gastric cancer . To assess the effect of eradication of _H. pylori_ for the reduction of gastric cancer development, a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted. In a general‐population study in China, the effect was not significant, apart from a reduction in gastric cancer development in a subgroup analysis of participants without precancerous lesions in the stomach . In another trial, among participants who had curative endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of early gastric cancer, eradication significantly reduced the incidence of metachronous gastric cancer development . Eradication therapy is therefore generally recommended in people infected with _H. pylori_ .\n\n【7】Extra‐digestive disorders associated with infection with _H. pylori_ have also been reported, such as urticaria, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, growth retardation, and iron deficiency anemia. Although the relationship between _H. pylori_ infection and some of these diseases is still under discussion, there is some evidence for an association with idiopathic thrombocytopenia and iron deficiency . Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional deficiency in the world, affecting two billion people . Many people with a hemoglobin level below 5.0 g/dl suffer from adverse effects associated with iron deficiency, with symptoms such as general fatigue, headache, dizziness or lightheadedness and appetite loss. Iron deficiency has a negative impact in children, increasing the risk of infectious diseases and disorders of cognitive function. Iron deficiency also impacts upon pregnant women, contributing to about 40% of maternal deaths in developing countries .\n\n【8】An association between infection with _H. pylori_ and iron deficiency has been reported by some cross‐sectional epidemiological studies. Cardenas 2006 reported that _H. pylori_ infection was linked to an increase in the prevalence of iron deficiency in a large sample of the US population in a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1999 to 2000. National health surveys in Denmark, South Korea, and Germany between 1998 and 2003 provide similar findings . Milman 1998 reported in a large epidemiologic observational study conducted in Denmark that 2.2% of men, 22.1% of premenopausal and 6.5% of post‐menopausal women with _H. pylori_ infection had iron deficiency (serum ferritin < 12 μg/L), compared with 1.0% of men, 17.5 % of premenopausal and 2.3% of post‐menopausal women without infection being iron‐deficient. Additionally, in the late 1990s several reports suggested the efficacy of _H. pylori_ eradication for refractory iron deficiency anemia among children and adolescents. Pra 2009 reported in their review a positive link between iron deficiency and gastrointestinal cancer. Further investigation is warranted into the possibility that not only gastritis but also iron deficiency induced by _H. pylori_ infection accelerate the increased rate of gastric cancer development.\n\n【9】See Glossary  for definitions of topic‐specific terminology.\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Iron supplementation is the standard therapy for iron deficiency and for iron deficiency anemia. However, despite routine iron supplementation a number of people, especially children and adolescents, have refractory iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【12】In 1993, a possible association between _H. pylori_ ‐induced antral gastritis and iron‐deficiency anemia was reported for the first time in a person with no evidence of hemorrhage who was refractory to iron supplementation . Thereafter, many case reports suggested a link between infection with _H. pylori_ and iron deficiency. Choe 1999 conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled therapeutic trial in 43 pre‐adolescent children or adolescents with iron‐deficiency anemia. They reported that groups receiving eradication therapy showed a significant increase in hemoglobin levels, compared with a group without eradication therapy, at eight weeks after therapy . Since then, some trials for eradicating _H. pylori_ to improve iron deficiency have been conducted, and an association between eradication of _H. pylori_ and improvement in iron‐deficiency anemia has been reported.\n\n【13】Triple‐therapy regimens, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) combined with two antibiotics (amoxicillin and clarithromycin or 5‐nitroimidazole) aimed at eradicating _H. pylori_ are the most commonly‐used standard eradication therapy. The duration of treatment is usually at least one week or sometimes two weeks. Sequential triple or quadruple therapy, consisting of PPI/bismuth plus amoxicillin followed by PPI plus a macrolide or 5‐nitroimidazole or both, is also used . In this review we aim to examine these eradication therapies with and without iron supplementation as intervention arms.\n\n【14】There are some known adverse events associated with eradication therapy . The main adverse drug reactions are diarrhea and dyspepsia. Additionally, the decrease in eradication rates associated with an increase in antimicrobial resistance has become problematic, so we plan to assess the decreased rate of eradication therapy through subgroup analysis.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Although the mechanism responsible for the alteration in body stores of iron in response to infection with _H. pylori_ is not clear, several pathways working in combination may be involved. The first hypothesis is that infection with _H. pylori_ changes the physiology of the stomach and decreases the absorption of dietary iron . Infection with _H. pylori_ causes chronic gastritis. Optimal iron absorption requires intact gastric mucosa, so _H. pylori‐_ induced gastritis might result in a reduction in iron uptake from the gastrointestinal tract . Futhermore, infection with _H. pylori_ causes hypochlorhydria and decreases the ascorbic acid content of the gastric juices. Both of these changes decrease non‐heme iron absorption. It is also reported that those who are infected with _H. pylori_ are likely to take antacids, which induce high pH in the stomach . The second hypothesis involves the sequestration of iron in antral infections with _H. pylori_ , since iron is an essential nutrient for the survival of the bacterium . Siderophores produced by _H. pylori_ have high affinity for heme iron. Iron in the stomach may be bound by these siderophores and become unavailable for uptake. Chronic infection has a large influence on the body's iron store, partly because a reduction in stored iron is the first step of immune‐response to bacterial infection . This might explain why _H. pylori_ can sense iron concentrations and uses them as an important signal to activate virulence mechanisms. In addition, a few recent papers show that iron deficiency can modulate _H. pylori_ virulence and influence gastric cancer risk .\n\n【17】The final hypothesis is that the specific genotype of the virulence factor of the organism for iron acquisition may play some role in iron deficiency in individuals infected with _H. pylori_ . The elimination of _H. pylori_ might therefore increase body stores of iron.\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】The major aim of this review is to consider evidence for or against the influence of _H. pylori_ eradication on iron stores in people with and without iron‐deficiency anemia. As previously mentioned, Choe 1999 reported evidence suggesting that _H. pylori_ eradication plays a role in the improvement of iron deficiencies. Muhsen 2008 reported the results of a systematic review of case series, epidemiological studies, and interventional studies including three RCTs from published articles, in which evidence suggesting a role for infection with _H. pylori_ in the pathogenesis of iron deficiency was found to be statistically significant. On the other hand, there are reports indicating that _H. pylori_ eradication is not effective. Qu 2010 , in a meta‐analysis of five RCTs, reported that the relationship between _H. pylori_ eradication and an improvement in iron deficiency was not significant. The role of _H. pylori_ eradication in the treatment of iron deficiency therefore remains so far unresolved. Because several RCTs have been reported since the latest systematic review of the role of _H. pylori_ eradication in iron metabolism, we are conducting this systematic review of the topic, and will include the latest RCTs as well as other unpublished studies.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of _Helicobacter pylori_ ( _H. pylori_ ) eradication on iron deficiency, using data from randomized controlled trials.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】Randomized trials (including cluster‐randomized), irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language are eligible for consideration. For trials with a cross‐over design, we will consider only the results for the first randomization period. We will exclude trials in which the participants were allocated using a quasi‐random method.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】Adults and children who have either been referred, who self‐referred, or were recruited from the general population and who are _H.pylori_ ‐positive, assessed by at least two positive tests, histology and one of following tests; culture, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Urea Breath Test (UBT) or _Helicobacter Pylori_ Stool Antigen (HPSA). However, since in this systematic review the aim of the studies is not to evaluate the eradication rate, _H. pylori_ status can be assessed by a single test, UBT or HpSA .\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】The drug intervention regimens should consist of one of the following, with or without iron supplements, and with a dosing duration of at least one week:\n\n【30】**Intervention regimens**\n\n【31】1.

Placebo for iron supplementation and placebo for eradication\n\n【46】We will use placebo/no medication matched with eradication therapy, or placebo/no medication added to iron supplementation matched with eradication therapy added to iron supplementation as comparators.\n\n【47】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【48】We will extract data for the three primary outcomes and the first two secondary outcomes at 16 weeks after the end of the eradication therapy. If the 16‐week data are not available, we will extract data at the time nearest to 16 weeks, within the interval between 8 and 24 weeks after the end of the eradication therapy. We will seek data for the third secondary outcome (incidence of gastric cancer development) at the longest available follow‐up.\n\n【49】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【50】1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise therapy aimed at reducing knee pain and improving knee function for people with patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common problem among adolescents and young adults. Its incidence varies from 22 new cases per 1000 persons/year in highly active populations to five to six new cases per 1000 in general practice . PFPS is characterised by retropatellar pain (behind the kneecap) or peripatellar pain (around the kneecap), mostly occurring when load is put on the knee extensor mechanism such as when climbing stairs, squatting, running, cycling or sitting with flexed knees.\n\n【7】Several factors have been implicated in the etiology of PFPS. These include local factors (contribution of patellofemoral joint mechanics and surrounding tissues to patellofemoral pain), distal factors (contribution of foot and ankle mechanics) and proximal factors (contribution of hip, pelvis and trunk mechanics) . However, the etiology of the condition is still unclear, as is the origin of the pain.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】The majority of people with PFPS are treated conservatively (non‐surgically). Physically‐based conservative interventions include knee orthoses, foot orthoses , patellar taping  and exercise therapy.\n\n【10】Most exercise therapy programmes for PFPS have focused on strengthening the quadriceps muscles, which was seen as the most promising conservative treatment method for patellofemoral pain syndrome . More recently, studies have focused on the hip muscles as a possible origin of patellofemoral pain .\n\n【11】Exercise therapy comprises a broad range of possible variations and accompanying terms. Activity of the quadriceps muscles ‐ and other muscles involved in knee function ‐ can either be concentric, eccentric or isotonic. During concentric activities the muscles shorten, whereas during eccentric activities muscles lengthen in an actively controlled manner. During isotonic activity the muscle tension remains the same. Exercises can either be static/isometric or dynamic. Exercises are referred to as static/isometric if the position of the knee does not change. If the position of the knee does change, the exercise is called dynamic. In cases where the lower leg moves at a predetermined, constant speed which requires an isokinetic dynamometer to control the velocity, the dynamic exercise is also called isokinetic. Exercises where the foot is in contact with a fixed surface are referred to 'closed kinetic chain exercises', as opposed to 'open kinetic chain' exercises where the surface is not fixed.\n\n【12】Hence, exercises can be described in three dimensions: the type of muscle activity (concentric, eccentric, isotonic), joint movement (dynamic versus no movement: isometric or static) and the presence of reaction forces caused by contact of the foot with a fixed surface (closed versus open kinetic chain) . Combinations of the above denominations apply to every type of exercise, and the terminology used for exercise programmes reflects the emphasis intended by the therapist or researcher.\n\n【13】Besides strengthening of the quadriceps muscle, many exercises will also result in the coordination of muscle contraction. Emphasis during exercise therapy may be put on the coordinated contraction of the medial and lateral parts of the quadriceps muscle, and also on the coordinated contraction of hip adductor, hip abductor and gluteal muscles . Electromyographic biofeedback visualises specific muscle contractions and may help the patient target the required muscle during exercise.\n\n【14】In addition, there are other differences such as in the delivery of exercise, for example supervised exercise versus home exercise; or in the duration or intensity of exercise.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】A recent published review on factors associated with PFPS concluded that patients with PFPS have lower knee extension strength, lower hip extension strength and decreased flexibility of the lower extremity muscles compared with people without PFPS . Exercise programmes that comprise static and dynamic muscular exercises for both quadriceps and hip muscles are aimed to improve the strength of these muscles and consequently reduce the pain. Furthermore, many exercise programmes also focus on improving the flexibility of the lower extremity by adding stretching exercises.\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common problem among adolescents and young adults. Its etiology, including the structures causing the pain, and treatment methods are all debated in literature, but consensus has not been reached so far. Exercise therapy to strengthen the quadriceps is often prescribed, though its efficacy is still debated. This updates and supercedes a former Cochrane review .\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise therapy aimed at reducing knee pain and improving knee function for people with patellofemoral pain syndrome.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomised and quasi‐randomised (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random: e.g. by hospital number) controlled clinical trials which evaluate exercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome will be included.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Adolescents and adults with patellofemoral pain syndrome (designated by the trial author(s) as such or as 'anterior knee pain syndrome', 'patellar dysfunction', 'chondromalacia patellae' or 'chondropathy').\n\n【27】Studies focusing on other named knee pathologies such as Hoffa's syndrome, Osgood Schlatter syndrome, Sinding‐Larsen‐Johansson syndrome, iliotibial band friction syndrome, tendinitis, neuromas, intra‐articular pathology including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic injuries (such as injured ligaments, meniscal tears, patellar fractures and patellar luxation), plica syndromes, and more rarely occurring pathologies, will be excluded .\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】We will include studies evaluating exercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome. Exercises can be applied on their own or in combination with other non‐surgical interventions, provided the same other intervention is applied to the whole population in the comparison. Exercises can be performed at home or under supervision of a therapist.\n\n【30】##### Comparisons:\n\n【31】1.  Exercise therapy versus control (no treatment, placebo or waiting list controls). This also includes 'exercise therapy + another intervention (e.g. taping) versus the other intervention alone (e.g. taping)'.\n\n【32】2.  Exercise therapy versus different conservative interventions (e.g. taping).\n\n【33】3.  Comparisons of different exercises\n\n【34】*   1.  Delivery of exercises or exercise programmes (e.g. supervised versus home exercise; group versus individual supervision).\n\n【35】    2.  Medium of exercises or exercise programmes (water versus land based exercise).\n\n【36】    3.  Types of exercise (e.g. closed versus open kinetic chain exercises; dynamic versus isometric).\n\n【37】    4.  Target of exercise (strengthening of hip or abdominal muscles versus quadriceps muscles)\n\n【38】    5.  Duration of exercises or exercise programmes (e.g. long duration (more than three months) versus shorter duration (less than three months)).\n\n【39】    6.  Intensity of exercises or exercise programmes (e.g. high intensity (several times per week) versus low intensity (once weekly)).\n\n【40】The intervention groups for comparisons of different exercises will be defined as the most novel intervention (and first listed) of the two exercises being compared. For instance, the intervention is supervised exercise and the control is home exercise in the first comparison of 3a. Consideration will also be given to consistency in the choice of control groups.\n\n【41】Combined interventions or treatment packages including exercise will not be tested in this review, with the exception of exercises provided with instructions or advice, where exercise is the predominant intervention.\n\n【42】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【43】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【44】1.  Knee pain measured by validated self reporting methods (Visual Analog Scale \\[VAS\\], numerical rating scale \\[NRS\\] of McGill Pain questionnaire) . Pain scores are reported for pain in daily life (usual pain), for worst pain and for pain at activities (e.g. sports) if available .\n\n【45】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【46】1.  Functional ability (i.e. knee function in activities of daily living). Questionnaires focusing on knee function (such as Functional Index Questionnaire , WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index , Kujala Patellofemoral Function Scale  and Lysholm scale ).\n\n【47】2.  Functional performance tests (squatting, hopping on one leg, etc) .\n\n【48】3.  Subjective perception of recovery. Recovery from patellofemoral pain syndrome is a outcome measure inconsistently reported in studies and different methods are used to describe recovery. In this review, 'number of patients no longer troubled by symptoms' or 'perceived recovery' measured on a Likert scale will be included as a secondary outcome measure .\n\n【49】4.  Adverse events (e.g. knee swelling or substantially increasing pain levels as a direct effect of treatment).\n\n【50】Changes in knee function measured on impairment level only (e.g. range of motion, muscle strength) do not directly represent changes in the symptoms of patellofemoral pain or the resulting disability, and will therefore not be considered clinically relevant outcome measures in this review .\n\n【51】###### Timing of outcome measurement\n\n【52】Outcomes measured within three months after the baseline measurement will be considered short term outcomes of exercise therapy, and measurements from three months and longer will be considered long term outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Most types of cardiac surgery are performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Cardiac surgery performed with CPB is associated with morbidities. CPB needs an extracorporeal circulation that replaces the heart and lungs, and performs circulation, ventilation, and oxygenation of the blood. The lower limit of mean blood pressure to maintain blood flow to vital organs increases in people with chronic hypertension. Because people undergoing cardiac surgery commonly have chronic hypertension, we hypothesised that maintaining a relatively high blood pressure improves desirable outcomes among the people undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To evaluate the benefits and harms of higher versus lower blood pressure targets during cardiac surgery with CPB.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search of databases was November 2021 and trials registries in January 2020.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a higher blood pressure target (mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg or greater) with a lower blood pressure target (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg) in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were 1. acute kidney injury, 2. cognitive deterioration, and 3. all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 4. quality of life, 5. acute ischaemic stroke, 6. haemorrhagic stroke, 7. length of hospital stay, 8. renal replacement therapy, 9. delirium, 10. perioperative transfusion of blood products, and 11. perioperative myocardial infarction. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included three RCTs with 737 people compared a higher blood pressure target with a lower blood pressure target during cardiac surgery with CPB. A high blood pressure target may result in little to no difference in acute kidney injury (risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 2.08; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐certainty evidence), cognitive deterioration (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 389 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and all‐cause mortality (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.90; I² = 49%; 3 studies, 737 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No study reported haemorrhagic stroke. Although a high blood pressure target may increase the length of hospital stay slightly, we found no differences between a higher and a lower blood pressure target for the other secondary outcomes.\n\n【12】We also identified one ongoing RCT which is comparing a higher versus a lower blood pressure target among the people who undergo cardiac surgery with CPB.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】A high blood pressure target may result in little to no difference in patient outcomes including acute kidney injury and mortality. Given the wide CIs, further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of a higher blood pressure target among those who undergo cardiac surgery with CPB.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Cardiac Surgery\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Blood pressure measurement\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】*   Blood pressure measurement\n\n【21】###### Outcom\n\n【22】*   All Cause Mortality\n*   Acute Nontraumatic Kidney Injury\n*   Impaired Cognition\n\n【23】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【24】### Blood pressure targets for people undergoing heart surgery\n\n【25】**Review question**\n\n【26】What effect does a high blood pressure target compared with a low blood pressure target have in people undergoing heart surgery while on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\n\n【27】**Key messages**\n\n【28】A high blood pressure target compared with a lower target may result in little to no difference in kidney injury, cognition (ability to learn and understand) damage, or survival.\n\n【29】A high blood pressure target may increase the length of hospital stay slightly.\n\n【30】**What is heart surgery?**\n\n【31】Heart surgery is a common type of surgery throughout the world. Most types of heart surgery are performed with CPB. CPB is a medical device that replaces the work of the heart and lungs by pumping the blood, and taking oxygen into and removing carbon dioxide from the blood. People undergoing heart surgery usually have high blood pressure (called hypertension). People with hypertension need a higher blood pressure to keep the blood flow to important organs such as the brain and kidneys. However, the evidence about the best blood pressure targets to use during heart surgery is scarce.\n\n【32】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【33】We wanted to assess the effects of a higher blood pressure target compared with a lower blood pressure target on the kidneys, brain, quality of life, and complications occurring while in hospital.\n\n【34】**What did we do?**\n\n【35】We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing high versus low blood pressure targets during heart surgery while on CPB.\n\n【36】**What did we find?**\n\n【37】We found three studies including 737 people undergoing heart surgery. The duration of the studies varied from two to three years. The average age of included participants ranged between 65.8 and 76 years and about 72% were men.\n\n【38】There was little to no difference between a high and low blood pressure target in injury to the kidneys, cognition damage, or deaths. Although a high blood pressure target may increase the length of hospital stay slightly, there may be little to no differences in quality of life or complications during hospitalisation.\n\n【39】**What are the limitations of the evidence**\n\n【40】Our confidence in the evidence for kidney injury and death was very limited as the studies were small, did not provide data about everything that we were interested in, and included different types of people. We are also less confident in the evidence for cognition damage as the studies were small and did not provide data about everything that we were interested in.\n\n【41】**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n【42】The evidence is current to November 2021.\n\n【43】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted eletrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Faecal incontinence is a socially embarrassing and physically disabling condition. It may be defined as the uncontrolled loss of faeces (liquid or solid) from the bowel. It may occur passively (without the person affected being aware of passing faeces) or be preceded by urgency ‐ a sense of an urgent need to defaecate. Faecal incontinence may result from damage to the anal sphincter mechanism (either from direct trauma or damage to its nerve supply), idiopathic degeneration of the sphincter, spinal injury or other neurological causes.\n\n【6】Those affected usually resort to containment using absorbent pads or anal plugs but these are often unsatisfactory. Clinical treatment is conservative in the first instance, including dietary advice, antidiarrhoeal medication and physical and behavioural therapy, for example pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback . A proportion of patients will remain resistant to these forms of treatment. With up to 10% of the adult population being affected by some degree of faecal incontinence a considerable number of people potentially require further treatment .\n\n【7】Surgical intervention has been the next step in the management of these patients. For external anal sphincter defects, overlapping sphincter repair may be undertaken. Early results show good symptomatic relief, but tend to deteriorate with time . Dynamic graciloplasty and artificial bowel sphincter implants may be attempted to improve continence, but require major surgery and have high morbidity and failure rates . Permanent stoma (colostomy or ileostomy) is another surgical option.\n\n【8】For people who do not respond to conservative treatments, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a minimally invasive technique that should avoid the risks and morbidity associated with other types of surgery but might carry other risks. It allows modulation of the nerves and muscles of the pelvic floor and hindgut with potential beneficial effects, although the mechanism of its action is unclear.\n\n【9】SNS involves applying a low amplitude electrical current to a sacral nerve via an electrode placed through its corresponding sacral foramen. SNS has the advantage that it is possible to test each patient, over a two to three week period, with a percutaneous electrode attached to an external stimulator. If a significant benefit is achieved, implantation of the definitive implanted pulse generator (IPG) can then be carried out. Furthermore, the device can be removed if necessary, for example if complications occur. SNS using low amplitude electrical current for the treatment of faecal incontinence is a recent, innovative technique and a systematic review is needed to summarise the available evidence on its effects.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted eletrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】Randomised or quasi randomised trials.\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】Adults with faecal incontinence.\n\n【18】If the evidence allows, we will undertake sub‐group analysis on the following categories of patients.  \n(1) Patients with faecal urgency.  \n(2) Patients with structural defects of the anal sphincter.  \n(3) Patients with partial spinal cord injury.  \n(4) Patients with central neurological disease.\n\n【19】#### Types of interventions\n\n【20】One arm of the study must use a surgically implanted device to provide sacral nerve stimulation.\n\n【21】Comparators will include mock, sham or placebo treatment and any alternative intervention considered appropriate by the trialists, such as dynamic graciloplasty, artificial bowel sphincter implants, colostomy, absorbent pads, anal plugs and physical or behavioural therapies.\n\n【22】Magnetic and transcutaneous stimulation will not be considered.\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】The primary outcomes for the review are (a) cure or improvement of incontinence and (b) quality of life. Outcomes will be considered in the following six categories.  \n(1) Faecal incontinence (number cured or improved, episodes of faecal incontinence, urgency, ability to defer defaecation, use of pads, use of anal plugs, incontinence score, and need for further treatment such as medication or surgery).  \n(2) Quality of life (generic and condition‐specific).  \n(3) Surrogate measures, such as anorectal manometry (resting pressure, maximum squeeze pressure, rectal sensory threshold to balloon distention, sensation of urgency to balloon distention and maximum tolerated rectal volume to balloon distention).  \n(4) Adverse effects (infection and/or pain at the implantation site, displacement of the electrodes, technical failure requiring removal and/or change in urinary function).  \n(5) Health economics (costs, resource implications and cost‐effectiveness or cost utility evaluation).  \n(6) Other outcomes (other outcome measures quoted by authors and judged to be important by the reviewers).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables amongst children aged five years and under.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with micronutrient deficiencies and a range of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease . Globally, 1.8% of the total burden of disease, and over 2.5 million deaths each year are attributable to inadequate fruit and vegetable intake . Consumption of at least 400 grams per day of fruit and vegetables is recommended to reduce the risk of chronic diseases . Nationally representative surveys, however, indicate that throughout most regions of the globe, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables is well below such recommendations .\n\n【7】Population surveys of children indicate the need to increase the intake of fruits and vegetables . For example, less than a third of school aged children from European nations report daily consumption of vegetables . While the mean intake of fruit and vegetables is below the WHO recommendations across all WHO regions, South American, African, and South East Asian nations report the lowest quantities of child fruit and vegetable consumption .\n\n【8】Longitudinal studies suggest that eating behaviours established in childhood are likely to persist into adulthood . Encouraging healthy eating among children may therefore represent a particularly effective primary prevention strategy for reducing the risk of chronic diseases . In addition, adequate fruit and vegetable intake during childhood may have a number of immediate beneficial impacts, including reducing the risk of excessive weight gain  and a number of respiratory illnesses .\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】The etiology of fruit and vegetable consumption is complex, involving the dynamic interaction of a variety of factors. Given such complexity, a number of frameworks have been utilised to guide the development of interventions to increase fruit and vegetable intake . The conceptual framework developed for the international Pro Children Project suggests that interventions targeting a variety of cultural, physical and social environment factors, as well as those targeting personal factors may be effective in positively influencing fruit and vegetable intake among children .\n\n【11】Despite the range of potential intervention targets, previous trials have tended to focus on those determinants more amenable to intervention, such as nutrition knowledge and skills, or the food environment of settings such as schools . Among school aged children, systematic reviews suggest that the strongest evidence exists for the efficacy of interventions specifically targeting fruit and vegetable consumption rather than broader healthy eating interventions, multicomponent school based interventions, and interventions incorporating a parent or family element . While similar strategies would be hypothesised to be effective for preschool aged children, previous systematic reviews have not focused on the efficacy of interventions targeting children of this age .\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】A number of theories have been used to explain a mechanism by which interventions may be able to influence fruit and vegetable consumption of children . In most instances, psychosocial theories such as Social Cognitive Theory , the Theory of Planned Behaviour , and the Stages of Change Trans‐theoretical Model  have been used to explain possible causal pathways to fruit and vegetable consumption . Collectively, such theories assert that changes to attitudes, knowledge and skills and perceived norms and expectancies are required for behavioural change. The international Pro Children Project incorporated Social‐Ecological Theory in its conceptual theoretical framework of determinants of children's fruit and vegetable consumption . Interventions derived from Social‐Ecological Theory recognise the importance of more structural influences on fruit and vegetable consumption of children, for example, the availability or accessibility of fruit and vegetables in the home or at settings such as schools which children frequent.\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Previous reviews have identified a number of determinants of fruit and vegetable consumption among children . While such reviews provide important information for the development of interventions, only systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials are able to determine the efficacy of strategies to increase child fruit and vegetable consumption. A number of such reviews have been published , however, few of these reviews included trials of preschool aged children, and most lacked important information relevant to practice such as the effectiveness of interventions for various subpopulations (such as minority groups), the cost effectiveness of interventions, or the presence of any unintended adverse effects of the intervention. A comprehensive systematic review on this issue is therefore required to provide guidance for practitioners and policy makers interested in implementing strategies to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables in early childhood.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To assess the effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and associated adverse events of interventions designed to increase the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables amongst children aged five years and under.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised controlled trials, will be included that:\n\n【22】1\\. compare two or more alternative intervention programmes to increase the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables of children aged five years and under; or\n\n【23】2\\. compare an intervention programme to increase the consumption of fruit and/or vegetables of children aged five years and under with a standard care or no intervention control group.\n\n【24】Randomised trials must explicitly state fruit or vegetable intake as a primary or secondary outcome of the trial outcome.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Participants may include:\n\n【27】1\\.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing burn wound infections.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The _International Society for Burn Injuries_ (ISBI) define a burn as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue caused by thermal trauma . A skin burn is the destruction of some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burns) or a flame (flame burns). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered to be burns .\n\n【7】Burn injuries are a major source of morbidity and mortality; they represent a public health problem and a significant burden to the health care system . More than 300,000 people die each year from fire‐related burns, most of them occurring in low and middle‐income countries .  However, burns also represent one of the main causes of injury‐related death in some high‐income countries, such as  the USA and some European countries .  Millions of people suffer permanent disability and disfigurement, which is often stigmatizing; it is estimated that 10 million disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs) are lost each year at a worldwide level . Burns create a heavy economic burden for health services. Treatment costs depend on the type and seriousness of the burn, as well as associated costs such as hospitalization, the need for long‐term rehabilitation, the loss of schooling, future unemployment, and social rejection. In spite of this there are actually very few studies that provide evidence of the magnitude and cost of a burn .\n\n【8】It can be difficult to decide whether a burn wound is infected . Firstly the inflammation resulting from the injury can mimic infection. Secondly the interpretation of surface cultures is often difficult due to the extensive microbial colonisation of the wound , microorganisms coming from the patient skin or from external sources can rapidly colonize the burn wound .\n\n【9】The nature and extent of the burn wound, together with the type and amount of colonizing microorganisms can influence the risk of invasive infection. The spectrum of infective agents that can be present in the burn wounds varies. Nowadays, gram‐positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ , and gram‐negative bacteria such as _Pseudomona aeruginosa_ are the predominant pathogens, however, other microorganisms can be implicated, such as fungi, rickettsias and viruses . It should also be noted that multidrug resistant microorganisms, such as methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), have become frequent pathogens identified as present in the burned person .\n\n【10】Burn wound infection is a serious problem: it can delay wound healing, can increase the scarring and can favour the proliferation of microorganisms that may result in invasive infections . Nowadays, after the initial resuscitation of people who have been burned, up to 75% of all deaths are a consequence of infection, rather than osmotic shock and hypovolemia (decreased volume of blood plasma) . Common invasive infections in the burned patient are pulmonary infections, urinary tract infection, bacteraemia and sepsis .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Preventing an infection of the burn wound is a team approach that should be an early focus of the care of the burned patient; with particular consideration given to infection‐control practices and long‐term rehabilitative care .\n\n【13】Various interventions exist for preventing infections of the burn wound: early removal of full‐thickness burned tissue (debridement); early definitive wound closure; strict enforcement of infection‐control procedures (hand washing, use of personal protective equipment ‐ i.e. gown, gloves, and masks); and the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis . There is a wide variety of topical antimicrobial agents available for use as prophylaxis for burn wound infections, such as silver nitrate or silver sulfadiazine . Moreover, topical antimicrobials have been used together with systemic antibiotics to prevent and treat infection. There are different antibiotics, and different routes of administration that have been evaluated for the prevention of systemic infection in patients with burn wounds, for example ‐ cephalothin or trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole , but in spite of this there is scarce evidence to support the use of systemic antibiotics for the prevention of complications due to infection in burn patients . In contrast, it has been shown that selective intestinal decontamination with antibiotics like polymyxin E, tobramycin and amphotericin B decreases bacterial colonization of the wound and the incidence of septic complications in burn patients .\n\n【14】This review will focus on the evidence for efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis (oral (PO), intravenous (IV) or topical antimicrobials) for preventing burn wound infections.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Improvements in recovery for seriously burned patients have been attributed to medical advances in wound care and infection control practices . Clinical management of these lesions remains complicated due to the diversity of intervening factors. Burn wounds are highly susceptible to infection due to the loss of skin integrity and the reduction of immunity mediated by the cells. Once the physical barrier of the skin has been compromised, a potential for the invasion of microbes into the body has been created . An avascular necrotic tissue (eschar) will replace the skin and will be eventually colonized with microorganisms . The proliferation of microorganisms in the burn wound may be followed by tissue invasion, giving rise to burn wound infection and invasive infections. Moreover, burn injury has a severe impact on the host’s immune system, resulting in a general impairment of the host defences .\n\n【17】Before the wide adoption of early excision and closure of deep wounds, infection was a frequent occurrence in the burn wound . However, nowadays, the early excision of eschar and avascular tissues improves the perfusion of the burnt tissues, and allows any systemic antibiotics to reach adequate therapeutic levels in the burn wound . However, in spite of the fact that local infection such as sepsis is now less frequent, infection in the burn patient continues to be a serious threat .\n\n【18】Considering these facts, antibiotic prophylaxis may be useful for protecting the burned person against wound infection and invasive infections.\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】The use of prophylactic antibiotics has been considered useful to prevent and treat infections in the burned person . In some centres, patients with a positive microbiological culture from a burn site were given systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in an attempt to prevent wound infection and sepsis . However, this is now controversial . There is a paucity of high quality research evidence to determine the effectiveness and cost‐efficiency of antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing burn wound infection . Moreover, the use of prophylactic antibiotics may not be safe: it may increase the risk of diarrhoea due to overgrowth of toxigenic strains of _Clostridium difficile_ and other secondary infections, allergic reactions to the drug or bone marrow suppression . Finally, it may also promote the emergence of resistant strains of micro‐organisms, making the treatment of infections even more difficult .\n\n【21】There is considerable debate concerning the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of the burn wound infection and therefore a systematic review of the evidence is warranted.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing burn wound infections.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, with allocation to interventions at the individual (Patient‐RCT) or at the group level (Cluster‐RCT), testing the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of burn wound infections. Quasi‐randomised studies will be excluded.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】Studies involving people of any age or gender, with any type of burn injury to the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissues, vessels, nerve, tendons, or bone admitted to any unit in the hospital setting or treated in an outpatient setting.\n\n【30】We will include studies regardless of the severity of the burn (determined by either clinical evaluation or objective assessment, or both) or the method of burn injury (e.g., chemical, scald, or flame burns). We will not exclude studies depending on the presence of inhalation injury as a co‐morbidity. We will exclude studies that include mixed population, i.e. people with already infected wounds in addition to those without an infection unless the data can be presented separately.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will assess antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo, no treatment, usual care or an alternative intervention (for example: non pharmacological ‐ isolation of the burn patient, surgical excision; or pharmacological, such as another antibiotic regimen (trials comparing different antibiotics or different antibiotic dosages, routes of administration, timings or duration of administration)).\n\n【33】Prophylaxis is defined as the administration of antibiotics to patients without a documented infection, regardless of the signs of systemic inflammation, with the intention of preventing infection in the wound and invasive infection, including systemic antibiotics given intravenously, orally, or by intramuscular injection, oral nonabsorbables antibiotics, or topical antibiotics (dressings, ointments, or by inhalation). Antibiotics can be given at any moment after admission (\"general\") or can be specifically connected to a surgical procedure (\"perioperative\"). We will not consider a minimum duration of the intervention or of the follow‐up as an inclusion criteria.\n\n【34】Studies evaluating antibiotic impregnated catheters will be excluded, as will evaluations of ointments or dressings that contain antimicrobials (iodine, chlorhexidine), non‐antibiotics or antifungals. Dressings for superficial burns with partial thickness have been evaluated in a previous review by Wasiak 2008 , but the principal objective of that study was not the evaluation of antibiotic prophylaxis _._\n\n【35】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【36】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【37】1.  **Burn wound infection:** Studies must report an objective measure of burn wound infection in order to be included in the review. Diagnosis should rely on clinical examination (burn wound appearance) and culture data, if possible. However, burn wound infections diagnosed only by clinical examination will be also eligible.\n\n【38】2.  **Infections in the burned patient:** such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia or blood infection (sepsis), or central venous catheter‐associated bloodstream infections. We will admit any metric for quantifying infections, such as incidence rate or incidence density rate.\n\n【39】3.  I **nfection‐related mortality:** for example, mortality due to burn wound infection, sepsis, or another infection complication.\n\n【40】4.  **Adverse events:** as considered by the study investigators to be related to the antibiotic prophylaxis, such as toxicity, allergies, antibiotic‐associated diarrhoea due to the overgrowth of toxigenic strains of _Clostridium difficile_ , etc.\n\n【41】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【42】1.  **Objective measures of wound healing rate:** such as time to complete healing; proportion of wounds completely healed within a trial period; proportion of participants with completely healed wounds; or proportion of wounds partly healed in a specified time period.\n\n【43】2.  **Antibiotic resistance:** defined as clinical infection or colonization caused by bacteria resistant to one or more of the antibiotics included in the prophylactic regimen (proportion or rate of isolates of a specific pathogen ).\n\n【44】3.  **All‐cause mortality:** We will try to analyse this outcome according to longest common time point of assessment among the included studies.\n\n【45】4.  **Length of hospital stay (LOS).**\n\n【46】Studies will be eligible for inclusion even if they only report secondary outcomes, as these outcomes are relevant to patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the efficacy and safety of pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23 or PCV, or both, of any valency, alone or in combination) in HIV‐positive individuals.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】_Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae)_ is a leading cause of community‐acquired pneumonia and invasive bacterial infections worldwide. Over 90 pneumococcal serotypes have been identified, with 10 serotypes accounting for most pneumococcal infections . Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) occurs when _S. pneumoniae_ bacteria infect a normally sterile site (a site where bacteria are not usually isolated) such as the cerebrospinal fluid (causing meningitis) or the bloodstream (causing bacteraemia), and causes an overall mortality of approximately 20% .\n\n【7】People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are disproportionately affected by _S. pneumoniae_ infection. The risk of IPD is 30 to 100 times greater in HIV‐positive individuals compared to HIV‐negative age‐matched controls , and 25% will have a recurrent episode of IPD within a 12‐month period . Advanced immunosuppression in people who are untreated for HIV infection is characterized by impaired B cell immunity, which is probably the most important risk factor for IPD. However, drug use and cirrhosis are also more common in people living with HIV than in the general population and these factors also increase the risk of IPD . Although some studies have reported a decrease in IPD incidence following the widespread introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) , this finding has not been consistent .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Two pneumococcal vaccine types are currently available to protect against pneumococcal disease: polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines (PPVs) and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs). The first PPV was licensed in 1977, and contained capsular material from 14 pneumococcal serotypes (PPV14). PPV14 was replaced in 1983 by PPV23, which provides extended serotype coverage against the 23 pneumococcal serotypes causing approximately 85% to 90% of cases of pneumococcal disease in the USA .\n\n【10】In the most recent Cochrane Review of PPV23, which included 18 trials with over 60,000 participants, there was strong evidence that PPV23 reduced IPD in the general population. However, the evidence was less clear regarding protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, or against IPD in adults with chronic illness, such as asthma or COPD . Several studies have shown that the magnitude and durability of immunological response to PPV23 vaccination is inferior in HIV‐positive individuals compared with healthy controls, and failure of PPV23 is well described in this patient group .\n\n【11】Conjugate vaccines covalently couple polysaccharide antigens to a carrier protein to stimulate a greater immune response . The seven‐valent conjugate vaccine was designed to provide protection against the serotypes responsible for approximately 80% of infections in the USA , and was shown to be highly effective in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations including children and adults . A nine‐valent conjugate vaccine was developed for use in sub‐Saharan Africa with the addition of two major serotypes prevalent in the region. This vaccine was effective in children in South Africa , but never went into production or entered routine use.\n\n【12】The 13‐valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine superceded other conjugate vaccines and entered routine use in 2010. PCV13 extends coverage of PCV7 by including antigens to six additional serotypes of pneumococcus, including the 19A serotype, which increased in frequency in the USA following the introduction of PCV7 immunization in children . PCV13 protects against approximately 80% of pneumococcal serotypes causing pneumococcal disease in children .\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】This Cochrane review is of great importance as the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in HIV‐positive individuals, the degree of protection and the safety afforded remain debated . The long‐standing recommendation for pneumococcal vaccine in HIV‐positive individuals remains, given the increased burden of pneumococcal‐associated infection and complications in this population. Current recommendations are PCV13 followed by PPV23 after eight weeks for prevention of pneumococcal disease in pneumococcal vaccine naive HIV‐positive adults, and PCV13 vaccine at least one year after PPV23 for those people previously vaccinated with PPV23 .\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To determine the efficacy and safety of pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23 or PCV, or both, of any valency, alone or in combination) in HIV‐positive individuals.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs comparing pneumococcal vaccine with no intervention or control vaccines.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Adults and children who are infected with HIV.\n\n【23】#### Types of interventions\n\n【24】##### Intervention\n\n【25】Any pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23 or PCV, or both, of any valency, alone or in combination).\n\n【26】##### Control\n\n【27】Placebo, no intervention, or an alternative pneumococcal vaccine or vaccine schedule.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】*   IPD\n\n【31】*   All‐cause pneumonia\n\n【32】*   All‐cause mortality\n\n【33】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【34】*   Vaccine type IPD\n\n【35】*   Vaccine type pneumonia\n\n【36】*   Adverse effects of vaccine", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Oral side effects, including oral mucositis (mouth ulceration), remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral mucositis or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】Electronic searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers , CENTRAL via _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 1 June 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 June 2010), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 June 2010), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 1 June 2010), OpenSIGLE (1980 to 1 June 2010) and LILACS via the Virtual Health Library (1980 to 1 June 2010) were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral mucositis in people receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. Outcomes were oral mucositis, time to heal mucositis, oral pain, duration of pain control, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and quality of life.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two review authors. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. Risk of bias assessment was carried out on six domains. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratio (RR) values calculated using fixed‐effect models (less than 3 trials in each meta‐analysis).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Thirty‐two trials involving 1505 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Three comparisons for mucositis treatment including two or more trials were: benzydamine HCl versus placebo, sucralfate versus placebo and low level laser versus sham procedure. Only the low level laser showed a reduction in severe mucositis when compared with the sham procedure, RR 5.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.30 to 12.13).\n\n【12】Only 3 comparisons included more than one trial for pain control: patient controlled analgesia (PCA) compared to the continuous infusion method, therapist versus control, cognitive behaviour therapy versus control. There was no evidence of a difference in mean pain score between PCA and continuous infusion, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA, mean difference 0.65 mg/hour (95% CI 0.09 to 1.20), and the duration of pain was less 1.9 days (95% CI 0.3 to 3.5).\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】There is limited evidence from two small trials that low level laser treatment reduces the severity of the mucositis. Less opiate is used for PCA versus continuous infusion. Further, well designed, placebo or no treatment controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of interventions investigated in this review and new interventions for treating mucositis are needed.\n\n【15】### Interventions for treating oral mucositis for patients with cancer receiving treatment\n\n【16】Using a low level laser may reduce the severity of ulcers caused by cancer treatment.  \nTreatments for cancer can cause severe ulcers (sores) in the mouth. These can be painful and slow to heal. The review found some evidence that using a laser relieves or cures the ulcers. Morphine can control the pain. Although using morphine automatically on a constant drip, or self controlled use, provide similar relief, people use less morphine when they are controlling it themselves.\n\n【17】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy of temozolomide in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed and progressive DIPG.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is one of the most devastating childhood cancers. The incidence is 0.1 per 100,000 children per year and DIPG accounts for 7 percent of all pediatric central nervous system tumors . DIPG usually concerns high grade glioma (grade III or glioblastoma multiforme) but can also be grade II diffuse astrocytoma ; even primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) histology has been described in occasional subjects . Diagnosis is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which typically shows a diffusely swollen pons and encasement of the basilary artery by the tumor. Treatment is difficult because of the delicate location within the pons from which the majority of the cranial nerves originate. This makes radical surgery too dangerous . In addition, several anti‐cancer drugs appeared to be inactive in DIPG, either due to tumor drug resistance and/or poor drug distribution in the tumor due to a frequently intact blood brain barrier . Radiotherapy can significantly reduce the tumor and often improves clinical signs, but these effects are almost always temporary . For these reasons, the prognosis of DIPG has remained unchanged in the past 30 years with a median overall survival rate of nine months and a two‐year overall survival rate of less than 10 percent .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Temozolomide, an imidazotetrazine derivative of dacarbazine, is an oral alkylating drug. Once temozolomide enters the systemic circulation it is converted to its active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC) .\n\n【9】Nowadays, the use of temozolomide in the treatment of pediatric and adult glioma is widespread. This extensive use resulted from the report of a phase III trial in 2005, in which temozolomide was given concurrently with radiotherapy and as adjuvant treatment for adult high grade glioma . The median overall survival increased from 12.1 to 14.6 months (P < 0.001) with temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone. This study resulted in the approval of temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). These results were confirmed in a systematic review on temozolomide for high grade glioma in 2008 . In addition, temozolomide was also approved for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma. In the mean time, phase I studies with temozolomide in children were initiated. Temozolomide was found to be safe in children with mainly hematological toxicity, which was comparable to that been observed in adults .\n\n【10】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【11】After the successes obtained in adults, multiple temozolomide trials were initiated in children and young adults with glioma, both with conventional and protracted dose schedules . This also applies to DIPG, where multiple studies were published from 2005 with temozolomide alone or in combination with other drugs . Furthermore, temozolomide became a drug that was frequently prescribed off protocol to patients with DIPG. However, the efficacy of temozolomide in children with DIPG is unclear. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been done on temozolomide in children and adolescents with DIPG thus far. The results from this systematic review thus answer the clinical question whether children and adolescents with DIPG should or should not be treated with temozolomide and to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from temozolomide treatment.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】To assess the efficacy of temozolomide in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed and progressive DIPG.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinically controlled trials (CCTs), unrandomized single‐arm trials with historical controls and cohort studies examining the efficacy of temozolomide in the treatment of childhood and adolescent DIPG. Cross‐sectional studies, case‐reports and case series (i.e. a series of non‐consecutive patients) will be excluded. A cohort study is defined as a study in which a group of consecutive patients treated for DIPG was followed either from diagnosis or from time of progression onwards. The described study could be the original cohort or a subgroup of the original cohort based on well‐defined inclusion criteria. Studies including less than five patients will be excluded.\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】Patients aged < 21 years with clinical and MRI features consistent with the diagnosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma are eligible. Patients can be either newly diagnosed with no prior therapy other than corticosteroids or with disease progression after radiotherapy. The MRI criteria include a T1 iso‐ or hypointense, T2 hyperintense tumor originating in the pons, with at least 50% involvement of the pontine region. Patients diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) only will be excluded, since CT is not sensitive for diagnosing pontine glioma . Histological confirmation by means of biopsy is not mandatory. In cases where pathologic analysis of the tumor is available, histological diagnosis should be grade 2‐4 astrocytoma or grade 2‐3 oligodendroglioma or oligoastrocytoma, located in the pons . We will exclude exophytic tumors and cases of pilocytic astrocytomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) of the brainstem. If studies include both eligible and non‐eligible patients, the results of only eligible patients should be available for inclusion in the review.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】Treatment with temozolomide, either neo‐adjuvant, concomitant or adjuvant to fractionated radiotherapy. Both treatment arms of the RCT or CCT or, in case the control group is a historical cohort, both the current and historical cohort, should receive fractionated radiotherapy. Treatment protocols are allowed to include supportive care, e.g. glucocorticosteroids, anti‐epileptics and other drugs depending on appropriate clinical need, as well as additional anti‐cancer drugs in the treatment regimen.\n\n【22】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【23】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【24】###### Newly diagnosed patients\n\n【25】*   Overall survival, defined as the interval between tumor diagnosis and death from any cause.\n\n【26】###### Patients with progressive disease\n\n【27】*   Radiological response rate, defined as the total number of patients with a complete or partial response.

We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials database and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN) in April 2013 for ongoing studies. No language or time period restrictions were applied. We examined the reference lists of all included randomised controlled trials and contacted authors of identified trials. We searched the 'grey' literature at OpenGrey and handsearched relevant conference proceedings.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised controlled trials comparing a leukocyte‐depleting arterial line filter with a standard arterial line filter, on the arterial outflow of the heart‐lung bypass circuit, in elective patients undergoing heart valve surgery.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were collected on the study characteristics, three primary outcomes (1. post‐operative in‐hospital all‐cause mortality within three months, 2. post‐operative all‐cause mortality excluding inpatient mortality < 30 days, 3. length of stay in hospital, 4. adverse events and serious adverse events) and seven secondary outcomes (1. tubular or glomerular kidney injury, 2. validated health‐related quality of life scales, 3. validated renal injury scales, 4. use of continuous veno‐venous haemo‐filtration, 5. length of stay in intensive care, 6. costs of care). Data were extracted by one author and verified by a second author. Insufficient data were available to perform a meta‐analysis or sensitivity analysis.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the review but data on prespecified review outcomes were available from only one, modestly powered (24 participants) study . There were no differences between a leuko‐depleting versus standard filter in length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (mean difference (MD) 0.80 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.24 to 1.84) or length of hospital stay (MD 0.20 days; 95% CI ‐1.78 to 2.18).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There are currently insufficient good quality trials with valve surgery patients to inform recommendations for changes in clinical practice. A future National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)‐funded feasibility study  comparing leukodepletion with a standard arterial line filter in patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery (the ROLO trial) will be the largest study to date and will make a significant contribution to future updates of this review.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Heart Valve Disorder\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Leukodepletion\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   All Cause Mortality\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Duration Of Hospital Stay\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### Leukodepletion for patients undergoing heart valve surgery\n\n【23】Patients undergoing heart valve surgery are at a higher risk of developing complications after surgery, such as damage to the kidneys, compared with patients who undergo coronary artery surgery alone. The injury to organs is associated with an increased risk of death, longer stay in hospital and higher costs of care. A systemic inflammatory response is thought to be responsible for this effect. One possible mechanism for this response is activation of white blood cells (leucocytes) as they come into contact with the heart and lung bypass machine during surgery. In an attempt to avoid this inflammation response, special filters have been developed that capture the leucocytes while patients are on the bypass machine.\n\n【24】The authors of this review evaluated whether these filters were safe to use and effective in reducing the risk of death, length of stay in intensive care and hospital, impairment of kidney functioning, costs of care, and improving quality of life in patients undergoing heart valve surgery. We searched the literature and found eight studies, comprising at least 185 patients, that met our inclusion criteria for the review. However, only one study with 24 participants could provide data on any of our review outcomes. The study showed that length of stay in intensive care and length of stay in hospital were not different between patients who had surgery with the leukodepletion filter compared to a standard filter. None of the studies reported on death rates or five of the seven secondary outcomes that the review aimed to evaluate.\n\n【25】The authors concluded that there were not enough good quality trials in patients undergoing valve surgery to determine whether leukodepletion works. More good quality research studies with relevant outcome measures are required. A forthcoming study will help to clarify the findings in a future update of the review.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】There are currently insufficient good quality trials that compare arterial line leukodepletion with standard arterial line filters in valve surgery patients to inform recommendations for changes in practice.\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】Future studies on arterial line leukodepletion in patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery should consider the following.\n\n【32】*   The conduct of cardiopulmonary bypass ought to be standardized, where practicable, to eliminate potential confounding variables. This could be achieved for the majority of patients presenting for heart valve surgery.\n\n【33】*   Inclusion of key clinical outcomes such as mortality, markers of renal impairment, health‐related quality of life, adverse events and costs of care\n\n【34】*   The potential renoprotective benefit of leukodepletion would logically be best assessed in those with preserved left ventricular (LV) function (ejection fraction (EF) > 40%) in the first instance as poor LV function is an established independent predictor of post‐operative renal dysfunction in this setting.\n\n【35】A future NIHR‐funded feasibility study of leukodepletion versus a standard arterial line filter for patients undergoing elective heart valve surgery, led by Mr Augustine Tang, is due to begin in Spring 2013 (the ROLO trial). The study design conforms to international best practice for trial design and will measure most of the outcomes specified in this review. It aims to recruit 108 patients over 18 months. Once complete it will make a significant contribution to this review, being the largest study to date. The ROLO study is designed to inform parameterisation of a larger multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.\n\n【36】Background\n----------\n\n【37】### Description of the condition\n\n【38】Diseases of the heart valves can dramatically worsen quality of life and cause premature death if left untreated. Although the underlying causes of heart valve disease vary considerably between developed and developing countries, the burden of disease in Western economies is substantial, partly due to an ageing population and the accompanying increase in degenerative valve diseases . Prevalence of valvular heart disease in the general US population is estimated at 2.5%, with age‐related increases rising to 13% in people over 75 years . In the period 2000 to 2010, the proportion of valve surgeries in the United States rose from 16% to 22% of all cardiac surgeries . Despite recent innovations, the gold standard treatment remains open heart surgery to repair or replace the damaged valves . Positive outcomes of such surgery include increased life expectancy and improved quality of life . However, there are intrinsic risks associated with heart valve operations which cannot be avoided .\n\n【39】Patients undergoing heart valve surgery are at more than twice the risk of developing post‐operative end organ injury, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), the most prevalent adverse event, compared with patients who undergo coronary artery surgery alone . The crude incidence of acute renal failure for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, isolated valve operation, and a valve with coronary artery bypass grafting operation was 1.9%, 4.4%, and 7.5%, respectively (P < 0.001) when estimated over a four‐year period in the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre . Although the risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) is undoubtedly influenced by the presence of established patient‐related (increasing age, diabetes), cardiac (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%) and co‐morbidity (pre‐existing renal dysfunction) factors, valvular heart surgery per se is associated with an increased incidence of this complication due to the more prolonged heart‐lung bypass time and haemoglobinuria arising from haemolysis induced by extended cardiotomy suction. The international Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines define AKI when one of the following criteria is met: serum creatinine rises by ≥ 26 μmol/L within 48 hours or serum creatinine rises ≥ 1.5 fold from the reference value (which is known or presumed to have occurred within one week) or urine output is < 0.5 ml/kg/hr for > 6 consecutive hours . It is estimated that around 8% of patients undergoing heart surgery experience post‐operative renal dysfunction and 1.5% require dialysis . Post‐operative length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) may be twice as long for patients with renal dysfunction (five times longer for dialysis) and the mortality rate is also significantly higher at 27% for patients with post‐operative renal dysfunction compared to 0.9% for those without . Even mild AKI is associated with a twofold increase in mortality rate, longer stay in ICU (x 1.6) and increased costs of care (x 1.6), with risk and costs escalating with severity of kidney injury . This same mechanism may lead to the failure of other organs (multi‐organ dysfunction), which is a major cause of chronic ill‐health and death . Avoiding cardiac surgery associated AKI is therefore crucial due to the associated higher mortality rates, increased length of stay in ICU and elevated costs .\n\n【40】### Description of the intervention\n\n【41】A special device, called the leukodepletion (LG6) filter, has been developed that can successfully remove activated leukocytes (white blood cells) during the heart‐lung bypass process which is mandatory for all heart valve surgery. These specially engineered filters combine a depth element with a screening component in order to trap activated leucocytes. Early studies demonstrated a reduction in inflammation and lung injury with the use of the filter during blood transfusions . Its effectiveness in removing the activated portion of leukocytes in circulating blood has been validated , though use of the filter is associated with an additional cost of approximately GBP 80 each. It was first used during heart and lung bypass surgery during the early 1990s  and since then leukocyte filters have been used at different sites in the heart‐lung bypass circuit showing good performance and patient safety . Its effectiveness in ameliorating AKI, as defined by biomarkers, had been validated in low‐risk coronary artery bypass patients . The mode of action is to reduce the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) associated with use of the extra‐corporeal circuit during heart‐lung bypass. Peri‐operative risk may be mediated by leucocyte activation, which may form the basis of SIR. The potential link between leucocyte activation and SIR is supported by evidence of a genetic basis for individual variation in the magnitude of SIR associated with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . There is no evidence supporting a link between leucocyte activation and pre‐existing co‐morbidities in the cardiac surgical population.\n\n【42】### How the intervention might work\n\n【43】A standard arterial line filter removes microemboli (gas, fat, aggregates) from blood passing through the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. In addition, the leukodepletion filter has been proven to remove activated circulating leukocytes . When a patient’s blood comes into contact with the artificial components of the heart and lung bypass circuit, the leucocytes become activated, which may lead to a SIR and the elevated risk of multi‐organ dysfunction and death . The role of activated leukocytes in the development of post‐operative complications is well documented . Laboratory evidence for kidney protection (renoprotection) using the leukodepletion filter has been demonstrated with low‐risk patients undergoing coronary artery surgery . However, this study did not demonstrate clinical evidence of a reduction in kidney injury and the authors suggested that benefits may be more discernible in patients with moderate to high risk of developing kidney injury, for example, patients undergoing heart valve surgery. This cohort are at a higher risk of end‐organ failure because they face additional challenges, such as increased time spent on the heart‐lung machine and increased blood spillage and salvage. The sequelae of these additional challenges include an increase in leukocyte activation leading to a greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Reducing the number of activated leukocytes using a leukodepletion filter may reduce the risk of organ injury . Leukodepletion may therefore reduce post‐surgical mortality and length of stay, and improve long‐term quality of life . To our knowledge there are no known side effects or harms associated with use of the leukodepletion filter compared to a standard arterial line filter.\n\n【44】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【45】There is some evidence for the benefits of leukodepletion in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery  but its effectiveness in higher‐risk patients, such as those undergoing heart valve surgery, has not previously been reviewed. Evidence for the benefit of leukodepletion in terms of overall clinical outcomes in heart surgery is currently unclear . Although leukodepletion during cardiopulmonary bypass has contributed to improved heart and lung function, this has not translated into better overall clinical outcomes . This may be partly due to studies on low‐risk patients, who are not expected to have frequent complications . The impact of heart surgery from the patient's perspective is an important consideration when evaluating the efficacy of an intervention. The subjective measurement of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is an established outcome measure following cardiac surgery  and is able to predict post‐surgical functional status  and level of disability . In addition, post‐operative HRQoL can be predicted by the severity of pre‐operative heart failure and type of valve surgery . Pre‐operative HRQoL scores have recently been confirmed as independent predictors of post‐operative mortality and myocardial infarction, leading to a call for their inclusion in the standard set of assessments . Evidence for the impact of leukodepletion on a patient’s lifestyle and well‐being has not previously been collated. A leukodepletion filter is relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of renal replacement therapy and prolonged intensive care, but few studies have evaluated cost savings. However, in a small US study Palanzo and colleagues reported potential savings in post‐operative hospital costs of USD 2892 per patient . Prevention of end‐organ injury during valvular surgery could represent substantial cost savings  and it is therefore important to review the potential reduction in costs of care associated with use of the leukodepletion filter. It was the aim of this review to comprehensively evaluate the impact of leukodepletion on clinical, economic and health‐related quality of life outcomes in patients undergoing heart valve surgery.\n\n【46】Objectives\n----------\n\n【47】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of leukodepletion on clinical, patient‐reported and economic outcomes in patients undergoing heart valve surgery.\n\n【48】Methods\n-------\n\n【49】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【50】#### Types of studies\n\n【51】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\n\n【52】#### Types of participants\n\n【53】##### Included\n\n【54】Adult (≥ 18 years) patients requiring surgical intervention for heart valve disease, including single or multiple valves, first time or redo procedures.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy and safety of interferon for the treatment of anogenital warts in non‐immunocompromised adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Epidemiology\n\n【7】Anogenital warts are now the most common viral sexually transmitted disease in developed countries . In a large study of privately insured individuals, anogenital warts were present in 1.7 cases per 1000 person‐years, with the highest prevalence occurring among women aged 20 to 24 years (6.2 cases per 1000 person‐years) and men aged 25 to 29 years (5.0 cases per 1000 person‐years) . In the United States, 5.6% of sexually active 18‐ to 59‐year olds reported that they had been diagnosed with anogenital warts between 1999 and 2004 . Anogenital warts can occur in bisexual, heterosexual, and homosexual men and women. Some studies report that the prevalence of anogenital warts is similar among men and women , whereas other studies have found that women are more likely to have warts . The annual direct healthcare costs of anogenital warts in the United States are estimated to be US$200 million, with the average cost of an individual episode being US$436 .\n\n【8】#### Pathology and transmission\n\n【9】Anogenital warts are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV). More than 120 HPV subtypes have been identified, of which more than 40 subtypes are specific to the anogenital tract. More than 90% of anogenital warts are caused by low‐risk HPV subtypes 6 and 11 . HPV is most commonly transmitted during sexual contact  when the virus penetrates the skin and mucosal surfaces through microscopic abrasions. However, the virus can also be transmitted by nonsexual contact such as hand‐genital transmission and sharing towels . There is no evidence that transmission can occur via fomites .\n\n【10】HPV infects the basal layer of epithelial cells. Most infections stay subclinical or latent for months or years until the virus replicates in dividing epithelial cells to produce anogenital warts . The cell‐mediated immune response causes HPV containment and lesion regression . HPV infection could induce a local immune deficiency manifested by depletion of intraepithelial lymphocytes, langerhans cells, and CD4+ cells, as well as down regulation of cytokine production . Immunocompromised patients, especially those with cell‐mediated immune deficits, have a higher prevalence of HPV‐related diseases and are more likely to have large, multifocal, and dysplastic lesions .\n\n【11】Anogenital warts tend to recur because of the presence of HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences in the apparently normal surrounding tissue . Risk factors for contracting anogenital warts include first intercourse at an early age, a large number of sexual partners, a high level of sexual hormones, and multiple pregnancies.\n\n【12】#### Symptoms and signs\n\n【13】Anogenital warts tend to occur on the vulva (most frequently), vagina, cervix, penis, scrotum, and perianal area. Warts may also be found within the rectum or mouth of individuals having anal or oral sex. Although commonly asymptomatic, the most frequent symptoms of HPV infection include pruritus, burning, pain, bleeding, odour, tenesmus, and pain during intercourse. On physical examination, warts usually have a classic cauliflower‐like appearance. Other common forms include flat‐topped papules, dome‐shaped papules, and keratotic warts. The lesions, which range in color from skin‐colour to pink, may vary in size from small nodules that are invisible to the naked eye to large cauliflower‐like masses. Single or multiple warts may be present, and some may even spread into large masses.\n\n【14】#### Diagnosis\n\n【15】Anogenital warts can usually be identified by their characteristic macroscopic appearance. A biopsy should be taken when the lesion is atypical. Colposcopy and a vaginal speculum can be used to identify lesions on the cervix or inside the vagina. Anoscopy and proctosigmoidoscopy are helpful for identifying internal lesions, especially in homosexual men. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique could also be used to detect HPV DNA.\n\n【16】#### Treatment\n\n【17】The treatment regimens for external anogenital warts recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2006 encompass patient‐applied therapies, such as podofilox and imiquimod, and provider‐administered therapies such as trichloroacetic or bichloracetic acid, surgical excision, loop electrosurgical excision, cryotherapy, and podophyllin . Most treatments aim to remove the visible lesions or relieve the symptoms, but the therapeutic effects do not last long and the rate of recurrence is very high .\n\n【18】### Description of the intervention\n\n【19】Interferon, which is classified as interferon‐alpha, ‐beta, or ‐gamma depending on its antigenic specificity and molecular structure, can be used systemically, intralesionally, or topically . However, the systemic route is generally believed to be ineffective because interferon induces host cells to produce antiviral protein only when it is concentrated in a local region. The usual dose of intralesional interferon is 1 to 2 million units . The adverse effects of interferon mainly include flu‐like symptoms (fever, chills, myalgia, headache, fatigue, etc.) and hematological toxic effects (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) . The adverse effects are usually mild and well tolerated. It is not known whether interferon has teratogenic effects or is secreted into breast milk.\n\n【20】### How the intervention might work\n\n【21】Interferon belongs to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines. It is induced and secreted in response to challenges by foreign agents such as viruses, parasites, and tumor cells, and is associated with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities . Interferon augments the immune response by inhibiting viral replication, activating natural killer cells and macrophages, increasing antigen presentation to lymphocytes, and increasing the resistance of host cells to viral infection. However, interferon is not usually considered as a first line treatment for anogenital warts because of its inconsistent therapeutic effect. Interferon could enhance the effect of other treatments, such as surgery and laser ablation, by lowering the viral burden in the surrounding \"normal\" tissue and reducing the likelihood of recurrence.\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Some trials have shown interferon to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating anogenital warts , while others have demonstrated modest or variable efficacy . In one trial, interferon had no effect on external anogenital warts as a primary or an adjunct therapy . Many authors have advocated the use of interferon in combination with other therapeutic modalities for extensive and refractory anogenital warts, whereas others do not recommend it as a therapy . Therefore, we aim to determine the benefits and harms of using interferon to treat anogenital warts and the effect of factors, such as preparation method, route of administration, dosage, regimen, sex of the patient, and severity of disease, on patient outcomes.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the efficacy and safety of interferon for the treatment of anogenital warts in non‐immunocompromised adults.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in all languages, that examine the effect of using interferon to treat anogenital warts in non‐immunocompromised adults.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the efficacy of ketamine as compared to placebo, no intervention or standard care for management of severe acute asthma in children who have failed standard therapy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children, with prevalence between 10% and 23% . The prevalence and annual hospitalization rates of asthma in children have increased from 1980 through the mid‐1990s, with a plateau recently . In the United States, the annual hospitalization rate for asthma among persons aged 0 to 24 years was 16.8 per 10,000 population in 1980. This increased by 28% in 1993, reaching 21.4 per 10,000  and 27 per 10,000 in 2004 . Approximately 3% of hospitalized asthmatic children respond poorly to treatment and require mechanical ventilation . In children, the morality rate of 1.72 per 1000 hospitalized asthmatic patients has been reported , with this trend declining recently . Although it is difficult to identify the criteria which may predict potentially fatal asthma in children, there are some risk factors which may suggest possibility of severe, life‐threatening asthma in children: these include previous severe exacerbation, previous attack with respiratory failure, seizure or loss of consciousness, noncompliance to therapy, denial or failure to perceive severity of illness and dysfunctional family unit .\n\n【7】The standard treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma in children include O <sub>2 </sub> supplementation, inhaled beta‐2 agonist with or without ipratropium bromide (either through a inhaled and spacer device or nebulization) and systemic corticosteroids . There is limited evidence, however, to guide the use of second line therapies (e.g. aminophylline, magnesium sulfate, inhaled corticosteroids or continuous intravenous infusion of beta‐2 agonist etc.) to treat children with acute severe excerebration of asthma who respond poorly to standard treatment .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Ketamine hydrochloride, a phencyclidine‐derived agent, is a unique drug with anxiolytic, analgesic, amnesic and dissociative properties. It produces functional and electrophysiological dissociation between the cortical and limbic systems of the brain, resulting in cataleptic state . This trancelike cataleptic state is characterised by profound analgesia and amnesia, with retention of protective airway reflexes, spontaneous respiration and cardiopulmonary stability . Ketamine has been used effectively and safely as an intravenous or intramuscular agent for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in children both in emergency department (ED) and outpatient settings over many years . It is used commonly to facilitate the completion of short painful procedures (e.g. suturing, lumbar puncture, removal of a foreign body etc.) or reduction of children's fractures in the ED . Finally, ketamine is the agent of choice in rapid sequence intubation for children and adults with severe respiratory distress .\n\n【10】Ketamine is relatively safe in children and the side effects are generally mild (e.g. laryngospasm, emergency reactions, agitation) and self‐limiting . The emergence reactions or recovery agitation may be observed often in older children (more than 10 years old) and adults, but are very uncommon in younger children .\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Ketamine administration has been associated with increase in pulmonary compliance and decrease in airway resistance in patients with obstructive airway disease . Gateau et al reported that ketamine has a powerful bronchial relaxant effect and reversed the bronchoconstriction caused by histamine, acetylcholine, barium chloride or potassium chloride and the effect was not inhibited by propranolol and indomethacin which excluded the involvement of beta activation and of prostaglandins . Ketamine is also known to inhibit catecholamine reuptake processes and act as sympathomimetic agent resulting in bronchial relaxation . One or all of the above mechanisms are responsible for bronchodilator effects of ketamine and probably play a role in the attenuation of bronchospasm in a patient with intrinsic asthma.\n\n【13】Ketamine had been used in acute severe asthma with benefits both in adults  and children .\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Children with asthma frequently visit the pediatric ED with acute exacerbations. Some of these children fail to respond to standard therapy (aerosol beta <sub>2 </sub> ‐agonist with or without aerosol anticholinergic and oral or parenteral corticosteroid) for acute asthma leading to prolonged ED stays, hospitalization, morbidity (e.g. barotrauma, intubation) and (albeit rarely) mortality. Ketamine may relieve bronchospasm and is a potentially promising therapy for children with acute asthma who fail to respond to standard treatment.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To evaluate the efficacy of ketamine as compared to placebo, no intervention or standard care for management of severe acute asthma in children who have failed standard therapy.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】Prospective randomized controlled trials.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】Children (up to 18 years of age) presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation who have failed standard therapy with aerosol beta <sub>2 </sub> ‐agonist, with or without aerosol anticholinergic and oral or parenteral corticosteroid, for at least one hour.\n\n【24】**Exclusion criteria:** Studies enrolling adults only, non‐randomized trials and cross over.

Failure to close results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) . In very preterm infants, a large PDA is present in approximately 50% of infants in the first day of life . An early large DA is frequently clinically \"silent\", without the characteristic clinical signs including murmur, hyperdynamic precordium and bounding pulses . Detection may be dependent on echocardiographic techniques including colour flow Doppler . Although frequently clinically silent, an early large PDA has been associated with systemic hypotension  and low systemic blood flow , which in turn has been associated with intraventricular haemorrhage , neurodevelopmental impairment , necrotising enterocolitis and mortality .\n\n【19】After the first days of life, approximately 30% of infants born before 30 weeks gestation will develop a symptomatic PDA . A ductus may be confirmed as being symptomatic by the identification of clinical (hyperdynamic precordium and bounding pulses) and/or echocardiographic signs (increased pulmonary blood flow, increased left atrial to aortic ratio (LA/Ao), or absent or reversed flow in the distal aorta or organ arteries) of haemodynamic significance . The left to right shunting through the DA leads to overloading of the pulmonary circulation and reduced perfusion of the brain, gut and kidneys, resulting in symptoms attributable to the PDA including respiratory distress, feed intolerance and renal insufficiency. If left uncorrected, PDA may lead to pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure  and reduced organ blood flows (ductal steal) . A symptomatic PDA has been associated with cystic periventricular leukomalacia , chronic lung disease , necrotising enterocolitis  and mortality in very preterm infants .\n\n【20】Phototherapy is the most widely used therapy for neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Phototherapy leads to photoisomerisation of bilirubin into a water‐soluble form that can be excreted by the kidneys . In nearly all infants, phototherapy reduces the rise of serum bilirubin concentrations  and the need for an exchange transfusion . Phototherapy may be delivered from sources including fluorescent tubes, light emitting diodes and fibreoptic sources. Phototherapy can be delivered by overhead lamps, lamps surrounding the infant or a phototherapy 'blanket', at varying wavelengths and intensity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends phototherapy in the 430 nm to 490 nm wavelength spectrum and intensity of at least 30 uW/cm <sup>2 </sup> /nm .\n\n【21】The effect of light on the DA is not completely understood but _in vitro_ studies have shown that constricted arteries relax when exposed to light . More specifically, phototherapy has been associated with failure of closure of the DA in preterm infants .\n\n【22】### Description of the intervention\n\n【23】It has been proposed that shielding the chest from phototherapy light may prevent a haemodynamically significant PDA . Chest shields are used for the duration the infant receives phototherapy. The chest shield may be made of any photo‐opaque or reflective material designed to prevent phototherapy light from reaching the ductus. In theory, the photo‐opaque material is taped over the left side of the chest, both front and back to cover the area of the PDA, but not covering more than 10% of the infant's body surface area so as not to reduce the effectiveness of phototherapy . The shield may be tested to block transmission of light by placing a radiometer directly underneath. Chest shields have been used to shield from phototherapy specifically, not ambient light, although this could be considered. Theoretical adverse effects of shielding with aluminium foil include burns and skin damage, although there are no current reports.\n\n【24】### How the intervention might work\n\n【25】It is hypothesised that the skin of preterm infants permits transmission of light during phototherapy causing photo‐relaxation of the musculature of the DA . Chest shielding has the potential to prevent photo‐relaxation of the duct . Animal studies have shown that chest shielding blocks transmission of light and prevents photo‐relaxation of the DA. It has been shown that immature lambs are more sensitive to photo‐relaxation as compared to mature lambs . Hypotheses for this action include activation of photosensitive metabolites, alterations in membrane or receptor sites or alteration in prostaglandin metabolism. It has been proposed that light may exert its effect through the nitric oxide pathway, accompanied with an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or may have a direct relaxation effect on arterial smooth muscle . Light penetrates the skin as shown in mice during phototherapy  with potential consequences on the DA. Front and back shielding may prevent the action of light.\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】PDA is a common problem of prematurity that is associated with significant morbidity and frequent treatment. Phototherapy is widely used in the first few days in preterm neonates when there is frequent ductal patency. Chest shielding is a simple intervention that has the potential to prevent a symptomatic and/or haemodynamically significant PDA in preterm babies treated with phototherapy.\n\n【28】Objectives\n----------\n\n【29】The primary objective will be to determine if chest shielding of preterm infants receiving phototherapy versus sham shielding or no shielding reduces the incidence of symptomatic and/or haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and reduces subsequent morbidity secondary to a PDA and mortality.\n\n【30】The secondary objectives will be to determine whether chest shielding of preterm infants receiving phototherapy versus sham shielding or no shielding reduces the incidence of symptomatic and/or haemodynamically significant PDA and reduces subsequent morbidity secondary to a PDA and mortality, based on to the following subgroups.\n\n【31】1.

Respiratory failure and weak cough develop in all patients as a consequence of muscle weakness leading to a risk of atelectasis, pneumonia, or the need for ventilatory support. There is no curative treatment for DMD. Corticosteroids are the only pharmacological intervention proven to delay the onset and progression of muscle weakness and thus respiratory decline in DMD. Antioxidant treatment has been proposed to try to reduce muscle weakness in general, and respiratory decline in particular.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 23 March 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We included male patients with a diagnosis of DMD who had respiratory decline evidenced by a forced vital capacity (FVC%) less than 80% but greater than 30% of predicted values, receiving any antioxidant agent compared with other therapies for the management of DMD or placebo.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors screened studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias of studies, and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were FVC and hospitalisation due to respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, adverse events, change in muscle function, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included one study with 66 participants who were not co‐treated with corticosteroids, which was the only study to contribute data to our main analysis. We also included a study that enrolled 255 participants treated with corticosteroids, which was only available as a press release without numerical results. The studies were parallel‐group RCTs that assessed the effect of idebenone on respiratory function compared to placebo. The trial that contributed numerical data included patients with a mean (standard deviation) age of 14.3 (2.7) years at the time of inclusion, with a documented diagnosis of DMD or severe dystrophinopathy with clinical features consistent with typical DMD. The overall risk of bias across most outcomes was similar and judged as 'low'.\n\n【12】Idebenone may result in a slightly less of a decline in FVC from baseline to one year compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 3.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.41 to 6.97; 64 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and probably has little or no effect on change in quality of life (MD −3.80, 95% CI −10.09 to 2.49; 63 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), range 0 to 100, 0 = worst, 100 = best quality of life). As a related but secondary outcome, idebenone may result in less of a decline from baseline in FEV1 (MD 8.28%, 95% CI 0.89 to 15.67; 53 participants) and PEF (MD 6.27%, 95% CI 0.61 to 11.93; 1 trial, 64 participants) compared to placebo.\n\n【13】Idebenone was associated with fewer serious adverse events (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.04; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and little to no difference in non‐serious adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; 66 participants; low‐certainty evidence) compared to placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in arm muscle function (MD −2.45 N, 95% CI −8.60 to 3.70 for elbow flexors and MD −1.06 N, 95% CI −6.77 to 4.65 for elbow extensors; both 52 participants) compared to placebo. We found no studies evaluating the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.\n\n【14】The second trial, involving 255 participants, for which data were available only as a press release without numerical data, was prematurely discontinued due to futility after an interim efficacy analysis based on FVC. There were no safety concerns.\n\n【15】The certainty of the evidence was low for most outcomes due to imprecision and publication bias (the lack of a full report of the larger trial, which was prematurely terminated).\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Idebenone is the only antioxidant agent tested in RCTs for preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD for which evidence was available for assessment. Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in FVC and less of a decline in FEV1 and PEF, but probably has little to no measurable effect on change in quality of life. Idebenone is associated with fewer serious adverse events than placebo. Idebenone may result in little to no difference in change in muscle function.\n\n【18】Discontinuation due to the futility of the SIDEROS trial and its expanded access programmes may indicate that idebenone research in this condition is no longer needed, but we await the trial data. Further research is needed to establish the effect of different antioxidant agents on preventing respiratory decline in people with DMD during the respiratory decline phase of the condition.\n### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Populatio\n\n【20】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy\n*   Decreased Respiratory Function\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Interventio\n\n【22】*   Antioxidants\n*   Green Tea Extract\n*   Coenzyme Q10\n*   Acetylcysteine\n*   Idebenone\n*   Citrulline\n*   Metformin\n\n【23】###### Compariso\n\n【24】*   Antioxidants\n*   Corticosteroids - Opthamological and Otological\n*   Physiotherapy\n*   Respiratory Muscle Training\n*   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\n\n【25】###### Outcom\n\n【26】*   Forced Vital Capacity\n*   Acute Respiratory Infections\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Hospitalization\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The muscles used in breathing become involved, which leads to shortness of breath and the need for artificial ventilation (a machine to support breathing). Treatment with antioxidants has been proposed to slow down the loss of muscle strength and the decline in breathing.\n\n【33】**Study characteristics**\n\n【34】We searched the evidence up to 23 March 2021. We included two studies in boys with DMD whose breathing was affected. Both studies compared the antioxidant medicine idebenone with a dummy medicine. One study included 66 participants between 10 and 18 years of age. The participants in this study were not receiving corticosteroids (medicines shown to be beneficial in DMD). The other study involved 255 children with DMD who were also taking corticosteroids. This study was stopped early for lack of benefit. The full results of the study are not yet available.\n\n【35】**Study funding sources**\n\n【36】The studies were sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the maker of idebenone.\n\n【37】**Key results**\n\n【38】Idebenone may result in slightly less of a decline in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity), but probably has little or no effect on quality of life in patients with worsening breathing. Idebenone may result in less of a decline in the ability to force air out of the lungs and airways (based on tests of forced expiratory volume in the first second and peak expiratory flow). Idebenone was associated with fewer serious side effects than the dummy drug and has little or no effect on non‐serious side effects. Idebenone may have little or no effect on muscle function (arm strength). We found no studies that looked at hospitalisation due to respiratory infection.\n\n【39】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【40】The overall certainty of the evidence was low.\n\n【41】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

ABPA is associated with an accelerated decline in lung function. High doses of corticosteroids are the main treatment for ABPA; although the long‐term benefits are not clear, their many side effects are well‐documented. A group of compounds, the azoles, have activity against _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and have been proposed as an alternative treatment for ABPA. Of this group, itraconazole is the most active. A separate antifungal compound, amphotericin B, has been employed in aerosolised form to treat invasive infection with _Aspergillus fumigatus_ , and may have potential for the treatment of ABPA. Antifungal therapy for ABPA in cystic fibrosis needs to be evaluated.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】The review aimed to test the hypotheses that antifungal interventions for the treatment of ABPA in cystic fibrosis:  \n1\\. improve clinical status compared to placebo or standard therapy (no placebo);  \n2\\. do not have unacceptable adverse effects.\n\n【4】If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, duration and dose of antifungal therapy.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.\n\n【7】In addition, pharmaceutical companies were approached.\n\n【8】Date of the most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 09 February 2012.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials, where antifungal treatments have been compared to either placebo or no treatment, or where different doses of the same treatment have been used in the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two trials were identified by the searches; neither was judged eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】No completed randomised controlled trials were included.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】At present, there are no randomised controlled trials to evaluate the use of antifungal therapies for the treatment of ABPA in people with cystic fibrosis.

PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【26】### Treatments to fight fungal infections which cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis\n\n【27】Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic lung reaction to a type of fungus (usually _Aspergillus fumigatus_ ) in some people with cystic fibrosis. It causes cough and wheezing and sometimes fever. If left untreated it can lead to chronic lung damage. ABPA is usually treated with a high dose of corticosteroids (also known as steroids). However, it has not been proved that corticosteroids can prevent lung function deteriorating in the long term. Also, long‐term use of these drugs is linked to some serious side effects. Treating the fungus which causes ABPA may be an alternative to using high doses of steroids to combat the allergic reaction. No trials were found which we could include in the review. There are trials in people without cystic fibrosis which have shown that if treatment is given to reduce the fungus, the steroid dose can be reduced with no adverse effects. However, in one CF centre researchers observed that when treated with an anti‐fungal agent in addition to steroids, several people became unable to produce enough cortisol (a hormone) in their adrenal glands in response to stress. There is not enough evidence for us to recommend the use of antifungal drugs in people with CF and ABPA. There should be a trial of these drugs to assess their effects in the long and the short term.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The trials were all of low quality. One small trial found that compared to EN, PN significantly increased weight (mean difference (MD) 4.12; 95% CI 1.91 to 6.33), serum albumin levels (MD 0.70; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.26), calorie intake (MD 22.00; 95% CI 5.12 to 38.88) and protein intake (MD 0.80; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.15). One trial comparing peripheral PN and EN with central PN found that mean daily weight gain (MD ‐27.00; 95% CI ‐43.32 to ‐10.68) and energy intakes (MD ‐15.00; 95% CI ‐26.81 to ‐3.19) were significantly less for the peripheral PN and EN group, whereas mean change in serum albumin was significantly greater for that group(MD 0.47; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81, P = 0.008).\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】There is limited evidence from individual trials to suggest that parenteral nutrition is more effective than enteral nutrition in well‐nourished children and young people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

It may help to reverse malnutrition seen at diagnosis, prevent malnutrition associated with the cancer treatment and promote weight gain and growth. Nutritional support may be provided by one of two methods: nutritional liquids delivered through a central or peripheral vein which bypass the gut (parenteral nutrition); or nutritional liquids or solids that pass through any part of the gut, regardless of method of delivery (e.g. orally or via a tube) (enteral nutrition).\n\n【25】We found some evidence from one small trial to suggest that parenteral nutrition may result in an increase in weight, serum albumin levels, and calorie and protein intake when compared to enteral nutrition (usual food intake). However, the evidence for other methods of delivery of nutritional support remains unclear. No studies were identified that compared the nutritional content in either the PN or EN groups of studies. The trials were all of low quality and very different in terms of outcome measures used. In future much larger, rigorously conducted trials with better defined outcome measures are needed in order to address this important question.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Psychological (e.g. psychotherapy), psychosocial (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) and biological (e.g. SSRIs or tricyclic drugs) treatments are the most common treatments being offered. The large variety of therapeutic interventions give rise to questions of clinical effectiveness and side effects. Physical exercise is inexpensive with few, if any, side effects.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of exercise interventions in reducing or preventing anxiety or depression in children and young people up to 20 years of age.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (latest issue available), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC and Sportdiscus up to August 2005.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised trials of vigorous exercise interventions for children and young people up to the age of 20, with outcome measures for depression and anxiety.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.

Five studies reporting depression scores showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise group (SMD (random effects model) ‐0.66, 95% CI ‐1.25 to ‐0.08). However, all trials were generally of low methodological quality and they were highly heterogeneous with regard to the population, intervention and measurement instruments used. One small trial investigated children in treatment showed no statistically significant difference in depression scores in favour of the control group (SMD (fixed effects model) 0.78, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 2.04). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment.\n\n【13】Five trials comparing vigorous exercise to low intensity exercise show no statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children. Three trials reported anxiety scores (SMD (fixed effects model) ‐0.14, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.13). Two trials reported depression scores (SMD (fixed effects model) ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.14). Two small trials found no difference in depression scores for children in treatment (SMD (fixed effects model) ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.16). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment.\n\n【14】Four trials comparing exercise with psychosocial interventions showed no statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children. Two trials reported anxiety scores (SMD (fixed effects model) ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.43 to 0.17). Two trials reported depression scores (SMD (fixed effects model) 0.10, 95% CI  \n‐0.21 to 0.41). One trial found no difference in depression scores for children in treatment (SMD (fixed effects model) ‐0.31, 95% CI ‐0.97 to 0.35). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Whilst there appears to be a small effect in favour of exercise in reducing depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children and adolescents, the small number of studies included and the clinical diversity of participants, interventions and methods of measurement limit the ability to draw conclusions. It makes little difference whether the exercise is of high or low intensity. The effect of exercise for children in treatment for anxiety and depression is unknown as the evidence base is scarce.\n### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Populatio\n\n【18】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Depression\n*   Anxiety\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Interventio\n\n【20】*   Preventive\n*   High Intensity Exercise\n\n【21】###### Compariso\n\n【22】*   Low Intensity Exercise\n*   Waiting list control\n\n【23】###### Outcom\n\n【24】*   Depression\n*   Anxiety\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Despite major advances and increasing enthusiasm for modern endoscopic local excision (LE), uncertainty remains regarding its oncologic equivalence and safety relative to radical resection (RR).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the oncologic, operative, and functional outcomes of modern endoscopic LE compared to RR surgery in adults with stage I rectal cancer.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science ‐ Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to present), four trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials database), two thesis and proceedings databases, and relevant scientific societies' publications in February 2022. We performed handsearching and reference checking and contacted study authors of ongoing trials to identify additional studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with stage I rectal cancer comparing any modern LE techniques to any RR techniques with or without the use of neo/adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and standard errors for time‐to‐event data and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes, using generic inverse variance and random‐effects methods. We regrouped surgical complications from the included studies into major and minor according to the standard Clavien‐Dindo classification. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE framework.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Four RCTs were included in data synthesis with a combined total of 266 participants with stage I rectal cancer (T1‐2N0M0), if not stated otherwise. Surgery was performed in university hospital settings. The mean age of participants was above 60, and median follow‐up ranged from 17.5 months to 9.6 years. Regarding the use of co‐interventions, one study used neoadjuvant CRT in all participants (T2 cancers); one study used short‐course radiotherapy in the LE group (T1‐T2 cancers); one study used adjuvant CRT selectively in high‐risk patients undergoing RR (T1‐T2 cancers); and the fourth study did not use any CRT (T1 cancers).\n\n【12】We assessed the overall risk of bias as high for oncologic and morbidity outcomes across studies. All studies had at least one key domain with a high risk of bias. None of the studies reported separate outcomes for T1 versus T2 or for high‐risk features.\n\n【13】Low‐certainty evidence suggests that RR may result in an improvement in disease‐free survival compared to LE (3 trials, 212 participants; HR 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 4.24). This would translate into a three‐year disease‐recurrence risk of 27% (95% CI 14 to 50%) versus 15% after LE and RR, respectively.\n\n【14】Regarding sphincter function, only one study provided objective results and reported short‐term deterioration in stool frequency, flatulence, incontinence, abdominal pain, and embarrassment about bowel function in the RR group. At three years, the LE group had superiority in overall stool frequency, embarrassment about bowel function, and diarrhea.\n\n【15】Local excision may have little to no effect on cancer‐related survival compared to RR (3 trials, 207 participants; HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.33; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not pool studies for local recurrence, but the included studies individually reported comparable local recurrence rates for LE and RR (low‐certainty evidence).\n\n【16】It is unclear if the risk of major postoperative complications may be lower with LE compared with RR (risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.28; low‐certainty evidence; corresponding to 5.8% (95% CI 2.4% to 14.1%) risk for LE versus 11% for RR). Moderate‐certainty evidence shows that the risk of minor postoperative complications is probably lower after LE (risk ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.85); corresponding to an absolute risk of 14% (95% CI 8% to 26%) for LE compared to 30.1% for RR. One study reported an 11% rate of temporary stoma after LE versus 82% in the RR group. Another study reported a 46% rate of temporary or permanent stomas after RR and none after LE.\n\n【17】The evidence is uncertain about the effect of LE compared with RR on quality of life. Only one study reported standard quality of life function, in favor of LE, with a 90% or greater probability of superiority in overall quality of life, role, social, and emotional functions, body image, and health anxiety. Other studies reported a significantly shorter postoperative period to oral intake, bowel movement, and off‐bed activities in the LE group.\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】Based on low‐certainty evidence, LE may decrease disease‐free survival in early rectal cancer. Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that LE may have little to no effect on cancer‐related survival compared to RR for the treatment of stage I rectal cancer. Based on low‐certainty evidence, it is unclear if LE may have a lower major complication rate, but probably causes a large reduction in minor complication rate. Limited data based on one study suggest better sphincter function, quality of life, or genitourinary function after LE. Limitations exist with respect to the applicability of these findings. We identified only four eligible studies with a low number of total participants, subjecting the results to imprecision. Risk of bias had a serious impact on the quality of evidence. More RCTs are needed to answer our review question with greater certainty and to compare local and distant metastasis rates. Data on important patient outcomes such as sphincter function and quality of life are very limited. Results of currently ongoing trials will likely impact the results of this review. Future trials should accurately report and compare outcomes according to the stage and high‐risk features of rectal tumors, and evaluate quality of life, sphincter, and genitourinary outcomes. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy as an emerging co‐intervention for improving oncologic outcomes after LE needs to be further defined.\n### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Populatio\n\n【21】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Rectal Cancer\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【22】###### Interventio\n\n【23】*   Local Excision\n\n【24】###### Compariso\n\n【25】*   Radical Resection Of Soft Tissue\n\n【26】###### Outcom\n\n【27】*   Disease-Free Survival\n*   Urethral Sphincter Function\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【29】### Is local or major surgery better for treating early rectal cancer with or without additional treatments before or after surgery?\n\n【30】**Key messages**\n\n【31】We are uncertain if local excision (LE) (removal through the anus of an early rectal cancer that has not grown beyond the muscle layer of the rectum, or stage I) may shorten the period of being cancer‐free after surgery compared to radical resection (RR) (removing the entire rectum and its surrounding tissues through a major surgery). It is also unclear if LE affects cancer‐related survival related compared with RR.\n\n【32】There is probably a large reduction in minor complications after surgery (only necessitating medications or supportive measures) with LE compared with RR for the treatment of early rectal cancer. It is unclear if LE lowers the rate of major complications.\n\n【33】Based on only one study, LE results in better quality of life and anal sphincter function.\n\n【34】**What is early rectal cancer?**\n\n【35】Rectal cancer presents at an early stage in one‐third of patients and does not invade beyond the muscle layer of bowel wall; this is classified as stage I, or early rectal cancer. People with early rectal cancer may experience bleeding or pain, or only get diagnosed on screening colonoscopy. We undertook this review to compare standard surgery for rectal cancer to a new, smaller surgery that has been increasingly adopted in recent decades.\n\n【36】**How is early rectal cancer treated?**\n\n【37】The currently recommended treatment for stage I rectal cancer is a major surgery for removal of the rectum with all its surrounding supporting tissues, known as radical resection (RR). This extensive surgery carries significant risks of surgical and functional complications. Recently, an alternative treatment using advanced instruments through the anus has been popularized. This has enabled precise removal, or local excision (LE), of only the tumor safely through the anus with fewer complications and faster recovery. Sometimes additional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be used in conjunction before or after the surgery.\n\n【38】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【39】We compared RR to LE to find out whether LE is as effective as or better than RR with regard to:\n\n【40】1\\. disease recurrence and survival;\n\n【41】2\\. functional and quality of life outcomes;\n\n【42】3\\. side effects and complications after undergoing surgery.\n\n【43】**What did we do?**\n\n【44】We looked for studies that compared RR with LE in people with early rectal cancer with or without the use of any additional treatments. We compared, summarized, and combined the results across studies and rated our confidence in the evidence.\n\n【45】**What did we find?**\n\n【46】We found four studies that involved 266 participants with early rectal cancer with a median age of 60 years undergoing RR or LE. Participants were studied from 17.5 months in the shortest study to up to 9.6 years in the longest study. Three studies were carried out in European countries and one in China. One study did not use any additional therapy; two studies used chemotherapy or radiotherapy before the surgery; and one study used chemotherapy after the surgery for select patients. Three of the four studies were funded by government agencies.\n\n【47】**Main results**\n\n【48】Results suggest that RR may decrease the chance of disease coming back locally or in other organs of the body. This means for every 100 patients undergoing LE, up to 27 may develop recurrence at 3 years compared with 15 patients per 100 after RR.\n\n【49】Only one study looked at anal sphincter function, including the ability to control stool or flatulence, number of leakage episodes, and the need to use diapers. RR was associated with short‐term deterioration in stool frequency, flatulence, incontinence, abdominal pain, and embarrassment about bowel leakage. At 36 months after surgery, participants in the LE group had better overall stool frequency, stool frequency at night, and less embarrassment about leakage and diarrhea.\n\n【50】It is unclear if LE affects cancer‐related survival. Additionally, studies did not present the results in a way that could help us answer if LE affects the chance of disease coming back in the pelvis.\n\n【51】We are uncertain if LE results in a lower rate of major complications after surgery, but we found that LE probably causes a large reduction in minor complications.\n\n【52】The only study that evaluated quality of life or urinary and sexual function after surgery reported a 90% or greater probability that LE results in a better overall quality of life, various role/social/emotional functions, body image, health anxiety, and urinary incontinence. The same study reported similar sexual function after both surgeries.\n\n【53】**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n【54】We have low confidence in the evidence mainly because it was based only on a few studies, and due to the way the studies were conducted. In addition, it is possible that the results of the studies could have been affected by the fact that participants and investigators were aware of which treatment participants had received.\n\n【55】**How up‐to‐date is this evidence?**\n\n【56】This review is current to February 2022.\n\n【57】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effect of long‐term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs in patients who have recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation, to reduce death, stroke and embolism, drug adverse effects and recurrence of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【3】Primary aim is to assess the effects of any antiarrhythmic drugs compared with no antiarrhythmic drugs treatment, no treatment, placebo, or treatment for rate control. If several antiarrhythmic drugs appear to be effective the secondary aim will be to assess which is more effective.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and its incidence increases substantially as age increases . Atrial fibrillation is associated with important morbidity and mortality, related to stroke, other embolic complications, and heart failure . In developed countries, atrial fibrillation has grown progressively as a contributing cause of hospitalisation and death in the last decades .\n\n【7】Knowledge of the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation is rapidly evolving. Usually secondary to other cardiac diseases, when maintained in time atrial fibrillation induces progressive changes in electrophysiology and mechanics of the atria. This atrial remodelling hinders restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) and favours persistence of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is frequently associated with heart failure, in a vicious circle in which heart failure favours the appearance and persistence of atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation exacerbates heart failure in turn .\n\n【8】In the management of atrial fibrillation, different aspects have to be assessed and integrated: treatment of the arrhythmia itself, prevention of the associated risk of stroke and embolism, and consideration of underlying conditions ‐ type of cardiac disease, co morbidities ‐ that may alter therapeutic options. Two basic strategies exist: rate‐control or rhythm‐control. In rate‐control strategy, atrial fibrillation is allowed to continue and treatment objectives are to control heart rate and to prevent stroke, usually with anticoagulants. In rhythm‐controlstrategy, treatment aims to restore and keep normal sinus rhythm, using different antiarrhythmic drugs (AAR), electrical cardioversion or a combination of both.\n\n【9】Recent well‐designed trials  comparing rhythm control to rate control indicate both strategies yield to similar clinical results, that is, no significant difference in terms of mortality, stroke rate or overall cardiovascular events were observed. Two other Cochrane systematic reviews compare rate control strategy against rhythm control using electrical conversion  ‐ this review has found only ongoing trials ‐ or using pharmacological conversion , this last review currently ongoing.\n\n【10】If a rhythm control strategy is chosen for a patient, after restoring sinus rhythm the next therapeutic challenge is recurrence of atrial fibrillation.The risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation is dependent on age, duration of atrial fibrillation and the existence and severity of heart structural disease, being left atrial diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction good predictors of recurrence . The overall rate of recurrence of atrial fibrillation without treatment is high: only 20 to 30% of patients who converted remain in sinus rhythm at one year . An additional aspect to assessing the affects of antiarrhythmic drugs for atrial fibrillation is that as many as 70% of patients are thought to recover sinus rhythm spontaneously within 24 hours after an episode of recent onset atrial fibrillation .\n\n【11】Long‐term antiarrhythmic therapy has been widely used to prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation. There is evidence that several antiarrhythmic drugs are more effective than placebo for maintaining sinus rhythm . However, some questions remain to be answered:\n\n【12】(1) It is not known to which measure keeping patients in sinus rhythm reduces the risks associated with atrial fibrillation ‐ like embolism, stroke or increased mortality. It is possible that those risks are associated with underlying cardiac disease more than with atrial fibrillation itself. Unfortunately, many of the trials with antiarrhythmic drugs have focused on maintenance of sinus rhythm and have not assessed other relevant outcomes ;\n\n【13】(2) Chronic treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can be associated with severe adverse effects, one of them the potential for inducing life‐threatening arrhythmias. Adverse effects could compromise the potential benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm or even outweigh them, leading to worse outcomes. In fact, the results of some trials show an increased mortality associated with long term use of antiarrhythmic drugs like quinidine  or flecainide ;\n\n【14】(3) It is not known if all antiarrhythmic drugs are equivalent or not in effectiveness and security for this indication.\n\n【15】Different trials have studied chronic treatment with diverse antiarrhythmic drugs for maintaining sinus rhythm, sometimes compared to placebo, sometimes compared to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Attempts to summarize this evidence in systematic reviews or meta‐analysis have been incomplete: the studies were combined in a narrative review , mortality and stroke were not assessed  or results from trials using different antiarrhythmic drugs and very dissimilar length of treatment were pooled together . Therefore, we aim to conduct a systematic review of trials studying long‐term use of antiarrhythmic drugs to avoid recurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients recovering sinus rhythm.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To determine the effect of long‐term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs in patients who have recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation, to reduce death, stroke and embolism, drug adverse effects and recurrence of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【18】Primary aim is to assess the effects of any antiarrhythmic drugs compared with no antiarrhythmic drugs treatment, no treatment, placebo, or treatment for rate control. If several antiarrhythmic drugs appear to be effective the secondary aim will be to assess which is more effective.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomised controlled trials with concealed allocation of participants to intervention or placebo. Studies that are not randomised or that use quasi‐randomisation or where allocation to treatment is not concealed will be excluded. Cross over studies and studies where duration of follow up is less than 6 months will be excluded.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Adults (>16 years) who have had atrial fibrillation of any type and duration and in whom sinus rhythm has been restored spontaneously or by a therapeutic intervention.\n\n【25】Patients with atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery will be excluded. Also patients with any known terminal disease causing an expectancy of life of less than 12 months.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】To be included, studies must randomly allocate patients to an intervention and a control group. The intervention group must receive oral long‐term treatment with any available antiarrhythmic drugs, at appropriate dosing regime, aimed at preventing new episodes of atrial fibrillation and maintaining sinus rhythm.\n\n【28】Control group, for the primary objective of the review, can use placebo, drugs for rate control (digoxin, calcium channel blockers, beta‐blockers) or no treatment. If the secondary objective of assessing which antiarrhythmic drugs are more effective is required, that is, several antiarrhythmic drugs appear to be more effective than no antiarrhythmic drugs treatment, then the control group will be any of the other effective antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\n【29】Both groups, intervention and control, must be similar with regard to cardiac disease (frequency, type and severity) and type of atrial fibrillation (especially duration). Also, both groups must be treated equally, apart from the experimental therapy:  \n(1) Management of hypertension or heart failure must be similar i.e., the frequency of use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which some studies have shown it can influence the rate of development of atrial fibrillation ;  \n(2) Guidelines used to manage initiation, discontinuation, dose and surveillance of anticoagulation should be the same in both intervention and control groups.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】It will be included primary studies assessing at least one of the following outcomes:\n\n【32】**Primary outcomes**  \n(1) Mortality:  \n(a) Global mortality;  \n(b) Mortality due to cardiovascular causes;\n\n【33】(2) Embolic complications: stroke and peripheral embolism combined;\n\n【34】(3) Adverse effects of treatment:  \n(a) Overall: any event attributed to the treatment and leading to stop it;  \n(b) Pro‐arrhythmia: any new symptomatic arrhythmia or an aggravation of existing arrhythmias (i.e. rapid atrial fibrillation) or sudden death.\n\n【35】**Secondary outcomes**  \n(1) Use of anticoagulation: number of patients on chronic treatment with anticoagulants;\n\n【36】(2) Recurrence of atrial fibrillation: number of patients not being in sinus rhythm.\n\n【37】All outcomes will be analysed at 6, 12 and 24 months, when data available.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of banding ligation versus no intervention in adults with cirrhosis and gastro‐oesophageal varices that have not bled.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Oesophageal varices develop as a result of portal hypertension . At the time of diagnosis, approximately 30% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices . In people with cirrhosis who do not have varices at the time of diagnosis, the incidence of oesophageal varices is 5% at one year and 28% at three years . The factors precipitating variceal haemorrhage are still not clear. The risk of bleeding is increased when the size of the varices is more than five mm. The risk of bleeding also increases with the severity of liver disease. In people with alcohol‐related cirrhosis, the risk of bleeding depends on whether or not they continue to drink. Once varices are present, they tend to enlarge. Of people with small varices at the outset, 12% will have large varices at one year and 31% at three years , resulting in a higher risk of bleeding. The estimated two‐year incidence of bleeding is approximately 24%  and most episodes of bleeding from varices (70%) occur within two years of diagnosis. Although the in‐hospital mortality associated with variceal bleeding has decreased in recent years due to improvements in endoscopic therapy and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the reported mortality rate still lies between 12% to 44%. The risk of death within six weeks of the initial variceal haemorrhage is below 10% in Child–Pugh Class A and greater than 32% in those in Child–Pugh Class C .\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】As approximately 30% of people with cirrhosis with oesophageal varices develop bleeding and 12% to 44% die as a result of the first bleed, prophylactic regimens to prevent bleeding are important . Nonselective beta‐blocker therapy reduces azygos blood flow and variceal pressure and is used for the primary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage . About one in three patients do not respond to beta‐blockers or develop adverse events, leading to a reduction in dose or treatment withdrawal . Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have been used to assess endoscopic interventions as an alternative option . Variceal sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a strong and irritating sclerosant or glue, is associated with serious adverse events including severe bleeding and oesophageal strictures . Banding ligation may provide a safer option .\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】Banding devices use a means of capturing the target tissue while a small‐diameter circular band is deployed around the base of the tissue . The band may be rubber, latex, or a similar material. The ligation procedure results in tight compression with vascular compromise leading to thrombosis, necrosis, and sloughing. Previous banding devices used an overtube for the repeated intubation, allowing the placement of multiple bands . The insertion of an overtube was associated with adverse events including perforation of the oesophagus . At present, multi‐band devices (without an overtube) are used, resulting in considerably fewer adverse events .\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】The effect of banding ligation for preventing variceal bleeding is a clinically‐important question. Endoscopic variceal ligation is advocated as an alternative option for primary prophylaxis . Although banding ligation is a relatively simple endoscopic procedure, repeated banding is normally required to achieve eradication of varices and for surveillance for variceal recurrence. A systematic review found that banding ligation may be superior to beta‐blockers in the prevention of bleeding . The review did not include RCTs with a no intervention control. Several RCTs have compared banding ligation versus no intervention . Conducting a systematic review with meta‐analyses of these trials may provide important information about the beneficial and harmful effects of banding ligation.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of banding ligation versus no intervention in adults with cirrhosis and gastro‐oesophageal varices that have not bled.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language. If, during the selection of trials, we identify observational studies (i.e. quasi‐randomised studies; cohort studies; or patient reports) reporting adverse events, we will include these studies for a review of the adverse events. We will not specifically search for observational studies for inclusion in this review, which is a known limitation of our systematic review.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】We will include people with cirrhosis and endoscopically verified gastro‐oesophageal varices that have not bled (primary prevention), irrespective of the size of the varices or the hepatic venous pressure gradient.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】Banding ligation versus no intervention. Considering the nature of the intervention, we do not believe that sham interventions are ethical as they may have associated morbidity and no benefit to the participant. In addition, we do not believe it is possible to adequately double blind banding ligation. If we do identify RCTs using blinding based on sham banding ligation, we will consider including them. We will not compare banding ligation versus nonselective beta‐blockers due to overlap with another review , but we will include RCTs in which participants received the same supportive treatment in the intervention and control group.\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】We will assess all outcomes at the maximum duration of follow‐up.\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】*   All‐cause mortality.\n\n【27】*   Serious adverse events, defined as any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment .

The purpose of this review is to compare clinical outcomes in patients randomised to restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds (triggers).\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To examine the evidence for the effect of transfusion thresholds on the use of allogeneic and/or autologous red cell transfusion, and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We identified trials by searching: the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1948 to January Week 3 2011, EMBASE (Ovid) 1980 to 2011 (Week 04), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to February 2011) and ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (1990 to February 2011). We checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Controlled trials in which patients were randomised to an intervention group or to a control group. We included trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We pooled risk ratios of requiring allogeneic blood transfusion, transfused blood volumes and other clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two people performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included 19 trials involving a total of 6264 patients and they were similar enough that results could be combined. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 39% (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.72). This equates to an average absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 34% (95% CI 24% to 45%). The volume of RBCs transfused was reduced on average by 1.19 units (95% CI 0.53 to 1.85 units). However, heterogeneity between trials was statistically significant (P < 0.00001; I² ≥ 93%) for these outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies did not appear to impact the rate of adverse events compared to liberal transfusion strategies (i.e. mortality, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia and thromboembolism). Restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a statistically significant reduction in hospital mortality (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95) but not 30‐day mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.03). The use of restrictive transfusion strategies did not reduce functional recovery, hospital or intensive care length of stay. The majority of patients randomised were included in good‐quality trials, but some items of methodological quality were unclear. There are no trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The existing evidence supports the use of restrictive transfusion triggers in most patients, including those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease. As there are no trials, the effects of restrictive transfusion triggers in high‐risk groups, such as acute coronary syndrome, need to be tested in further large clinical trials. In countries with inadequate screening of donor blood, the data may constitute a stronger basis for avoiding transfusion with allogeneic red cells.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Anemia\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Transfusion Using High Hemoglobin Threshold\n*   Red Blood Cell Transfusion\n*   Transfusion Using Low Hemoglobin Threshold\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Red Blood Cell Transfusion\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Infection\n*   Myocardial Infarction\n*   Stroke\n*   Congestive Heart Failure\n*   Red Blood Cell Transfusion\n*   Death\n*   Rebleeding\n*   Thromboembolism\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There are, however, risks involved. In particular, infections (including HIV and certain types of hepatitis) may be passed on to the person receiving the blood. This risk is very small in high‐income countries but much larger in poor countries which do not test the blood for infections. Because of the risks, doctors try to avoid giving blood unless it is really necessary. One approach is to give the transfusion only if the amount of haemoglobin in the patient's blood has dropped below a certain 'threshold' level. We looked for controlled studies comparing the effectiveness of giving more versus less blood. We found 19 studies, with a total of 6264 patients. We conclude that, for most patients, giving less blood is safe and blood transfusion is probably not essential until haemoglobin levels drop below 7.0 to 8.0 grams per decilitre. As no trials have been done involving patients with an acute heart problem, it is not currently known how much blood to give these patients.\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objectives of this review are as follows.\n\n【3】*   To determine the effect of a topical chlorhexidine application compared with the effect of a topical fluoride application for the prevention, arrest or reversal of caries lesions on deciduous and permanent teeth.\n\n【4】*   To examine the optimum parameters of administration for the use of either fluoride‐ or chlorhexidine‐ containing products.\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Dental caries is a multifactorial disease. Its development is associated with the presence of bacterial biofilms, fermentable (especially low‐molecular) carbohydrates, the presence of specific cariogenic bacteria (such as _Streptococcus mutans_ ), and individual factors‐ nutrition habits, oral hygiene, the flow rate and composition of saliva as well as the degree of tooth mineralisation . A genetic disposition for an increased caries risk due to a different transcription of genes participating in enamel formation is also likely .\n\n【8】In recent years, a paradigm of dental caries treatment has changed. The therapy is shifting increasingly towards a more preventive and minimally invasive approach in contrast to the much more invasive previous concept of caries treatment . Due to the marked increase of the worldwide prevalence of dental caries  and its huge financial load on the public health systems as well as its relevance for the oral and systemic health of every caries‐affected individual, the need for efficient caries prevention is evident. Therefore, the development and application of effective anticariogenic agents is of utmost importance for a modern oral preventive health care . Current preventive concepts are based on an anticariogenic diet (e.g. reduction of the consumption of fermentable carbohydrates) and an increased salivary flow, if possible , sufficient and effective oral hygiene, the application of various types of fluoride‐containing agents  and also on a reduction or elimination of cariogenic bacteria. Possible strategies include the prevention of cariogenic biofilm formation as well as a best possible post‐eruptive maturation of enamel by modifying the kinetics of apatite mineralisation, which can be achieved by mechanical and chemical control of plaque . This review will compare the potency of two central elements of prevention and management of dental caries: fluoride application as an established, evidence‐based prevention method , and the use of chlorhexidine, which is often considered as \"the gold‐standard of antiplaque agents\" .\n\n【9】### Effects of fluoride or chlorhexidine in caries control\n\n【10】Fluorides are compounded forms or complexes of the element fluorine. The most important inorganic fluoride agents are sodium fluoride (NaF), stannous fluoride (SnF2), and sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP, a complex), whereas amine fluoride is the most frequently applied organic fluoride‐containing agent used for caries prevention. These inorganic or organic agents are topically applied by means of dentifrices, mouthrinses, varnishes and gels. The caries‐preventing effect of topical fluoride treatment has been intensively investigated; it is based on three main mechanisms: inhibition of demineralisation, promotion of remineralisation, and interferences with bacterial growth and metabolism . The local application is considered to be much more effective compared to a systemic application, which does not reduce enamel solubility to an extent which may cause a relevant anticariogenic effect . It was previously thought that pre‐eruptive exposure was the most important effect of fluoride. However, this effect is now considered to be of secondary importance compared with post‐eruptive exposure for the resistance of enamel to attacks from acids in the oral cavity .\n\n【11】The newly formed mineral of previously 'demineralised' enamel due to remineralisation processes in the presence of topical fluoride derived from saliva or plaque, is more acid‐resistant than before demineralisation because of the integration of fluorapatite into the teeth's apatite structure . The presence of dissolved fluoride is the key for a successful therapy , because it also interferes with bacterial metabolism, growth and their adherence to the enamel surface, due to its influence on the microbial glycolysis. It has been documented that fluoride is able to inhibit the activity of the magnesium‐dependent enzyme enolase by compounding with magnesium, and because of its inhibiting effect on the accumulation of lactic acid . The metabolic mechanisms may arrest and even reverse the progression of caries, which is dependent on the intensity of the cariogenic impulse. The antibacterial action of fluoride is of minor importance clinically when compared to the remineralising effect. An important negative side effect of fluoride treatment is fluorosis, which may affect young children after chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of fluoride . Fluorosis causes a white to brown discolouration of the teeth (stripes or dots). Severe fluorosis can also result in partial or almost complete hypomineralisation of enamel. It has been indicated that all topical fluoride treatments are likely to have a similar caries‐preventive effectiveness .\n\n【12】Chlorhexidine (CHX) was originally used in medicine as a skin and wound cleanser/disinfectant. An intraoral use as an antiplaque mouthrinse was first reported in 1970 ; it is likely that the antimicrobial action of CHX may be also useful in oral prophylaxis for the prevention of caries. CHX is a bisbiguanide, which is used in different pharmaceutical forms in oral medicine. It has been reported that a varnish causes the most persistent reduction of _Mutans streptococci_ , followed by gels and mouthwashes . CHX‐containing sprays, chewing gums and dentifrices are also available on the market. The range of concentration varies between 0.03% in mouthrinses up to 40% in varnishes. CHX has a bacteriostatic effect at low concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations it has a bactericidal action. _S. mutans_ (MS) is highly susceptible to CHX . The antimicrobial mechanism by which CHX acts is the ability of integration into the cellular membrane of bacteria. Dissolved in water, the CHX molecule carries two positive charges and reveals a high chemical affinity to negatively charged bacterial membranes. The bactericidal effect is based on a disintegration of the microbial membrane. The dicationic nature of CHX causes a pronounced and strong adhesion to the dental hard tissues as well as to other surfaces in the oral cavity, such as the mucosa or pellicle . This high substantivity provides an extended retention and slow release of the agent, but it also causes adverse effects, such as a discolouration of teeth, the tongue, restorations, and dentures. Other adverse effects are mucosal soreness and desquamation, bitter taste and temporary taste disturbances, an increase in calculus formation due to an alteration of hard surfaces, acute parotitis and potential allergic reactions. The characteristics of CHX are also associated with the risk of interfering with anionic substances, which are contained in toothpaste (e.g. fluorides), which may result in a decreased efficiency. CHX is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinaI tract or the mucosal membrane. Therefore, it is excreted almost 100%. Less than 1% is excreted in the urine and approximately 90% through faeces. So far it has not been documented that microorganisms may become resistant to CHX .\n\n【13】### Why is it important to do this review?\n\n【14】The benefits of topical fluorides as caries‐preventive agents are firmly based on a considerable body of evidence from randomised controlled trials . Although the anticariogenic effect of fluorides compared to CHX and the effect of CHX itself are of utmost interest, this topic is still discussed controversially . Different types of evaluations, application methods, concentrations of agents and duration of the application have to be considered. It also needs to be taken into consideration that studies may be confronted to a large variation of outcomes and side effects. Other investigations showed that CHX is effective in caries prevention . The majority of clinical studies on CHX addressed its antiplaque and antigingivitis effects in a periodontal context, but some studies also demonstrated a caries‐preventive efficiency of this compound . This variation of outcomes underlines the need for an up‐to‐date systematic review to give reliable recommendations for caries preventive programmes.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】The objectives of this review are as follows.\n\n【17】*   To determine the effect of a topical chlorhexidine application compared with the effect of a topical fluoride application for the prevention, arrest or reversal of caries lesions on deciduous and permanent teeth.\n\n【18】*   To examine the optimum parameters of administration for the use of either fluoride‐ or chlorhexidine‐ containing products.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials which investigated the topical application of chlorhexidine and fluoride will be eligible for inclusion in this review. Cluster‐randomised trials may also be included if they meet the inclusion criteria.\n\n【23】RCTs or quasi‐randomised controlled trials using split‐mouth designs are excluded, because the possibility of significant contamination of control sites with chlorhexidine or fluoride cannot be ruled out (regardless of the adhesiveness of the material to the tooth surfaces in the first hours after application).\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】Children and adolescents (up to 16 years of age at the start of the study) will be included regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, health status or geographical location.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】In this review, the intervention of interest is topical chlorhexidine compared to topical fluoride application on all surfaces of deciduous and permanent teeth of children and adolescents. All types of application (varnishes, dentifrices, mouthrinses, gels, sprays and chewing gum), concentrations and formulations of chlorhexidine or fluoride will be considered, as well as different frequencies and durabilities of their application.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】1.  Changes in decayed, missing and filled surfaces or teeth (DMFS/DMFT in permanent teeth and dmfs/dmft in deciduous teeth).\n\n【31】2.  Progression of caries lesion through enamel or into dentine and caries arrest.\n\n【32】Studies should contain explicit/specific criteria for diagnosing dental caries and may include visual and tactile examination, radiographic survey and transillumination.\n\n【33】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【34】1.  Any adverse effects related to chlorhexidine or to fluorides, such as staining, mucosal soreness and desquamation, taste disturbances, increased calculus formation, acute parotitis and allergic reactions and fluorosis.\n\n【35】2.  Patient‐centred outcomes (e.g. ease of use/frequency of application required).\n\n【36】3.  Time taken for application.\n\n【37】4.  Cost of treatments.\n\n【38】Outcome measurements concerning chlorhexidine should first of all be focused on a change of DMFS/DMFT/dmfs/dmft data. Studies providing solely data for the reduction of _S. mutans_ (MS) will not be included, but for studies reporting changes in _S. mutans_ levels in addition to changes in DMFS/DMFT/dmfs/dmft, the MS levels will be recorded, as this would allow assessment of the extent to which MS measures are accurate indicators of DMF increment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, for a range of reasons, implementation and impact remain variable. PHC integration, at its simplest, can be considered a way of delivering PHC services together that sometimes have been delivered as a series of separate or 'vertical' health programmes. Healthcare workers are known to shape the success of implementing reform interventions. Understanding healthcare worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration can therefore provide insights into the role healthcare workers play in shaping implementation efforts and the impact of PHC integration. However, the heterogeneity of the evidence base complicates our understanding of their role in shaping the implementation, delivery, and impact of PHC integration, and the role of contextual factors influencing their responses.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To map the qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of PHC integration to characterise the evidence base, with a view to better inform future syntheses on the topic.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 28 July 2020. We did not search for grey literature due to the many published records identified.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included studies with qualitative and mixed methods designs that reported on healthcare worker perceptions and experiences of PHC integration from any country. We excluded settings other than PHC and community‐based health care, participants other than healthcare workers, and interventions broader than healthcare services. We used translation support from colleagues and Google Translate software to screen non‐English records. Where translation was not feasible we categorised these records as studies awaiting classification.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】For data extraction, we used a customised data extraction form containing items developed using inductive and deductive approaches. We performed independent extraction in duplicate for a sample on 10% of studies allowed for sufficient agreement to be reached between review authors. We analysed extracted data quantitatively by counting the number of studies per indicator and converting these into proportions with additional qualitative descriptive information. Indicators included descriptions of study methods, country setting, intervention type, scope and strategies, implementing healthcare workers, and client target population.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】The review included 184 studies for analysis based on 191 included papers. Most studies were published in the last 12 years, with a sharp increase in the last five years. Studies mostly employed methods with cross‐sectional qualitative design (mainly interviews and focus group discussions), and few used longitudinal or ethnographic (or both) designs. Studies covered 37 countries, with close to an even split in the proportions of high‐income countries (HICs) and low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). There were gaps in the geographical spread for both HICs and LMICs and some countries were more dominant, such as the USA for HICs, South Africa for middle‐income countries, and Uganda for low‐income countries. Methods were mainly cross‐sectional observational studies with few longitudinal studies. A minority of studies used an analytical conceptual model to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the integration study.\n\n【12】The main finding was the various levels of diversity found in the evidence base on PHC integration studies that examined healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences. The review identified six different configurations of health service streams that were being integrated and these were categorised as: mental and behavioural health; HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and sexual reproductive health; maternal, women, and child health; non‐communicable diseases; and two broader categories, namely general PHC services, and allied and specialised services. Within the health streams, the review mapped the scope of the interventions as full or partial integration. The review mapped the use of three different integration strategies and categorised these as horizontal integration, service expansion, and service linkage strategies. The wide range of healthcare workers who participated in the implementation of integration interventions was mapped and these included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay healthcare workers, and health system support staff. We mapped the range of client target populations.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】This scoping review provides a systematic, descriptive overview of the heterogeneity in qualitative literature on healthcare workers' perceptions and experience of PHC integration, pointing to diversity with regard to country settings; study types; client populations; healthcare worker populations; and intervention focus, scope, and strategies. It would be important for researchers and decision‐makers to understand how the diversity in PHC integration intervention design, implementation, and context may influence how healthcare workers shape PHC integration impact. The classification of studies on the various dimensions (e.g. integration focus, scope, strategy, and type of healthcare workers and client populations) can help researchers to navigate the way the literature varies and for specifying potential questions for future qualitative evidence syntheses.\n### PICOs\n\n【15】###### Populatio\n\n【16】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Healthcare Professional\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n\n【17】###### Interventio\n\n【18】*   Primary healthcare services\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The aim of this integration is usually to give people better access to healthcare and to make more efficient use of limited health resources.\n\n【25】**Why is it important to know about healthcare workers' views and experiences?**\n\n【26】Primary healthcare integration has been implemented in many different countries with varying success. Healthcare workers can influence the extent to which such changes in health services are implemented successfully. Learning about healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration can help us understand how healthcare workers might influence its implementation and its success or failure.\n\n【27】**What was the purpose of this scoping review?**\n\n【28】This scoping review searched for and mapped qualitative studies (studies with no numerical data) about healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration. We wanted to describe the available research to help inform future systematic reviews and research studies in this area.\n\n【29】**How did we identify and map the evidence?**\n\n【30】We searched for all published qualitative studies that reported on healthcare workers' views and experiences of primary healthcare integration up to 28 July 2020. We described the different study methods, countries, the scope and type of primary healthcare integration approaches, and the different types of healthcare workers and client groups involved. We then grouped the studies into categories.\n\n【31】**What did we find?**\n\n【32】We included 184 studies. The studies were from 37 countries. About half the studies took place in high‐income countries and half in low‐ and middle‐income countries.\n\n【33】The studies we found in our review covered a variety of settings, participants, and types of primary healthcare integration. There were different configurations for which healthcare service programmes were being combined for integrated service delivery. These were categorised into the following six configurations: mental health; HIV, tuberculosis, and sexual reproductive health; maternal, woman, and child health; non‐communicable diseases (for example, heart disease, diabetes); general primary health integration, and allied and specialised services. We also explored whether integrated service delivery was fully or partially integrated, and the different integration strategies used to link and co‐ordinate services.\n\n【34】The people participating in the implementation of integration interventions included policymakers, senior managers, middle and frontline managers, clinicians, allied healthcare professionals, lay health workers, and health system support staff. A wide range of clients were recipients of the integrated services.\n\n【35】**Author's conclusions**\n\n【36】This scoping review shows the variety of primary healthcare integration approaches that have been studied. Researchers and decision‐makers need to understand the relationship between different integration approaches and contexts, and the ways in which healthcare workers influence the impacts of this integration. The study categories we have developed can help researchers to understand these different types of integration approaches and to identify more focused questions for future systematic reviews.\n\n【37】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of consumer guidelines for people with chronic illnesses, on health outcomes.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Chronic illnesses are characterised by their long duration and generally slow progression . They are not limited to non‐communicable diseases; further, public health specialists increasingly view some diseases that were formerly considered to be terminal (such as HIV/AIDS and some cancers) as chronic illnesses. These conditions require long‐term, ongoing and comprehensive health services similar to other recognised chronic illnesses such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease . Chronic illnesses as defined for this review include both physical and mental illnesses . The World Health Organisation (WHO) has projected that the proportion of deaths due to chronic illnesses would rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030 . More recently, WHO reported that chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are the leading causes of mortality in the world, representing 60% of all deaths .\n\n【7】A significant proportion of people with chronic illness do not receive appropriate care . Studies in the United States and Netherlands suggest that 30 to 40% of patients do not receive care according to current scientific evidence, while 20% or more of the care provided is not needed, or may be harmful to patients . McGlynn 2003 , surveying 12 metropolitan areas in the United States, found that only 56% of people with chronic illnesses received recommended medical treatment. An examination of the experiences of chronically‐ill patients across eight countries found major differences in access, safety and care efficiency, with these patients at particular risk of experiencing inefficient, poorly‐organised care or errors .\n\n【8】There are a number of reasons as to why people with chronic illness do not receive the type and level of care that is recommended. Deficits in care management during hospital discharge or when seeing multiple doctors are common , highlighting the need for system innovations to improve outcomes for patients with complex chronic illnesses. A survey of 'sicker adults' across Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK and USA, reported that 33 to 49% of respondents were not given advice on health risk behaviours (such as weight, nutrition, exercise, smoking and at risk alcohol use) and that 47 to 67% were not asked for their input into treatment options . Another concern relates to inadequate patient involvement in health care, which is particularly evident in mental health. Reports have found that less than 15% of patients with chronic illnesses such as major depression, panic disorder or generalised anxiety disorder, receive evidence‐based treatment . People with chronic illnesses may not have adequate control of their condition  and general practitioners can overestimate patients' adherence to guidelines .\n\n【9】People with chronic illnesses increasingly are expected to contribute to decision making around their health care and disease management , but they do not always have access to appropriate evidence‐based information. As a result, some patients will turn to resources such as the Internet which may not always offer the most appropriate information, as they may be out‐of‐date, or may reflect the views of specific interest groups (e.g., pharmaceutical companies or professional associations). In some cases the advice thus obtained can have negative health consequences . Recent research into the accuracy and reliability of medical advice over the internet found that news sites only gave correct advice in 55% of cases (based on current United Kingdom gold standard recommendations), whilst no sponsored sites encountered in the study gave the correct advice . There is, therefore, a need for accurate and reliable information for people with chronic diseases.\n\n【10】Increasingly, clinicians have become aware of the impact of using patients' expertise to assist with their own disease management . However, clinical and research developments in this area have been slow. This may be partly due to the anxieties and skepticism of some healthcare professionals, who fear that more, rather than less time will be needed to manage 'expert' patients . Additional barriers relate to conflicting notions of who is responsible for managing the illness: the patient or their care provider . It has been reported that not all patients want to be accountable for the overall management of their health , believing instead that this is the role of their healthcare professional. In addition, a 2005 study found that patients felt that they did not possess the technical competence to become adept in self‐management .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】For the purpose of this review a consumer self‐care guideline is an educational guideline designed to encourage patient participation in the management of their chronic disease. We will include guidelines provided to patients by a healthcare professional that seek to enhance their understanding of their illness and recommend standards of care and treatment options to be discussed with their healthcare professional. Guidelines are increasingly produced by a wide range of organisations, but we will include only those produced in consultation with health professionals or are accepted as an established national guideline.\n\n【13】Consumer self‐care guidelines as defined for this review are aimed at two areas, firstly to promote self‐care or self‐management by increasing patient participation in the management of their chronic disease, and secondly to enhance patient understanding of their illness. Promotion of self‐care seeks to encourage people to take responsibility for their own health and well‐being. According to the National Health Service , self‐care is a working partnership between the individual and their care professional by communication, negotiation and decision‐making processes to achieve the best possible outcome for the individual. Self‐care refers to empowering individuals in a supportive, non‐threatening manner, by promoting health and well‐being and providing tools and resources to manage their own healthcare needs.\n\n【14】Extensive, well‐researched guidelines exist for all chronic illnesses, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma, , hypertension , type II diabetes , irritable bowel syndrome  and depression . Clinical guidelines can use different types of evidence with varying levels of validity and reliability . Consolidating an often complicated body of evidence can be problematic for guideline developers, and where empirical evidence is not available, guidelines may use consensus‐based expert opinion or provide recommendations with a disclaimer that the area requires further research . Numerous tools have been developed to determine the reliability of such evidence, including the Jadad score , NHMRC evidence ratings , FORM  and GRADE tools (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) . These assessments are important when considering the reliability of such information for consumer self‐care guidelines and this will be examined within the review.\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Consumer self‐care guidelines might work by providing patients with the resources so that they can take a more active role in their health care. Patients with effective self‐management skills reportedly make better use of health professionals' time and subsequently have enhanced self‐care . Evidence suggests that some patients want a more active role in their health care  and this results in increased feelings of control, which one author suggests may have significant health benefits . Through everyday decisions, which are influenced by attitudes and knowledge regarding medications, self‐management and exercise, people with chronic illnesses will influence the course and severity of their disease  as well as their everyday quality of life. In the primary care setting there is increasing evidence that patients' expectations of treatment have significant effects on the treatment they actually receive from their healthcare provider . Giving consumers guidelines containing the latest evidence‐based recommendations for treating their chronic condition may prompt them to talk with their physician about treatment options. Reducing the need for professional input may increase the cost‐effectiveness of care and reduce 'inappropriate' demands on healthcare providers . Moreover, guidelines synthesise a large amount of information. Given the magnitude of new evidence, and the gap that already exists, patient‐directed educational resources offer a potential bridge to narrow this gap .\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】In conducting this review we aim to consolidate and critically analyse trials of consumer‐directed self‐care guidelines for chronic diseases, in order to uncover which strategies work best for appropriate, acceptable and effective patient care. As a result this review will act as a guide for future clinical practice initiatives and health service investment in patient‐directed resources. Incorporating new knowledge into clinical practice has been slow, uneven and at times resisted . Providing evidence‐based resources to patients is considered vital to enable them to more actively manage their health . As treatment of chronic illness is being directed increasingly at the community level, the role of the patient in understanding and managing their own health is growing more important . There is little evidence consolidation on this intervention, which may prove to be a cost‐effective approach to patient self‐care.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To assess the effects of consumer guidelines for people with chronic illnesses, on health outcomes.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomised controlled trials, including cluster randomised controlled trials.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】People with a chronic disease meeting the World Health Organisation definition, being 'a disease of long duration and generally slow progression' , in contrast to an acute illness which is expected to resolve completely within a relatively short period of time.\n\n【27】Chronic diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes mellitus, Ischaemic heart disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, cancer, arthritis and renal failure . Obesity (as defined by study authors) will also be considered as a chronic disease .\n\n【28】We will exclude studies of people without an established chronic illness, such as those who only have a family history of a disease or who have high risk factors.\n\n【29】We will include people of all age groups, as well as informal caregivers and parents of children with a chronic illness, who also receive the intervention.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】The primary purpose of a consumer guideline is to provide a patient with an easy‐to‐follow resource, which will enable a more practical approach to self‐management in collaboration with healthcare providers, and enhance their understanding of the illness. To be included in this review, guidelines assessed in studies must:\n\n【32】*   include a recommendation for standards of care that should be met with treatment options (i.e., provide suggested treatments within the guideline for the health problems reported);\n\n【33】*   be delivered or initiated by a healthcare professional or healthcare worker, such as a doctor, surgeon, visiting ward specialist, nurse, therapist, pharmacist, dietician or researcher, to the patient; and\n\n【34】*   be produced in consultation with a healthcare professional, recognised healthcare organisation, or established recognised guideline with the aim of increasing patient participation in chronic disease management.\n\n【35】The intervention could be delivered in various ways, such as face‐to‐face, via the internet, email or post.\n\n【36】Comparison: No intervention, usual practice, oral education only, minimal written information e.g., pamphlet or standard information or a guideline of comparable intensity, that is not used for chronic disease management.\n\n【37】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【38】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【39】1\\. Consumer reported physical health outcomes (including symptom scores or counts related to the disease such as breathlessness, pain scales, tiredness, frequency of bowel movements etc.)\n\n【40】2\\. Psychological health outcomes (including validated quality of life measures, anxiety and depression scales)\n\n【41】3\\. Adverse outcomes such as mortality and adverse health events\n\n【42】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【43】4\\. Consumer behaviour (use of guideline recommendations, such as change in use of vaccinations, scans, blood tests, or medication, or involvement in the decision‐making process)\n\n【44】5\\. Consumer knowledge or mastery (level of knowledge or change in knowledge about the disease, illness, treatment) and attitudes (towards the illness, treatment)\n\n【45】6\\. Process measures (patient‐reported guideline usage, reading of the guideline, talked/showed doctor the guideline)\n\n【46】7\\. Clinical treatment outcomes (including results of investigations such as pulmonary function testing, BMI, biopsies and haematological and biochemical tests)\n\n【47】8\\. Acceptability of guidelines to the consumer (including satisfaction with the information provided, satisfaction with how it was offered, effectiveness of support provided)\n\n【48】9\\.

Date of the most recent search: October 2007.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomized trials which compared interventions by community pharmacy personnel to promote smoking cessation amongst their clients who were smokers compared to usual pharmacy support or any less intensive programme. The main outcome measure was smoking cessation rates at six months or more after the start of the intervention.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were extracted by one author and checked by the second, noting: the country of the trial, details of participant community pharmacies, method of subject recruitment, smoking behaviour and characteristics of participants on recruitment, method of randomization, description of the intervention and of any pharmacy personnel training, and the outcome measures.  \nMethodological quality was assessed according to the extent to which the allocation to intervention or control was concealed. Because of the potentially important cluster effects, we also rated trials according to whether they checked for or adjusted for these but, in the absence of consensus on how to pool cluster level data, we adopted a narrative approach to synthesizing the data, rather than a formal meta‐analysis.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We identified two trials which met our selection criteria. They included a total of 976 smokers. Both trials were set in the UK and involved a training intervention which included the Stages of Change Model; they then compared a support programme involving counselling and record keeping against a control receiving usual pharmacy support. In both studies a high proportion of intervention and control participants began using NRT.  \nBoth studies reported smoking cessation outcomes at three time points. However, the follow‐up points were not identical (three, six and 12 months in one, and one, four and nine months in the other), and the trend in abstinence over time was not linear in either study, so the data could not be combined. One study showed a significant difference in self‐reported cessation rates at 12 months: 14.3% versus 2.7% (p < 0.001); the other study showed a positive trend at each follow‐up with 12.0% versus 7.4% (p = 0.09) at nine months.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The limited number of studies to date suggests that trained community pharmacists, providing a counselling and record keeping support programme for their customers, may have a positive effect on smoking cessation rates. The strength of evidence is limited because only one of the trials showed a statistically significant effect.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Smoker\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Community Environment\n*   Behavioral Therapy\n*   Pharmacist\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Smoking cessation\n*   Tobacco abstinence\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

They may have a role because nicotine replacement therapy, an effective cessation pharmacotherapy, is available without prescription in many countries. People also come to pharmacies with prescriptions for medications to help them quit. The review included two trials and found limited evidence that training pharmacy personnel to offer counselling and record keeping services to their customers may help smokers to quit.\n\n【24】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Antenatal immunoglobulin for fetal red blood cell alloimmunization\n\n【24】Pregnant women may develop antibodies in response to antigens on fetal red blood cells. The antibodies that result can cross the placenta to the fetus and break down red blood cells, leading to fetal anaemia. This has become less common with the routine use of anti D immunoglobulin in pregnant women with a Rhesus D‐negative blood group and no pre‐existing anti‐D antibodies, but remains a cause of fetal death. Currently, standard management involves monitoring antibody titres in conjunction with ultrasound assessment of fetal well‐being, and the use of intrauterine transfusion when fetal anaemia is diagnosed. Unfortunately, intrauterine transfusion poses significant risks because of its inherent invasiveness and procedure‐related risks, including a risk of perinatal death.\n\n【25】Intravenous immunoglobulin has been proposed as an alternative form of treatment, with the advantage of being less invasive. There are no randomized trials of intravenous immunoglobulin given antenatally to women with severe fetal red blood cell alloimmunization to show if this offers any benefit over other forms of treatment or no treatment, but there are case series suggesting a possible role in delaying the onset of fetal anaemia requiring invasive intrauterine transfusion.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】There is no information currently available from randomized trials to conclude whether the maternal administration of immunoglobulin in the antenatal period confers any benefit compared with other or 'no treatment' for fetal red blood cell alloimmunization. Although this obstetric complication has become less prevalent with the routine use of anti D immunoglobulin, there are still a significant number of cases of fetal anaemia that develop and which can ultimately lead to hydrops or death.\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】Whilst intrauterine transfusion (IUT) is an effective treatment, its invasiveness and potential risk of procedure‐related perinatal mortality justifies further research in this area. In an era when fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler assessment has eliminated the need for amniotic fluid evaluation, thus rendering the assessment of alloimmunization far less invasive, further reduction of the need for intrauterine manipulation would be the logical next step. Trials are needed to establish an evidence base toward this prospect. Of relevance would be whether proposed treatments such as intravenous immunoglobulin can be administered safely, and whether such treatment may be effective in successive pregnancies.\n\n【32】Background\n----------\n\n【33】Antigens on the red blood cell (erythrocyte) include the Rhesus antigens D, C, c, E, and e, as well as less common antigens such as Kell, MNS, and P antigens. Red blood cell alloimmunization has become less common with the routine use of anti D immunoglobulin during pregnancy and after delivery, but it may still occur with either D or non‐D red blood cell antigens. Maternal antibodies may develop as a result of exposure to foreign red blood cell antigens via mechanisms including blood transfusion and transplacental fetomaternal haemorrhage. Since many of the red blood cell antigens are expressed on the fetal erythrocyte by the end of the first trimester, these maternal antibodies can cross the placenta. If they activate fetal red blood cell destruction (or, in the case of Kell antibodies, additionally suppress erythropoiesis), fetal anaemia can result, ultimately leading to hydrops or death, or both.\n\n【34】Traditionally, management of pregnant women demonstrating these antibodies has involved monitoring their antibody titres. In the past, once a titre reached a critical level, further evaluation via amniotic fluid bilirubin levels as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis would be performed. Such evaluation is generally deemed mandatory when titres reach 32, as these levels correlate with a possibility of severe fetal anaemia in all antibody cases except Kell‐alloimmunization. In the case of Kell‐alloimmunization, antibodies not only activate fetal haemolysis, but also act independently to suppress erythropoiesis at the progenitor cell level, making the critical titre difficult to estimate . In the last decade, diagnosis of fetal anaemia via Doppler assessment of the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity has revolutionized practice in many centres, eliminating the need for amniotic fluid evaluation and thus rendering the management of alloimmunization far less invasive .\n\n【35】Despite the almost universal use of Doppler ultrasound in the evaluation of fetal red cell alloimmunization, the invasive requirement of the established therapy of choice, intrauterine transfusion (IUT), remains. Whilst experience in this field has improved greatly, complication rates are still impressive, with procedure‐related perinatal mortality rates of up to 5% .\n\n【36】Alternative treatment modalities have been proposed and trialled. These include plasmapheresis, oral erythrocyte membrane therapy, various medical agents such as azathioprine, promethazine and prednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) . The latter has been used successfully in haematological and other obstetric settings, most notably and analogously in the area of platelet alloimmunization . IVIG use was reported in isolated cases of red blood cell alloimmunization in the 1980s , and only began to be trialled more extensively in case series from 1990 onward . As a proposed alternative treatment to IUT, IVIG is particularly attractive in the management of women with a history of severe alloimmunization in previous pregnancies. These women are at risk of alloimmunization and consequent fetal anaemia early in their subsequent pregnancy, when the technical difficulty and potential morbidity associated with IUT is at its highest. The use of IVIG instead of IUT, or to enable a delay in IUT, also reduces the risk of iatrogenic induction of maternal red cell alloimmunization .\n\n【37】IVIG has proved safe in many applications, but is not free from adverse effects. Transmission of blood‐borne diseases is now rare in most centres due to rigorous infectious control measures, but other serious reactions remain a real, if rare possibility. These include severe headaches, renal dysfunction, and maternal cardiovascular compromise .\n\n【38】There have been no randomized controlled trials comparing the use of IVIG either compared with no treatment or other treatments for fetal red blood cell alloimmunization. There have been 11 case series since 1990, with the majority (eight) examining the maternal administration of IVIG rather than fetal administration . Ten of these studies concluded that IVIG offers benefit. The first  reported a reduction in disease severity only in one case (involving anti‐Kell antibodies), otherwise no benefit of IVIG was identified. Several authors  have postulated that the reason for this lack of benefit was the lack of early commencement of therapy, suggesting the importance of commencing IVIG treatment before the onset of fetal anaemia.\n\n【39】The largest case series to date included 69 cases retrospectively, and concluded that adjuvant IVIG followed by IUT improved fetal outcomes . The latest case series was reported in 2009 , with all six women receiving IVIG as well as intrauterine and/or intraperitoneal transfusions. The use of these treatments in conjunction with serial Doppler ultrasound monitoring led to a delay in the onset of expected invasive therapy in five of the six women, as compared with poor outcomes in previous pregnancies. The majority (five) of women commenced IVIG in the second trimester.\n\n【40】All case series thus far have predominantly involved anti‐D alloimmunization. Three studies included women with anti‐Kell antibodies ; one also included a woman with anti‐c antibodies as the causal factor for disease . Based on current limited evidence, there appears to be a potential role for IVIG administration in the management of fetal red blood cell alloimmunization. However, there is a notable lack of comparative trials.\n\n【41】### Description of the condition\n\n【42】Since the widespread introduction of routine anti D immunoglobulin prophylactic administration, the incidence of Rhesus D allommunization has decreased dramatically . Overall, 1.1% of women in one study from the United States were identified to carry an antibody previously reported to be associated with haemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn . When allommunization does occur, it can result in a very difficult disease to treat, often relying on the diagnosis of fetal anaemia and then usually serial invasive procedures to correct the anaemia in‐utero. In the absence of treatment, this disease can lead to fetal death.\n\n【43】Current treatment involves IUT, which although potentially life‐saving, unfortunately also involves intrinsic procedure‐related risks including perinatal mortality.\n\n【44】### Description of the intervention\n\n【45】The use of IVIG administered to the mother during the antenatal period.\n\n【46】### How the intervention might work\n\n【47】The use of IVIG during the antenatal period may ameliorate the disease and allow later and less frequent red blood cell transfusions to the fetus, thus reducing the invasive procedure‐related risk to the pregnancy.\n\n【48】Postulated mechanisms for the efficacy of IVIG in this area include the inhibition of transplacental passage of red blood cell antibodies, and/or a direct Fc blockade of the fetal reticuloendothelial system, thus reducing the degree of fetal phagocytosis of sensitised fetal red blood cells . Some authors have also suggested that IVIG can downregulate the maternal immune response, for example by increasing suppressor T cell function, thereby inhibiting antibody synthesis . Additionally, IVIG may bind maternal antibodies or enhance their dissociation from antigenic components, decreasing their destructive effects .\n\n【49】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【50】A systematic review of the available literature is needed to establish if there is sufficient evidence to establish that IVIG for severe red cell alloimmunization is an efficacious treatment which should be recommended for women with this disease or, if not, to dissuade clinicians from continuing with its use.\n\n【51】Objectives\n----------\n\n【52】To systematically review the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) antenatally to women with severe fetal red blood cell alloimmunization.\n\n【53】Methods\n-------\n\n【54】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【55】#### Types of studies\n\n【56】Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials, with parallel study design.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】**Primary objective**\n\n【3】*   To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury (excluding traumatic brain injury (TBI)), when compared to usual care or other experimental intervention.\n\n【4】**Secondary objectives**\n\n【5】*   To assess the effectiveness of different types of psychosocial interventions.\n\n【6】*   To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on different post‐injury outcomes (physical disability, mental health, social functioning).\n\n【7】--------------\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】### Description of the condition\n\n【10】Injuries account for nine percent of the world's deaths and 12% of the world's disease burden , and may arise from road traffic crashes, poisoning, falls, fires, drowning, interpersonal violence and war, self‐inflicted injuries, as well as other sources. The WHO states that \"While mortality is an important indicator of the magnitude of a health problem, it is important to realise that for each injury death, there are several thousand injury survivors who are left with permanent disabling sequelae\" ( WHO 2002 p3). Even in patients with physical problems that do not arise from traumatic injury, the ability to function effectively is strongly influenced by factors such as mood, coping skills and social support. Interventions that influence these factors are therefore likely to contribute to better health and more cost effective outcomes .\n\n【11】Schnyder et al found that 25.5% of severely injured accident victims showed some form of psychiatric morbidity after one year, and that this \"can be predicted to some degree by mainly psychosocial variables\" ( Schnyder 2001 p653), and in particular, patients' early cognitive appraisal of their accident. However, while NICE  has endorsed the effectiveness of longer‐term psychosocial interventions in the aftermath of psychological trauma, the effectiveness of short‐term 'debriefing' has not been demonstrated . While psychosocial interventions following physical injury may alleviate psychiatric co‐morbidity, we wish to focus on the benefits of preventative interventions rather than therapeutic interventions per se. To date, there has been no attempt to systematically review the effects of psychosocial interventions that seek to alleviate the distress of those who have acquired physical injuries, including subsequent disability. This review will provide this evidence. For the purposes of this review, by disability we mean any diminution in an individual's psychological, social or physical functioning that has arisen following, and as a consequence of, a traumatic physical injury.\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】Psychosocial interventions are interventions that have their primary mode of action through psychological or social processes. Such interventions include, for instance, direct therapeutic work, health education and social support.\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Physical injury may result in impairment of physical functioning. The way in which people respond to such impairment, along with the social and environmental context they live in, determines the degree of disability associated with the injury. A physical injury may disable people in terms of their physical, mental or social functioning. An individual's own ability to cope with physical impairment, as well as their broader social situation, offers opportunities to reduce the extent to which physical injury results in disability. By providing people with psychological and social resources that assist their coping responses to physical impairment, psychosocial interventions may be able to prevent physical impairment resulting in physical, mental and social disability.\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】This will be the first systematic review to consider the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to reduce disability following an injury that produces physical impairment.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】**Primary objective**\n\n【20】*   To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the prevention of physical, mental and social disability following traumatic physical injury (excluding traumatic brain injury (TBI)), when compared to usual care or other experimental intervention.\n\n【21】**Secondary objectives**\n\n【22】*   To assess the effectiveness of different types of psychosocial interventions.\n\n【23】*   To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on different post‐injury outcomes (physical disability, mental health, social functioning).\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】Randomised controlled trials that consider one or more defined psychosocial intervention for the prevention of physical disability, mental health problems or reduced social functioning as a result of traumatic physical injury. Cross‐over trials, cluster randomised trials and factorial trials will be included.\n\n【28】Non‐randomised intervention studies will be excluded.\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】Patients who have suffered a traumatic physical injury.\n\n【31】Trials which include people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) will be excluded unless they can be disaggregated from other physically injured people who receive the intervention. Trials which include people without traumatic physical injury (for example, psychological de‐briefing following a traumatic incident not resulting in physical injury) will be excluded if the results cannot be disaggregated to include only those who have suffered a traumatic physical injury. The full text of trials including patients with TBI or without traumatic physical injury will be retrieved, and will only be excluded if the data cannot be disaggregated. Musculoskeletal conditions incurred other than through a physical injury will not be included. Sexual assault will only be included if it results in a physical injury.\n\n【32】#### Types of interventions\n\n【33】We define 'psychosocial intervention' as being any intervention that focuses on psychological and/or social factors rather than biological factors . This may include, but is not limited to:\n\n【34】*   psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, non‐directive counselling, psychological debriefing and problem‐solving therapy;\n\n【35】*   social interventions such as befriending, mentoring and social support.\n\n【36】Psychosocial interventions are included as long as they are sufficiently described by trialists to facilitate replication. Interventions may be administered by any health professional (for example, psychologist, medical practitioner, nurse, occupational therapist) or lay person and in any form, for example, individual or group therapy, over the telephone, or in the form of written material.\n\n【37】Psychosocial interventions may be offered to enhance people's coping resources, without any suggestion that they are currently suffering through any type of psychopathology. Such interventions may prevent circumstances arising where their ability to cope is exceeded, resulting in a state of psychological disorder or variously defined psychopathologies.

In 2003, the World Health Organization recommended that infants be breastfed exclusively until six months of age, with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until at least two years of age. However, current breastfeeding rates in many countries do not reflect this recommendation.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To describe forms of breastfeeding support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, the timing of the interventions and the settings in which they have been used.\n\n【4】To examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, whether the support offered was proactive or reactive, face‐to‐face or over the telephone), and whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone.\n\n【5】To examine the effectiveness of different care providers and (where information was available) training.\n\n【6】To explore the interaction between background breastfeeding rates and effectiveness of support.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (29 February 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing extra support for healthy breastfeeding mothers of healthy term babies with usual maternity care.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】This updated review includes 100 trials involving more than 83,246 mother‐infant pairs of which 73 studies contribute data (58 individually‐randomised trials and 15 cluster‐randomised trials). We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in the review was mixed. Of the 31 new studies included in this update, 21 provided data for one or more of the primary outcomes. The total number of mother‐infant pairs in the 73 studies that contributed data to this review is 74,656 (this total was 56,451 in the previous version of this review). The 73 studies were conducted in 29 countries. Results of the analyses continue to confirm that all forms of extra support analyzed together showed a decrease in cessation of 'any breastfeeding', which includes partial and exclusive breastfeeding (average risk ratio (RR) for stopping any breastfeeding before six months 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95; _moderate‐quality evidence, 51 studies)_ and for stopping breastfeeding before four to six weeks (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; _moderate‐quality evidence, 33 studies)._ All forms of extra support together also showed a decrease in cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at six months (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92; _moderate‐quality evidence_ , 46 studies) and at four to six weeks (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; _moderate quality_ , 32 studies). We downgraded evidence to moderate‐quality due to very high heterogeneity.\n\n【15】We investigated substantial heterogeneity for all four outcomes with subgroup analyses for the following covariates: who delivered care, type of support, timing of support, background breastfeeding rate and number of postnatal contacts. Covariates were not able to explain heterogeneity in general. Though the interaction tests were significant for some analyses, we advise caution in the interpretation of results for subgroups due to the heterogeneity. Extra support by both lay and professionals had a positive impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Several factors may have also improved results for women practising exclusive breastfeeding, such as interventions delivered with a face‐to‐face component, high background initiation rates of breastfeeding, lay support, and a specific schedule of four to eight contacts. However, because within‐group heterogeneity remained high for all of these analyses, we advise caution when making specific conclusions based on subgroup results. We noted no evidence for subgroup differences for the any breastfeeding outcomes.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face‐to‐face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding.\n### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Populatio\n\n【19】*   Intending to breastfeed\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Pregnant\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Breastfeeding\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Interventio\n\n【21】*   Breastfeeding Support\n\n【22】###### Compariso\n\n【23】*   Usual Care\n\n【24】###### Outcom\n\n【25】*   Breastfeeding Stopped\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【27】### Support for breastfeeding mothers\n\n【28】**What is the issue?**\n\n【29】The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be breastfed exclusively until six months of age with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until he or she is at least two years old. We know that breastfeeding is good for the short‐term and long‐term health of both infants and their mothers. Babies are less likely to develop infections in the digestive tract, lungs or airways, and ears. They are also less likely to become overweight and develop diabetes later in life. The mothers are less likely to develop diabetes and to experience breast or ovarian cancer. Many mothers may stop breastfeeding before they want to as a result of the problems they encounter. Good care and support may help women solve these problems so that they can continue to breastfeed.\n\n【30】**Why is this important?**\n\n【31】By knowing what kind of support can be provided to help mothers with breastfeeding, we can help them solve any problems and continue to breastfeed for as long as they want to, wherever they live. Stopping breastfeeding early may cause disappointment and distress for mothers and health problems for themselves and their infants. Support can be in the form of giving reassurance, praise, information, and the opportunity for women to discuss problems and ask questions as needed. This review looked at whether providing extra organised support for breastfeeding mothers would help mothers to continue to breastfeed when compared with standard maternity care. We were interested in support from health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or from trained lay workers such as community health workers and volunteers.\n\n【32】**What evidence did we find?**\n\n【33】We searched for evidence on 29 February 2016 and identified a further 31 new trials for inclusion in the review. This updated review now includes 100 randomised controlled studies involving more than 83,246 women. The 73 trials that contributed to the analyses were from 29 countries and involved 74,656 women. Some 62% of the women were from high‐income countries, 34% from middle income countries and 4% from low‐income countries\n\n【34】All forms of extra organised support analyzed together showed an increase in the length of time women continued to breastfeed, either with or without introducing any other types of liquids or foods. This meant that fewer women stopped any breastfeeding or exclusively breastfeeding (moderate quality evidence) before four to six weeks and before six months. Both trained volunteers and doctors and nurses had a positive impact on breastfeeding.\n\n【35】Factors that may have contributed to the success for women who exclusively breastfed were face‐to‐face contact (rather than contact by telephone), volunteer support, a specific schedule of four to eight contacts and high numbers of women who began breastfeeding in the community or population (background rates).\n\n【36】The term 'high‐quality evidence' means that we are confident that further studies would provide similar findings. No outcome was assessed as being 'high‐quality'. The term 'moderate‐quality evidence' means that we found wide variations in the findings with some conflicting results in the studies in this review. New studies of different kinds of support for exclusive breastfeeding may change our understanding of how to help women to continue with exclusive breastfeeding.\n\n【37】The methodological quality of the studies was mixed and the components of the standard care interventions and extra support interventions varied a lot and were not always well described. Also, the settings for the studies and the women involved were diverse.\n\n【38】**What does this mean?**\n\n【39】Providing women with extra organised support helps them breastfeed their babies for longer. Breastfeeding support may be more helpful if it is predictable, scheduled, and includes ongoing visits with trained health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or with trained volunteers. Different kinds of support may be needed in different geographical locations to meet the needs of the people within that location. We need additional randomised controlled studies to identify what kinds of support are the most helpful for women.\n\n【40】--------------\n\n【41】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【42】### Implications for practice\n\n【43】When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face‐to‐face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding.\n\n【44】### Implications for research\n\n【45】There is a very large number of trials in this field and this number continues to grow. This has resulted in a great deal of research time, energy and funding. While there are still questions to address about how best to provide support, the key messages are clear – we have ample evidence to know that women need support to be available and to be provided using the characteristics we have identified to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. The key research question for the future is to identify how such support can best be provided consistently, for all women, in all countries. This becomes a scaling‐up issue, which needs implementation and quality improvement approaches rather than effectiveness studies.\n\n【46】Any future studies should describe in detail the attributes of the intervention (who delivered it, setting, intensity, proactive or reactive); standard care (Baby Friendly accreditation or not, staff trained in breastfeeding or not); the population group studied (low‐ versus high‐income, any selection criteria); and the background breastfeeding rates in the population studies. Studies should also examine the potential for synergy between support and other interventions that aim to increase breastfeeding rates, as it may be that a package of interventions is more effective than single interventions in tackling the multifaceted challenge of increasing breastfeeding rates. Packages to be tested could include peer and professional support along with, for example, antenatal education, staff training, and mother‐to‐mother support. Studies should also assess the effectiveness of lay, professional and combined support in different settings ‐ in particular in those communities with low rates of breastfeeding initiation. Implementation of the Baby Friendly Initiative should be accompanied by the continued monitoring of breastfeeding rates to explore whether its effect is similar in countries with differing rates of initiation and prevalence of breastfeeding.\n\n【47】Further study is also required to:\n\n【48】*   test the effectiveness of different training programmes (which should be well‐defined and reproducible) and should attempt to address impact on both exclusive and any breastfeeding where possible;\n\n【49】*   analyse and develop the theoretical basis for their approach, and analyse the elements of their approach that appear to have an impact, including training, timing, and intensity of the intervention, and differential impact on different population subgroups;\n\n【50】*   establish the cost‐effectiveness of different interventions;\n\n【51】*   investigate appropriate strategies for supporting women who wish to breastfeed for longer than six months;\n\n【52】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【53】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

For children, good quality evidence demonstrates that in both low‐, middle‐ and high‐income settings _not_ breastfeeding contributes to mortality due to infectious diseases , hospitalisation for preventable disease such as gastroenteritis, and respiratory disease , otitis media , increased rates of childhood diabetes and obesity , and increased dental disease . For women, there is good quality evidence that _not_ breastfeeding is associated with increased risks of breast and ovarian cancer, and diabetes . Lactational amenorrhoea is associated with exclusive/predominant breastfeeding and increases birth spacing when other forms of contraception are not available . Not being breastfed has an adverse impact on intelligence quotient (IQ), and educational and behavioural outcomes for the child . For many outcomes a dose‐response relationship exists, with the greatest benefit resulting from breastfeeding exclusively, with no added food or fluids, for around six months, with breastfeeding continuing thereafter as an important component of the infant’s diet . The negative impact of not breastfeeding has been demonstrated in a range of settings and population groups, though the balance of risks and benefits varies from setting to setting; for example, gastroenteritis will result in much higher mortality in low‐income countries .\n\n【64】Few health behaviours have such a broad‐spectrum and long‐lasting impact on population health, with the potential to improve life chances, health and well‐being. Victora 2016 estimated that each year, 823,000 deaths in children under five years and 20,000 deaths from breast cancer could be prevented by near universal breastfeeding. The cost burden of not breastfeeding was estimated by Rollins 2016 to represent 0.49% of world gross domestic product. The cost burden includes the cost of caring for children and women with chronic disease as well as short‐term illness .\n\n【65】The established negative impact on a population of not breastfeeding has resulted in global and national support for encouraging the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that, wherever possible, infants should be fed exclusively on breastmilk until six months of age , with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until at least two years of age. Other agencies and countries have endorsed the recommendation to breastfeed exclusively to around six months of age .\n\n【66】Due to the lack of standardised infant feeding indicators in high‐income countries, it is difficult to compare rates of breastfeeding across high‐income countries, or between high‐income, and low‐ and middle‐income countries. Therefore reported rates of breastfeeding need to be treated with caution. Victora 2016 suggest that, in general, there is an inverse relationship between breastfeeding rates and national wealth, though this relationship does not necessarily hold at the level of population subgroups. In high‐income countries, for example, the relationship is often seen to be the opposite, with rates higher among more affluent women .\n\n【67】Although some high‐income countries such as, Norway and Finland have high rates of both initiation and continuation of breastfeeding , rates in many high‐income countries are low. Initiation rates have risen in some high‐income countries in recent years , but there remains a marked decline in breastfeeding within the first few weeks after initiation, and exclusive breastfeeding to six months is rare .\n\n【68】In middle‐ and low‐income countries, while breastfeeding initiation and duration are generally higher than in high‐income countries, the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding for children younger than six months is only 37% . However, rates of exclusive breastfeeding for children younger than six months vary widely; Peru and Rwanda report rates of 72% and 85% respectively , while in Nigeria the rate is only 17%. In some low‐ and middle‐income countries, cultural practices such as prelacteal feeds, and giving water or teas alongside breastfeeding, account for the low rates of exclusive breastfeeding . This is particularly important as when breastfeeding continues for long periods of time, infant and young child mortality are reduced in the second year of life in low‐ and middle‐income countries .\n\n【69】Infant feeding is strongly related to inequalities in health, and, far from being an individual decision made by each woman, is influenced most strongly by structural determinants of health. The range of different rates of initiation and continuation of breastfeeding in different settings globally demonstrates that the key factors influencing infant feeding rates are likely to be sociocultural and related to societal and subgroup norms, public policy, and the availability of appropriate care and support, both professional and lay . In high‐income countries, for example, young mothers and women in low‐income groups, or women who ceased full‐time education at an early age, are least likely either to start breastfeeding or to continue for a period of time sufficient to benefit from the greatest health gain . Migrant women have been shown to adopt breastfeeding practices that are more similar to the country in which they live, than the country of their birth .\n\n【70】The early discontinuation of breastfeeding is not a decision that is taken lightly by women; it is associated with a high prevalence of problems such as painful breasts and nipples, concern about adequacy of milk supply and about the baby’s behaviour, and, in some settings, embarrassment related to breastfeeding in public. Many mothers report distress related to the decision to discontinue breastfeeding , even in cultures where breastfeeding rates are high . A key factor is the widespread lack of appropriate education for health professionals in the prevention and treatment of breastfeeding problems, which means that in a wide range of settings women commonly do not receive the quality of care needed from the health services . Enkin 2000 notes that industrial societies, on the whole, do not provide women with the opportunity to observe other breastfeeding women before they attempt breastfeeding themselves. In such societies, where breastfeeding is not normative behaviour and women may find it socially challenging to breastfeed, women are at particular risk of finding a serious lack of support to continue breastfeeding.\n\n【71】### Description of the intervention\n\n【72】‘Support’ is complex and can include several elements such as emotional and esteem‐building support (including reassurance and praise), practical help, informational support (including the opportunity to discuss and respond to women’s questions) and social support (including signposting women to support groups and networks) . It can be offered in a range of ways, by health professionals or lay people, trained or untrained, in hospital and community settings. It can be offered to groups of women or one‐to‐one, it can involve mother‐to‐mother support, and it can include family members (typically fathers or grandmothers) and wider communities. Support can be offered proactively by contacting women directly, or reactively, by waiting for women to get in touch. It can be provided face‐to‐face, by telephone or through social media. It can involve only one contact or regular, ongoing contact over several months.\n\n【73】Support is a complex intervention that tackles the multifaceted challenge of enabling women to breastfeed, and it should not be surprising that it varies from setting to setting and from study to study. However, it is likely that different forms of support in different contexts will be differentially effective. The global Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (Baby Friendly Initiative in some countries), which is a complex intervention incorporating 10 steps to successful breastfeeding, has been shown to be associated with increased breastfeeding rates . Over 21,000 facilities in 198 countries have ever been accredited, representing 27.5% of maternities worldwide , but most babies are still not born in a Baby Friendly environment.\n\n【74】In many settings, the health professionals who provide standard maternity care lack in‐depth knowledge of the prevention and treatment of breastfeeding problems. Therefore training and education of health professionals and others who provide breastfeeding support is critical. To address this, WHO and UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) have developed two breastfeeding training programmes: the 40‐hour Breastfeeding Counselling, and the five‐day Infant and Young Child Feeding Counselling, to train a cadre of health workers that can provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers and help them overcome problems .\n\n【75】### How the intervention might work\n\n【76】Support for breastfeeding women can work in different ways for different women. Timely, skilled support will help women to avoid or overcome breastfeeding problems that may lead to cessation of breastfeeding. In settings where breastfeeding is not the social norm, support can increase women’s belief in breastfeeding, and give them confidence to continue breastfeeding in the face of societal and family pressures that might undermine breastfeeding. In settings where exclusive breastfeeding is rare, support can dispel myths about the need for additional foods or fluids alongside breastfeeding to meet babies’ nutritional needs.\n\n【77】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【78】It is fundamentally important to examine the support that mothers receive when breastfeeding to determine what might be effective in helping women continue to breastfeed, whatever setting they live in. There is evidence that effective breastfeeding support interventions are cost‐effective and likely to realise a return on investment within a few years .\n\n【79】The purpose of this review is to examine interventions which provide extra support for mothers who are breastfeeding or considering breastfeeding; and to assess their impact on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and, where recorded, on health outcomes and maternal satisfaction. This review is an update of the previously published version Renfrew 2012b . The focus of this review is support for mothers and babies who are part of the general healthy population of their countries; mothers of premature and sick babies and mothers with some medical conditions have additional issues with breastfeeding, and interventions to support these mothers need to be reviewed separately. A Cochrane Review of breastfeeding education and support for mothers with multiple pregnancies is in progress . Whilst many support interventions include breastfeeding education for mothers, our review excludes interventions described as solely educational in nature and interventions with no postnatal component. A Cochrane Review of antenatal breastfeeding education for increasing breastfeeding duration has been published .\n\n【80】Specific objectives of this review are to describe forms of support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, and the settings in which they have been used. It was also of interest to examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, face‐to‐face or over the telephone), whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone, and whether the support was offered proactively to women, or whether they needed to seek it out. We also planned to examine the effectiveness of different care providers, and the possible impact of background breastfeeding rates in the countries or areas where the trials took place on the effectiveness of supportive interventions. It is important to note that the support interventions offered were in addition to standard care, which varied from setting to setting, though there are few settings in which standard care is consistently offered by people with training and skill in enabling women to breastfeed.\n\n【81】Objectives\n----------\n\n【82】1.  To describe forms of breastfeeding support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, the timing of the interventions and the settings in which they have been used.\n\n【83】2.  To examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, whether the support offered was proactive or reactive, face‐to‐face or over the telephone), and whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone.\n\n【84】3.  To examine the effectiveness of different care providers and (where information was available) training.\n\n【85】4.  To explore the interaction between background breastfeeding rates and effectiveness of support.\n\n【86】Methods\n-------\n\n【87】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【88】#### Types of studies\n\n【89】All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding. Cluster‐randomised controlled trials were also eligible for inclusion.\n\n【90】#### Types of participants\n\n【91】Participants were healthy pregnant women considering or intending to breastfeed or healthy women who were breastfeeding healthy babies.Healthy women and babies were considered those who did not require additional medical care (e.g. women with diabetes, women with HIV/AIDs, overweight or obese women) or surgical care (e.g. women who required a Caesarean Section). Studies which focused specifically on women with additional care needs were excluded.\n\n【92】#### Types of interventions\n\n【93】Contact with an individual or individuals (either professional or volunteer) offering support which is supplementary to the standard care offered in that setting. ‘Support’ interventions eligible for this review could include elements such as reassurance, praise, information, and the opportunity to discuss and to respond to the mother’s questions, and could also include staff training to improve the supportive care given to women. It could be offered by health professionals or lay people, trained or untrained, in hospital and community settings. It could be offered to groups of women or one‐to‐one, including mother‐to‐mother support, and it could be offered proactively by contacting women directly, or reactively, by waiting for women to get in touch. It could be provided face‐to‐face or over the phone, and it could involve only one contact or regular, ongoing contact over several months. Studies were included if the intervention occurred in the postnatal period alone or also included an antenatal component. Interventions taking place in the antenatal period alone were excluded from this review, as were interventions described as solely educational in nature.\n\n【94】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【95】The main outcome measure was the effect of the interventions on stopping breastfeeding by specified points in time. Primary outcomes were recorded for stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks and before six months postpartum. Other outcomes of interest in previous versions of this review were stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at other time points (two, three, four, nine and 12 months), measures of neonatal and infant morbidity (where available) and measures of maternal satisfaction with care or feeding method. Secondary outcomes were not considered in this update so that the review could be completed in time to inform the World Health Organisation’s review of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set of core outcomes for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breastfeeding reviews is currently being developed and the outcomes from this core set may influence future outcomes chosen for this review.\n\n【96】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【97】1.

Nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Alternatively, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways underlying nicotine addiction, independent of their antidepressant effects.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long‐term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in March 2004.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative therapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re‐initiate smoking cessation and using pharmacotherapy to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow up.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the pharmacotherapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up.\n\n【11】The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta‐analysis using a fixed effect model.\n\n【12】### Main results\n\n【13】There was one trial of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor moclobemide, and one of the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine. Neither of these detected a significant long‐term benefit. There were five trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; three of fluoxetine, one of sertraline and one of paroxetine. None of these detected significant effects, and there was no evidence of a significant benefit when results were pooled. There were 24 trials of bupropion and six trials of nortriptyline. When used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion (19 trials, OR 2.06, 95% confidence intervals \\[CI\\] 1.77 to 2.40) and nortriptyline (four trials, OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.70 to 4.59) both doubled the odds of cessation. In one trial the combination of bupropion and nicotine patch produced slightly higher quit rates than patch alone, but this was not replicated in a second study. Two trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation did not show a significant long‐term benefit. There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Concerns that bupropion may increase suicide risk are currently unproven.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long term smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not. The fact that only some forms of antidepressants aid cessation and that they do so regardless of depressive symptoms strongly suggests that their mode of action is independent of their antidepressant effect.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Smoker\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Antidepressants\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Antidepressants\n*   Placebo\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Smoking cessation\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Tobacco abstinence\n*   Withdrawal Due To Adverse Events\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

This medication can also cause seizures; at the dose used for smoking cessation the risk is estimated to be 1 in 1000. The tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline also doubles quit rates. The side effects of this medication include nausea and sedation. It may also cause urinary retention and can be dangerous in overdose. The efficacy of bupropion and nortriptyline does not appear to be restricted to people with a history of depression or depressive symptoms during smoking abstinence. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (for example, fluoxetine) have not consistently been shown to help smoking cessation.\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

However, in hospitals worldwide, continuous support during labour has become the exception rather than the routine.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】Primary: to assess the effects of continuous, one‐to‐one intrapartum support compared with usual care. Secondary: to determine whether the effects of continuous support are influenced by routine practices and policies the provider's relationship to the hospital and to the woman; an timing of onset.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2012).\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing continuous support during labour with usual care.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】We used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted the data. We sought additional information from the trial authors. We used random‐effects analyses for comparisons in which high heterogeneity was present, and we reported results using the average risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Twenty‐two trials involving 15,288 women met inclusion criteria and provided usable outcome data. Results are of random‐effects analyses, unless otherwise noted. Women allocated to continuous support were more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.12) and less likely to have intrapartum analgesia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96) or to report dissatisfaction (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79). In addition, their labours were shorter (MD ‐0.58 hours, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.31), they were less likely to have a caesarean (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) or instrumental vaginal birth (fixed‐effect, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96), regional analgesia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99), or a baby with a low five‐minute Apgar score (fixed‐effect, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95). There was no apparent impact on other intrapartum interventions, maternal or neonatal complications, or breastfeeding. Subgroup analyses suggested that continuous support was most effective when the provider was neither part of the hospital staff nor the woman's social network, and in settings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely available. No conclusions could be drawn about the timing of onset of continuous support.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Continuous support during labour has clinically meaningful benefits for women and infants and no known harm. All women should have support throughout labour and birth.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Normal Labor\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Clinical Support\n*   Coping Support\n*   Labor Care Management\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Usual Care\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Cesarean Section\n*   Finding Of Duration Of Labor\n*   Postpartum Depression\n*   Breast Fed\n*   Vaginal Delivery\n*   Intensive Care\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Continuous support for women during childbirth\n\n【24】Continuous support in labour increased the chance of a spontaneous vaginal birth, had no harm, and women were more satisfied.\n\n【25】Historically women have been attended and supported by other women during labour and birth. However in many countries, as more women are giving birth in hospital rather than at home, continuous support during labour has become the exception rather than the norm. This may contribute to the dehumanisation of women's childbirth experiences. Modern obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, information and advocacy. These may enhance physiologic labour processes as well as women's feelings of control and competence, and thus reduce the need for obstetric intervention. The review of studies included 23 trials (22 providing data), from 16 countries, involving more than 15,000 women in a wide range of settings and circumstances. The continuous support was provided either by hospital staff (such as nurses or midwives), women who were not hospital employees and had no personal relationship to the labouring woman (such as doulas or women who were provided with a modest amount of guidance), or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network (such as her husband, partner, mother, or friend). Women who received continuous labour support were more likely to give birth 'spontaneously', i.e. give birth with neither caesarean nor vacuum nor forceps. In addition, women were less likely to use pain medications, were more likely to be satisfied, and had slightly shorter labours. Their babies were less likely to have low five‐minute Apgar scores. No adverse effects were identified. We conclude that all women should have continuous support during labour. Continuous support from a person who is present solely to provide support, is not a member of the woman's social network, is experienced in providing labour support, and has at least a modest amount of training, appears to be most beneficial. In comparison with having no companion during labour, support from a chosen family member or friend appears to increase women's satisfaction with their childbearing experience.\n\n【26】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effectiveness of metformin co treatment (prior to ovarian stimulation) in PCOS women receiving IVF or ICSI in achieving pregnancy or live birth.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by chronic anovulation (failure or absence of ovulation) and hyperandrogenism (excessive production of male hormones in women), with clinical manifestations of irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, hirsutism and/or acne . The condition is the most common endocrinopathy in women affecting approximately 5‐10 percent of women of reproductive age .\n\n【6】PCOS is a heterogenous condition, both clinically and bio chemically, and a new internationally agreed definition of PCOS has been recently proposed by an international consensus workshop group . This consensus group recommended that diagnosis of PCOS requires that at least two of the following three criteria are met Oligo‐ and/or anovulation (infrequent or no ovulation) Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Other causes for hyperandrogenism which mimic PCOS (such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome or androgen‐secreting tumours) should be excluded.\n\n【7】The primary aetiology of PCOS is unknown  However, insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia is a prominent feature of the syndrome and appears to have a pathophysiologic role in the hyperandrogenism of the disorder for both lean and obese women with PCOS . Hyperinsulinemia results in increased ovarian androgen biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro  and decreased sex hormone‐binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis from the liver  leading to increased bioavailability of free androgens.\n\n【8】A number of treatments have been used in an attempt to induce ovulation and pregnancy in infertile anovulatory PCOS women. The traditional use of clomiphene citrate as first line medical treatment results in modest pregnancy rates . Recently, the use of insulin sensitizer's, such as metformin, have been used as an alternate treatment given the association of insulin resistance contributing to anovulation in women with PCOS ( Nestler 2002 ; Costello 2003 ; ).\n\n【9】Metformin is an oral, water‐soluble biguanide used in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus which is antihyperglycaemic in action and does not cause hypoglycaemia. It enhances insulin sensitivity in both the liver, where it inhibits hepatic glucose production, and the peripheral tissue, where it increases glucose uptake and utilization into muscle tissue .\n\n【10】Patients with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) have been demonstrated to have a longer duration of treatment, use a higher total FSH dose, produce large numbers of follicles and oocytes with high serum estradiol (E2) levels resulting in an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), have an elevated cancellation rate and lower conception rate .\n\n【11】There is physiologic rationale for believing that suppression of insulin levels, with insulin sensitising agents such as metformin, in women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) might ameliorate the adverse effects on ovarian stimulation and consequently improve treatment outcome such as ovulation and pregnancy rates . In addition, metformin may also act directly on ovarian thecal cells to decrease androgen production .\n\n【12】The overall aim of this review is to determine the effectiveness of metformin used in combination with IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To determine the effectiveness of metformin co treatment (prior to ovarian stimulation) in PCOS women receiving IVF or ICSI in achieving pregnancy or live birth.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that compare metformin treatment with placebo or no treatment in PCOS women who underwent IVF/ICSI cycles will be considered for inclusion in the review.  \nQuasi randomised trials will not be include.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or strategies which promote participation in physical activity in daily life in individuals with CF.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex, progressive, life‐limiting disease predominantly affecting children and young adults. It is the most common inherited, life‐shortening illness of childhood with a carrier rate of 1 in 25, and an incidence of 1 in 2500 live births . It is a multi‐system disease that is characterised by chronic suppurative lung disease, including bronchiectasis, progressing to respiratory failure . Mortality due to CF has improved considerably over the past decades with children born this century expected to live into their fourth and fifth decades, and beyond .\n\n【7】Physical activity is an encompassing term relating to any bodily movement that results in an increase in energy expenditure above baseline resting energy expenditure . Physical activity includes structured exercise and sport activities, as well as activities involved in play, work, transportation, chores and recreational pursuits . Habitual physical activity (HPA) implies the performance of physical activity within the context of regular daily life .\n\n【8】Participation in physical activity on a regular basis has important health benefits particularly in reducing the risk of non‐communicable diseases such as obesity and heart disease . In healthy adults at least 150 minutes of physical activity each week (moderate‐vigorous intensity) is required to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, bone health and reduce the risk of non‐communicable diseases and depression . Consequently, strategies designed to improve the uptake of physical activity are of great importance. In an earlier review targeting healthy individuals, Foster found professional advice with continued support could encourage short‐term improvement in physical activity participation, with more research required to identify the best long‐term strategies .\n\n【9】In individuals with CF there are no established targets for participation in physical activity, nor have ideal strategies to promote physical activity been identified. Although supervised group‐exercise programs are regularly used to improve physical activity levels in other chronic lung diseases , the unique nature of CF prevents the use of this strategy. Due to the significant risks associated with cross‐infection, patients must be segregated and isolated from their peers  and are not permitted to exercise together in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Consequently physical activity interventions are usually limited to advice and support provided at an individual’s clinic visit. Whether alternative interventions, for example coaching or motivational interviewing, have a more positive influence on the uptake and continuation of physical activity in the CF population is unclear.\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Physiological, behavioural, psychological and environmental variables impact on the performance of physical activity . Strategies which address these variables and: provide education regarding health benefits ; provide physical skills practice ; overcome perceived barriers fostering enjoyment of activity and providing motivation , are strategies which are likely to be successful in promoting ongoing adherence to physical activity participation.\n\n【12】Healthcare professionals generally regard participation in physical activity as beneficial for people with CF . Undertaking regular physical activity may diminish dyspnoea and improve exercise tolerance, as well as exert a positive influence on bone mineral accretion, blood glucose regulation and clearance of pulmonary secretions . Despite being regularly prescribed, adherence to exercise programs is poor. In the adult CF population, adherence to prescribed exercise programs has been reported at around 50% . Furthermore, participation in exercise decreases with increasing perception of illness severity, with patients ascribing decreased importance and increased burden of exercise compared to other therapies when disease severity increases .  Identifying strategies which promote the uptake and continued participation in physical activity could have long‐term health benefits for people with CF. Whether the same strategies to promote activity participation are effective in both adults and children may be elucidated in this review.\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】A prior Cochrane review has focused on interventions to promote physical activity in previously sedentary adults, however, the review excluded those who had pre‐existing medical conditions . Consequently, it is unknown whether interventions identified in the review which target behaviour adaptation or involve strategies for delivering physical activity programmes, have application to individuals with CF.\n\n【15】If strategies that promote physical activity participation are successful in improving uptake and ongoing participation in physical activity for individuals with CF, then health improvements such as improved blood glucose control, bone mineral accretion  and enhanced clearance of pulmonary secretions could be expected . Such improvements may be reflected as increases in exercise capacity, respiratory function and quality of life, all of which are associated with improved prognostic outcomes in CF .\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Previous reviews in CF have focused on exercise participation and measures of exercise or aerobic capacity . This review will allow clinicians to identify appropriate intervention strategies for encouraging uptake and long‐term participation in physical activity. This review will also allow identification of new areas of future research for promoting physical activity participation in people with CF. Novel strategies may be required to enhance participation in physical activity whilst maintaining strict infection control procedures.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or strategies which promote participation in physical activity in daily life in individuals with CF.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】People with CF aged over five years, with any degree of disease severity.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the efficacy and safety of plerixafor for the mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in people with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and multiple myeloma (MM) with the indication for autologous transplantation.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Malignant lymphomas are malignancies of the lymph nodes and lymphatic system with possible involvement of other organs, and can be differentiated into non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of the bone marrow and is classified among the plasma cell neoplasms by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n【7】Non‐Hodgkin lymphoma derives from B and T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells at varying stages of maturation. The most common classification of NHL is the WHO system which was last updated in 2008. It classifies the NHL in B‐cell neoplasms and T/NK‐cell neoplasms, whereby about 85% of the NHL descend from mature and progenitor B lymphocytes . A clinical approach is the classification to indolent NHL (approximately 70% of all NHL) and aggressive NHL (approximately 30% of all NHLs) . The annual incidence of NHL varies between different regions in the world. In North America the incidence is estimated to be 13.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, while in the European Union it is 8.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, with the global incidence amounting to 5.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. The worldwide mortality is 2.5% and is quite similar in the various global regions . The median age at diagnosis is around 60 years, and varies only slightly between the diverse types of NHL .\n\n【8】Hodgkin lymphoma arises from germinal centre or post‐germinal centre B cells, and is associated with unique neoplastic cells called Sternberg‐Reed cells which morphologically differentiate HL from NHL. The WHO classifies HL into the classic (approximately 93% of all HL) and the nodular lymphocyte predominant (approximately 7% of all HL) type . Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for about 10% of all lymphomas and has an annual incidence of 2 to 3 per 100,000 inhabitants in Western countries . Hence HL is a comparatively rare disease, but it is one of the most common malignancies in young adults. In industrialised countries the age distribution of HL shows a first peak in the third decade and a second peak around the age of 60 .\n\n【9】Multiple myeloma, one of the mature B‐cell neoplasms, is characterised by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow compartment, by the increased production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), and bone destruction. This disorder may be preceded by a pre‐malignant state called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Overall, MM accounts for approximately 10% of all haematologic malignancies and for 1% of all cancers . The annual incidence is approximately 4 to 5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Western countries . Multiple myeloma is an adult‐onset disease, with a median age at diagnosis of 66 and only 2% of patients younger than 40 years of age . To date, no curative approach exists for MM, and depending on the therapy the overall survival varies between a few months and some years. The 10‐year survival rate of young patients with ideal treatment is around 50% .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】High‐dose chemotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation is widely used as an effective treatment option for people with NHL, HL and MM . Stem cell transplantation is directed at restoring a functioning bone marrow in patients after myeloablative chemotherapy. In contrast to allogeneic transplantation with donor cells, in the autologous setting stem cells are collected from the patient and re‐infused after the high‐dose chemotherapy .\n\n【12】Commonly‐used agents for stem cell mobilisation are granulocyte colony‐stimulating factors (G‐CSF). The patient receives G‐CSF for up to eight days and as soon as sufficient CD34‐positive cells are detectable in the patient's peripheral blood, the stem cells are collected by stem cell harvest (aphereses) and stored for transplantation after the myeloablative therapy . The two types of traditional mobilisation methods, G‐CSF with chemotherapy (chemo‐mobilisation) or without chemotherapy ('steady‐state') leads to a failure rate of 5% to 40% of the cases, depending on definition, disease and mobilisation agents used . In contrast to G‐CSF mobilisation alone, chemo‐mobilisation leads to higher stem cell yield, a higher probability of getting grafts with a large number of CD34+ cells, fewer aphereses and even to an anti‐tumour effect. But chemo‐mobilisation is associated with higher toxicity and increased probability of complications . Major risk factors for mobilisation failure are advanced age, the diagnosis of NHL, progressive disease, previous radiotherapy, bone marrow involvement or prior treatment with lenalidomide or purine analogues, thrombocytopenia, and the failure of previous mobilisation attempts .\n\n【13】Plerixafor is a new agent, which apparently improves mobilisation and stem cell harvest, and reduces the required number of aphereses . It has mainly been studied in combination with G‐CSF mobilisation. Before its approval in Europe, plerixafor was only available at transplant centres in the compassionate use program (CUP). Positive results of this programme evaluating plerixafor in combination with G‐CSF in patients who had previously failed a mobilisation attempt (60% to 75%) strongly indicate the efficacy of this agent . Based on promising data from phase II studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were initiated comparing G‐CSF in combination with plerixafor to G‐CSF and placebo .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Plerixafor  was originally developed for the treatment of HIV infection. It inhibits the CXCR4 chemokine receptor that blocks the receptor binding of the stromal cell–derived factor‐1α. This interaction leads to the mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood, in mice as well as in humans . Moreover, plerixafor and G‐CSF are synergistic. Results of clinical trials indicate that plerixafor plus G‐CSF leads to an increased augmentation of mobilisation and release of CD34+ cells into the peripheral blood, facilitating effective apheresis .\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Even though a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute is already evaluating the role of plerixafor , this proposed systematic review will be of high relevance because a new systematic literature search will be performed and recent research results will be included. At the time of publication of the HTA report in March 2010, at least two clinical trials were still ongoing and not completed. For the HTA report no new systematic literature search was run, and it only evaluated the evidence used during the European approval process in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) already published in 2009.\n\n【18】Based on the published trials plerixafor might be an effective mobilisation agent in the treatment of people with NHL, HL in relapse and MM. A systematic review and meta‐analysis will provide the conclusive evidence to clarify the role of this agent and will also examine differences of treatment effectiveness caused by population group or chemotherapy agents. To choose the best therapeutic options, evidence is needed for decisions at individual patient level as well as for decisions in the health care system.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To evaluate the efficacy and safety of plerixafor for the mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells in people with non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and multiple myeloma (MM) with the indication for autologous transplantation.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】We will include only randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Urodynamic investigations measure bladder pressure and urine flow rate during bladder filling and voiding to assess the function of the lower urinary tract and identify the cause(s) of urinary storage or voiding symptoms.\n\n【15】In the evaluation of LUTS in men, the aim of urodynamic tests is to objectively demonstrate physiological dysfunction while differentiating between possible causes of the symptoms, so that the most effective method of treatment can be selected. For men with voiding dysfunction, urodynamics are commonly used to differentiate among bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), detrusor underactivity (DUA) and detrusor overactivity (DOA) . It is thought to be important to distinguish between LUTS due to BOO and LUTS due to DUA, as this may influence management decisions specifically in relation to surgery for BOO. Some low‐level evidence suggests that making this distinction is important, as clinical outcomes may be affected .\n\n【16】### Description of the condition\n\n【17】#### Definitions and terminology\n\n【18】##### Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)\n\n【19】LUTS may be divided into three categories depending on the phase of the micturition cycle affected.\n\n【20】*   Storage symptoms are those experienced during the storage phase and include frequency, nocturia, urgency (the symptoms of overactive bladder syndrome) and urinary incontinence .\n\n【21】*   Voiding symptoms are those arising during the voiding phase of the micturition cycle. These include slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining and terminal dribble .\n\n【22】*   Postmicturition symptoms are those experienced immediately following micturition and include a feeling of incomplete emptying and post‐micturition dribble .\n\n【23】This review will focus on the investigation of voiding dysfunction in men and therefore will primarily assess men with voiding and post‐micturition symptoms. Storage symptoms, in particular urinary incontinence, are already the main focus of another Cochrane review .\n\n【24】##### Voiding dysfunction\n\n【25】Voiding LUTS are experienced during the voiding phase (emptying the bladder) of micturition . The voiding phase of the micturition cycle alternates with the storage phase and is under voluntary brain control, leading to both contraction of the bladder wall and relaxation of the urethral sphincter. Voiding dysfunction is most commonly caused by poor contractility of the bladder wall in DUA or enlargement of the prostate gland in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), leading to BOO.\n\n【26】Voiding dysfunction in men may have many different causes; it is important to differentiate between these causes to determine appropriate management.\n\n【27】*   BOO may be caused by anatomical or functional problems. The most common cause is benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), which compresses the urethral canal, leading to obstruction of the normal flow of urine. Other anatomical causes of BOO include bladder tumour, urethral stricture, prostatitis and foreign body . Functional causes of BOO include detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia, in which neuronal injury, such as that occurring in spinal injury, leads to inappropriate contraction of the internal urethral sphincter during voiding, leading to retention. Other causes include primary bladder neck obstruction and pelvic floor dysfunction . Bladder outlet obstruction may be accompanied by DOA as the bladder tries to compensate for resistance to outflow .\n\n【28】*   DUA is defined as \"detrusor contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span\" . It is thought to be multi‐factorial in aetiology. \"Primary\" or \"idiopathic\" DUA is thought to be due to the natural age‐related decrease in detrusor contractility. However, not everyone in this group will become clinically symptomatic. Other causes of DUA include BOO (secondary to chronic overstretching of the detrusor muscle, leading to muscle damage and hence an inability to contract) and diabetes mellitus .\n\n【29】Voiding LUTS in men are a common problem. Several studies have demonstrated through autopsy that prevalence of histological BPH is around 10% for men in their 30s, 20% for men in their 40s, 50% to 60% for men in their 60s and 80% to 90% for men in their 70s and 80s . It is reported that among men 50 to 80 years of age, 90% suffer from voiding LUTS . In one population‐based study in the USA, it was reported that 6% of all men (n = 2125) over 40 years of age had isolated voiding dysfunction as defined by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Nine percent of all men had mixed voiding and storage LUTS . It is important to note that these figures may not reflect the true scope of the problem, as men may not present to a healthcare professional or admit that they are troubled, because of embarrassment. Alternatively, some men may be affected but may not find these symptoms to be a problem. LUTS in men become more common with increasing age. They are also associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus and a genetic susceptibility .\n\n【30】##### Overactive bladder syndrome\n\n【31】Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a diagnosis characterised by urinary urgency in the absence of urine infection. When demonstrable involuntary detrusor contractions associated with symptoms of OAB are observed during urodynamic studies, this is termed 'detrusor overactivity' (DOA) . Although not strictly a direct cause of voiding dysfunction, OAB is a major cause of LUTS in men. Therefore if present, OAB may influence a clinician's management plan for concomitant BOO, for example, by altering the likelihood of proceeding to surgery or counselling the patient about the chance of symptom resolution.\n\n【32】### Description of the intervention\n\n【33】The term 'urodynamics' is commonly used to encompass a wide variety of physiological measurements of bladder and urethral function that aim to demonstrate a causal abnormality of storage and voiding. The term is often used interchangeably to signify multi‐channel cystometry, but several tests, including non‐invasive free flow rate testing, can be described as urodynamic tests.\n\n【34】Cystometry is an invasive method of investigation: At a minimum, a catheter must be inserted into the bladder. A range of measurements can be taken, including urinary flow rate; pressure within the urethra, bladder and abdomen; and electrical nerve recording . A significant number of study participants have reported that undergoing these investigations was embarrassing and painful for them . Nevertheless, cystometric studies have been invaluable in aiding our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological processes involved in the development of voiding dysfunction .\n\n【35】When urodynamic studies are performed in men, the most important goal is to reproduce the symptoms, so that the causes of symptoms of voiding dysfunction and any associated storage abnormality can be determined. This is normally achieved first by asking the patient to urinate into a container that is used to measure the volume and rate of urine passed (uroflowmetry). The volume of urine contained in the bladder after urination (postvoid residual volume) can then be measured by an external ultrasound scan of the bladder or by catheterisation.\n\n【36】Next, a urinary catheter is normally inserted to fill the bladder with water, saline or contrast medium to allow controlled reproduction of symptoms. Bladder sensations during bladder filling are reported by patients, including a sensation of filling, a desire to void, urgency and a sense of discomfort or pain. Concurrently, various pressure measurements are taken during the phases of the micturition cycle by using fluid‐filled lines connected to external transducers, or 'microtip' transducers, inserted into a body cavity. When the bladder is deemed to be “full” (cystometric capacity), the patient is given permission to void, so that urinary flow rates can be related to changes in pressure during bladder emptying; this is termed a 'pressure‐flow study.' The main pressure measurements taken are:\n\n【37】*   intravesical pressure (pressure within the bladder; P <sub>ves </sub> ); and\n\n【38】*   abdominal pressure (pressure within the abdominal cavity, normally measured transrectally by using a rectal catheter; P <sub>abd </sub> ).\n\n【39】Both of these measurements are needed to derive the detrusor pressure (P <sub>det </sub> ), which is the difference between bladder and abdominal pressures (P <sub>ves </sub> ‐ P <sub>abd </sub> ) and is computed throughout the test. Variation in these pressure measurements during the phases of the micturition cycle facilitates the diagnosis of various conditions, provided a high‐quality study is achieved.\n\n【40】#### Other types of urodynamics\n\n【41】Videourodynamics is another method of assessing function by using synchronous x‐ray or ultrasound imaging of the bladder with multi‐channel cystometry. This live imaging of the bladder may be recorded for future review. Ambulatory urodynamics involves using portable devices to measure multi‐channel cystometry carried out with natural bladder filling. This allows patients to carry out their normal activities of daily living while they are being urodynamically assessed.\n\n【42】Gas cystometry uses carbon dioxide as the medium for filling the bladder during the study. This approach has been found to be unreliable and is not now recommended . Surface electromyography may be used as an indirect measure of pelvic floor and sphincter muscle contractility, but it is not commonly used in clinical practice.\n\n【43】#### Risks of invasive urodynamic tests\n\n【44】The main risks associated with urodynamic testing are those associated with the process of urethral catheterisation, such as dysuria (painful urination) and urinary tract infection (UTI). A separate Cochrane review addresses interventions to reduce the incidence of infection . Urodynamic tests also require the use of sophisticated machines and technical expertise, both of which have cost implications for the healthcare system. Men may find testing to be an uncomfortable or embarrassing experience.\n\n【45】The reproducibility of cystometry as a diagnostic investigation has been called into question , as have its specificity and sensitivity in differentiating between causes of LUTS . It has been suggested that correlation between urodynamic findings and symptoms in men with LUTS may be poor .\n\n【46】### How the intervention might work\n\n【47】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommends that men contemplating surgery for the treatment of LUTS should be offered invasive urodynamic investigations .\n\n【48】A Committee of the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) in 2009 published a recent overview of the best scientific evidence with regard to the role of cystometry in the management of people with urinary incontinence or voiding difficulties . This overview advised that evidence demonstrating that invasive urodynamics improves clinical outcomes in men investigated for LUTS related to BOO and DOA is limited; nonetheless the ICI advised that the investigation should be performed before surgical intervention is provided . The research behind these recommendations is conflicting. Some studies have suggested that preoperative detection of DOA aided in the prediction of postoperative complications such as incontinence . Other evidence supports the contrary assertion that preoperative DOA does not predict postprostatectomy incontinence .\n\n【49】It is possible that one type of urodynamic investigation may provide more useful information than another. This issue has been addressed by studies comparing the utility of ambulatory urodynamics and conventional cystometry, particularly in determining the contribution of detrusor overactivity to LUTS in men. In one study, conventional urodynamics was compared with ambulatory urodynamics, and ambulatory urodynamics was found to be more sensitive in detecting DOA; however, this finding did not correlate with a better outcome .\n\n【50】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【51】The diagnostic accuracy of a test is normally determined by verifying test results against a reference ('gold') standard that defines true disease status. The diagnostic performance of cystometry cannot be assessed in this way, however, because no gold standard has been accepted. In the absence of a gold standard, there may be no alternative to evaluating whether the treatment response after cystometry leads to improved health gains compared with the treatment response based on tests that do not include cystometry.\n\n【52】Furthermore, these tests are not without cost: They are invasive and expensive and may produce adverse effects. For the financial year 2011‐2012, in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, urodynamic testing for one patient on an outpatient basis was calculated to cost £147. This cost increased to £340 on a day‐case basis. With regard to adverse effects, it is estimated that cystometry results in at least a 3% incidence of symptomatic UTI .\n\n【53】The value of accurate diagnosis depends on the availability and effectiveness of appropriate treatments. It is of no clinical value unless it is known, for example, that cystometry can distinguish between a group for whom surgery is effective and another group for whom it is neither effective nor contraindicated, or for which management needs to be altered in a specific way.\n\n【54】The value of invasive urodynamic investigation in the diagnosis and management of men with voiding dysfunction complaining of LUTS is therefore uncertain.\n\n【55】This review addresses whether the extra information generated by invasive urodynamic testing influences clinical decision making regarding men with voiding dysfunction and LUTS, and particularly whether this leads to improvement in clinical and economic outcomes.\n\n【56】Objectives\n----------\n\n【57】To determine whether performing invasive urodynamic investigation, as opposed to other methods of diagnosis such as non‐invasive urodynamics or clinical history and examination alone, improves the management of LUTS and voiding dysfunction in men. This goal will be achieved by critically appraising and summarising current evidence from randomised controlled trials related to better clinical outcomes and cost‐effectiveness.\n\n【58】The following hypotheses will be tested.\n\n【59】*   Do invasive urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes of men with voiding dysfunction?\n\n【60】*   Do invasive urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making?\n\n【61】*   Is one type of invasive urodynamics better than another for improving the outcomes of management of LUTS due to voiding dysfunction and/or for influencing clinical decisions?\n\n【62】*   Do invasive urodynamic tests identify risk factors for an adverse outcome from surgery?\n\n【63】The following comparisons will be made.\n\n【64】*   Invasive urodynamic tests versus clinical management without invasive urodynamics.\n\n【65】*   One type of urodynamic test versus another.\n\n【66】Because a reference ('gold') standard investigation is not available for comparison, this review will not aim to determine whether invasive urodynamic studies are reliable tests for making a clinical diagnosis, nor whether one type of urodynamic study is better than another for this purpose.\n\n【67】Methods\n-------\n\n【68】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【69】#### Types of studies\n\n【70】All randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials on the management of voiding dysfunction in which men with symptoms were randomly assigned to invasive urodynamic testing in at least one arm of the study.\n\n【71】Studies that did not report clinical outcomes of LUTS management nor effects on clinical decision making will be excluded.\n\n【72】#### Types of participants\n\n【73】All men with voiding LUTS presenting for investigation and management of their LUTS, as defined by the trial authors.\n\n【74】#### Types of interventions\n\n【75】##### Interventions\n\n【76】Invasive urodynamic investigations used as part of a diagnostic work‐up before management decisions are made. All types of urodynamics are eligible for consideration in this review , including the following.\n\n【77】*   Cystometry (simple, multi‐channel or subtracted: study of the pressure/volume relationship of the bladder during urine storage (filling cystometry) and urine expulsion (voiding cystometry)).\n\n【78】*   Pressure‐flow studies of voiding (study of the bladder pressure/urine flow rate relationship during voiding).\n\n【79】*   Urethral pressure measurements (profilometry: measurement of pressure within the urethra; urethral closure pressure is defined as the difference between intraluminal pressure in the urethra and intravesical pressure in the bladder at rest or during stress such as coughing or straining.\n\n【80】*   Leak point pressure measurements (pressure within the bladder at which leakage of urine from the urethra occurs: a direct measure of the closure function of the entire urethra).\n\n【81】*   Penile cuff test (non‐invasive measurement of bladder pressure during voiding, taken by intermittent occlusion of the urinary stream with an inflatable cuff placed around the penis).\n\n【82】*   Electromyography (direct measurement of the contractility of muscles concerned with continence, i.e. urethral sphincter, anal sphincter or pelvic floor muscles).\n\n【83】*   Videourodynamics (radiological (x‐ray) imaging and urodynamic measurements of the lower urinary tract performed simultaneously during filling and voiding).\n\n【84】*   Ambulatory urodynamic monitoring (urodynamic test performed with natural bladder filling under circumstances in which the patient's mobility is minimally restricted).\n\n【85】Cystoscopy and imaging tests (radiography, ultrasonography) are not usually considered routine urodynamic tests and will not be included in this review.\n\n【86】Although the specific management decisions made and the treatments that patients undergo following assessment with or without urodynamics are not included among the interventions assessed in this review, it is important to note that it is the outcome of these for which the usefulness of urodynamics is to be judged. Therefore, to minimise bias associated with systematic differences in care between centres or treatment modalities, included studies will be assessed for statements that diagnostic procedures and subsequent interventions have been carried out to an internationally accepted high standard. Furthermore, in trials in which a new intervention is being deployed, statements regarding whether training and learning curves have been concluded before the start of the trial will be sought.\n\n【87】##### Comparators\n\n【88】Investigations that do not include invasive tests, such as:\n\n【89】*   clinical history;\n\n【90】*   physical examination;\n\n【91】*   symptoms reported on enquiry or by questionnaire;\n\n【92】*   uroflowmetry and residual volume measurement;\n\n【93】*   urinary diaries; and\n\n【94】*   pad tests.\n\n【95】Uroflowmetry and residual urine measurement (recording the volume of fluid expelled via the urethra per unit time during voiding; and the volume of urine left in the bladder after voiding) can be considered as part of urodynamic testing, but alone, they are not by definition invasive and therefore will not be considered as a comparator in this review unless they are used in conjunction with other invasive urodynamic tests. This will allow determination of whether it is urodynamic studies as a whole, or mainly the uroflowmetry and residual urine measurement (non‐invasive) portions of the study, that influence decisions and outcomes.\n\n【96】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【97】Outcome measures used in this review were selected on the basis of their relevance to the clinical cure of or improvement in LUTS in men with voiding dysfunction, or to the management decisions that are made to address this problem. The primary outcomes of this review are regarded as clinical ones, as assessed by symptoms, questionnaire (e.g. IPSS) or urinary diary. In addition, the effect of invasive urodynamic testing in influencing clinical decisions was quantified. Studies that did not report clinical outcomes or effects on clinical decision making will be excluded.\n\n【98】We will adopt the recommendations provided by the Standardisation Committee of the International Continence Society for outcomes of research investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions for people with voiding dysfunction or urinary incontinence. These outcome categories include observations (symptoms) of people investigated for voiding dysfunction, quantification of symptoms, the clinician's observations (anatomical and functional), quality of life and socioeconomic measures .\n\n【99】Data could be obtained from history and questionnaire assessment, or from urinary diaries (including frequency of micturition and voided volumes).\n\n【100】The review will also include adverse events as outcome measures.\n\n【101】The ideal minimum follow‐up for our primary outcome and for other relevant clinical outcomes will be one year following urodynamics. Should trials report follow‐up of different length for each outcome, each will be analysed separately.\n\n【102】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【103】Number of men with continuing symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment following assessment with and without urodynamic studies.\n\n【104】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【105】###### Clinical decision making\n\n【106】*   Number of men receiving conservative, drug or surgical treatment.\n\n【107】*   Number of men whose treatment was changed after invasive urodynamics.\n\n【108】*   Need for repeat or alternative treatment.\n\n【109】###### Participant observations\n\n【110】*   Number of men with no improvement in symptoms of voiding dysfunction as defined by the authors of each trial.\n\n【111】*   Symptom scores (e.g. IPSS).\n\n【112】*   Overactive bladder symptoms (urgency, frequency, nocturia).\n\n【113】*   Urinary incontinence.\n\n【114】*   Use of pads.\n\n【115】*   Satisfaction with treatment.\n\n【116】*   Time to return to normal activity.\n\n【117】###### Quantification of associated symptoms\n\n【118】*   Frequency of micturition.\n\n【119】*   Nocturia.\n\n【120】*   Urine flow rate.\n\n【121】*   Voided volumes.\n\n【122】###### Clinician observations (anatomical and functional)\n\n【123】*   Clinician‐observed urinary incontinence.\n\n【124】*   Need for further treatment.\n\n【125】###### Adverse effects\n\n【126】*   Adverse events due to the method of investigation (e.g. UTI after urodynamic investigation).\n\n【127】*   Adverse events due to subsequent clinical management.\n\n【128】*   Deaths.\n\n【129】###### Quality of life\n\n【130】*   General health status measures (physical, psychological, other).\n\n【131】*   Condition‐specific health measures (specific instruments designed to assess the effect of voiding dysfunction on quality of life).\n\n【132】*   Psychological health status measures e.g. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).\n\n【133】###### Economic outcomes\n\n【134】*   Health economic measures.\n\n【135】*   Costs of investigations.\n\n【136】*   Costs of treatment and retreatment.\n\n【137】###### Other outcomes\n\n【138】*   Non‐prespecified outcomes judged important while conducting the review.\n\n【139】###### Quality of evidence\n\n【140】Primary and secondary outcomes, as defined above, were classified by the review authors as 'critical,' 'important' or 'not important' for decision making from the participant's perspective. The GRADE working group strongly recommends including up to seven outcomes in a systematic review. In this systematic review, GRADE methodology will be adopted for assessing the quality of available evidence for the following outcomes.\n\n【141】*   Number of men with continuing symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment following assessment with and without urodynamic studies.\n\n【142】*   Incidence of UTI.\n\n【143】*   Subjective participant satisfaction with treatment at three months following treatment.\n\n【144】*   Need for repeat or alternative treatment within one year.\n\n【145】*   Health outcome measures such as quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the benefits and harms of tenofovir‐based antiviral combination regimens for hepatitis B virus (HBV) for the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HBV, in HIV‐positive pregnant women co‐infected with HBV.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Worldwide, hepatitis B virus (HBV) accounts for an estimated 370 million chronic infections, and HIV for about 40 million . Chronic HBV infection occurs commonly in HIV‐infected persons, because the two viruses have similar routes of transmission through sexual and percutaneous contacts . The prevalence of HBV‐HIV co‐infection differs according to geographical settings, depending on various factors, such as predominant transmission modes, HBV vaccination rates, and prevalence of HBV in the general population . Globally, the estimated prevalence of hepatitis B among people living with HIV/AIDS is 5% to 20% . Therefore, about two to four million HIV‐infected persons are co‐infected with HBV worldwide . Estimates of HBV prevalence in HIV‐infected pregnant women are scarce, especially in Western countries , but co‐infection with HBV is common in HIV populations of sub‐Saharan Africa . Available data suggest that in resource‐rich settings, such as Western Europe and the USA, about 4% to 16% of the HIV‐infected population have chronic HBV infection . Conversely, in resource‐poor settings, such as Asia and Africa, where there is HBV endemicity, the HBV‐HIV co‐infection rate is up to 20% . In a SWEN India trial, the prevalence of active maternal HBV‐HIV co‐infection in pregnant women was estimated at 4.6% .\n\n【8】Chronic HBV infection is a chronic necro‐inflammatory liver disease, caused by persistent HBV liver infection . Individuals with chronic HBV are at increased risk of having cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV infection appears to have a negative impact on the natural history of HBV infection . For instance, in immunocompromised people, the chronicity rates of HBV infection are higher, and the rates of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, and seroconversion to anti‐HBe and anti‐HBs are lower than those in immunocompetent subjects .\n\n【9】Co‐infection with HBV in people with HIV who are receiving a commonly used nevirapine‐based antiretroviral therapy is a major concern for clinicians, owing to its high prevalence, the infrequent testing and treatment of viral hepatitis, and the impact of liver disease on the tolerability and effectiveness of anti‐HIV treatment . Limited information is available on the possible interactions between the presence of hepatitis B co‐infection and the administration of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, including the non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine . Thus, data obtained during pregnancy are particularly relevant, because of the increased risk of drug‐related toxicity reported for HBV‐HIV co‐infected pregnant women .\n\n【10】Generally, HBV‐HIV co‐infected women have a higher risk of transmitting HBV to their infants . The risk of transmitting HBV to the infant is higher for mothers who are positive for HBeAg, and have a higher HBV load . Even with active and passive immunisation, the rate of breakthrough transmission to the infant remains as high as 5% to 15% in these women . Consequently, most HBV infections are acquired during the perinatal period, especially in highly endemic areas . Even in areas with low endemicity, perinatal transmission may account for up to one‐third of chronic infections . For this reason, mother‐ to‐child transmission (MTCT), during pregnancy and childbirth, has been recognized as the most important phase for prevention of chronic HBV infection in infants. The progression of chronic HBV infection to cirrhosis, end‐stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma is more rapid in persons with HBV‐HIV co‐infection than in persons with chronic HBV mono‐infection .\n\n【11】Pregnant women who are HBV‐HIV co‐infected are twice as likely to test positive for HBeAg, three times more likely to have detectable HBV DNA, and have higher HBV DNA serum concentrations than those who are HBV mono‐infected, thereby greatly increasing the risk of MTCT . In one West African study, maternal HBV‐HIV co‐infection increased the probability of MTCT of HBV by 2.5 times . A potential association with adverse HIV outcomes in individuals who are HBV‐HIV co‐infected has been reported, in which HIV‐associated immune deficiency was aggravated in those with active HBV replication, resulting in increased progression to AIDS‐related outcomes and all‐cause mortality .\n\n【12】According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 2018 hepatitis B guidance, all people with HBV‐HIV co‐infection, regardless of CD4 count, should receive antiretroviral therapy that includes two drugs with activity against HBV: specifically, tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus lamivudine or emtricitabine . Pregnant women who are already receiving effective antiretroviral therapy that does not include a drug with antiviral activity against HBV should have their treatment changed to include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide, with emtricitabine or lamivudine . HBV‐HIV co‐infection promotes an aggressive disease course of hepatitis B by the following mechanisms: increasing replication of the virus and rates of HBV reactivation; increasing the risk of acute liver failure, chronicity of newly acquired HBV infections, and occult infection, characterised by the absence of HBsAg and low viral replication, as well as HBV DNA concentration .\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】Tenofovir, lamivudine, and emtricitabine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which are effective against both HIV and HBV . The interventions could be in the form of tenofovir‐based antiviral combination regimens. The rationale for using at least two dually active antiviral agents is to prevent the emergence of HBV‐associated drug mutation and resistance .\n\n【15】#### Tenofovir\n\n【16】Both tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide are prodrugs of tenofovir, which are further converted to the active metabolite called tenofovir diphosphate intracellularly .\n\n【17】##### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate\n\n【18】Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has a low bioavailability of 25%, a long plasma half‐life of 12 hours to 18 hours, and intracellular half‐life of 69 hours to 139 hours. It also has a low protein binding of < 0.7%, and a negative charge at physiological pH . Tenofovir is excreted in the urine, predominantly via the proximal tubules, mainly by the process of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion . The main target of toxicity of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the proximal tubule, where it can lead to renal Fanconi syndrome in severe cases of toxicity .\n\n【19】##### Tenofovir alafenamide\n\n【20】Tenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonoamidate prodrug of the nucleotide analogue tenofovir, whose active metabolite, known as tenofovir diphosphate, has an intracellular half‐life of 150 hours to 180 hours . Tenofovir alafenamide regimens have improved bone and renal safety compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate‐containing regimens, while still maintaining outstanding efficacy . For example, a 90% decrease in tenofovir plasma concentration and a 2.41‐fold increase in cell‐associated tenofovir diphosphate concentration was seen after a regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was converted to one, containing tenofovir alafenamide . Higher intracellular accumulation of tenofovir diphosphate allows a smaller dose of tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg) compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg), associated with improved drug adherence . In cases of tenofovir‐combined antiviral therapy for HBV‐HIV co‐infection, tenofovir alafenamide may be preferred to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate because of its improved safety profile, and improved uptake by the lymphoid tissue . Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel prodrug of tenofovir that is more stable in plasma, enabling a 10‐fold reduction in dose, and resulting in a 91% reduction in plasma tenofovir, and a four‐fold increase in intracellular levels of tenofovir diphosphate .\n\n【21】In terms of safety of a tenofovir‐based antiviral regimen (tenofovir, emtricitabine, and ritonavir‐boosted lopinavir) among HIV‐positive pregnant women, there was a greater risk for very premature birth, and death within 14 days post delivery than for those assigned to receive non‐tenofovir combined antiviral therapy . However, another study on birth outcomes for HIV‐positive pregnant women receiving a tenofovir‐based antiviral regimen (tenofovir‐emtricitabine) found that the risk of adverse birth outcomes was not higher with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate‐emtricitabine‐lopinavir or ritonavir than with zidovudine‐lamivudine‐lopinavir or ritonavir, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate‐emtricitabine‐atazanavir or ritonavir .\n\n【22】#### Lamivudine\n\n【23】Lamivudine is the negative enantiomer of 2′‐deoxy‐3′‐thiacytidine (analogue of cytidine), a dideoxypyrimidine in which the 3′ carbon of the ribose ring is replaced by a sulphur atom . It is a dideoxynucleoside analogue first approved for the treatment of chronic HBV . It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with maximum serum concentrations usually attained 0.5 hours to 1.5 hours after the dose. The adult absolute bioavailability is approximately 82%. Lamivudine systemic exposure is not altered when it is administered with food. Lamivudine is widely distributed into total body fluid, with the mean apparent volume of distribution of approximately 1.3 L/kg following intravenous administration. In pregnant women, lamivudine concentrations in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, and neonatal serum are comparable, indicating that the drug diffuses freely across the placenta. In postpartum women, lamivudine is secreted into breast milk . The dominant elimination half‐life of lamivudine is approximately five hours to seven hours, and the in vitro intracellular half‐life of its active 5′‐triphosphate anabolite is 10.5 hours to 15.5 hours in HIV‐1 and 17 hours to 19 hours in HBV cell lines .\n\n【24】#### Emtricitabin\n\n【25】Emtricitabin is an enantiomer of a cytidine analogue which has a fluorine in the position 5 . It is primarily excreted in the urine, and its improved efficacy is achieved with combination treatment . When taken orally, emtricitabin exhibits bioavailability in over 90% of recipients. The peak plasma concentrations of emtricitabin are reached within three hours post‐dose. Less than 4% of emtricitabin is bound to plasma proteins, with a blood‐to‐plasma ratio of 0.6 . Emtricitabin is activated through intracellular phosphorylation to emtricitabin‐5ʹ‐triphosphate. Compared to healthy adults, people with HIV‐infected demonstrate similar peak plasma concentration and exposure . Emtricitabin is predominantly eliminated in urine. Its median elimination half‐life is 10 hours, and that of emtricitabin‐5ʹ‐triphosphate is 39 hours . Co‐administration of food does not effect the bioavailability of emtricitabin. Emtricitabin is metabolized through oxidation of the sulphur moiety to form the 3ʹ‐sulfoxide diastereomers, and conjugation with glucuronic acid, to form 2ʹ‐O‐glucuronide. According to in vitro studies, emtricitabin is not an inhibitor of cytochromes P450 enzymes . At doses from 50 mg to 400 mg, emtricitabin significantly suppresses the HIV viral load; a maximum reduction occurs with emtricitabin ≥ 200 mg/day. Emtricitabine is potent, safe, efficacious, and well tolerated . Emtricitabine is a pregnancy category B drug, and as such, is an acceptable medication to use during pregnancy . The incidence of fetal variations and malformations did not increase in embryo‐fetal toxicity studies performed in mice .\n\n【26】### How the intervention might work\n\n【27】#### Tenofovir\n\n【28】Tenofovir works by reducing viral replication . It reduces HIV mother‐to‐child transmission, either by lowering plasma viral load in pregnant women, or through post‐exposure prophylaxis in their newborns . Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate shows high efficacy and tolerance, renal and bone toxicity has been noted following its use . The predisposing factors for tenofovir‐associated renal damage include low CD4+ T lymphocyte count, low body weight, older age, hepatitis C virus co‐infection, diabetes comorbidities, and the concomitant use of protease inhibitors . Tenofovir is generally preferred in cases of confirmed lamivudine resistance.\n\n【29】#### Lamivudine\n\n【30】Lamivudine works by inhibiting HIV‐1, HIV‐2, and hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase. It is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. Lamivudine undergoes anabolic phosphorylation by intracellular kinases to form lamivudine 5'‐triphosphate, the active anabolite that prevents HIV‐1 and HBV replication by competitively inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase, and terminating proviral DNA chain extension . Lamivudine exerts more potent antiviral activity, presumably because it is resistant to cleavage from the 3′ terminals of RNA/DNA complexes by 3′‐5′‐exonuclease, and is not subject to deamination . Lamivudine also works by promoting HBeAg seroconversion, HBV DNA suppression, normalisation of alanine aminotransferase, and in decreasing the progression of liver fibrosis . Following its use in HBV‐HIV co‐infected individuals, lamivudine‐resistance mutations in HBV frequently develop . Lamivudine resistance occurs as a result of mutations occurring within the tyrosine‐methionine‐aspartate‐aspartate (YMDD) motif of the reverse transcriptase gene at position 204, with the substitution of methionine with valine (M204V) or isoleucine . Lamivudine is presently in pregnancy category C, by the US Food and Drug Administration, based primarily on animal data, with no clear evidence of harm in sparse human data.\n\n【31】#### Emtricitabine\n\n【32】Emtricitabin works by exhibiting its activity against both HIV and HBV . Like lamuvidine, and other nucleoside analogues, emtricitabine is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated intracellularly into its active triphosphate form, called emtricitabine 5‐triphosphate. Emtricitabine 5‐triphosphate is incorporated, by reverse transcriptase, into the elongating proviral DNA chain, leading to termination of DNA synthesis through the inability of the next nucleotide to bind to emtricitabine 5‐triphosphate (active form) at the 3‐prime position .\n\n【33】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【34】HBV–HIV co‐infection in pregnancy represents a major global public health threat . Treatment of HBV alone, without addressing the HIV infection, will lead to the emergence of HIV strains that are resistant to non‐nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors . HIV infection impacts the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed . Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV‐infected individuals, and co‐infection is associated with a significantly reduced CD4 response in pregnancy . Because each virus affects the other's natural history and response to therapy, HBV‐HIV co‐infection requires dedicated evidence‐based research, and should be a priority for health researchers and policymakers. The use of antiretroviral agents with dual antiviral activity is a promising preventive approach. However, this is limited by a paucity of evidence on important agents (e.g. tenofovir) regarding safety during pregnancy, for both the fetus and the mother . The 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the management of chronic HBV infection did not recommend an antiviral agents approach, citing limited and low certainty evidence on the relative benefits or harm; but in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommended antiviral therapy in HBsAg–positive pregnant women who had an HBV DNA level of more than 200,000 IU/mL, despite a low certainty of evidence .\n\n【35】Prenatal antiretroviral or antiviral treatment may increase the risk for adverse birth outcomes among women with HIV infection or HBV, but whether the risk differs by antiretroviral therapy or antiviral regimen is unknown . There remains a number of unanswered questions about disease pathogenesis and management in HBV‐HIV co‐infected pregnant women. Pregnancy itself can trigger elevation of liver enzymes . During pregnancy, the administration of antiretroviral prophylaxis containing one agent with anti‐HBV activity may be associated with later development of HBV resistance. For pregnant women who take antiretroviral prophylaxis containing one or two agents with anti‐HBV activity to prevent perinatal HIV transmission, the safety of stopping treatment after delivery is unknown . The administration of antiretroviral agents without HBV activity in co‐infected pregnant women may leave their infants unprotected against HBV. As regimens including tenofovir become first‐line therapy for many HIV‐infected people (and are used as pre‐exposure prophylaxis for the uninfected), determining the safety of these medications during pregnancy becomes a critical research need. Finally, infection of the infant with HIV threatens the benefits of HBV immunisation for perinatal prevention . Therefore, this review is timely in its aim to establish the availability of up‐to‐date evidence about the effects of antiviral agents for HBV, for the prevention of HBV mother‐to‐child transmission in HIV‐positive pregnant women, co‐infected with HBV. Although there are previous Cochrane Reviews on antenatal pharmacological interventions for the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HBV , or HIV , none have been published on HBV‐HIV co‐infection. The only available systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluating the efficacy and maternal‐fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy, for prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HBV or HIV, is a non‐Cochrane review . In the Siemieniuk 2017 review, none of the women studied had HBV‐HIV co‐infection, but were either HBV‐ or HIV‐seropositive. This justifies the need for high‐quality research to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of antiviral agents for HBV, for the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HBV in HIV‐positive pregnant women co‐infected with HBV.\n\n【36】Objectives\n----------\n\n【37】To assess the benefits and harms of tenofovir‐based antiviral combination regimens for hepatitis B virus (HBV) for the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HBV, in HIV‐positive pregnant women co‐infected with HBV.\n\n【38】Methods\n-------\n\n【39】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【40】#### Types of studies\n\n【41】Randomised clinical trials, regardless of blinding, publication date, type and status of publication, language, and unit of randomisation, assessing the benefits and harms of hepatitis B antivirals as treatment for pregnant women with hepatitis B virus (HBV), who are co‐infected with HIV.\n\n【42】#### Types of participants\n\n【43】Pregnant women, 18 years of age or older, HIV‐positive and co‐infected with HBV, with pregnancy between 14 weeks and 28 weeks’ gestation (estimated on the basis of the dates of the last menstruation and ultrasonography findings, if available).\n\n【44】We will exclude women with hepatitis delta co‐infections, hepatitis C, or co‐existing malignancy.\n\n【45】#### Types of interventions\n\n【46】##### Experimental intervention\n\n【47】*   Tenofovir‐based antiviral combination regimens with anti‐retroviral regimen with lopinavir‐ritonavir therapy, or any other antiviral therapy, and two drugs with activity against HBV, specifically, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), plus lamivudine or emtricitabine.\n\n【48】##### Control intervention\n\n【49】*   Placebo, or tenofovir alone, or non‐tenofovir‐based antiviral regimen (zidovudine, lamivudine, telbivudine, emtricitabine, entecavir, lopinavir‐ritonavir, or any other antiviral therapy) either alone or in combination with at least two other antivirals.\n\n【50】We will also include trials where one intervention, or combination of interventions was compared with the experimental intervention (tenofovir‐based antiviral combination regimen).\n\n【51】We will allow co‐interventions if women in both the experimental and control groups of the trials receive them equally.\n\n【52】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【53】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【54】###### Infant outcomes\n\n【55】*   All‐cause infant mortality at longest follow‐up\n\n【56】*   Proportion of infants with serious adverse events (including infants with prematurity)\n\n【57】*   Proportion of infants with HBV mother‐to‐child transmission, assessed by either hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)‐seropositivity at 6 months to 12 months, detectable HBV DNA at 6 months to 12 months, or anti‐HBc‐positivity at 6 months to 12 months\n\n【58】###### Maternal outcomes\n\n【59】*   All‐cause maternal mortality at the longest follow‐up\n\n【60】*   Proportion of mothers with serious adverse events.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】1.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of all BT approaches compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo control conditions for acute depression.\n\n【3】2.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of different BT approaches (behavioural therapy, behavioural activation, social skills training and relaxation training) compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo control conditions for acute depression.\n\n【4】3.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of all BT approaches compared with different types of comparator (standard care, no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo) for acute depression.\n\n【5】--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】### Description of the condition\n\n【8】Major depression is characterised by persistent low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death . Somatic complaints are also a common feature of depression, and people with severe depression may develop psychotic symptoms .\n\n【9】Depression is the third leading cause of disease burden worldwide and is expected to show a rising trend over the next 20 years . A recent European study has estimated the point prevalence of major depression and dysthymia at 3.9% and 1.1% respectively . As the largest source of non‐fatal disease burden in the world, accounting for 12% of years lived with disability , depression is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload . Depression is also associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality . The strength of this association, even taking account of confounders such as physical impairment, health‐related behaviours and socio‐economic factors, has been shown to be comparable to, or greater than, the strength of the association between smoking and mortality .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Clinical guidelines recommend pharmacological and psychological interventions, alone or in combination, in the treatment of moderate to severe depression . The prescribing of antidepressants has increased dramatically in many Western countries over the last 20 years, mainly with the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and newer agents such as venlafaxine. Antidepressants remain the mainstay of treatment for depression in health care settings .\n\n【12】Whilst antidepressants are of proven efficacy for the acute treatment of depression , adherence rates remain very low , in part due to patients' concerns about side effects and possible dependency . Furthermore, surveys consistently demonstrate patients' preference for psychological therapies over that of antidepressants . Therefore, psychological therapies provide an important alternative or adjunctive intervention for depressive disorders.\n\n【13】A diverse range of psychological therapies is now available for the treatment of common mental disorders . Psychological therapies may be broadly categorised into four separate philosophical and theoretical schools, comprising psychoanalytic/dynamic , behavioural , humanistic  and cognitive approaches . Each of these four schools incorporates a number of differing and overlapping psychotherapeutic approaches. Some psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive analytic therapy , explicitly integrate components from several theoretical schools. Other approaches, such as interpersonal therapy for depression , have been developed to address characteristics considered to be specific to the disorder of interest.\n\n【14】Behaviour therapy became a dominant force in the 1950s, drawing from the work of Skinner 1953 , Wolpe 1958 and Eysenck 1960 . Behaviour therapy (BT) emphasises the role of environmental cues in influencing the acquisition and maintenance of behaviour , and in contrast with psychoanalysis, was developed through experimentally derived principles of learning .\n\n【15】A number of BT models have been developed for the treatment of depression, including behavioural activation (BA) , social skills training  and Lewinsohn’s behavioural therapy approach . Some models initially developed as behavioural treatments, including problem‐solving therapy , self‐control therapy  and the Coping with Depression program  have, over time, integrated cognitive techniques  .\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Skinner 1953 proposed that depression was associated with an interruption of established sequences of healthy behaviour that were previously positively reinforced by the social environment, based on operant conditioning principles (in which behaviour patterns are learnt, rather than instinctive). In subsequent expansions of this model, reduction of positively reinforced healthy behaviour has also been attributed to a decrease in the number and range of reinforcing stimuli available to the individual, a lack of skill in obtaining positive reinforcement  and/or increased frequency of punishment .\n\n【18】Conventional BT models for depression focus attention on increasing access to pleasant events and positive reinforcers and decreasing the intensity and frequency of events and consequences deemed to be unpleasant/negative , through monitoring of pleasant events, activity scheduling, social skills development, assertiveness training, relaxation therapy and time management training .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】With the advent of cognitive therapy in the 1970s, BT approaches based on purely operant and respondent principles came to be regarded as insufficient. However, in the past 10 to15 years, there has been renewed interest in the feasibility of behavioural treatments for depression . A recent meta‐analysis of 17 RCTs comparing BT against controls or other psychotherapies suggested superior outcomes compared with comparators in terms of depression recovery rates, symptom levels and participant dropout . The NICE 2009 guidelines recommend the use of behavioural activation (BA) for moderate to severe depressive disorder, whilst acknowledging that the evidence for BA is currently less robust. However, in this and other recent systematic reviews, the inclusion of a heterogeneous group of studies and studies using an ‘extended’ behavioural activation approach (regarded as a ‘third wave’ CBT intervention) limits interpretation of the findings .\n\n【21】Given the resurgence of interest in the use of BT as a cost‐effective intervention for depression which is simple to deliver, a comprehensive review of the comparative effectiveness and acceptability of BT interventions for depression is now timely to inform and update clinical practice and future clinical guideline development. This review forms part of a programme of 12 reviews covering behavioural, cognitive behavioural, psychodynamic, interpersonal, cognitive analytic and other integrative, humanistic and mindfulness‐based 'third wave' cognitive and behavioural psychological therapies, all compared with treatment as usual or with one another.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】1.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of all BT approaches compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo control conditions for acute depression.\n\n【24】2.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of different BT approaches (behavioural therapy, behavioural activation, social skills training and relaxation training) compared with treatment as usual/waiting list/attention placebo control conditions for acute depression.\n\n【25】3.  To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of all BT approaches compared with different types of comparator (standard care, no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo) for acute depression.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will be eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials employing a cross‐over design will be included in the review (whilst acknowledging that this design is rarely used in psychological therapy trials) but data from the first active treatment phase only will be used. Cluster RCTs will also be eligible for inclusion.\n\n【30】Quasi‐randomised controlled trials, in which treatment assignment is decided through methods such as alternate days of the week, will not be eligible for inclusion.\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】##### Participant characteristics\n\n【33】Studies of men and women aged ≥18 years will be included. A Cochrane review on psychotherapy for depression in children and adolescents (<18 years) has been undertaken separately and is soon to be published . The increasing prevalence of memory decline , cognitive impairment  and multiple comorbid physical disorders/polypharmacy  in individuals over 74 years may differentially influence the process and effect of psychological therapy interventions. Therefore, to ensure that older patients are appropriately represented in the review , an upper age cut‐off of <75 years will be used (when a study may have included individuals ≥75, we will include it so long as the average age is <75) and a previously published Cochrane review on psychotherapeutic treatments for older depressed people  will be updated concurrently by the authors.\n\n【34】##### Setting\n\n【35】Studies may be conducted in a primary, secondary or community setting, and will include volunteers. Studies involving inpatients will be excluded. Studies that focus on specific populations ‐ nurses, care givers, depressed participants at a specific work place ‐ will be included if the participants all meet the criteria for depression.\n\n【36】##### Diagnosis\n\n【37】We will include all studies that focus on acute phase treatment of clinically diagnosed depression.\n\n【38】1\\. Studies adopting any standardised diagnostic criteria to define participants suffering from an acute phase unipolar depressive disorder will be included. Accepted diagnostic criteria include Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM‐III , DSM‐ III‐R , DSM‐IV‐TR  or ICD‐10  criteria. Earlier studies may have used ICD‐9 , but ICD‐9 is not based on operationalised criteria, so studies using ICD‐9 will be excluded from this category.\n\n【39】2\\. Mild, moderate and severe depressive disorders are all found in primary care . In order to fully represent the broad spectrum of severity of depressive symptoms encountered by healthcare professionals in primary care, studies that used non‐operationalised diagnostic criteria or used a validated clinician or self‐report depression symptom questionnaire, such as Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  and Beck Depression Inventory , to identify depression caseness based on a recognised threshold, will also included. However, the influence of including this category of studies will be examined in a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【40】Studies focusing on chronic depression or treatment resistant depression, i.e. studies that list these conditions as inclusion criteria, will be excluded from the review. Studies in which participants are receiving treatment to prevent relapse following a depressive episode (that is, where participants are not depressed at study entry) will also be excluded.\n\n【41】Studies of people described as ‘at risk of suicide’, or with dysthymia or other affective disorders such as  panic disorder will be included if the participants meet criteria for depression as stated above, but will be excluded if not.\n\n【42】We will not include subgroup analyses of people with depression, selected out of people with mixed diagnoses, because such studies would be susceptible to publication bias (the authors reported such subgroup studies because the results were \"interesting\"). In other words we will include such studies only if the inclusion criteria for the entire study satisfied our eligibility criteria.\n\n【43】##### Comorbidity\n\n【44】Studies involving participants with comorbid physical or common mental disorders will be eligible for inclusion, as long as the comorbidity is not the focus of the study. In other words, we will exclude such studies which focused on depression among patients with Parkinson's disease or after acute myocardial infarction but will accept such studies which may have included some subjects with Parkinson's disease or with acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【45】#### Types of interventions\n\n【46】##### Experimental interventions\n\n【47】BT approaches eligible for inclusion will be grouped into four main categories, according to the specific therapeutic principles and techniques described by trial authors, as follows:\n\n【48】###### 1\\. Behavioural therapy\n\n【49】Lewinsohn 1974 proposed that depressed individuals have low rates of pleasant activities and obtained pleasure, that their mood covaries with rates of pleasant and aversive activities, that their mood improves with increases in pleasant activities, and that they lack social skills during the depressed phase. Therefore, behavioural therapy based on the approach developed by Lewinsohn and colleagues involves helping individuals increase their frequency and quality of pleasant activities, producing corresponding improvement in mood and overall quality of life .\n\n【50】###### 2.  Behavioural activation (original model)\n\n【51】The original model of behavioural activation (BA) developed by Jacobson 1996 was defined primarily by the proscription of cognitive interventions , and was tested in a dismantling study in which the behavioural activation component of cognitive therapy for depression was isolated . Based on its original design, BA model components include increasing access to pleasant events and consequences, activity scheduling and social skills development, thereby helping people to make contact with potentially reinforcing experiences . No attempt is made to directly restructure cognitions.\n\n【52】###### 3\\. Social skills training/assertiveness training\n\n【53】The social skills training model (SST) proposes that depressed people may have difficulty initiating, maintaining and ending conversations . Because of these deficits, the individual is unable to elicit mutually reinforcing behaviour from other people in their environment. SST subsumes assertion and conversational skills, together with more specialised subskills such as dating and job interview skills. Four social contexts of interacting with strangers, friends, family members and people at work or school are targeted  and interventions such as instruction, modelling, rehearsal, feedback and reinforcement are used to enable the development of new responses .\n\n【54】As assertiveness training comprises a key component of SST, it will be included in the SST category.\n\n【55】###### 4\\. Relaxation therapy\n\n【56】Relaxation Training is a behavioural stress management technique that induces a relaxation response, helping to switch off the fight/flight response and causing the levels of stress hormones in the blood stream to fall. There are a variety of techniques for inducing relaxation, the most common of which is Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation training .\n\n【57】###### Other behavioural therapies\n\n【58】Where a study evaluating a behavioural therapy intervention not listed above is identified, a post‐hoc decision will be made about its inclusion in the review, with the impact of its inclusion examined in a sensitivity analysis .\n\n【59】##### Comparators\n\n【60】The control comparison will be 'treatment as usual' (also called standard care, usual care or no treatment; TAU), waiting list (WL), attention placebo (AP) and psychological placebo (PP). The type of 'treatment as usual' comparator used is likely to influence the observed effectiveness of the intervention and, where possible, for the purposes of heterogeneity analyses, comparators will be subgrouped as waiting list, treatment as usual/usual care or attention placebo. In each study, descriptions of 'treatment as usual' and attention placebo conditions will be scrutinised to ensure that they do not comprise an active psychological therapy treatment. Within the 'treatment as usual' and waiting list conditions, participants may receive any appropriate medical care during the course of the study on a naturalistic basis, including pharmacotherapy and/or psychological therapy, as deemed necessary by the clinician. Additional treatment(s) received naturalistically by participants in both the control and active comparisons for each included study will be documented.\n\n【61】##### Format of psychological therapies\n\n【62】The psychological therapy intervention is required to be delivered through face to face meetings between the patient and therapist. Interventions in which face to face therapy is augmented by telephone or Internet‐based support will be included in the review. Psychological therapy approaches conducted on either an individual or on a group basis will be eligible for inclusion. There is no limit to the number of sessions and we accept psychological therapy delivered in only one session.\n\n【63】##### Excluded interventions\n\n【64】The behavioural activation (BA) approach has been extended , by introducing contextual and idiosyncratic functional analysis in the assessment and treatment of depression. The extended BA approach is regarded as a third wave cognitive behavioural therapy and, therefore, for the purposes of this review will be categorised as a comparator third wave CBT intervention.\n\n【65】Counselling interventions traditionally draw from a wide range of psychological therapy models, including person‐centred, psychodynamic and cognitive behavioural approaches, applied integratively, according to the theoretical orientation of practitioners . Therefore, studies of counselling will usually be included in the integrative therapies reviews. However if the counselling intervention consists of a single discrete psychological therapy approach, it will be categorised as such, even if the intervention is referred to as 'counselling'. If the intervention is manualised, this will inform our classification.\n\n【66】Psychological therapy models based on social constructionist principles (that focus on the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the construction of their perceived social reality) including couples therapy, family therapy, solution‐focused therapy, narrative therapy, personal construct therapy, neuro‐linguistic programming and brief problem‐solving  will be excluded. These therapies work with patterns and dynamics of relating within and between family, social and cultural systems in order to create a socially constructed framework of ideas , rather than focusing on one individual's reality. Previously published Cochrane reviews on couples therapy for depression  and family therapy for depression  will be updated concurrently.\n\n【67】Studies of long‐term, continuation or maintenance therapy interventions designed to prevent relapse of depression or to treat chronic depressive disorders will be excluded from the review.  Similarly, studies of interventions designed to prevent a future episode of depression will be excluded.\n\n【68】Guided self‐help, in which the practitioner provides brief face to face non‐therapeutic support to patients who are using a self‐help psychological therapy intervention, will be excluded as will bibliotherapy and writing therapies.\n\n【69】Psychological therapy that is provided wholly by telephone or over the Internet will not be eligible for inclusion.\n\n【70】Studies of dual modality treatments, in which patients are randomised to receive a behavioural therapy intervention combined with pharmacological treatment and compared with a treatment as usual control condition, will be excluded from the current review, and will be examined in a separate programme of reviews on combination treatments for depression.\n\n【71】Component or dismantling studies, in which the effectiveness of individual components of behavioural therapeutic approach are investigated, will not be included. Data from these studies will be extracted and included in a separate overview of psychological therapies for depression, in which multiple treatments meta‐analysis (MTM) will be used to compare the relative effectiveness of all psychotherapies, regardless of whether they have been directly compared in direct RCTs. If there are sufficient data, we will use the MTM model proposed in Welton 2009 to allow conclusions to be drawn regarding which components, or combination of components, are most effective at reducing depressive symptoms. See Unit of analysis issues for further detail on MTM.\n\n【72】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【73】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【74】1.  Treatment efficacy: the number of patients who respond to treatment, based on changes on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) , Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D)  or Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) , or any other validated depression scale. Many studies define response by 50% or greater reduction on BDI, HAM‐D etc. but some studies define response using Jacobson's Reliable Change Index; we will accept the study authors' original definition. If the original authors report several outcomes corresponding with our definition of response, we will give preference to BDI for self‐rating scale and HAM‐D for observer‐rating scale.\n\n【75】2.  Treatment acceptability: the number of participants who drop out of psychological therapy treatment for any reason.\n\n【76】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【77】1.  The number of patients who remit on treatment, based on the endpoint absolute status of the patients, as measured by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) , Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D)  or Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) , or any other validated depression scale. Examples of definitions of remission include 10 or less on BDI, 7 or less on HAM‐D or 10 or less on MADRS; we will accept the study authors' original definition. If the original authors report several outcomes corresponding with our definition of response, we will give preference to BDI for self‐rating scale and HAM‐D for observer‐rating scale.\n\n【78】2.  Improvement in depression symptoms, based on a continuous outcome of group mean scores at the end of treatment using BDI, HAM‐D, MADRS, or any other validated depression scale.\n\n【79】3.  Improvement in overall symptoms, using the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) .\n\n【80】4.  Improvement in anxiety symptoms, measured using a validated continuous scale, either assessor‐rated, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale \\[HAM‐A\\]  or self‐report, including the Trait subscale of the Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI‐T)  and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) .\n\n【81】5.  Adverse effects, such as completed suicides, attempted suicides and worsening of symptoms, where reported, will be summarised in narrative form.\n\n【82】6.  Social adjustment, social functioning including the Global Assessment of Function  scores, where reported, will be summarised in narrative form.\n\n【83】7.  Quality of life, using validated measures such as the SF‐36 , HoNOS  and WHOQOL , where reported, will be summarised in narrative form.\n\n【84】8.

The potential positive actions of statins during an acute cerebrovascular ischemic event are two‐fold: a neuroprotective effect, limiting damage and improving recovery; and a preventative effect on early recurrence.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To quantify the potential benefits and harms of statins in the acute treatment of cerebrovascular ischemic events (both transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and ischemic stroke).\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group's Trials Register ; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2010, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to November 2010); and EMBASE (1980 to November 2010). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trials and research registers , checked reference lists from relevant articles and contacted authors.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statins (any type and dosage) versus placebo or no treatment, administered within two weeks of the onset of acute ischemic stroke or TIA.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed methodological quality and, when necessary, contacted study authors for additional data. We based quantitative analysis of outcome on the intention‐to‐treat principle. The primary outcomes were mortality from ischemic stroke and mortality from adverse drug effects, bleedings and infections. We estimated the overall treatment effect by the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed‐effect model (Mantel‐Haenszel).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We included eight RCTs involving 625 participants. Only one study was judged as 'low risk' of bias. There were insufficient published data from the eight studies for all planned primary and secondary outcomes. No patients died from ischemic stroke or from adverse drug effects, bleeding or infections among the 444 participants in the six studies where these outcomes were reported. Statin treatment did not reduce all‐cause mortality compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.81) in the 431 patients enrolled in seven studies. No cases of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of muscle fibres resulting in the release of muscle fibre contents (myoglobin) into the bloodstream) occurred in 274 patients enrolled in three studies.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】Insufficient data were available from randomized trials to establish if statins are safe and effective in cases of acute ischemic stroke and TIA.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Ischemic Stroke\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Statin Prophylaxis\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】*   Placebo\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Infection\n*   Ischemic Stroke\n*   Bleeding\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【23】### Statins for acute ischemic stroke\n\n【24】Stroke is a major public health problem than can cause death and severe disability. A limited number of drugs are available for treating patients with stroke. Statins, a group of drugs commonly used to reduce cholesterol levels, are known to be safe and effective when given to patients with an acute heart attack. Therefore, they may also be beneficial in patients with acute stroke. We identified eight relevant trials of statins in acute stroke involving 625 participants. Unfortunately, insufficient information was available to establish whether statins are safe and beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke\n\n【25】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of non‐clozapine antipsychotic combinations for people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Schizophrenia is a chronic, relapsing and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder. Antipsychotic medication remains the mainstay of treatment, however of those on adequate antipsychotic therapy, about one third fail to respond, and persist with positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms such as apathy or poor social functioning . These patients are often described as having treatment‐resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Despite the concept being clinically intuitive, attempts at operationalising the criteria for TRS have yielded disparate definitions. Most are iterations of the definition endorsed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, which defines TRS as the lack of significant improvement of psychopathology and/or target symptoms despite treatment with two different antipsychotics from at least two different chemical classes (at least one should be an atypical antipsychotic) at the recommended dosages for a period of at least 2 to 8 weeks per drug . Another often accepted operational definition of TRS used in clinical trials is one to three failed antipsychotic attempts, with each having a duration of more than 4 to 6 weeks at the dose equivalent to 400 to 1000 mg of chlorpromazine, which is similar to the Kane criteria based on his landmark clozapine trial .\n\n【7】TRS affects about 7.8 million people worldwide, with clozapine refractory TRS affecting about 4.68 million . Its significance cannot be understated, with close to 60% of people with schizophrenia failing to achieve response after 23 weeks of antipsychotic therapy, and mean quality of life about 20% lower than that of patients in remission . A recent published Global Burden of Disease Study placed it in the top 20 diseases for mean years lost to disability (YLD), with a significant jump of 52% from the 1990s baseline . Patients experiencing TRS can continue to hear voices or contend with ongoing delusional beliefs. Whilst the positive symptoms are easier to elicit, persistence of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are harder to elicit and most patients do not spontaneously report these unless specifically looked for. These, however, lead to significant decline in functional outcomes. A recent survey in Australia ‐ the Survey of High Impact Psychosis (SHIP) demonstrated that more than 40% of patients who were adequately treated remained symptomatic, and life expectancy is reduced by at least 10 years due to risk of suicide alone, not withstanding the devastating effects of smoking and metabolic syndrome . Patients with TRS showed the poorest achievements in functional milestones of everyday living compared to those with other chronic psychiatric conditions, with most being unemployed, unable to live independently, and lacking any sentimental relationships . TRS is also very costly, costing 3 to 11 times more per patient for care than other patients with schizophrenia .\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】For patients with TRS, when clozapine is either not an option or has not worked, the common alternatives considered are combination antipsychotics. This usually involves combining a first‐generation antipsychotic (FGA) with a second‐generation antipsychotic (SGA), followed by other combinations such as FGA + FGA, then SGA + SGA . One of the hypotheses for this rationale is to combine serotonin blocking agents with dopamine blockers. A recent review documented 19 studies on SGA + SGA, 4 studies on FGA + FGA, 3 studies on SGA + FGA and 2 studies on FGA + SGA, excluding clozapine for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia . Commonly used SGA + SGA in that review were aripiprazole plus risperidone and sulpiride plus olanzapine. With no single accepted non‐clozapine antipyschotic combination therapy (NCCAT) demonstrating significant and sustained benifit, different combinations are often trialled and tried in patients with schizophrenia. For example, aripiprazole has been combined with either quetiapine or risperidone and studied for efficacy and tolerability in patients with schizophrenia . Another study compared aripiprazole plus haloperidol to haloperidol alone, showing amelioration of prior hyperprolactinemia . Other studies have combined olanzapine with ziprasidone where there was no significant improvement observed for fasting glucose, insulin resistance, hyperlipidaemia and obesity, compared to clozapine plus ziprasidone . Seven different combinations were reported in case studies for a review, including amisulpiride plus olanzapine, olanzapine plus risperidone, and quetiapine plus risperidone . Given the broad chemical and pharmacological heterogeneity of antipsychotic agents, many different NCCAT are used in clinical studies and in practice.\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】The lack of any pharmacological rationale for combining antipsychotics with the same putative antipsychotic dopamine D2 receptor blockade has been criticised . However, the efficacy of clozapine in spite of its modest D2 blockade and the activity of different antipsychotics on a variety of non‐D2 receptors suggest the possibility that efficacy of antipsychotic combination treatment may relate to a more optimal suite of action on such a spectrum of receptors. Moreover, employing lower doses of two antipsychotics may mitigate unpleasant or harmful side effects, given the different side‐effect profile of the antipsychotics. For example, the addition of either amisulpride or risperidone to olanzapine or quetiapine may result in improvement in the D2 receptor antagonism but with a better side‐effect profile, as olanzapine or quetiapine have a reduced tendency to cause extrapyramidal side effects or prolactin elevation .\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】The current mainstay treatment for TRS is the antipyschotic clozapine . However, 40% to 70% of TRS patients are resistant to clozapine . In addition, of those on clozapine, 17% discontinue due to intolerance to clozapine’s side effects . For those who have been challenged again with clozapine after life‐threatening adverse effects, failure rate remains high for agranulocytosis and myocarditis . It is also contraindicated in patients with multiple comorbidities such as active liver disease and pre‐existing cardiovascular diseases, which are common in people with schizophrenia . The mandatory, frequent haematological monitoring in some countries can also cause much inconvenience to some patients .\n\n【14】Clinicians then need to consider NCCAT as a last‐line solution for TRS.\n\n【15】Indeed, the fact that antipsychotic combination treatment has been estimated to be prescribed to 10% to 50% of patients , is testament to both the prevalence of TRS and the inadequacy of monotherapy. Furthermore, clozapine displays both partial dopaminergic antagonism and serotonergic antagonism which are postulated to be implicated in its efficacy in TRS . Thus NCCAT can be employed for patients who are intolerant to, contraindicated or who have refused clozapine, by optimisation of the two neurotransmission pathways, leading to better efficacy and reduced side effects.\n\n【16】Reviews to date have largely focused on clozapine antipsychotic combination treatments in TRS  or antipsychotic combination treatments in schizophrenia in general . Consequently, there is a lack of good quality evidence regarding the efficacy or tolerability of non‐clozapine combinations in TRS. This review will address this gap.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of non‐clozapine antipsychotic combinations for people with treatment‐resistant schizophrenia.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】All relevant randomised controlled trials.

Two authors extracted data independently. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time‐to‐event outcomes where possible, and a fixed effect model was used for meta‐analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time‐to‐event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no statistically significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no statistically significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed statistically significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leukopenia were more common with the addition of a drug.\n\n【12】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【13】The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response observed with addition of a drug to the regimen was also associated with increased toxicity.\n### PICOs\n\n【14】###### Populatio\n\n【15】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Breast Cancer\n\n【16】###### Interventio\n\n【17】*   Cytotoxic agent\n*   Chemotherapy\n\n【18】###### Compariso\n\n【19】###### Outcom\n\n【20】*   Overall Survival\n\n【21】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【22】### Addition of drugs to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer\n\n【23】Advanced breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Women with advanced breast cancer have an average survival of about 2 years, although some women may live for many years beyond this. It is therefore important to investigate different chemotherapy treatment options. Chemotherapy can improve survival for women with metastatic breast cancer, but it can also cause toxic side effects. Of interest is whether there is any benefit to increasing the dose intensity of a regimen, particularly given the potential harm caused by more dose‐intensive treatment. This review investigated the value of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen. We found that the addition of chemotherapy drug/s to a regimen improved tumour response but there is insufficient evidence to determine if there is an impact on overall survival.\n\n【24】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There is some documentation of the range of plants used in sub‐Saharan Africa to treat ailments , but there has been little in the way of systematic appraisal of their benefits.\n\n【6】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common recessively inherited disorder of haemoglobin affecting peoples originating from sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Mediterranean basin, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean and South America. Descendants of immigrants from the above geographical areas, living in other parts of the world may also inherit the gene and be affected. It is estimated that 1 in 50 people in Africa suffers form SCD .\n\n【7】The homozygous state (SS) is associated with complications and a reduced life expectancy . Clinically significant disease also occurs in individuals who inherit the sickle gene from one parent and another variant haemoglobin gene from the second parent such as haemoglobin C (SC) or a β‐thalassaemia gene (Sβ+ or SβO). The red cells distort on giving up oxygen and can lead to blockage of small blood vessels, which can stop oxygen delivery to the tissues causing pain and/or organ damage .\n\n【8】Apart from advice to avoid cold and dehydration, particularly during intercurrent illness and the use of prophylactic antibiotics and vaccination in children to prevent pneumococcal infection , there is little treatment on offer until an individual is symptomatic. Treatment is supportive, with analgesia and blood transfusion. The prophylactic use of hydroxyurea in the case of recurrent painful crises and following life‐threatening sequestration crises reduces admissions and the need for transfusion, although the long‐term toxicity is unknown .\n\n【9】People with SCD, as such, remain a vulnerable group and could be at risk from remedies that they may encounter . There may be true benefits from traditional medicine that may go unrecognised by the classically trained medical fraternity. In‐vitro studies with red cells from people with SCD have shown potentially clinically beneficial action of extracts of plants, including Fagara xanthyloides , Griffonin and Ouabain , and Cajanus cajan . Unfortunately progress has been slow and largely guided by anecdotal reports of benefit in single patients, with little in the way of larger trials. Although most in vitro‐work has focused on single plants, with some evaluation of cocktails of plant extracts . The most recently assessed of these is collectively known as NIPRISAN and has been investigated in‐vitro and in animal studies . Human studies are currently underway.\n\n【10】Phytomedicines could be important in the management of SCD particularly in the developing world, in part because of a coming together of traditional and classical medical ideas for the benefit of a vulnerable patient group. The challenge remains to evaluate these therapies systematically such that any true benefit and any risks to the individual with SCD are accurately reported. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard in this regard.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】We aim to assess the effects of phytomedicines compared to placebo and/or conventional therapy (including hydroxyurea and blood transfusion) in relation to symptoms and complications of all types of SCD in both children and adults in any setting.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【15】#### Types of studies\n\n【16】RCTs or quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【17】#### Types of participants\n\n【18】All ages with SCD: homozygous (HbSS) and compound heterozygotes including SC Disease (HbSc) and β‐thalassaemia (Sβ0/Sβ+), proven by electrophoresis with family studies or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) tests as appropriate.\n\n【19】All settings will be included.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】Administration (by any mode: topical; oral; or parenteral) of phytomedicines (defined as a remedy derived directly from plants or plant material and not synthesised) compared to placebo or standard treatment, including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea.\n\n【22】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【23】**Primary outcomes**  \n(1) Change in painful crises (as judged by pain scales, analgesia use and hospital utilisation)  \n(2) Change in severe complications of SCD including sequestration crisis, acute sickle chest syndrome and leg ulcer\n\n【24】**Secondary outcomes**  \n(1) Any adverse events including hepatic and renal toxicity  \n(2) Change in use of blood transfusion  \n(3) Change in level of anaemia  \n(4) Quality of life measures (including exercise tolerance)  \n(5) Ability to live a normal life, e.g. employment and school attendance\n\n【25】Outcome data will be grouped into those measured at 3, 6, 12, 24 months and yearly thereafter.

{"seq_id": "ed575a05-a308-4e78-bfa0-a13306761e9b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different surgical techniques for harvesting autologous bone graft from the iliac crest in adults.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Bone is a highly specialised and dynamic tissue that is continually being renewed throughout life . However, bony voids or defects can arise in various circumstances, such as after serious fractures, fracture non‐union, infection, severe osteoporosis and bone cancer. Bone grafts and substitutes are often used to fill bony defects or provide additional structural material. Bone grafts are used extensively in trauma and orthopaedic surgery to augment bone regeneration and fracture healing; for example, by raising the articular surface of the tibia in depressed plateau fractures to restore the joint surface and improve articular congruity. Bone grafts are also used for the promotion of delayed healing (e.g. fracture non‐unions), in bone loss (e.g. to replace gaps caused by missing bone), and for fusion of joint spaces.\n\n【7】There are three main sources of bone graft material: autologous (harvested from the patient’s own body), allograft (from cadaveric bone, e.g. from a tissue bank) and synthetic substitutes. Autologous bone grafts, where healthy bone is extracted from another site in the person's own skeleton, have the advantages of retaining the inherent regeneration and remodelling properties of living bone in addition to being free from the risks of disease transmission and autoimmune rejection associated with allografts. A common practice amongst surgeons is to combine autologously harvested bone graft with bone graft substitutes for reconstruction of a bony defect. This technique may maximise the unique properties of autologous bone graft whilst minimising harvest volume as synthetic substitutes contribute to the bulk for reconstruction.\n\n【8】Autologous bone grafts may be harvested from a range of anatomical sites such as the femur and the fibula. However, the iliac crest (the curved ridge at the top of the pelvis) has been considered the \"gold standard\" source for bone graft procedures due to the relatively large volume of bone that can be harvested from the pelvis .\n\n【9】Autologous bone graft harvest material can be divided into three main types: cortical (the dense compact bone that forms the outer layer of the bone), cancellous (the porous inner layer of the bone composed of trabecular bone) and corticocancellous (combination of cortical and cancellous bone) . Cancellous bone graft material is the most commonly used iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) material because of its regeneration properties reflecting the presence of osteoblasts (bone forming cells) in the trabecular bone . Cortical bone graft material is often used where immediate mechanical stability is required . Corticocancellous bone material combines the properties of both bone types.\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】The surgical techniques for ICBG harvesting all involve the extraction of bone graft material from either the anterior or posterior iliac crest. The most commonly used site for harvesting is the posterior iliac crest, partly due to the larger quantities of potential bone graft material available . Subsequent to harvesting (removal of the bone graft), reconstruction or backfilling of the iatrogenic defect at the donor site may be undertaken .\n\n【12】Since their inception, the surgical techniques used for ICBG harvest have undergone several modifications. The wide variety of surgical techniques in use today evolved to facilitate the choice of a suitable bone graft material type (e.g. cortical, cancellous or corticocancellous) and approach (e.g. the posterior iliac crest is commonly used during prone spinal surgery due to its posterior approach). Despite the diversity in surgical techniques for iliac bone graft harvest, graft retrieval can be broadly classified into trapdoor techniques, splitting techniques, window techniques and trephine extraction. These are described below. Each may be accompanied by subsequent reconstruction of the iatrogenic bony defect.\n\n【13】#### Trapdoor techniques\n\n【14】Trapdoor methods involve any procedure where a bone flap (or 'trapdoor') is made in the iliac crest from which subcortical bone graft is removed before the flap is replaced to restore the cortical anatomy. This method is 'open', as the cortex is intentionally split to access cancellous bone.\n\n【15】#### Splitting techniques\n\n【16】These comprise any procedure that uses a vertical force to create a split or fissure in the iliac crest, and include the Wolfe‐Kawamoto technique .\n\n【17】#### Window techniques\n\n【18】Window techniques remove a segment of bone from the iliac crest including the cortex. This is often subcrestal in order to retain the aesthetic symmetry of the iliac crest.\n\n【19】#### Trephine extraction\n\n【20】Bone graft extraction using a trephine or a bone grinder to fill a trephine tube will remove a thin core of cancellous bone graft (where a hole is made in the bone by penetrating the cortex). This method has also been grouped under 'minimally invasive' ICBG harvest by many authors.\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】Complications after all forms of ICBG harvest are broadly divided into major and minor based upon the level of disability caused . Major complications after ICBG include major neurovascular or visceral damage, donor site (iliac wing) fracture , deep seated infection and chronic pain. Such complications often result in increased hospitalisation, economic costs and significant morbidity for the patient . Minor complications without long term disability include donor site pain, superficial cutaneous sensory nerve impairment and superficial seroma, haematoma or infection. Thus consideration of the best surgical technique is not just the efficacy of graft extraction but needs to include the risk of iatrogenic complications and subsequent morbidity related to the donor site.\n\n【23】There is considerable diversity in the surgical techniques for ICBG harvest. Moreover, the literature is replete with small case series that report on one or more of a variety of methods for ICBG but, overall, there is no consensus as to the putative advantages and disadvantages of each of the main techniques.\n\n【24】It has been suggested that trapdoor techniques are associated with a greater admission time and analgesia requirement compared with closed methods (e.g. trephination) for ICBG . However, where patients require repeat grafting, the trapdoor technique will allow sufficient re‐harvest of cancellous bone from the same donor site . This latter point will be relevant for rarer cases in which the use of multiple graft sites needs to be avoided.\n\n【25】Splitting techniques, classically described by Wolfe and Kawamoto, include anatomical restoration of the iliac crest contour . However, the reflection of the medial and lateral cortices of the ilium, inherent to the technique, cause disruption to the attachments of the fascia and the abdominal muscles; the latter are maintained in trapdoor techniques.\n\n【26】Window techniques tend to preserve the contour of the iliac crest, improving post‐operative cosmesis, pain and structural stability  compared with methods that disrupt the cortex of the crest. However, window methods have been abandoned by some centres in favour of minimally invasive, closed techniques .\n\n【27】There is some evidence that trephine extraction reduces admission time, post‐operative analgesia requirements and donor site morbidity, whilst also reducing incision length and shortening operating time compared with open techniques . Little data exist regarding the volume and sufficiency of graft obtained and it is suspected that trephination will not be suitable for all indications.\n\n【28】It is unclear how donor site reconstruction, where the void is backfilled, might reduce iatrogenic morbidity but one suggestion is that it protects the donor site from adhesive scar formation .\n\n【29】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【30】In 2001, it was estimated that more than 500,000 bone graft procedures were performed annually in the United States, and more than a million worldwide . Whilst it is difficult to ascertain the precise number of procedures carried out per year for autologous bone harvesting from the iliac crest, it remains a common surgical procedure worldwide.\n\n【31】The harvest of bone graft from the iliac crest is associated with considerable donor site morbidity, including chronic pain, deformity and functional impairment . The diversity in surgical techniques for ICBG harvest presents challenges in choosing the correct technique and, despite being a common orthopaedic surgical procedure, the varying techniques of ICBG harvest have not been reviewed in terms of their morbidity and graft success. There is a need to collate and synthesise the available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing these techniques in order enable surgeons to make more informed clinical decisions, improve patient outcomes, and reduce post‐operative morbidity.\n\n【32】Objectives\n----------\n\n【33】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different surgical techniques for harvesting autologous bone graft from the iliac crest in adults.\n\n【34】Methods\n-------\n\n【35】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【36】#### Types of studies\n\n【37】We will consider all randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (where the method of allocation is known but is not truly random, e.g. alternation, allocation by hospital number or date of birth) comparing two or more surgical techniques for harvesting autologous bone graft from the iliac crest.\n\n【38】#### Types of participants\n\n【39】Studies in which people over the age of 16 have undergone iliac crest bone graft harvesting. This will include obtaining bone grafts for treatments for acute fractures, delayed unions, and established non‐unions as well as filling bony defects from non‐traumatic causes and additional material for fusion and reconstruction. We will exclude studies if more than 10% of participants are under the age of 16 unless separate data are available for participants over 16 years of age.\n\n【40】For the purpose of this review, the iliac crest is defined as the superior border of the wing of the ilium and the superiolateral margin of the greater pelvis. Anteriorposteriorly the iliac crest forms from the anterior superior iliac spine to the posterior superior spine. We will include studies of techniques where the entry point to the iliac bone for bone graft harvesting is made within this anatomical site. Hence, we will exclude studies where bone graft harvesting occurs outside of the iliac crest. We will exclude studies that compare interventions for harvesting bone from multiple sites including the iliac crest unless separate data are available for the iliac crest.\n\n【41】#### Types of interventions\n\n【42】We will include all surgical interventions employed to extract bone from the iliac crest. We will exclude studies that present multiple methods of autologous iliac bone grafting, where separate data are not presented by surgical technique.\n\n【43】No single method is well established or in common use as a method for harvesting autologous bone from the iliac crests. This makes it difficult to choose a meaningful control intervention when comparing different general surgical methods. We propose a pragmatic order of comparisons based upon our views of the frequency of use of each technique as below:\n\n【44】1.  Trapdoor versus window\n\n【45】2.  Trapdoor versus splitting\n\n【46】3.  Trapdoor versus trephine\n\n【47】4.  Window versus splitting\n\n【48】5.  Window versus trephine\n\n【49】6.  Splitting versus trephine\n\n【50】We will also compare the use of donor site reconstruction versus no donor site reconstruction (including sham procedures), regardless of the primary harvest technique.\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【53】1.  Successful graft extraction. Success will be defined as achieving a sufficient bone graft for its intended purposes, i.e. not requiring augmentation from a second donor site or a synthetic product that was not planned pre‐operatively. Other definitions of success by the trial investigators will be considered.\n\n【54】2.  Chronic donor site pain as reported by patients, as measured by any recognised pain assessment tool (e.g. using a visual analogue scale).\n\n【55】3.  Persistent and serious donor site complications, such as fracture, deep infection, or hernia formation.\n\n【56】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【57】1.  Function, preferably based on validated patient‐reported outcome measures, but also objective measures and return to work or former activities.\n\n【58】2.  Patient‐reported quality of life (e.g. EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ‐5D)).\n\n【59】3.  Early complications, including major blood loss (defined as perioperative blood loss requiring blood transfusion), initial donor site pain (measured using any recognised pain assessment tool) and superficial surgical site infection.\n\n【60】###### Resourse use\n\n【61】We will collect economic measures such as operation time, cost of procedure and resource use.\n\n【62】###### Timing of outcome assessment\n\n【63】We expect that the majority of studies included in this review will report outcomes stratified into follow‐up time periods that may not be consistent between studies. For clarity, we will divide complications into early complications (any complication reported in the first three post‐operative months) and delayed complications (those reported at any time point after three months).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ALC for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), affecting 50% of all individuals with diabetes . An internationally accepted definition of DPN for clinical practice is “the presence of symptoms and/or signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after the exclusion of other causes\" .\n\n【7】DPN is frequently asymptomatic but it may be clinically evident through a set of positive and negative symptoms. The positive symptoms are often painful and the negative are abnormalities associated with lack of sensation or, less commonly, with weakness. Chronic neuropathic pain, depression, balance disorders, foot ulcerations, Charcot arthropathy, osteomyelitis, and amputations are some examples of complications associated with progressively advanced stages of DPN . In DPN, pain is typically distal, symmetrical, and worsens at night. The patient usually describes the sensation as tingling, a deep ache, sharp shooting or burning. On examination it is common to find hyperalgesia (abnormal sensitivity to painful stimuli) and allodynia (heightened sensitivity to non‐noxious stimuli).\n\n【8】The combination of neuropathic symptoms, signs, and abnormal electrical diagnostic studies provides researchers with the most accurate diagnosis of polyneuropathy . However, in clinical practice, the diagnosis of DPN can be made after a careful clinical examination with at least two neurological tests. For example, the combination of temperature and vibratory tests (on neurological examination) provides 87% sensitivity in detecting DPN . The most important differential diagnoses in the assessment of DPN include spinal stenosis, hypothyroidism, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> and thiamine deficiency, and other nutritional polyneuropathies such as alcohol‐related neuropathy. Furthermore, polyneuropathy may be associated with uraemia, cancer, peripheral arterial disease, hepatitis, neurotoxic drugs, and toxins. Additionally, rarer possibilities are human immunodeficiency disease, vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, amyloidosis, and inherited neuropathies, such as Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease.\n\n【9】Neuropathic pain is frequently encountered in diabetics with and without diagnosed neuropathy, but its prevalence is difficult to ascertain, as definitions vary enormously among studies. It is thought that between 16% and 24% of people with DPN may experience chronic neuropathic pain . In clinical trials, the severity of pain is evaluated through pain scales (visual analogue scale (VAS) and 11‐point Likert scale) and outcomes must be evaluated through validated instruments (for example, Brief Pain Inventory, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Neuro‐Qol) . The usual criteria for including a patient in such trials are the presence of DPN associated with neuropathic pain lasting for six months or longer, and a mean weekly pain on a zero to 10 VAS of between four and 10. The usual reasons to exclude a patient from a painful DPN trial are proximal neuropathies, pain of central origin, non‐neuropathic pain, and pain that is not DPN‐related.\n\n【10】A long period of non‐controlled hyperglycaemia, metabolic imbalances, such as oxidative stress, increased polyol flux, accumulation of advanced glycation end‐products, and dyslipidaemia (increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides) are the main factors associated with DPN development. However, total hyperglycaemic exposure seems to be the most important factor associated with DPN . The elucidation of metabolic disruptions related to hyperglycaemia remains the foremost target for research, with the aim of reversing or minimising these homeostatic imbalances and eventually reducing complications and negative impact on quality of life.\n\n【11】Apart from tight blood glucose control, no treatments have shown any capacity to arrest DPN progression. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of painful DPN remains a challenge for physicians and the ability of the individual to tolerate treatment remains a major consideration in any treatment decision . A multifaceted treatment approach to chronic neuropathic pain in DPN is reasonable, but results have been modest so far. Currently, there are many treatments for painful DPN, but quite a few have adverse effects that limit their utility , and few papers have studied the effects of treatment on function and quality of life.\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】Acetyl‐L‐carnitine (ALC) is an ester of L‐carnitine, which is a naturally occurring amino acid. ALC is produced in the kidneys, central nervous system (CNS) and liver via the action of ALC‐transferase and is stored in skeletal muscle. ALC plays an essential role in the transfer of long‐chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β‐oxidation . ALC supports cell metabolism when there is hypoxia, for example during reduced circulation, or due to genetic metabolic defects. ALC binds organic acids and fragmented free fatty acids in order to expel them from the cell, and to prevent the harmful effects that fatty acid fragments can have on cell and on tissue structures.\n\n【14】In addition, ALC is able to reduce tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) concentration and has an antioxidant effect on mitochondrial DNA, whilst stimulating mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Therefore, ALC not only assists in the transportation of long‐chain fatty acids through the inner mitochondrial membrane for β‐oxidation, but also helps energy availability and prevents toxic accumulation of long‐chain fatty acids .\n\n【15】Administration of ALC can be oral, intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM). Oral doses range from 1.5 g to 3.0 g by day, in divided doses. IV and IM doses range from 1.0 g to 2.0 g daily.\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Recent clinical trials, usually in groups of patients with an advanced stage of DPN, have shown disappointing outcomes from experimental treatments based on vitamin supplementation, aldose reductase inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitors. In these studies, each different drug has targeted a single underlying pathogenetic factor. By contrast, substitution of ALC in DPN targets several mechanisms and could be a more advantageous therapy .\n\n【18】In experimental as well as human diabetic neuropathy, ALC is depleted in peripheral nerves . Replenishment of ALC enhances regional blood flow, increases myo‐inositol and free carnitine levels, and reduces malonyl dialdehyde (that is, reduces lipid peroxidation). Another mechanism to explain the effects of ALC in DPN could be via diabetic dyslipidaemia, as oral L‐carnitine supplementation in people with diabetes significantly reduces plasma lipoprotein A levels by as much as 20.9% after six months . On the other hand, one theoretical role of ALC in peripheral neuropathy is the reduction of pain. ALC may abate the overexcitability of Aδ and C fibres in the dorsal root ganglion and regulate their connections with interneurons in the spinal medulla .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Polyneuropathy is a frequent, heterogeneous, polymorphic and devastating complication of diabetes mellitus  because of the debilitating symptoms it causes and the associated higher risk of other complications, in particular those involving the cardiovascular system and the foot. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that \"someone somewhere in the world loses a limb due to DM every 30 seconds\"  .\n\n【21】Currently, it is estimated that there are 366 million adults with diabetes in the world . Of these, approximately half have some phenotype of neuropathy and 16% to 24% have chronic painful DPN. Of those with chronic painful DPN, up to 39% have never received any kind of treatment for their pain . There is therefore an enormous worldwide burden of disease, and an unmet need for prevention and treatment of the diabetes, the neuropathy and the resultant painful symptoms.\n\n【22】Recently, at least four systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been published about ALC or L‐carnitine and its effects on different conditions: type 2 diabetes mellitus , secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease , hepatic encephalopathy , and end‐stage renal failure under haemodialysis , with positive results in all except renal failure. ALC has also shown promise as a therapeutic agent for DPN in small numbers of studies but the published data have not been considered as a whole and subjected to meta‐analysis. This review will systematically evaluate the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of ALC for this highly prevalent condition.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ALC for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs with parallel or cross‐over designs. Quasi‐RCTs are studies in which participants are allocated to intervention groups based on methods that are not truly random, such as hospital number or date of birth.\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】The participants will be individuals of any sex and age (adults, including those over 60, and children), and with both forms of diabetes (type 1 or type 2). Furthermore, participants will be diabetics with any severity of DPN  and with any three definitions of minimal criteria for typical DPN recommended by the Toronto Consensus , that is, probable, confirmed or subclinical DPN. The participants with only symptoms or signs of DPN (that is, with 'possible DPN') will be considered as providing a lower quality of evidence and could be excluded at a later date from this review.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】The intervention will be ALC compared with placebo, other treatment or no intervention. Where additional treatments are given these should be matched equally in the intervention and control groups.\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【35】Pain (using a validated scoring system such as a VAS or numerical rating scale) . The pain outcome will be the proportion of participants with a 30% or 50% decrease in pain, as well as the magnitude of that pain on a VAS or Likert scale.\n\n【36】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【37】1.  Functional impairment score: the neuropathy impairment score (NIS)  or the neuropathy disability score (NDS) (or one of the modified NDS scores) in the lower extremities . Additionally, we will consider these functional disability outcomes as continuous variables (for example, zero to 10 for the modified NDS).\n\n【38】2.  Measures of impairment of sensation: quantitative sensory testing (vibration perception threshold and thermal threshold) with an appropriate time of assessment (at least six months after treatment).\n\n【39】3.  Quality of life using a validated scoring system such as the Short Form‐36 Health Survey (SF‐36) or the NeuroQol .\n\n【40】4.  Neurophysiological measures: changes in sural and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (NCV) after an appropriate time of therapy (one year or more). Similarly, changes in amplitude of either the sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) or the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from the ulnar, peroneal, and tibial nerves.\n\n【41】5.  Adverse events: any adverse event, those adverse events requiring withdrawal, and serious adverse events (those which are fatal, life‐threatening, or which require prolonged hospitalisation).\n\n【42】6.  Validated screening questionnaires about symptom quality and severity: NSS (neuropathy symptom score) or MNSI (Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument). These instruments will be used for continuous variables (e.g. from zero to nine for NSS) .\n\n【43】7.  Sural nerve biopsy parameters.\n\n【44】All outcomes will be assessed before treatment and at six months (at minimum) after treatment and, when possible, at a year or even two or more years after treatment.\n\n【45】These outcomes are not eligibility criteria for the review but are the outcomes of interest in whichever studies are included.\n\n【46】###### Outcomes for inclusion in a 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【47】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes.\n\n【48】*   Number of patients with 30% or greater reduction in pain assessed by a validated scoring system, such as a VAS or Likert scale, at six months or more.\n\n【49】*   Change in a functional impairment score (NIS or NDS) at six months or more.\n\n【50】*   Change in measures of impairment from quantitative sensory testing ‐ vibration perception threshold at six months or more.\n\n【51】*   Change in measures of impairment from quantitative sensory testing ‐ thermal threshold at six months or more.\n\n【52】*   Change in data from validated screening questionnaires about symptom quality and severity (NSS, MNSI) at six months or more.\n\n【53】*   Adverse events: any adverse event, those requiring withdrawal, and serious adverse events.\n\n【54】We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence (studies that contribute data for the prespecified outcomes). We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapters 11 and 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_  using GRADEpro software. We will justify all decisions to down‐ or up‐grade the quality of studies using footnotes and we will make comments to aid reader's understanding of the review where necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8530055e-157b-4787-bc50-8104c8afb6dc", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of prostatic urethral lift for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The prostate gland is an organ approximately the size of a walnut that is located below the urinary bladder encircling the urethra . Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histological diagnosis defined as an increased number of epithelial and stromal cells in the prostate; this may cause prostatic enlargement and subsequently compression of the urethra and obstruction . BPH may therefore develop with or without lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men over the age of 40 . BPH receives clinical significance when associated with bothersome LUTS . Symptom bother typically correlates with the number and severity of symptoms increased, which relates to both quality of life impairment and treatment seeking . Self‐administered questionnaires, namely International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), include the quality of life domain to evaluate the relative degree of bother across all LUTS . Chapple 2017 reported that increasing LUTS severity was associated with worsening men's overall distress using patient perception of bladder condition which is a single‐item global question (ranging from 1 (causes no problems at all) to 6 (causes severe problems)). In this Cochrane Review, we will consider the term BPH as prostatic enlargement with LUTS through which to define the disease condition and potential need for intervention.\n\n【7】BPH can progress over time and cause serious consequences, such as acute urinary retention, urinary tract infection, and upper urinary tract deterioration. BPH also results in a negative impact on public health and a reduction in a person's quality of life . In Europe, 30% of men over 50 years of age, equivalent to 26 million men, are affected by bothersome LUTS, including storage symptoms (such as urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia) or voiding symptoms (such as urinary hesitancy, weak urinary stream, straining to void, and prolonged voiding), or both. A yearly reported associated number of medical prescriptions is estimated to be around 11.6 million for 74 million people at risk from 2004 to 2008 . The prevalence of LUTS, according to an international study involving 7588 men was 18%, 29%, 40%, and 56% in the ages of 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, respectively . In the USA, 8 million men older than 50 years of age also suffer from BPH .\n\n【8】#### Diagnosis\n\n【9】Initial evaluation of LUTS suggestive of BPH includes patient history, physical examination including a digital rectal examination, urinalysis, prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test, voiding diary, and IPSS . A digital rectal examination is performed to assess the prostate for size, and for any lesions suspicious for cancer. The PSA is secreted by the prostate gland and is found to be abnormally elevated in the presence of prostate cancer, BPH, infection or inflammation of the prostate . The IPSS is used to assess urinary symptom severity and quality of life. It is also used to document subjective responses to treatment . Measurement of maximum flow rate (Qmax) and post‐void residual (PVR) are also often used in diagnosis and treatment decisions . A low Qmax and a large PVR predict an increased risk of symptom progression . Other tests include radiologic imaging, urodynamic evaluation, and cystoscopy to further determine appropriate treatment and predict treatment response .\n\n【10】#### Treatment\n\n【11】Treatment decisions are based on symptoms and the degree of bother noted by the patient. Initial treatment options for BPH include conservative management (watchful waiting and lifestyle modification) and medication (alpha‐blockers and 5‐alpha reductase inhibitors) . If patients have been refractory to conservative and medical treatment, or BPH causes subsequent complications, such as acute urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infection, bladder stones or diverticula, hematuria, or renal insufficiency, surgical options are considered . Until the 1970s, the only option available to treat this condition and relieve LUTS was an open or endoscopic surgery with the aim to remove or resect prostatic tissue to open up the blocked urethra . Clinical guidelines recommend monopolar or bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as a standard treatment modality in regards to subjective symptom relief and objective improvements in urinary flow , but this procedure is also associated with significant morbidity and long‐term complications, including hematuria requiring blood transfusion, urethral stricture, recurrent urinary tract infection, and urinary incontinence. Moreover, men may experience ejaculatory (65%) and erectile dysfunction (10%) related to TURP . Furthermore, BPH is a disease common in elderly men who have an increased risk of complications for general anesthesia and the surgery itself . Nowadays, other minimally invasive surgeries using electrode, laser, transurethral thermal ablation of the prostate (needle ablation, microwave therapy, and radiofrequency ablative techniques), and mechanical stents have been developed as alternatives to TURP . While new laser‐based procedures have demonstrated a decrease in short‐term complications, such as bleeding, they also have similar adverse effects on sexual dysfunction when compared with TURP .\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】A less invasive surgical intervention known as the prostatic urethral lift (PUL) has recently become available. The US Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence in the UK approved PUL in September 2013 and September 2015, respectively . As the PUL procedure can be performed under local anesthesia with oral or intravenous sedation, and also performed in men with blood clotting disorders or those on anticoagulant therapy, it is more suitable for men at high risk of general anesthesia . Typical inclusion criteria of PUL are a prostate volume between 20 mL and 70 mL, IPSS of 12 or greater, a measured Qmax of 15 mL/s or less, and PVR of less than 350 mL . The PUL system consists of two single use components (delivery device and an implant). The delivery device consists of a hand held pistol grip to which a needle‐shaped probe is attached. Each PUL implant consists of a super‐elastic nitinol capsular tab, a polyethylene terephthalate monofilament, and a stainless steel urethral end piece. The surgeon inserts the probe into the urethra until it reaches the prostatic urethra (the widest part of the prostatic urethra); a fine needle at the end of the probe deploys and secures an implant in a lobe of the prostate . One end of the implant is anchored in the urethra and the other is attached to the firm outer surface of the prostatic capsule, so pulling the prostatic lobe away from the urethra. This is repeated on the other lobe of the prostate. Systematically, four implants for PUL are delivered to both the right and left lateral lobes of the prostate (at the 2 and 10 o'clock position, distally from approximately 1.5 cm distal to the bladder neck). The median lobe of the prostate in which the ejaculatory duct is located is avoided .\n\n【14】#### Adverse events of the intervention\n\n【15】Mild adverse events, such as transient dysuria and hematuria are commonly reported with PUL . Incontinence was less prevalent with the PUL (5%) compared with TURP (11%) and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP; 14%) . However, reoperation rates were higher with the PUL (8%) than with TURP (6%) and HoLEP (4%) . In a feasibility study, implant encrustation occurred when PUL implants are placed too close to the bladder and exposed to static urine .\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】The fundamental idea of PUL is the separation and distraction of the enlarged prostatic tissue by a series of implants. The PUL system uses adjustable, permanent implants to hold excess prostatic tissue out of the way and thereby open the narrowed urethra without cutting or removing enlarged prostatic tissue . These implants are shaped as a double‐ended hook, and aim to increase the opening of the urethra .\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Until now, it is unclear whether PUL actually translates into more clinical benefits and less adverse events in clinical practice. While there are existing systematic reviews that compare PUL to other therapies used to treat BPH , these reviews merely pooled efficacy measurements, such as IPSS, Qmax, and PVR from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐RCTs, without discussing the harms of the intervention or assessing the quality of evidence. No systematic review so far has used the same rigorous methodology as a Cochrane Review, which includes the application of the GRADE approach and its focus on patient‐important outcomes . In today's era, with the availability of numerous minimally invasive procedures to treat BPH, the findings of this Cochrane Review will be highly relevant to policymakers, healthcare providers and patients alike.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】To assess the effects of prostatic urethral lift for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】We will include parallel group RCTs and cluster‐RCTs. We will exclude cross‐over trials, as these study designs are not relevant in this setting. If we only find RCTs that provide low‐quality evidence for a given outcome and comparison, we will also include non‐RCTs, such as cohort and cross‐sectional studies with concurrent comparison groups, as a source of complementary, sequential or replacement evidence for RCTs . We will not consider including single‐armed studies. We will include studies regardless of their publication status or language of publication.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】We will define the eligible patient population as men over the age of 40 with a prostate volume of 20 mL or greater (as assessed by digital rectal examination, and/or ultrasound or cross‐sectional imaging), with LUTS as determined by an IPSS of eight or over, and a Qmax of less than 15 mL/sec, as measured by non‐invasive uroflowmetry, or invasive pressure flow studies, or both . The age limitation is based on the observation that the prevalence of BPH increases in middle‐aged and older men, and is infrequent in younger men . We will include studies in which only a subset of participants are relevant to this review (i.e. trials with > 75% participants as relevant to the review), if data are available separately for the relevant subset.\n\n【28】We will exclude trials of men with active urinary tract infection, bacterial prostatitis, chronic renal failure, untreated bladder calculi or large diverticula, a diagnosis of prostate cancer, urethral stricture disease, and prior prostate, bladder neck, or urethral surgery. We will also exclude studies of patients with other conditions that affect urinary symptoms, such as neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or central nervous system disease.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We plan to investigate the following comparisons of experimental intervention versus comparator interventions. Concomitant interventions will have to be the same in the experimental and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons.\n\n【31】##### Experimental interventions\n\n【32】*   Prostatic urethral lift (PUL)\n\n【33】##### Comparator interventions\n\n【34】*   Sham control (or no intervention)\n\n【35】*   Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (monopolar or bipolar)\n\n【36】*   Laser ablations of the prostate (e.g. photoselective vaporization of the prostate)\n\n【37】*   Laser enucleations of the prostate (e.g. HoLEP)\n\n【38】*   Other minimally invasive therapies (e.g. transurethral incision of the prostate, transurethral thermal ablation of the prostate (needle ablation, microwave therapy, and radiofrequency ablative techniques), prostate stent, and prostatic arterial embolization)\n\n【39】*   Simple prostatectomy (e.g. open, laparoscopic, and robotic‐assisted prostatectomy)\n\n【40】##### Comparisons\n\n【41】*   PUL versus sham control (or no intervention)\n\n【42】*   PUL versus TURP\n\n【43】*   PUL versus laser ablations of the prostate\n\n【44】*   PUL versus laser enucleations of the prostate\n\n【45】*   PUL versus other minimally invasive therapies\n\n【46】*   PUL versus simple prostatectomy\n\n【47】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【48】We will not use the measurement of the outcomes assessed in this review as an eligibility criterion.\n\n【49】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【50】*   Urologic symptom scores\n\n【51】*   Quality of life\n\n【52】*   Major adverse events\n\n【53】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【54】*   Retreatment\n\n【55】*   Erectile function\n\n【56】*   Ejaculatory function\n\n【57】*   Minor adverse events\n\n【58】*   Acute urinary retention\n\n【59】*   Indwelling urinary catheter\n\n【60】*   Hospital stay\n\n【61】###### Method and timing of outcome measurement\n\n【62】We will consider clinically important difference for the review outcomes to rate overall quality of the evidence in the 'Summary of findings' table .\n\n【63】**Urologic symptom scores**\n\n【64】*   Mean change measured as a validated scale (such as IPSS).\n\n【65】*   We will consider improvement of the IPSS score of three points as a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to assess efficacy and comparative effectiveness . If possible, we will use different thresholds of MCID based on the severity of IPSS, with a threshold of three for men with mild LUTS, five for moderate LUTS, and eight for severe LUTS .\n\n【66】**Quality of life**\n\n【67】*   Mean change measured as a validated scale (such as IPSS‐quality of life or BPH Impact Index).\n\n【68】*   No threshold was established for the IPSS‐quality of life. We will use a MCID of one to assess efficacy and comparative effectiveness . We will consider improvement of the BPH Impact Index score of 0.5 as a MCID .\n\n【69】**Major adverse events**\n\n【70】*   For example, postoperative hemorrhage requiring admission or intervention.\n\n【71】*   We will use the Clavien‐Dindo classification system to assess surgical complications , and will categorize grade III, IV and V complications as major. If the study authors of eligible studies did not use the Clavien‐Dindo system, we will judge the adverse events by severity using the available information described in the studies.\n\n【72】**Retreatment**\n\n【73】*   Events requiring other surgical treatment modalities (e.g. TURP) after intervention.\n\n【74】**Erectile function**\n\n【75】*   Mean change, measured as erectile function domain of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) or total score of IIEF‐5 questionnaire .\n\n【76】*   We will consider the MCID in the erectile function domain score of IIEF of four . If possible, we will use different thresholds of MCID based on the severity of ED, with a threshold of two for men with mild erectile dysfunction, five for moderate erectile dysfunction, and seven for men with severe erectile dysfunction . We will also consider IIEF‐5 of over five points as MCID .\n\n【77】**Ejaculatory function**\n\n【78】*   Mean change, measured as Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction .\n\n【79】**Minor adverse events**\n\n【80】*   For example, postoperative fever or pain requiring medication.\n\n【81】*   We will use the Clavien‐Dindo classification system to assess surgical complications , and will categorize grade I and II complications as minor. If the authors did not use the Clavien‐Dindo system, we will grade the adverse events as described above.\n\n【82】**Acute urinary retention**\n\n【83】*   Events requiring catheterization after intervention.\n\n【84】**Indwelling urinary catheter**\n\n【85】*   Measured in days from intervention to urinary catheter removal.\n\n【86】**Hospital stay**\n\n【87】*   Measured in days from admission to discharge.\n\n【88】There is no reported threshold in adverse events, retreatment, ejaculatory function, acute urinary retention, indwelling urinary catheter, and hospital stay. We will consider the clinically important difference for adverse events, retreatment, and acute urinary retention as relative risk reduction of at least 25% . We will use a MCID of 25% improvement from baseline in MSHQ‐EjD for ejaculatory function . We will use a MCID of one day to assess efficacy and comparative effectiveness for indwelling urinary catheter and hospital stay.\n\n【89】We will consider outcomes measured up to and including 12 months after randomization as short‐term and later than 12 months as long‐term for urologic symptom scores, quality of life, major adverse events, erectile function, ejaculatory function, minor adverse events, and acute urinary retention. We assessed retreatment, indwelling urinary catheter and hospital stay as short‐term only.\n\n【90】###### Main outcomes for 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【91】We will present a 'Summary of findings' table reporting the following outcomes listed according to priority.\n\n【92】1.  Urologic symptom scores.\n\n【93】2.  Quality of life.\n\n【94】3.  Major adverse events.\n\n【95】4.  Retreatment.\n\n【96】5.  Erectile function.\n\n【97】6.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TNF inhibitors used for treatment of JIA‐U.\n\n【4】--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Uveitis is inflammation of the vascular middle layer of the eye, including the iris, choroid, and retina. Pediatric uveitis is a potentially sight‐threatening inflammatory condition, where up to 86% of those affected can develop ocular complications and 35% of cases result in vision loss . The most common systemic association of pediatric uveitis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA is the most common childhood chronic inflammatory disease, with a prevalence of 16 to 150 cases per 100,000 population . Uveitis is the most common extra‐articular manifestation of JIA and occurs in up to 30% of children with JIA . Uveitis is also a cause of high morbidity and long‐term organ damage in JIA ; it may precede onset of arthritis in 3% to 7% of children with JIA .\n\n【8】Despite the strong association between JIA and uveitis, the cause of uveitis is not fully understood. Uveitis is most frequently seen in the subtype of JIA with relatively benign course of arthritis. JIA‐uveitis (JIA‐U) is most often a chronic anterior uveitis, where patients may be completely asymptomatic, yet have significant inflammation that can lead to permanent ocular damage and loss of vision . Based on consensus standards, strict screening guidelines for eye exams among JIA patients are recommended in order to optimize early detection and treatment of JIA‐U .\n\n【9】The first‐line treatment for JIA‐U is topical or systemic glucocorticoids, or both. If inflammation is inadequately controlled after three months of steroids, systemic immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) is initiated. The first IMT of choice is methotrexate . Other types of IMT include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, calcineurin inhibitors, and interleukin inhibitors .\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】TNF inhibitors have been used as IMT in adults and children with autoimmune inflammatory diseases, including JIA‐U. Four monoclonal anti‐TNF antibodies are commercially available: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Etanercept is the only commercially available anti‐TNF receptor fusion protein.\n\n【12】Adalimumab and golimumab are fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. Infliximab is a mouse‐human chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Certolizumab pegol is a pegylated Fab fragment of humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Etanercept is a fusion protein of Fc region of human IgG1 and human TNF receptor 2. Infliximab is administered intravenously, whereas the other four TNF inhibitors are given subcutaneously .\n\n【13】Adalimumab and etanercept have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in JIA. Adalimumab is the only TNF inhibitor that is FDA‐approved for use in uveitis .\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an essential role in the immune system. It acts as a pivotal upstream trigger of an immune cascade that leads to cell activation and trafficking, cytokine and chemokine production, and initiation of apoptotic pathways . Although it is a key mediator that maintains homeostasis in the immune system, high systemic levels of TNF lead to vascular decompensation, inflammation, and organ injury . Dysregulation of inflammatory pathways triggered by cytokines like TNF is thought to be the underlying mechanism resulting in immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases, including non‐infectious uveitis.\n\n【16】TNF is produced by both immune and non‐immune cells, depending on the nature of the stimulus. It is synthesized as a transmembrane protein that is converted by an enzyme and released as a soluble fraction. Both membrane and soluble forms of TNF are biologically active . Activities of TNF are mediated through binding to TNF receptors I and II (TNFR1 and TNFR2), which are present in most cells, including pigment epithelial cells of the iris, ciliary body, and retina .\n\n【17】Under normal physiologic conditions, TNF is consumed, so serum level is not detected in healthy individuals. Following an inflammatory stimulus, serum levels of TNF can rise significantly, as it is produced in large quantities by activated cells . TNF levels in both serum and aqueous humor are elevated in individuals with uveitis . The levels of TNF correlate with the severity of disease . Intravitreal injection of TNF can induce uveitis in animal models . Persistent elevation of TNF in aqueous humor leads to tissue damage by reactive oxygen species, breakdown of blood ocular barrier, and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor leading to angiogenesis . In the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) model, TNF inhibition led to reduced cell trafficking into the retina and prevention of tissue destruction .\n\n【18】TNF inhibitors act as competitive antagonists to block receptor binding of both soluble and membrane TNF. Receptor blockage occurs by a monoclonal antibody or with a circulating receptor fusion protein .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】At present, considerable variations exist in how JIA‐U is treated. Due to the relative lack of clinical trials on JIA‐U, treatment for JIA‐U is based on personal experience and general practice guidelines. Even among published clinical studies, there is significant heterogeneity around outcome measures of JIA‐U . Several consensus statements have been published in Europe and North America based on expert recommendations. The majority on the expert panels were rheumatologists rather than ophthalmologists. In addition, differences are present even among these suggested standards of care . Despite these limitations, treatment with TNF inhibitors is becoming a mainstay for JIA‐U. We aim with this review to evaluate evidence from randomized controlled trials, explore possible outcome measures that can be more easily converted to clinical utility, and create a framework for reviewing new IMTs.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TNF inhibitors used for treatment of JIA‐U.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】We will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】We will include trials that enrolled participants with a diagnosis of JIA and uveitis who are aged 2 to 18 years old.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Interventions: TNF inhibitors (anti‐TNFs), including:\n\n【31】*   adalimumab (usually dosed at 24 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , 20 mg or 40 mg, subcutaneous every two weeks);\n\n【32】*   etanercept (usually dosed at 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneous twice weekly);\n\n【33】*   infliximab infusions (usually dosed at 3 to 6  mg/kg every two to eight weeks);\n\n【34】*   golimumab (usually dosed at 30 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body surface area (maximum dose: 50 mg) subcutaneous every four weeks or infusions 2 mg/kg every eight weeks);\n\n【35】*   certolizumab (used in adults: subcutaneous 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4, then 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks).\n\n【36】We will accept anti‐TNFs used at any dosing schedule as tested in the included trials.

Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background pain. Breakthrough pain usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity and generally self limiting with a mean duration of 30 minutes. Breakthrough pain has traditionally been managed by the administration of supplemental oral analgesia (rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around‐the‐clock (ATC) opioid dose.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine the efficacy of opioid analgesics given by any route, used for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer, and to identify and quantify, if data permitted, any adverse effects of this treatment.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries in January 2005 for the original review, and again on 6 February 2013 for this update.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain. Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life. We applied no language restrictions.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two review authors independently selected and examined eligible studies. We retrieved full text if any uncertainty about eligibility remained. We screened non‐English texts. We conducted quality assessment and data extraction using standardised data forms. We compared drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation and recorded details of all outcome measures (if available).\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】The original review included four studies (393 participants), all concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC versus normal‐release morphine and one study compared OTFC versus placebo.\n\n【12】Fifteen studies (1699 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this update. All studies reported on the utility of seven different transmucosal fentanyl formulations, five of which were administered orally and two nasally. Eight studies compared the transmucosal fentanyl formulations versus placebo, four studies compared them with another opioid, one study was a comparison of different doses of the same formulation and two were randomised titration studies.\n\n【13】Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl formulations were an effective treatment for breakthrough pain. When compared with placebo or oral morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity and higher pain relief scores for transmucosal fentanyl formulations at all time points. Global assessment scores also favoured transmucosal fentanyl preparations. One study compared intravenous with the transmucosal route and both were effective.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain. The RCT literature for the management of breakthrough pain is relatively small. Given the importance of this subject, more trials, including head‐to‐head comparisons of the available transmucosal fentanyl formulations are required.\n\n【16】### Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients\n\n【17】**Background**\n\n【18】Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are effective in the management of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden brief pain that occurs despite taking regularly scheduled doses of pain medication. It is a common and debilitating component of pain in patients with cancer.\n\n【19】**Study characteristics**\n\n【20】We sought clinical trial evidence to determine the effectiveness of opioids in relieving breakthrough pain and the incidence of side effects in cancer patients. The evidence is current to 6 February 2013.\n\n【21】We identified 15 trials and included 1699 participants. The identified studies examined the use of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate (an opioid medicine that relieves pain administered across the mucous membrane of either the mouth or nose) in breakthrough pain in cancer patients taking regularly scheduled opioids. Most studies measured similar outcomes.\n\n【22】**Key results**\n\n【23】Available data suggest that both oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are safe and effective (compared with both placebo and morphine) in relieving breakthrough pain. The side effect profiles of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate were similar to other opioids. Recommendations are made about future clinical trials.\n\n【24】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【25】We could wish for more consistency in study design and more studies comparing the oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate formulations to one another.\n\n【26】--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】Since the last review, none of the new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. The literature suggests that breakthrough pain (BTP) in cancer patients is a common and heterogeneous phenomenon. Patients with cancer pain should, therefore, be assessed for the presence of BTP and, if present, BTP should be specifically assessed; the subsequent management should be individualised based on the assessment. With respect to the utility of opioid pharmacotherapy, the practice of delivering a fixed proportion of the around‐the‐clock 'ATC' dose as rescue medication is not supported by this review, neither is the recommendation that the same opioid is used for the treatment of background and BTP, but in different formulations. This review suggests that the dose of rescue medication should be titrated in the same way that ATC medication is titrated for background pain. Furthermore, transmucosal fentanyl can be used in patients taking a variety of oral or transdermal opioids for background pain.\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】A number of opioids are available for the management of BTP and these opioids could be delivered by different formulations and different routes. Most of the studies identified in this review were placebo‐controlled studies undertaken by pharmaceutical companies for registration purposes. Although demonstrating that randomised controlled studies are possible in a palliative care setting, more head‐to‐head studies to confirm the findings using validated assessment tools are recommended; the reporting of dichotomous data (where each participant is in one or other category but not both) would also be welcomed, to ease analysis and interpretation, and make it easier for decision‐makers to understand and make judgements.\n\n【32】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【33】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

BTP is a common and distinct component of cancer pain that was first highlighted by Portenoy and Hagen . The prevalence of BTP has since been evaluated in a number of studies of cancer patients and ranges from 19% to 95% . This wide range is partially explained by the varied sampling procedures and inclusion or exclusion criteria used in different studies. Moreover, the terminology for describing 'breakthrough pain' is also varied and has been described as 'episodic pain', 'transient pain' and 'pain flare' . These terms are defined or recognised differently in different countries .\n\n【39】BTP is usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity and generally self limiting with a mean duration of 30 min . BTP is usually divided into two subtypes:\n\n【40】*   incident pain, precipitated by factors such as movement, walking, coughing, sitting and standing. In some cases, the causes are predictable and can be anticipated, although, occasionally, pain can be precipitated by factors such as flatulence and bladder spasm that are unpredictable;\n\n【41】*   spontaneous pain occurs in the absence of a relationship to specific activities and the lack of a definite trigger.\n\n【42】Some people may report pain that consistently occurs just before the next scheduled dose of around‐the‐clock (ATC) analgesia, so‐called 'end of dose pain', which results from an inadequate ATC analgesic dose or the fact that the interval between administrations is too long. Although sometimes included in the classification of BTP, it does not fit the above definition, as background pain is not controlled with the optimum dose of ATC medication.\n\n【43】### Description of the intervention\n\n【44】The traditional approach to managing BTP with rescue medication involves giving an additional dose, usually based on the patient's ATC analgesia . Rescue medication is best administered before or soon after BTP has started and, ideally, the medication should have a rapid onset and short duration of action to match the profile of most BTP. Opioids are most commonly administered, usually orally, although alternative routes include parenteral, transmucosal and rectal. The route of administration is important as it can often influence the time to onset of the analgesia.\n\n【45】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【46】BTP can have a profound impact on both patient and carers' quality of life. Patients with BTP are often less satisfied with their analgesic therapy, they have decreased functioning because of their pain, and may also experience social and psychosocial consequences such as increased levels of anxiety and depression . BTP can be a poor prognostic indicator , and the site of BTP may predict response to treatment . Furthermore, inadequately relieved BTP can place additional burden on the healthcare system, with increases in emergency and other medical visits, more hospital admissions and longer stays , in addition to an increased financial burden for patients .\n\n【47】Given the prevalence of the problem and the significance of adverse effects (AE) known to result from opioid medication, an assessment of the evidence of the effectiveness of opioids for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain is warranted.\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】To determine the efficacy of opioid analgesics given by any route, used for the management of BTP in patients with cancer, and to identify and quantify, if data permitted, any AE of this treatment.\n\n【50】Methods\n-------\n\n【51】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【52】#### Types of studies\n\n【53】We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), blinded and non‐blinded, published and unpublished, which assess the management of BTP.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To compare the effectiveness and safety of antecolic and retrocolic gastro‐/duodenojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy (pPD).\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Pancreatic cancer was predicted to be the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in 2014 in Europe  as well as in the United States . The global age‐standardised incidence rate of pancreatic cancer was estimated to be around 5 per 100,000 men and 3.2 per 100,000 women, with great differences between highly developed countries and less developed countries . While mortality rates for other types of cancer are predicted to fall, the mortality rate for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been rising in recent years . The majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are located in the head of the gland, and if the lesion is resectable, radical surgery is still the treatment of choice . Partial pancreaticoduodenectomy (pPD) is the standard treatment for tumours of the pancreatic head, benign precursor lesions such as intraductal mucinous neoplasia, or chronic pancreatitis that require a resective surgical approach . Due to improvements in imaging techniques and their increased use in health checks, an increasing number of asymptomatic lesions are discovered incidentally, leading to higher rates of pancreatic surgery . Due to surgical expertise and standardised perioperative management, pancreatic surgery, which is technically challenging, can be performed in specialised centres with low mortality rates of less than 5% . However, morbidity consisting of exemplarily postoperative pancreatic fistula, post‐pancreatectomy haemorrhage, biliary leakage, intra‐abdominal abscess, and delayed gastric emptying, remains at a high level of approximately 30% to 60% .\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】One of the most frequent complications after pPD, with rates between 14% to 61% reported in the literature, is delayed gastric emptying . Delayed gastric emptying impairs oral intake, interferes with the patient’s quality of life, often resulting in prolonged hospitalisation and delay of further treatment (e.g. necessary adjuvant chemotherapy). Several modifications of the surgical technique have been used in an attempt to reduce the frequency of delayed gastric emptying, for instance pylorus‐resecting versus pylorus‐preserving pPD , since the pylorus might have an influence on delayed gastric emptying, acting as a gatekeeper of the gastric outlet. Billroth‐II versus Roux‐en‐Y reconstruction  have also been compared, since the gastroenteric passage could be influenced by the passing of biliopancreatic juice. Furthermore, different perioperative treatment strategies have been used to reduce the impact of delayed gastric emptying, e.g. the application of erythromycin  is supposed to improve delayed gastric emptying by acting as a motilin‐agonist, or somatostatin analogues  which decrease gastric motility in healthy patients. The large variations in rates of delayed gastric emptying in different studies are attributable to the use of different definitions and assessment of delayed gastric emptying, hence, in 2007 the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) developed a consensus definition to provide comparability of future trial results by an objective assessment of this condition . There is a reasonable assumption that the method of bowel reconstruction after pPD (antecolic versus retrocolic) has an impact on delayed gastric emptying.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】The etiology of delayed gastric emptying has been attributed to multiple factors including other intra‐abdominal complications, e.g. intra‐abdominal abscess or postoperative pancreatic fistula. Nevertheless, not all cases of delayed gastric emptying are related to other complications and the route of reconstruction might be another influencing factor. Bowel continuity after pPD can either be established via an antecolic route (i.e. a jejunal loop is brought up anterior to the transverse colon for the gastroenteric anastomosis) or via a retrocolic route through a mesocolic window (i.e. a jejunal loop is brought up posterior to the transverse colon for the gastroenteric anastomosis). As suggested by several randomised and non‐randomised studies  the route of reconstruction and the angulation of the stomach/duodenum might influence the occurrence of delayed gastric emptying.\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】Several explanations have been provided for the potential difference between antecolic and retroclic reconstruction: the mobility of the descending jejunal loop might be different which supposedly decreases the risk of torsion or angulation. Furthermore, the different anatomic position between the gastroenteric anastomosis and the pancreaticojejunostomy might have an effect on the gastrointestinal passage, e.g. caused by a small pancreaticojejunal anastomotic leak or a transient mild postoperative pancreatitis . Furthermore, the angulation of the stomach can be different between the two techniques, thus influencing the gastrointestinal passage.\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Since delayed gastric emptying is still a frequent and clinically relevant problem after pPD, and the optimal reconstruction method to reduce the occurrence of delayed gastric emptying is still under debate; a recent systematic review including randomised and non‐randomised studies addressed this issue  but the analysis of the retropsective studies might introduce substantial bias in the light of a sufficient number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Furthermore one of the included studies  represents a preliminary report on the same set of patients of another included study , which is not addressed in the review. Therefore a systematic review with clear methodology comparing these two ways of reconstruction appears both, feasible and important.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins for preventing measles when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of symptoms.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Before vaccination against measles was available, annual case numbers were estimated at 130 million , and the disease caused between five and eight million deaths globally each year . With the introduction of the vaccine, the worldwide number of cases began to decline  and this trend continued with increasing vaccination coverage . However, the number of measles cases worldwide exceeded 300,000 in 2010  and measles is still an important cause of global mortality as identified by the joint World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) Global Immunization Vision and Strategy 2005‐2015 . One of the strategy's goals is measles mortality reduction. In 2008, measles caused around 164,000 deaths .\n\n【6】Further to mortality reduction, most WHO regions have set measles elimination goals and reported on progress towards these . Many countries have noted continued reductions in incidence  and even elimination of endemic transmission . However, the WHO cautions that failure to maintain high vaccination coverage in all areas of a country results in resurgence of the disease . Certainly, there are many recent published reports of measles outbreaks among countries with high vaccination coverage  and the WHO confirms that the incidence of measles worldwide increased in 2010 because of large outbreaks in some regions .\n\n【7】In countries with low incidences of measles, elimination strategies typically include an urgent response to a single reported case, including confirmation of the diagnosis, contact tracing and post‐exposure prophylaxis . Post‐exposure prophylaxis may be a vaccination, which seems to be effective at preventing disease onset if administered within 72 hours of exposure , or may involve passive immunisation with immunoglobulin, particularly if outside this 72‐hour window .\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Measles is a highly communicable viral illness . The measles virus is an enveloped, single‐stranded RNA _Morbillivirus_ of the family Paramyxoviridae . The virus is shed from the respiratory tract of infected persons and transmitted by aerosolised droplets or by direct contact with respiratory secretions . Someone with measles is contagious from one day before the symptoms start until four days after the rash appears. A susceptible person exposed to measles will usually develop symptoms after around 10 days but this may range from 7 to 18 days after exposure .\n\n【10】Symptoms of measles include fever, conjunctivitis, runny nose, cough and a red blotchy rash . The illness is often more severe in infants and adults than in children . Complications occur more frequently in cases in low‐income rather than high‐income countries (75% or more versus 10% to 15% of cases, respectively) . Middle ear infection and pneumonia are fairly common complications, occurring in 5% to 15%, and 5% to 10% of children with measles, respectively . Encephalitis is a serious, but rarer, complication of measles, occurring in about 1 out of every 1000 cases . A slowly progressing neurological disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), very rarely (1 out of 100,000 cases) occurs several years after the original measles infection, most often in children infected with measles under the age of two years .\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】The practice of passive immunisation against measles has been used since the 1930s . Polyclonal immunoglobulins are administered parenterally to susceptible individuals, who have been in contact with an infectious case of measles, in an attempt to prevent the onset of disease or modify disease expression .\n\n【13】Immunoglobulin preparations were originally made from animal sera but today are made from pooled donated human plasma . Both intramuscular and intravenous preparations are in use. Product names vary from country to country; so too the concentration of disease‐specific immunoglobulins in the products will generally reflect circulating antibody levels in the donating populations . Although, in some countries, minimum neutralising antibody concentrations to measles may be regulated .\n\n【14】Current recommendations for dose calculations vary by country, although they are all calculated according to body weight . Regardless of the dose recommended, passive immunisation is not currently recommended if more than six days have elapsed since exposure to measles .\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】Whether injected or infused, the administered immunoglobulins distribute throughout the recipient’s body . The mechanism by which the recipient is protected from disease involves interaction between the immunoglobulins, the invading measles virus particles and the cells and molecules of the recipient's immune system . The exact mechanisms by which viral infectivity is mitigated by antibodies within the body are not comprehensively understood, but vary according to the structure and functionality of the particular antibodies as they encounter the particular virus particles . In general, measles‐specific antibodies bind to invading measles virus particles and this may prevent their entry into cells directly, or trigger other immune mechanisms that result in neutralisation or destruction of the virus .\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】The effectiveness of post‐exposure prophylaxis against measles with immunoglobulins is generally accepted . However, effectiveness rates vary considerably among identified reports .\n\n【19】Further, national recommendations for the use of post‐exposure immunoglobulins for measles differ across a number of Western countries . Disease incidences , immunisation schedules , measles‐containing vaccine coverage  and relevant literature are similar. Differences in immunoglobulin dosage recommendations may reflect differences in the minimum levels of measles‐specific antibodies in intramuscular preparations .\n\n【20】We could not identify any systematic review evidence of the effectiveness of post‐exposure passive immunisation against measles, nor any systematic review evidence of the minimum effective dosage of immunoglobulin for post‐exposure prophylaxis against measles. Recent guidance from the United Kingdom on the required dosage of intramuscular immunoglobulin is based on a single study .\n\n【21】A systematic review of the evidence of effectiveness of passive immunisation for the post‐exposure prophylaxis of measles would help to clarify the effectiveness rate and the minimum effective dose and identify differences in benefit or harm across population groups. These outcomes would be valuable to guide public health practice in countries with low incidences of measles.\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】To assess the effectiveness and safety of intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins for preventing measles when administered to exposed susceptible people before the onset of symptoms.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and prospective non‐RCTs (cohort studies), irrespective of blinding, publication status, language or unit of randomisation. We will include prospective non‐RCTs given that more recent studies, using current immunoglobulin preparations, are likely to be non‐randomised for ethical reasons. The intervention has been part of public health practice since the 1930s and as such, any RCTs are likely to have been conducted at a time when the antibody levels of blood donors were due to infection with measles rather than vaccination. To inform practice appropriately, any evidence of the effectiveness of current immunoglobulin preparations should be included.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】People of any age, sex or ethnic origin who were susceptible (no history of measles and not vaccinated against measles and/or measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) negative) and exposed to measles virus or exposed to someone diagnosed with measles, and who were asymptomatic at the time of intervention or control administration. The primary study's definition of 'exposed' will be accepted and any differences explored via subgroup analysis.\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】1.  Intervention: intramuscular injection of polyclonal immunoglobulins; intravenous infusion of polyclonal immunoglobulins.\n\n【32】2.  Control: no intervention or placebo or live attenuated measles virus vaccine.\n\n【33】We will also include studies assessing different brands or preparations of polyclonal immunoglobulins or different dosages of immunoglobulins. We will only include studies where the intervention (and control) are administered to participants after exposure to measles and before the participants develop measles symptoms.\n\n【34】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【35】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【36】1.  Cases of measles. The diagnosis may be made by detection or isolation of measles virus in urine or respiratory secretions; by detection of measles virus antigen in urine or respiratory secretions; by serological detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) to measles in the absence of vaccination eight days to eight weeks prior to testing; by IgG seroconversion or by a fourfold or greater rise in titre to measles virus in the absence of vaccination eight days to eight weeks prior to testing; or by symptoms consistent with measles (fever, a red blotchy rash, conjunctivitis, runny nose and cough) or modified measles (prolonged incubation period, milder fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and sparse discrete rash of short duration).\n\n【37】2.  Mortality due to measles.\n\n【38】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【39】1.  Prevention of measles outbreak (higher than expected incidence) as identified by active surveillance.\n\n【40】2.  Cessation of measles outbreak (return to expected incidence) as identified by active and/or passive surveillance.\n\n【41】3.  Complications due to measles such as otitis media, pneumonia or encephalitis.\n\n【42】4.  Occurrence and type of adverse events. We will analyse two types of adverse events: serious adverse events and non‐serious adverse events. A serious adverse event is _\"_ any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life‐threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect _\"_ . We will classify all other events as non‐serious. We will specifically extract data on: blood‐borne virus infection; anaphylaxis; generalised hypersensitivity; and injection site reactions. We will also include any other adverse event reported as such by study authors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this review is to examine the effectiveness and safety of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Violence against women and girls is a major health and human rights concern . Women can experience physical or mental abuse throughout their lifecycle, in infancy, childhood, adolescence, during adulthood or older age . While violence has severe health consequences for the affected , it is a social problem that warrants an immediate coordinated response from multiple sectors including healthcare providers and social workers .\n\n【7】Domestic violence (DV) is referred to as spousal assault, intimate partner violence (IPV), wife abuse, wife assault, and battered wife syndrome . Most researchers define DV as threats of or actual physical injury from hitting, slapping, punching, choking, kicking, injury with weapon, or otherwise injuring an intimate partner . Assault and coercive behaviours include physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional attacks, and threats against property, children and pets, economic coercion, and many more such acts. Some are injurious and criminal in nature while others are not .\n\n【8】Although estimating the prevalence of domestic violence is difficult  and estimates might vary, specially during pregnancy, it is likely that most providers of a woman's healthcare service will encounter many pregnant women who are victims or survivors of domestic violence. For almost 30% of women who experience domestic violence, the first incident occurs in pregnancy . The prevalence of physical abuse during pregnancy varies around the world: in Canada, recorded occurrences range from 5.5% to 6.6% of all pregnancies; in the United States, 0.9% to 20.1% ; in the United Kingdom, 1.8% at booking, 5.8% at 34 weeks of gestation and 5.0% at 10 days postpartum ; in Sweden, 4.3% ; in South Africa, 6.8% ; and in India, 44% . The prevalence of psychological and sexual maltreatment of women during pregnancy has been also reported at between 13% and 60% . Domestic violence is reported within all socio‐economic class groupings but it is most prevalent within the working class and lower middle socio‐economic classes .\n\n【9】Abuse during pregnancy is of particular interest because it is a threat to both maternal and child health . It directly (e.g. via trauma to the abdomen) and indirectly affects the mortality and morbidity of infant and mother. It interacts with other health and economic risk factors, and it is a chronic and ongoing problem for mother and infant as the trend of violence tends to continue after pregnancy . It should also be noted that not all victims of domestic violence present with a particular set of symptoms. As such, the concept of domestic violence should not be conceptualized as a disease or syndrome, nor should it be considered as a specific health problem (e.g. injury or reproductive, physical, or mental health problem). Instead, abuse can be considered as a risk factor for all kinds of health problems. In fact, more often than not victims demonstrate strength and ability to take care of themselves and their infant, perhaps due to the nature of mothers being protective of their offspring, in spite of often untenable situations.  However, it is clear that abuse puts the victim at greatly increased risk for a multitude of physical and mental health problems .\n\n【10】Studies to date have demonstrated that physical abuse before, during, and after pregnancy is associated with reproductive health problems such as STDs , urinary tract infection , depression and other mental health problems , and substance abuse . Moreover, abuse during pregnancy is associated with higher incidence of unwanted pregnancy  and intentional abortions .\n\n【11】There are many negative effects of DV on pregnancy. The following harms have been clearly documented: maternal deaths , low birth weight , placental abruption , preterm labour and delivery , fetomaternal haemorrhage, fetal death , intrauterine growth retardation , pregnancy complications due to trauma , increased rates of miscarriage , chorioamnionitis , maternal infections, and poor weight gain . In addition, DV negatively affects pregnant women's health behaviours  leading to delayed entry into prenatal care or care at all , increased behavioral risks such as the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs, and poor maternal nutrition .\n\n【12】Physical injuries to fetuses, such as bruising, broken bones, and stab wounds, as well as death, have been also described . Children abuse is also reported more often among families with history of DV . Violent pregnancies are high risk and screening programs should be adopted to diagnose those at risk.\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】There are a number of interventions to prevent violence against pregnant mothers. The review by Sharps 2008 suggested that perinatal home visiting programs are likely to improve pregnancy and infant outcomes. Several studies show that interventions such as wallet‐size cards with community resources listed, spending time in a shelter, individual counselling, and home social support programs, alone or in combination, lead to decreases in physical abuse at six‐, 12‐, and 18‐month follow‐up visits when compared with those not receiving intervention . Based on the evidence reviewed , it is possible that intensive advocacy for women recruited in domestic violence shelters or refuges reduces physical abuse one to two years after the intervention. There is currently no such review for this type of intervention during pregnancy.\n\n【15】During routine prenatal checkups, the clinician has the opportunity to screen women and then refer to various intervention programs.  For women both screening and intervention programs would lead to referral of identified individuals to appropriate healthcare specialists or agencies for support. These interventions will include referral to social workers, shelters, counselling or other community‐based resources. For partners, referral can be made to batterer treatment programs. The effectiveness of these programs are not clear.\n\n【16】Whether intimate partner violence (IPV) screening reduces violence or improves health outcomes for women is unknown . Acceptability and effectiveness of domestic violence screening of women presenting in prenatal clinics has been studied . The authors' findings suggest that screening programs in antenatal clinics generally increased rates of identification of women experiencing domestic violence. Previous reviews have also failed to differentiate the variation in contexts for screening and have often combined results from disparate settings, which may hinder the evidence for whether or not screening programs are successful. A recent review found that screening programs that took a comprehensive approach (i.e., incorporated multiple program components, including institutional support) were successful in increasing IPV identification rates . Moreover, it is not clear whether IPV screening programs should or should not be universal . It cannot be assumed that a DV intervention program carries no risk of harm. Harmfull effects of interventions are to be investigated in this review as some of the interventions might endanger women by inadvertent breaches of confidentiality , inappropriate risk assessment, failed safety plan or poorly timed ending of relationship .\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】The goal of different types of interventions often is to reduce further abuse. Some interventions are designed to improve women's empowerment and to enhance their independence and control. Some attempt to keep women from danger of extreme violence and teach them how to stay safe. Generally, safeguarding, managing basics, managing symptoms, conducting a safe communication with others when in abusive relationship, gaining confidence, and regenerating family are the major set points for interventional programs . Healthcare providers may make positive contributions to women's access to special services designed to reduce violence. These interventions reduce women's exposure to violence and prepare them for obtaining better health . Reducing the contact between intimate partners in violence relationships also reduce opportunities for further abuse and potential harmful activities .\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Current literature on the subject is inconclusive. Some of the reviews concluded that interventions or screening have not been proven effective . Conversely, Horiuchi 2009 suggests that screening and interventions for pregnant women would be beneficial. It is therefore necessary to obtain a more comprehensive review of the existing evidence to identify the benefit or harm attributed to commonly practiced interventions to prevent or reduce IPV.\n\n【21】Moreover, time of pregnancy is a unique window of opportunity to screen and identify the victims of DV and the continuation of prenatal care even after delivery can facilitate the interventions. Women would welcome the opportunity to be asked about DV , although they need to be able to trust the care giver and be assured of confidentiality of the information exchanged . Therefore, healthcare professionals are in a unique position to identify and assist women during pregnancy. Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions during pregnancy remains inconclusive .\n\n【22】Given the emphasis on the development of primary care approaches, this review will attempt to assess available evidence on the effectiveness of interventions and to identify the best interventions to reduce or prevent DV during pregnancy.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】The objective of this review is to examine the effectiveness and safety of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【27】#### Types of studies\n\n【28】We will include randomized controlled trials and cluster‐randomized trials.\n\n【29】#### Types of participants\n\n【30】Pregnant women of any age at any stage of pregnancy and their partners (if intervention involves them). We will include studies that recruit both pregnant and non‐pregnant women, provided that data are reported separately for pregnant women, and will consider the data reported for pregnant women only in our analysis.\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will consider any intervention (including screening) that aims at reducing the number of episodes of intimate partner violence or investigates preventing domestic violence during pregnancy or postpartum for inclusion. Studies could include interventions done in any place, including healthcare services and community‐based studies.\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【35】The primary outcome to be measured is reduction of episodes of uni‐dimensional (physical, sexual, and/or psychological) violence or prevention of violence during and up to one year after pregnancy as defined by the authors of trials. We will record severity of these outcomes for sub‐analysis.\n\n【36】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【37】We will measure secondary outcomes as follows.\n\n【38】*   Depression including prenatal or postnatal depression.\n\n【39】*   Neonatal outcome:\n\n【40】    *   birthweight,\n\n【41】    *   Apgar first minute,\n\n【42】    *   Apgar score fifth minute,\n\n【43】    *   still birth,\n\n【44】    *   prenatal death.\n\n【45】*   Pregnancy outcome:\n\n【46】    *   miscarriage,\n\n【47】    *   antepartum haemorrhage,\n\n【48】    *   premature labour,\n\n【49】    *   abruptio placenta,\n\n【50】    *   maternal mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Migraine and headache studies were not considered.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】Randomised trials of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2003); EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2003); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library_ 2004, Issue 1; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register . Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two reviewers agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Fifty trials of 19 antidepressants were considered eligible (2515 patients) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and Number‐Needed‐to‐Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for the treatment of neuropathic pain.\n\n【13】Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.5) RR 4.1(95%CI 2.9‐5.9) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). There were insufficient data for an assessment of evidence of effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort, venlafaxine and L‐tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95%CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4(95%CI 5.2‐29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.2 (95%CI 1.7 to 3.1), RR 4.8(95%CI 2.5‐9.5)(three studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV‐related neuropathies.  \nThe number needed to harm(NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 16 (95%CI: 10‐45). The NNH for minor adverse effects was 4.6 (95%CI 3.3‐6.7)\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Antidepressants are effective for a variety of neuropathic pains. The best evidence available is for amitriptyline. There are only limited data for the effectiveness of SSRIs. It is not possible to identify the most effective antidepressant until more studies of SSRIs are conducted.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Neuropathic Pain\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】*   Antidepressants\n\n【20】###### Compariso\n\n【21】*   Placebo\n\n【22】###### Outcom\n\n【23】*   Difficulty Sleeping\n*   Adverse Effect Of Physical Agent\n*   Depression\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Pain Intensity\n*   Sleep Pattern\n*   Patient-Reported Outcome\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.\n\n【25】----------------------\n\n【26】### Medicines used to treat depression are also effective in treating neuropathic pain\n\n【27】A number of medicines used to treat depression (antidepressants) are effective in treating pain associated with nerve damage (neuropathic pain). We found that two‐thirds of patients with neuropathic pain who took traditional antidepressants (such as amitriptyline) obtained at least moderate pain relief. However, approximately one fifth found the side effects unacceptable. There is limited evidence that the newer antidepressants, known as SSRIs, are effective. Neuropathic pain can be treated with antidepressants and the effect is independent of any effect on depression .\n\n【28】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The majority of people with dementia develop behavioural disturbances, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Several non‐pharmacological interventions have been evaluated to treat BPSD in people with dementia. Simulated presence therapy (SPT), an intervention that uses video or audiotape recordings of family members played to the person with dementia, is a possible approach to treat BPSD.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To assess the effects of SPT on behavioural and psychological symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), CENTRAL ( _The Cochrane Library_ ) (9 February 2016), MEDLINE Ovid SP (1946 to 6 January 2017), Embase Ovid SP (1972 to 6 January 2017), PsycINFO Ovid SP (1806 to 6 January 2017), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1980 to 6 January 2017), LILACS via BIREME , ClinicalTrials.gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov ) , and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal ( apps.who.int/trialsearch ) . We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, including cross‐over studies, that evaluated the efficacy of SPT, consisting of personalised audio or videotape recordings of family members, in people with any form of dementia.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. No meta‐analyses were conducted because of substantial heterogeneity among the included studies.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】Three trials with 144 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials had a randomised cross‐over design, one was a cross‐over trial which we classified as quasi‐randomised.\n\n【12】Participants in the included studies were people with dementia living in nursing homes. They were predominantly women and had a mean age of over 80 years. SPT was performed using an audio or video recording prepared by family members or surrogates. It varied in its content, frequency of administration and duration. All the studies compared multiple treatments. In one study, SPT was compared with two other interventions; in the other two studies, it was compared with three other interventions. Specifically, SPT was compared to usual care, personalised music (two studies), a 'placebo' audiotape containing the voice of a person (two studies), and one‐to‐one social interaction performed by trained research assistants (one study). In terms of outcomes evaluated, one study considered agitation and withdrawn behaviour (both assessed with three methods); the second study evaluated verbal disruptive behaviour (assessed with three methods); and the third study evaluated physically agitated behaviour and verbally agitated behaviour (the method used was not clearly described).\n\n【13】According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very small numbers of participants and risk of bias in the included studies; (none of the trials was at low risk of selection bias; all the trials were at high risk of performance bias; one trial was at high risk of attrition bias; and all had unclear selective reporting).\n\n【14】Because of variation in the participants, the format of SPT, the comparison interventions, and the measures used to assess outcomes, we judged the results unsuitable for a meta‐analysis.\n\n【15】Within each trial, the effect of SPT on behaviour, compared to usual care, was mixed and depended on the measure used. Two trials which included a personalised music intervention reported no significant differences between simulated presence and music on behavioural outcomes. Because the overall quality of the evidence was very low, we were very uncertain regarding all the results\n\n【16】None of the studies evaluated quality of life or any of our secondary outcome measures (performance of activities of daily living, dropout and carer burden).\n\n【17】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【18】We were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of SPT for treating behavioural and psychological symptoms and improving quality of life of people with dementia. New high‐quality studies are needed to investigate the effect of SPT.\n### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Populatio\n\n【20】*   Dementia\n\n【21】###### Interventio\n\n【22】*   Simulated presence therapy\n\n【23】###### Compariso\n\n【24】*   Therapeutic Procedure\n*   Usual Care\n\n【25】###### Outcom\n\n【26】*   Dementia Symptoms - Behavioral And Psychiatric\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Depression\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Many people with dementia, particularly in its later stages, show signs of distress at times, or behave in ways which are difficult for their caregivers to manage. There is a lot of interest in finding ways to treat this without using drugs. Simulated presence therapy is a type of treatment which has been used mainly in nursing homes. It involves playing a personalised video or audiotape recording of family members to the person with dementia when he or she is distressed or agitated.\n\n【33】**Study characteristics**\n\n【34】We looked for trials which compared SPT to usual care or to another treatment. Ideally, people with dementia should have been randomly allocated to one or other treatment, but we also included trials even if treatment allocation was not strictly random.\n\n【35】We found three trials which met our inclusion criteria. The 144 participants were all living in nursing homes. The majority were women with an average age of over 80 years and severe dementia. The way SPT was administered was different in each trial. All the trials used more than one comparison treatment, which differed between trials. The trials all attempted to measure an effect on agitated behaviours, but used different approaches.\n\n【36】**Key findings**\n\n【37】Because the trials were so different from each other, we were not able to pool the results. Individually, each trial reported different methods to assess the effect of SPT on behavioural problems and the results varied depending on the method used to measure the outcome.\n\n【38】None of the studies assessed quality of life, effect on daily activities, effects on caregivers, or how likely participants were to drop out of the study.\n\n【39】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【40】The studies were small and all had problems with their methods which could have biased their results. Hence, we thought the overall quality of the evidence was very low, meaning we cannot be at all confident in the results.\n\n【41】**Conclusion**\n\n【42】Not enough high‐quality research has been done to allow us to judge whether SPT can help people with dementia who are distressed or agitated.\n\n【43】--------------\n\n【44】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【45】### Implications for practice\n\n【46】We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of SPT for people with dementia on behavioural disturbances, quality of life, activities of daily living or caregiver burden.\n\n【47】### Implications for research\n\n【48】The principal clinical trial registries do not have any ongoing or planned randomised trials on SPT for dementia.\n\n【49】This systematic review emphasises the need for more well‐designed, larger trials before conclusions can be drawn on the effectiveness of SPT to treat behavioural problems in dementia. Many methodological issues should be addressed, such as the comparability of different interventions, randomisation and blinding of outcome assessors, given that most of the outcomes of interest are subjective. Different types of SPT interventions, with different methods of implementation, should be standardised. In addition, the choice of the comparator is important, since some non‐pharmacological interventions (such as music therapy) can be more effective than others in the treatment of BPSD. Treatment effects for the different types of dementia and behavioural disturbances, as well as other variables, such as co‐morbidity and different settings, also need to be investigated. Assessing other outcomes of interest, such as quality of life, activities of daily living, caregiver burden and dropouts would also be of value.\n\n【50】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【51】Summary of findings for the main comparison.\n\n| **Simulated presence therapy compared with usual care for people with dementia**  | **Simulated presence therapy compared with usual care for people with dementia**  | **Simulated presence therapy compared with usual care for people with dementia**  | **Simulated presence therapy compared with usual care for people with dementia**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Patient or population** : dementia**Setting** : nursing home**Intervention** : Simulated presence therapy**Comparison** : usual care  | **Patient or population** : dementia**Setting** : nursing home**Intervention** : Simulated presence therapy**Comparison** : usual care  | **Patient or population** : dementia**Setting** : nursing home**Intervention** : Simulated presence therapy**Comparison** : usual care  | **Patient or population** : dementia**Setting** : nursing home**Intervention** : Simulated presence therapy**Comparison** : usual care  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Impact**  | **№ of participants(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  |\n| Overall BPSD (multidomain) – not assessed  | ‐  | ‐  | ‐  |\n| Agitation  | One study reported that agitation assessed by two methods (direct observation and weekly staff survey) was not reduced by SPT, while a third method (staff observation logs) showed a decline in agitation.

The prevalence of dementia is estimated to be 6% in populations aged 60 years or older . It increases dramatically with age, reaching 43% in people 85 years or older .\n\n【60】Dementia imposes a considerable burden on families and is becoming a major socioeconomic challenge for the healthcare system . It is one of the strongest predictors of nursing home admission and is a major clinical issue for nursing home residents. Its prevalence varies from 26% to 48% in US nursing homes to over 60% in European nursing homes .\n\n【61】The majority of people with dementia develop behavioural disturbances, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), over the course of the condition. BPSD comprise a heterogeneous group of non‐cognitive symptoms, such as agitation, disruptive behaviour, aberrant motor behaviour including wandering, irritability, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, apathy, delusions, disinhibition, and appetite and sleep alterations . BPSD are a major component of the dementia syndrome as they are strongly correlated with the severity of functional impairment, occurring most frequently in people with dementia in hospitals and nursing homes . These symptoms are independently associated with poor outcomes such as distress among those with dementia and their caregivers, inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medication, long‐term hospitalisation, mortality, excess morbidity, institutionalisation, early placement in a nursing home, and increased healthcare costs .\n\n【62】Several studies have documented that almost all people with dementia experience at least one episode of behavioural disturbance at some point during their illness . In a cohort of 408 dementia participants, for example, the Cache County Study estimated the five‐year period prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and found that 97% of the participants experienced at least one symptom. Five‐year period prevalence was highest for depression (77%), apathy (71%), and anxiety (62%). Rates for agitation/aggression vary between 13% and 24% . Behavioural symptoms frequently occur together (for example wandering with sleep problems or irritability with persecutory delusions) .\n\n【63】### Description of the intervention\n\n【64】Behavioural problems in people with dementia are often treated with drugs, which may lead to several adverse outcomes including sedation, falls, extrapyramidal disturbances, stroke, and increased mortality . For this reason, non‐pharmacological interventions are an appealing alternative ; and have been recommended as a first choice of treatment for BPSD . Several non‐pharmacological interventions have been evaluated to treat BPSD in people with dementia . These include emotion‐oriented therapies (such as reminiscence therapy , simulated presence therapy , validation therapy ), sensory stimulation interventions (such as acupuncture , aromatherapy , light therapy , massage/touch therapy , music therapy , Snoezelen multisensory stimulation , and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ), and other interventions (such as functional analysis‐based interventions , and exercise therapy ).\n\n【65】It has been reported that psychosocial interventions work best to reduce agitation and improve other behavioural disturbances in people with dementia when they are personalised to reflect the individual's background and environmental circumstances .\n\n【66】The focus of this review is simulated presence therapy (SPT), in which video or audiotape recordings of family members are played to the person with dementia . The content of the recordings may vary depending upon the interests of the individual and may include conversations, stories, or shared memories. The intention is that the recorded voice of a family member is reassuring and that anxiety and distress are reduced by making the environment of the person with dementia as familiar as possible .\n\n【67】### How the intervention might work\n\n【68】SPT is sometimes referred to as simulated family presence therapy , because it originated from the observation that nursing home residents who received more visits from family members were less agitated and had greater life satisfaction . Since family members may not be able to visit frequently, and family visits may be forgotten rapidly by residents with dementia, SPT aims to reduce the separation anxiety experienced by the resident .\n\n【69】The technique was first described in a 1995 study by Woods and Ashley, in which 27 nursing home residents with dementia listened to a tape prepared by their caregivers. The authors reported a substantial reduction of behavioural problems such as verbal aggression and social isolation, and an increase in positive behaviours such as proper verbalisation, smiling, and singing . In the following years, a limited number of studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of SPT. These studies are characterised by considerable methodological heterogeneity, including different outcomes, as some studies examined the effect of SPT on quality of life, while other investigations attempted to reduce challenging behaviours.\n\n【70】Although SPT has been investigated for more than 20 years, the mechanisms by which SPT might work are still unknown. Several explanatory models have been proposed for behavioural disturbances. According to the need‐driven, dementia‐compromised behaviour model, behavioural disturbances of the cognitively impaired person are an expression of an unmet need or goal . These disturbances might therefore be seen as an expression of the person seeking help or contact from family members. In this respect SPT might fulfil this unmet or personal need.\n\n【71】Another conceptual framework, the progressively lowered stress threshold model, proposes that people with dementia become progressively unable to understand their environment (for example recognize objects and their purposes and use). As a consequence, people with dementia experience stress that causes a variety of behavioural disturbances . In this context, voices and images of family members may represent well‐known references that help to lower stress levels.\n\n【72】Generally, the literature is scarce in terms of the epidemiology of adverse events associated with non‐pharmacological interventions. In the case of SPT, adverse events cannot be excluded, including the possibility that the intervention might worsen agitation or mood. Woods and Ashley reported that in 7% of the observation during SPT treatment, behaviours either remained unchanged or worsened with the audiotape . In some cases, for example, material contained in the tapes could be distressing for the person with dementia .\n\n【73】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【74】The majority of BPSD, in particular agitation, disruptive behaviour, and aberrant motor behaviours, are currently treated with psychotropic drugs that are not very effective , have several important adverse effects including increased mortality , and result in excessive drug costs and healthcare utilisation . Non‐pharmacological interventions should therefore be the first choice to treat BPSD.\n\n【75】SPT is a simple intervention that does not require expensive equipment, nor does it require extensive training. In addition, SPT reproduces an encounter of the patient with a family member, which is usually a positive experience for the former. The potentially relevant adverse event is an increase in agitation, which should not cause a serious risk for the patient's health. As such, we believe that it is important to verify whether SPT is effective in treating BPSD in people with dementia.\n\n【76】Objectives\n----------\n\n【77】To assess the effects of SPT on behavioural and psychological symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia.\n\n【78】Methods\n-------\n\n【79】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【80】#### Types of studies\n\n【81】We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, including cross‐over studies, of SPT in people with dementia.\n\n【82】#### Types of participants\n\n【83】People with any form and severity of dementia diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, Revision 10 (ICD‐10), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM‐IV), DSM‐5, or comparable criteria.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To undertake a systematic review comparing the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic cardiomyotomy and endoscopic pneumatic dilation in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia.\n\n【3】--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Achalasia is an progressive neuromuscular disorder of the oesophagus resulting from destruction of oesophageal neurons . Selective loss of inhibitory neural input occurs with preservation of excitatory nerves . This results in reduced motility and failure of the lower oesophageal sphincter to relax following swallowing. Symptoms are gradual in onset, progressive in nature and include difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, regurgitation, sleep disturbance, chest pain and weight loss. The annual incidence is approximately one in 100,000 people, with an equal sex incidence . It tends to present in adult life between about 25 and 60 years old.\n\n【7】The diagnosis is made using a combination of endoscopy, contrast swallow studies, pH studies and oesophageal manometry (pressure analysis). Manometry provides the definitive diagnosis . The classic features are an adynamic oesophagus, high pressure in the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) and failure of the LOS to relax on swallowing. Untreated, it leads to an extremely poor quality of life because of progressive difficulty swallowing, oesophageal dilatation, stasis and aspiration.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】All current treatments are palliative and aim to reduce the pressure at the LOS, these include pharmacological therapy, endoscopic pneumatic dilation (PD), intrasphincteric botulinum toxin injection and surgical myotomy (division of the LOS).\n\n【10】Pharmacological treatments such as oral nitrates, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergic agents and beta‐adrenergic agonists have limited effectiveness . Approximately 30% of patients will benefit from calcium channel blockers . A Cochrane review failed to find sufficient evidence to assess the effect of nitrates effectively . Intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin to paralyze the LOS is a safe endoscopic procedure associated with few side effects or complications . Botulinum toxin is injected in divided doses into the four quadrants of the LOS under direct vision with a gastroscope. Although initial efficacy is good, remission is maintained at 12 months in only 26% .\n\n【11】Pneumatic dilation to stretch the LOS may involve the use of a variety of balloon types and protocols. Initial success is high. Oesophageal perforation, a serious potentially life‐threatening complication occurs in up to 3% of cases . Meta‐analysis suggests that PD is more effective than Botulinum toxin injection in the long term . However the need for re‐intervention at five years may be greater than 50% , although some authors report satisfactory outcomes in 72% patients at 70 months .\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】Surgical myotomy involves division of the LOS and may be performed via a transabdominal or transthoracic approach. A laparoscopic (minimally invasive) transabdominal approach is generally accepted now to be the operative procedure of choice . Recovery is more rapid and length of hospital stay reduced following minimally invasive cardiomyotomy compared with conventional open surgery.\n\n【14】Surgical myotomy offers the potential benefit of reduction in the need for multiple procedures and may provide better overall palliation . An antireflux partial fundoplication (wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the LOS) reduces the rate of pathological gastro‐oesophageal reflux post myotomy from 47% to 9%  and is therefore usually performed. A meta‐analysis of randomized trials addressing all the main treatment modalities for achalasia concluded that laparoscopic myotomy was the preferred method of treatment. However follow‐up periods were short and trial and patient numbers were low.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Surgical myotomy and endoscopic dilation are well‐established treatments with acceptable efficacy and safety profiles. This review will aim to help clinicians and patients choose between surgical myotomy and endoscopic dilation in the treatment of achalasia.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To undertake a systematic review comparing the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic cardiomyotomy and endoscopic pneumatic dilation in the treatment of oesophageal achalasia.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with or without blinding, comparing laparoscopic cardiomyotomy to endoscopic pneumatic dilation in the primary treatment of achalasia.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Patients of any age diagnosed with achalasia by clinical, endoscopic, radiographic and manometric investigations.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】*   Laparoscopic cardiomyotomy with or without an anti‐reflux wrap\n\n【27】*   Pneumatic dilation with varying balloons and methods of stretch\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】*   Symptom remission rates at 12 months\n\n【31】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【32】*   Symptom remission rate at six months and five years\n\n【33】*   Time to relapse\n\n【34】*   LOS pressure confirmed by oesophageal manometry\n\n【35】*   Quality of life post intervention (however defined by authors)\n\n【36】*   Complications related to PD or laparoscopic cardiomyotomy\n\n【37】*   Conversion to open surgery\n\n【38】*   Need for further procedures\n\n【39】*   Mortality", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

If individuals do not take up smoking during this period it is unlikely that they ever will. Further, once smoking becomes established, cessation is challenging; the probability of subsequently quitting is inversely proportional to the age of initiation. One novel approach to reducing the prevalence of youth smoking is the use of incentives.\n\n【2】### Objectives\n\n【3】To determine whether incentives prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. We also attempted to assess the dose‐response of incentives, the costs of incentive programmes, whether incentives are more or less effective in combination with other interventions to prevent smoking initiation and any unintended consequences arising from the use of incentives.\n\n【4】### Search methods\n\n【5】We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, with additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CSA databases and PsycINFO for terms relating to incentives, in combination with terms for smoking and tobacco use, and children and adolescents. The most recent searches were in May 2012.\n\n【6】### Selection criteria\n\n【7】We considered randomized controlled trials allocating children and adolescents (aged 5 to 18 years) as individuals, groups or communities to intervention or control conditions, where the intervention included an incentive aimed at preventing smoking uptake. We also considered controlled trials with baseline measures and post‐intervention outcomes.\n\n【8】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【9】Data were extracted by two authors and assessed independently. The primary outcome was the smoking status of children or adolescents at follow‐up who reported no smoking at baseline. We required a minimum follow‐up of six months from baseline and assessed each included study for risk of bias. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial; we did not require biochemical validation of self‐reported tobacco use for study inclusion. Where possible we combined eligible studies to calculate pooled estimates at the longest follow‐up using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method, grouping studies by study design.\n\n【10】### Main results\n\n【11】We identified seven controlled studies that met our inclusion criteria, including participants with an age range of 11 to 14 years. Of the seven trials identified, only five had analysable data relevant for this review and contributed to the meta‐analysis (6362 participants in total who were non‐smokers at baseline; 3466 in intervention and 2896 in control). All bar one of the studies was a trial of the so‐called Smokefree Class Competition (SFC), which has been widely implemented throughout Europe. In this competition, classes with youth generally between the ages of 11 to 14 years commit to being smoke free for a six month period. They report regularly on their smoking status; if 90% or more of the class is non‐smoking at the end of the six months, the class goes into a competition to win prizes. The one study that was not a trial of the SFC was a controlled trial in which schools in two communities were assigned to the intervention, with schools in a third community acting as controls. Students in the intervention community with lower smoking rates at the end of the project (one school year) received rewards.\n\n【12】Only one study of the SFC competition, a non‐randomized controlled trial, reported a significant effect of the competition on the prevention of smoking at the longest follow‐up. However, this study had a risk of multiple biases, and when we calculated the adjusted RR we no longer detected a statistically significant difference. The pooled RR for the more robust RCTs (3 studies, n = 3056 participants) suggests that, from the available data, there is no statistically significant effect of incentives to prevent smoking initiation among children and adolescents in the long term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19). Pooled results from non‐randomized trials also did not detect a significant effect, and we were unable to extract data on our outcome of interest for the one trial that did not study the SFC. There is little robust evidence to suggest that unintended consequences (such as youth making false claims about their smoking status and bullying of smoking students) are consistently associated with such interventions, although this has not been the focus of much research. There was insufficient information to assess the dose‐response relationship or to report costs.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】To date, incentive programmes have not been shown to prevent smoking initiation among youth, although there are relatively few published studies and these are of variable quality. Trials included in this meta‐analysis were all studies of the SFC competition, which distributed small to moderately sized prizes to whole classes, usually through a lottery system.\n\n【15】Future studies might investigate the efficacy of incentives given to individual participants to prevent smoking uptake. Future research should consider the efficacy of incentives on smoking initiation, as well as progression of smoking, evaluate these in varying populations from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, and describe the intervention components in detail.\n### PICOs\n\n【16】###### Populatio\n\n【17】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Non-smoker\n*   Smoking Prevention\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【18】###### Interventio\n\n【19】###### Compariso\n\n【20】###### Outcom\n\n【21】*   Smoking Started\n\n【22】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Starting smoking earlier in life means a smoker will smoke for more years than someone who starts smoking later, which increases the associated health risks of smoking. Given the high amount of tobacco use among young people and the corresponding poor health outcomes this will result in in the future, strategies to prevent smoking in adolescence are a public health priority. One new approach to preventing young people from starting to smoke is the use of incentives, whereby young people or groups of young people are rewarded for being smoke free. The aim of this review was to assess the effect of incentives on preventing children and adolescents (aged 5 to 18 years) from starting to smoke.\n\n【25】This review included seven trials, six of which were trials of the so‐called Smokefree Class Competition (SFC), which has been widely used throughout Europe. In this competition, classes with youth generally between the ages of 11 to 14 years commit to being smoke free for a six month period. They report regularly on their smoking status, and if 90% or more of the class is non‐smoking at the end of the six months, the class goes into a competition to win prizes. We combined results from five trials of SFC and found that the competition did not have a significant impact on whether or not young people who were previously non‐smokers started smoking. In the one trial that was not of the SFC, classes with the smallest percentage of students smoking at the school year's end were given rewards, but we did not have enough information available to evaluate whether this programme was effective in preventing young people from starting to smoke.\n\n【26】Currently, there is no high quality evidence that incentives prevent young people from starting to smoke in the long term. Specifically, incentives associated with the SFC competition have not been shown to prevent young people from starting to smoke in the medium to long term, although there are relatively few published studies and these are of variable quality. Though potential negative effects of the SFC competition have not been widely researched, the data that is available suggests that the SFC competition does not have significant negative effects.\n\n【27】--------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
