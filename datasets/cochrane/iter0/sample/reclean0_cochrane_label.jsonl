However, continued post‐surfactant intubation and ventilation are risk factors for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The purpose of this review was to compare outcomes between two strategies of surfactant administration in infants with RDS; prophylactic or early surfactant administration followed by prompt extubation, compared with later, selective use of surfactant followed by continued mechanical ventilation.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk for RDS: early surfactant administration with brief mechanical ventilation (less than one hour) followed by extubation vs. later selective surfactant administration, continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support. Two populations of infants receiving early surfactant were considered: spontaneously breathing infants with signs of RDS (who receive surfactant administration during evolution of RDS prior to requiring intubation for respiratory failure) and infants at high risk for RDS (who receive prophylactic surfactant administration within 15 minutes after birth).\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】Searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (1966 ‐ December 2006), CINAHL (1982 to December Week 2, 2006), EMBASE (1980 ‐ December 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006), Pediatric Research (1990 ‐ 2006), abstracts, expert informants and hand searching. No language restrictions were applied.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled clinical trials comparing early surfactant administration with planned brief mechanical ventilation (less than one hour) followed by extubation vs. selective surfactant administration continued mechanical ventilation, and extubation from low respiratory support.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Data were sought regarding effects on the incidence of mechanical ventilation (ventilation continued or initiated beyond one hour after surfactant administration), incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of respiratory support (including CPAP and nasal cannula), number of patients receiving surfactant, number of surfactant doses administered per patient, incidence of air leak syndromes (pulmonary interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax), patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment, pulmonary hemorrhage, and other complications of prematurity. Stratified analysis was performed according to inspired oxygen threshold for early intubation and surfactant administration in the treatment group: inspired oxygen within lower (FiO <sub>2 </sub> < 0.45) or higher (FiO <sub>2 </sub> \\> 0.45) range at study entry. Treatment effect was expressed as relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for categorical variables, and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Six randomized controlled clinical trials met selection criteria and were included in this review. In these studies of infants with signs and symptoms of RDS, intubation and early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to nasal CPAP (NCPAP) compared with later selective surfactant administration was associated with a lower incidence of mechanical ventilation \\[typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57, 0.79\\], air leak syndromes \\[typical RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28, 0.96\\] and BPD \\[typical RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26, 0.99\\]. A larger proportion of infants in the early surfactant group received surfactant than in the selective surfactant group \\[typical RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.41, 1.86\\]. The number of surfactant doses per patient was significantly greater among patients randomized to the early surfactant group \\[WMD 0.57 doses per patient, 95% CI 0.44, 0.69\\]. In stratified analysis by FIO <sub>2 </sub> at study entry, a lower threshold for treatment (FIO <sub>2 </sub> < 0.45) resulted in lower incidence of airleak \\[typical RR 0.46 and 95% CI 0.23, 0.93\\] and BPD \\[typical RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20, 0.92\\]. A higher treatment threshold (FIO <sub>2 </sub> \\> 0.45) at study entry was associated with a higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus requiring treatment \\[typical RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.09, 4.13\\].\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Early surfactant replacement therapy with extubation to NCPAP compared with later selective surfactant replacement and continued mechanical ventilation with extubation from low ventilator support is associated with less need mechanical ventilation, lower incidence of BPD and fewer air leak syndromes. A lower treatment threshold (FIO <sub>2 </sub> < 0.45) confers greater advantage in reducing the incidences of airleak syndromes and BPD; moreover a higher treatment threshold (FIO <sub>2 </sub> at study > 0.45) was associated with increased risk of PDA. These data suggest that treatment with surfactant by transient intubation using a low treatment threshold (FIO <sub>2 </sub> < 0.45) is preferable to later, selective surfactant therapy by transient intubation using a higher threshold for study entry (FIO <sub>2 </sub> \\> 0.45) or at the time of respiratory failure and initiation of mechanical ventilation.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (5)\n\n【20】*   Very Preterm Infant (28-31 weeks)\n*   Extremely Preterm Infant (<28 weeks)\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【21】###### Intervention (5)\n\n【22】*   Administration Of Prophylactic Medication\n*   Lung Surfactants\n*   Intubation\n*   Extubation Of Trachea\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【23】###### Comparison (4)\n\n【24】*   Lung Surfactants\n*   Extubation Of Trachea\n*   Usual Care\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【25】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【26】*   Chronic Lung Disease\n*   Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Of Newborn\n*   Death\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n*   Oxygen Supplementation\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Common treatments for RDS include supplemental oxygen and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). For severe RDS, surfactant administration during mechanical ventilation is used. Although treating RDS with surfactant improves clinical outcomes, mechanical ventilation can cause lung injury in preterm infants with RDS and contribute to the development of chronic lung disease (oxygen requirements at 36 weeks) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (requirement for supplementary oxygen at 28 days, BPD). An important question is whether giving early surfactant with planned brief mechanical ventilation followed by prompt extubation (to NCPAP) is better than selectively giving surfactant when RDS has worsened causing respiratory insufficiency necessitating mechanical ventilation. The review authors identified six randomized trials reported between 1994 and 2006 that met the selection criteria for this review. A strategy of early surfactant administration with extubation to NCPAP was associated with significant reductions in the need for mechanical ventilation, fewer air leak syndromes (such as pneumothorax) and lower incidence of BPD compared with a strategy of later selective surfactant administration and continued mechanical ventilation in infants with RDS. The findings suggest that a lower treatment threshold (oxygen requirement < 0.45) confers greater advantage than does a higher treatment threshold (oxygen requirement > 0.45).\n\n【34】An early surfactant therapy strategy results in a greater number of infants receiving surfactant and so more infants being exposed to the potential risks of intubation and surfactant administration. Although no complications of surfactant administration were reported in the studies reviewed, infants treated with an early surfactant therapy strategy tended to have a higher prevalence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Two trials were terminated prior to achieving the targeted enrollment when the need for mechanical ventilation was found to be significantly different between groups at a scheduled interim analysis. Two other trials experienced slow enrollment leading to reduced numbers.\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of buprenorphine for pain in adults and children with cancer.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pain has been found to affect about 75% of people with advanced cancer ( Deandra 2008 ). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of cancer was 12,667,470 (new cases) in 2008 and based on projections it will be more than 15 million cases in 2020. Unrelieved cancer pain is a cause of major suffering worldwide. Globally, millions of people suffer from unrelieved pain, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries ( World Bank 2013 ), where cancer is diagnosed in late stages when pain is often severe ( Seya 2011 ; WHO 2008). Estimates of the prevalence of cancer pain have varied widely. In part this has been due to a lack of standardisation in definitions of pain and in the measures used to assess it, and because of the heterogeneity of cancer diagnoses. There is also heterogeneity in terms of where and in what setting patients with cancer, and cancer pain, receive their treatments (e.g. in outpatient clinics, in hospitals or in day units). In general, prevalence of pain at the time of cancer diagnosis and early in the course of disease is thought to be approximately 50%, increasing to 75% in the more advanced stages ( Portenoy 1989 ). According to a systematic review, pain prevalence ranges from 33% in patients after curative cancer treatment, to 59% in patients on anticancer treatment and to 64% in patients with metastatic, advanced or terminal phase disease ( van den Beuken‐van Everdingen 2007 ).\n\n【7】Cancer pain may be acute and chronic and is divided into four physiological types, somatic (or nociceptive), visceral, neuropathic and sympathetically maintained pain ( Foley 1998 ). Each of these pain types can result from the tumour itself causing compression or infiltration, or it may be more indirectly related to the cancer and its treatments, for example constipation, muscle spasms, post‐surgical scars or lymphoedema. Patients with cancer may have painful concurrent disorders which might be exacerbated by the presence of the cancer, for instance osteoarthritis.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Buprenorphine is prescribed in the management of cancer pain, but is not a typical first‐line opioid. It is, however, starting to experience a renaissance in the management of both chronic cancer and non‐cancer pain and it is also used in opioid‐dependence ( Foster 2013 ).\n\n【10】Buprenorphine is classified as a step III opioid analgesic by the WHO ( WHO 1996 ). It has mixed agonistic and antagonistic properties. Its opioid agonistic activity is exerted on mu‐opioid receptors and the ORL‐1 receptor, whilst it is a kappa and delta‐opioid receptor antagonist. It is given either transdermally (via a patch), as an injection or via the oral mucosa (sublingually). Largely metabolised by the liver, buprenorphine goes through dealkylation and glucuronidation and is excreted predominantly in bile. Buprenorphine pharmacokinetics vary with route of administration. Whilst the sublingual and intramuscular routes produce similar outcomes in terms of pain‐relief, when taken orally, buprenorphine undergoes extensive pre‐systemic elimination ( Bullingham 1981 ; Bullingham 1983 ). Oral bioavailability is therefore low (15%) due to extensive first‐pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver, it is however longer acting than morphine. Whilst buprenorphine is rapidly absorbed via oral mucosa, absorption into the systemic circulation is slow (t _max_ is 30 minutes to 3.5 hours after a single dose; 1 to 2 hours with repeat dosing; Elkader 2005 ), but it subsequently has a long duration of action (6 to 8 hours), which suggests that sublingual buprenorphine may be not suited for the management of breakthrough pain. One study has however demonstrated the successful use of buprenorphine as a breakthrough analgesic for patients on maintenance transdermal buprenorphine ( Poulain 2008 ).\n\n【11】Buprenorphine activity as a partial agonist at the µ receptor means it has agonist and antagonist activity. Its long duration of action is thought to be due to an unusually slow dissociation constant for the drug‐receptor complex. Naloxone appears to be relatively ineffective in reversing opioid effects from buprenorphine, despite naloxone's high affinity for the µ receptor ( Gal 1989 ). In humans, a ceiling effect has been shown with buprenorphine for respiratory depression but not for analgesia ( Dahan 2005 ; Dahan 2006 ). Whilst buprenorphine has been shown to slow intestinal transit, it possibly does this less than morphine ( Bach 1991 ; Robbie 1979 ); importantly, constipation as an adverse effect may be less severe ( Pace 2007 ) _._ Buprenorphine also exerts little or no pressure on pancreatic and biliary ducts, distinguishing it from morphine in this respect ( Staritz 1986 ). Compared with other opioids, buprenorphine causes little or no immunosuppression ( Budd 2004 ; Sacerdote 2000 ; Sacerdote 2008 ). As a drug, buprenorphine does not accumulate in renal failure, and it is not removed by haemodialysis. This means that analgesia is unaffected, making it potentially clinically useful in these situations ( Filitz 2006 ; Hand 1990 ).\n\n【12】Examples of buprenorphine patch preparations are 3‐ or 7‐day transdermal formulations (5, 10, 20, 35, 52.5, 70 microgram/hour). It is a highly lipid‐soluble drug, making it ideal for transdermal delivery. Within patch formulations it is evenly distributed in a drug‐in‐adhesive matrix and its release is governed by the physical attributes of the matrix and proportional to the surface area of the patch. It is also available as an injection (300 micrograms). Buprenorphine via either the transdermal or injectable route is approved for managing moderate to severe chronic pain. Sublingual tablets and a sublingual film preparation are also available in some countries and are combined with naloxone, but at present these are used for the treatment of opioid addiction, although some sublingual tablets (200 microgram and 400 microgram) without naloxone are available for chronic moderate to severe pain. It should not be used for acute pain, for example, when there is a need for rapid dose titration for severe pain in cancer and palliative care settings.\n\n【13】Buprenorphine is most commonly prescribed as a transdermal formulation for cancer patients. It is estimated to be 70‐115 times more potent than oral morphine ( Likar 2008 ; Mercadante 2009 ; Sittl 2005 ). In practical terms, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have suggested using caution when calculating opioid equivalences for transdermal patches and have suggested that a transdermal buprenorphine patch of 20 microgram/hour equates to approximately 30 mg of oral morphine daily ( NICE 2012 ).\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Many patients with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with strong analgesics. In 1986, the WHO published the Method for Cancer Pain Relief (WHO analgesic ladder) advocating a stepwise approach to analgesia for cancer pain and revolutionising the use of oral opioids ( WHO 1986 ). It recommended that morphine be used first line for moderate to severe cancer pain. Observational studies have suggested that this approach results in pain control for 73% of patients ( Bennett 2008 ) with a mean reduction in pain intensity of 65% ( Ventafridda 1987 ).\n\n【16】Buprenorphine, oxycodone ( Schmidt‐Hansen 2013 ), fentanyl ( Hadley 2013 ), hydromorphone ( Quigley 2002 ), methadone ( Nicholson 2007 ) and morphine ( Wiffen 2013 ) are examples of some of the more commonly used opioids used for the relief of cancer pain worldwide. Step III opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all patients ( Pergolizzi 2008 ), nor are they well‐tolerated by all patients. However, the fact that buprenorphine does not accumulate in renal impairment and is not removed by haemodynamics makes it a practical analgesic in some situations where the use of other strong opioids may be more problematic.\n\n【17】The aim of this review is to assess whether buprenorphine is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other analgesic options for patients with cancer pain.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of buprenorphine for pain in adults and children with cancer.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with parallel‐group or cross‐over design, comparing buprenorphine (any formulation and any route of administration) with placebo or an active drug (including buprenorphine) for cancer background pain. We will not examine studies on breakthrough pain.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】Adults and children with cancer pain.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】*   Buprenorphine (any dose, formulation and route of administration) versus buprenorphine (any dose, formulation and route of administration)\n    \n*   Buprenorphine (any dose, formulation and route of administration) versus other active drug (any dose, formulation and route of administration)\n    \n*   Buprenorphine (any dose, formulation and route of administration) versus placebo\n    \n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】*   Pain intensity and pain relief\n    \n    *   Both outcomes have to be patient‐reported and can be reported in any transparent manner (e.g. by using numerical or verbal rating scales)\n        \n    *   We will not consider these outcomes reported by physicians, nurses or carers\n        \n    *   If possible, we will distinguish between nociceptive and neuropathic pain\n        \n\n【31】In line with Wiffen 2013 , we will also attempt to look for outcomes that are equivalent to 'no worse than mild pain' ( Moore 2013 ) operationalised as either one of the following:\n\n【32】1.  no or mild pain;\n    \n2.  ≤ 3/10 on a numerical rating scale;\n    \n3.  ≤ 30/100 mm on a visual analogue scale;\n    \n4.  positive ratings on patient measures of satisfaction (usually very satisfied), or treatment success, or global impression of change (very good, excellent).\n    \n\n【33】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【34】Side effects or adverse events (e.g. constipation, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, respiratory depression), quality of life, and patient preference.\n\n【35】We will consider all of these outcomes as they are reported in the included studies.\n\n【36】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【37】We will not apply language, date or publication status (published in full, published as abstract, unpublished) restrictions to the search.\n\n【38】#### Electronic searches\n\n【39】We will identify relevant trials by searching the following databases:\n\n【40】1.  The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, (CENTRAL, _the Cochrane Library_ );\n    \n2.  MEDLINE;\n    \n3.  EMBASE;\n    \n4.  CINAHL;\n    \n5.  Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science);\n    \n6.  Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (ISI Web of Science);\n    \n7.  BIOSIS (Web of Science);\n    \n8.  PubMed.\n    \n\n【41】The search strategy for MEDLINE is in Appendix 1 and we will apply the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials to this search ( Higgins 2011 ). We will modify the MEDLINE search strategy for use in other databases using the appropriate syntax and controlled vocabulary.\n\n【42】#### Searching other resources\n\n【43】We will check the bibliographic references of identified studies as well as relevant studies and systematic reviews in order to find additional trials not identified by the electronic searches. We will also search ClinicalTrials.gov ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ), _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT) ( http://www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct/ ), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ) and the Proceedings of the Congress of the European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as complementary sources for related studies. We will contact authors of the included studies to ask if they know of any other relevant studies.\n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】Two review authors (MSH, NB) will assess the titles and abstracts of all the studies identified by the search for potential inclusion. We will independently consider the full records of all potentially relevant studies for inclusion by applying the selection criteria outlined in the Criteria for considering studies for this review section. We will resolve potential disagreements by discussion. We will not restrict the inclusion criteria by date, language or publication status (published in full, published as abstract, unpublished).\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】Using a standardised data extraction form, two authors will extract data pertaining to study design, participant detail (including age, cancer characteristics, previous analgesic medication and setting), interventions (including details about titration), and outcomes. We will resolve potential disagreements by discussion. If there are studies for which only a subgroup of the participants meet the inclusion criteria for the current review, we will only extract data on this subgroup provided randomisation will not be broken.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】Two authors will independently assess the methodological quality of each of the included studies by using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011 ). For each study we will assess the risk of bias for the following domains:\n\n【51】*   selection bias (study level: random sequence generation, allocation concealment);\n    \n*   performance bias (outcome level: blinding of patients, blinding of treating personnel);\n    \n*   detection bias (outcome level: blinding of outcome assessment);\n    \n*   attrition bias (outcome level: incomplete outcome data);\n    \n*   reporting bias (study level: selective reporting).\n    \n\n【52】We will also include an item that assesses the adequacy of titration. Each of the items from the above domains requires a 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' response. We will also document the reasons for each response in accordance with Higgins 2011 . We will resolve potential disagreements through discussion. In addition to this strategy for risk of bias assessment in the individual studies, we will consider the impact that study size may have on the validity of the results.\n\n【53】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【54】For continuous outcomes we will extract the means and standard deviations (SDs) and we will use these to estimate the mean difference (MD) between the treatments along with the 95% confidence interval (CI), if the outcome is measured on the same scale in the studies. Where the outcome is measured on different scales, we will report the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs instead. For dichotomous outcomes we will extract event rates and calculate risk ratios (RRs) and number needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH).\n\n【55】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【56】The patient will be the unit of analysis, but if the data reported in any included cross‐over trials cannot be otherwise incorporated into the analyses (see Dealing with missing data ), we will include them as if the design had been parallel group. Higgins 2011 points out that this approach, while giving rise to unit‐of analysis error, is nevertheless conservative as it results in an under‐weighting of the data. If we include cross‐over trial data in this manner we will perform sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of this strategy.\n\n【57】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【58】In cases where data are missing, we will contact the authors to request the missing data. Missing data imputation will be limited to the imputation of missing standard deviations if enough information is available from the studies to calculate the standard deviation according to the methods outlined by Higgins 2011 . We will record the drop‐out/missing data rates in the 'Risk of bias' tables under the items on attrition bias, and we will address the potential effect of the missing data on the results in sensitivity analyses and in the Discussion section of the review. In all cases we will aim to perform intention‐to‐treat analyses.\n\n【59】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【60】We will assess heterogeneity by using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. We will consider I <sup>2 </sup> values above 50% to represent substantial heterogeneity in line with Higgins 2011 and we will assess potential sources of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses as outlined in Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity .\n\n【61】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【62】In addition to implementing the comprehensive search strategy outlined in the section Search methods for identification of studies , the risk of outcome reporting bias will be illustrated in the 'Risk of bias' summary figures that we will construct for each study and each type of assessed bias.\n\n【63】#### Data synthesis\n\n【64】We will enter the data extracted from the included studies into the Cochrane Collaboration's statistical software, Review Manager 2013 , which will be used for data synthesis. We will analyse continuous outcomes using the generic inverse variance method, and dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel‐Haenszel method in accordance with Higgins 2011 . If I <sup>2 </sup> is above 50% we will use a random‐effects model and consider not reporting a summary estimate of the data (depending on the subgroup analyses; see also the section Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity ). Otherwise we will use a fixed‐effect model for the meta‐analyses. If it is not feasible to meta‐analyse the data from the included studies, we will summarise the data narratively and in tables, if sensible. Regardless of the manner in which the data will be analysed, we will summarise the results for all the listed outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table in accordance with the guidance provided by the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group (see Table 1 ).\n\n【65】Open in table viewer\n\n【66】Table 1.

If there are sufficient data, we will therefore perform subgroup analyses based on doses, titration, routes of administration (e.g. sublingual, transdermal), length of the trials, and populations (e.g., opioid‐naive patients, solid/haematological cancer type, adults/children, co‐morbidities).\n\n【70】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【71】If sufficient data are available, we will examine the robustness of the meta‐analyses by conducting sensitivity analyses using different components of the 'Risk of bias' assessment, particularly those relating to whether allocation concealment and blinding were adequate. We will conduct further sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of missing data on the results if a large proportion of the studies are at an 'unknown' or 'high risk' of attrition bias, and finally, sensitivity analyses will examine whether publication status and trial size influence the results.\n\n【72】Table 1.

However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations, for several potential reasons. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services; for instance, because of poor quality health services, distance from a health facility, or lack of money. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services.\n\n【5】Our understanding of what influences parents’ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children, is still limited.\n\n【6】This synthesis links to Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of interventions to improve coverage or uptake of childhood vaccination.\n\n【7】### Objectives\n\n【8】‐ Explore parents’ and informal caregivers’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and the factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance of routine childhood vaccination.\n\n【9】‐ Develop a conceptual understanding of what and how different factors reduce parental acceptance of routine childhood vaccination.\n\n【10】‐ Explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness.\n\n【11】### Search methods\n\n【12】We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and three other databases for eligible studies from 1974 to June 2020.\n\n【13】### Selection criteria\n\n【14】We included studies that: utilised qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; focused on parents’ or caregivers’ views, practices, acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal of routine vaccination for children aged up to six years; and were from any setting globally where childhood vaccination is provided.\n\n【15】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【16】We used a pre‐specified sampling frame to sample from eligible studies, aiming to capture studies that were conceptually rich, relevant to the review's phenomenon of interest, from diverse geographical settings, and from a range of income‐level settings. We extracted contextual and methodological data from each sampled study. We used a meta‐ethnographic approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of criteria used in previous Cochrane Reviews and originally based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme quality assessment tool for qualitative studies. We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in each finding. We integrated the findings of this review with those from relevant Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness. We did this by mapping whether the underlying theories or components of trial interventions included in those reviews related to or targeted the overarching factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination identified by this review.\n\n【17】### Main results\n\n【18】We included 145 studies in the review and sampled 27 of these for our analysis. Six studies were conducted in Africa, seven in the Americas, four in South‐East Asia, nine in Europe, and one in the Western Pacific. Studies included urban and rural settings, and high‐, middle‐, and low‐income settings.\n\n【19】Many complex factors were found to influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, which we divided into four themes.\n\n【20】Firstly, parents’ vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. Secondly, many parents’ vaccination ideas and practices were influenced by the vaccination ideas and practices of the people they mix with socially. At the same time, shared vaccination ideas and practices helped some parents establish social relationships, which in turn strengthened their views and practices around vaccination. Thirdly, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by wider political issues and concerns, and particularly their trust (or distrust) in those associated with vaccination programmes. Finally, parents' vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination services and their frontline healthcare workers.\n\n【21】We developed two concepts for understanding possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination.\n\n【22】The first concept, ‘neoliberal logic’, suggests that many parents, particularly from high‐income countries, understood health and healthcare decisions as matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility. Some parents experienced this understanding as in conflict with vaccination programmes, which emphasise generalised risk and population health. This perceived conflict led some parents to be less accepting of vaccination for their children.\n\n【23】The second concept, ‘social exclusion’, suggests that some parents, particularly from low‐ and middle‐income countries, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may damage trustful relationships between government and the public, generate feelings of isolation and resentment, and give rise to demotivation in the face of public services that are poor quality and difficult to access. These factors in turn led some parents who were socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a way to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, costs, and distress it creates.\n\n【24】Many of the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents' vaccination views and practices were underrepresented in the interventions tested in the four related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness.\n\n【25】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【26】Our review has revealed that parents’ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination are complex and dynamic social processes that reflect multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. We have provided a theorised understanding of the social processes contributing to vaccination acceptance (or not), thereby complementing but also extending more individualistic models of vaccination acceptance. Successful development of interventions to promote acceptance and uptake of childhood vaccination will require an understanding of, and then tailoring to, the specific factors influencing vaccination views and practices of the group(s) in the target setting. The themes and concepts developed through our review could serve as a basis for gaining this understanding, and subsequent development of interventions that are potentially more aligned with the norms, expectations, and concerns of target users.\n\n【27】Plain language summary\n----------------------\n\n【28】available in\n\n【29】*   English\n*   Deutsch\n*   Español\n*   فارسی\n*   Français\n*   日本語\n*   Bahasa Malaysia\n*   Polski\n*   Русский\n*   ภาษาไทย\n*   简体中文\n*   繁體中文\n\n【30】### What factors influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines?\n\n【31】**Review aim**\n\n【32】This Cochrane synthesis of qualitative evidence aimed to explore the factors that influence parents’ views and practices around routine childhood vaccines. To do this, we searched for and analysed qualitative studies of parents’ views, experiences, and practices.\n\n【33】This synthesis complements other Cochrane Reviews assessing the effect of strategies to improve the uptake of childhood vaccination.\n\n【34】**Key messages**\n\n【35】Many factors influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, including those related to individual perceptions, social relationships, and the wider context in which parents live. When parents make decisions about vaccination for their children, they are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify.\n\n【36】**What was studied in this synthesis?**\n\n【37】Childhood vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illnesses and deaths in children. However, worldwide, many children do not receive all recommended vaccinations. There are several potential reasons for this. Vaccines might be unavailable, or parents may experience difficulties in accessing vaccination services. Some parents may not accept available vaccines and vaccination services.\n\n【38】Our understanding of what influences parents’ views and practices around childhood vaccination, and why some parents may not accept vaccines for their children is still limited. Qualitative research explores how people perceive and experience the world around them, and is therefore well‐placed for examining these issues.\n\n【39】**What are the main findings of the review?**\n\n【40】We included 27 studies in our analysis. Studies were conducted in Africa, the Americas, South‐East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific, and included urban and rural settings, as well as high‐, middle‐, and low‐income settings.\n\n【41】Many complex factors were found to influence parents’ vaccination views and practices, which we divided into four themes.\n\n【42】Firstly, parents’ vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. Secondly, many parents’ vaccination ideas and practices were influenced by the vaccination ideas and practices of the people they mix with socially. At the same time, shared vaccination ideas and practices helped some parents establish social relationships, which in turned strengthened their views and practices around vaccination. Thirdly, parent’s vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by wider political issues and concerns, and particularly their trust (or distrust) in those associated with vaccination programmes. Finally, parent’s vaccination ideas and practices may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination services and their frontline healthcare workers.\n\n【43】We developed two concepts for understanding possible pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination.\n\n【44】The first concept, ‘neoliberal logic’, suggests that many parents, particularly from high‐income countries, understood health and healthcare decisions as matters of individual risk, choice, and responsibility. Some parents experienced this understanding as in conflict with vaccination programmes, which emphasise generalised risk and population health. This perceived conflict led some parents to be less accepting of vaccination for their children.\n\n【45】The second concept, ‘social exclusion’, suggests that some parents, particularly from low‐ and middle‐income countries, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may damage trustful relationships between government and the public, generate feelings of isolation and resentment, and give rise to demotivation in the face of public services that are poor quality and difficult to access. These factors in turn led some parents who were socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a way to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, costs, and distress it creates.\n\n【46】**How up‐to‐date is this review?**\n\n【47】We searched for studies published before 3 June 2020.\n\n【48】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【49】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【50】### Implications for practice\n\n【51】Below are a set of questions and prompts that may help policy‐ and decision‐makers when planning and implementing strategies to promote childhood vaccination acceptance or uptake. The questions and prompts are based on the findings of this review (see Appendix 3 ). They also align with implications identified in a linked review on perceptions and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination ( Ames 2017b ).\n\n【52】When applying these questions and prompts, please consider the following points.\n\n【53】The studies in our review took place in settings or amongst populations that may differ from your own. Not all factors will therefore necessarily be applicable. Similarly, our review suggests that parents may accept some vaccines for some diseases, but not others. Successful development and implementation of interventions will require an understanding of, and then a tailoring to, the target setting and the target vaccine and disease.\n\n【54】There are a wide range of interventions relevant to increasing childhood vaccination uptake. The questions and prompts below are not geared towards any specific strategy; they can be used to inform all strategies or help inform decisions regarding which types of strategies might be most important.\n\n【55】Finally, the questions and prompts were informed by our position that adherence to the currently recommended vaccines is an important public health measure. Our perspective also recognises the importance of supporting an individual’s right to make their own decision about vaccination, including having access to evidence‐based information about vaccination, such as side effects, evidence gaps, and uncertainties. This perspective may not be shared in all settings. It is therefore important to consider what the vaccination values, aims, and policies are in your setting, and how these may potentially diverge from the perspective provided here.\n\n【56】In sum, these questions and prompts should be regarded as guidance to help stakeholders think about how best to design and deliver strategies to promote vaccination acceptance or uptake that are tailored to the specific needs, priorities, and values of their own context.\n\n【57】**1\\. Have you considered the broader beliefs and practices that parents in your target setting have about health and illness, and the role they perceive vaccination to play within these?**\n\n【58】*   For instance, might parents hold various religious beliefs, or naturalistic views about health and illness, that may reduce acceptance of vaccination? Or might parents hold certain beliefs about infants and their immune systems that might increase or decrease acceptance of vaccination? Might parents have an individualistic view of health and the risks and benefits of vaccines? Might they perceive personal responsibility and choice regarding health and healthcare decision‐making as more important than collective responsibility? Might parents experience these views as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, and therefore be less accepting of vaccination? What other health beliefs might parents have, and what specific meanings, fears, or reservations about vaccination do these give rise to?\n    \n*   Have you considered how the intervention(s) could be tailored to the specific health beliefs and practices of parents in your target setting ‐ for instance, by providing vaccination communication that acknowledges these beliefs and practices, and attempts to address the concerns, questions, and tensions they may give rise to?\n    \n\n【59】**2\\. Have you taken into account the social networks and groups in which parents in your target setting reside or with which they are affiliated?**\n\n【60】*   What are the different groups (for example, social, cultural, religious, and geographical) that parents in your target setting belong to or inhabit? What are the common vaccination views and practices within these groups? For instance, is vaccination generally supported, or alternatively might non‐vaccination be a social norm, within these groups?\n    \n*   Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could incorporate the social groups in which parents in your target setting belong, such as involving influential individuals within these groups (e.g. key opinion leaders) in the design, planning, and/or delivery of the intervention(s)?\n    \n\n【61】**3\\. Have you considered how parents in your target setting perceive the authorities associated with vaccination programmes?**\n\n【62】*   Might parents feel distrustful towards any of the authorities associated with vaccination programmes ‐ for instance, government, healthcare workers, medical researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, global health agencies, or other relevant stakeholders?\n    \n*   If so, have you considered the specific reasons for this distrust? For instance, might they perceive them to be driven by motives other than the best interests of their child, such as financial gain? Might parents be aware of or have experienced ‘scandals’ in the past related to vaccination or other health‐related issues that have made them distrustful of authorities? Might parents be distrustful of authorities because their other concerns and priorities (e.g. food, sanitation, housing, income, employment, and general healthcare) are not being met, and might nonacceptance of vaccination be a form of resistance or a mechanism to have their other concerns and priorities addressed?\n    \n*   Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could be tailored to address the specific reasons for parents’ distrust, such as dialogue‐based approaches inviting open discussion about the reasons for distrust and how services could be reorganised in ways that might increase trust? Or could the interventions developed incorporate broader development goals by providing a wider range of basic services or goods along with vaccination? Alternatively, have you considered collaborating with groups or individuals that are known to be a trusted source amongst parents (e.g. non‐governmental organisations, local opinion leaders, etc.), potentially involving them in the design, planning, and/or delivery of the intervention(s)?\n    \n\n【63】**4\\. Have you considered the social or economic challenges parents in your target setting may face in accessing vaccination services?**\n\n【64】*   For instance, do parents need to travel long distances to get to vaccination services? Might parents have demanding daily schedules that make it difficult to take time out for vaccination? What other struggles may parents face in negotiating vaccination services for their children?\n    \n*   Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could target the specific barriers parents face in accessing vaccination ‐ for instance, through the provision of vaccination outreach or mobile vaccination teams that bring vaccination closer to where parents live?\n    \n\n【65】**5\\. Have you considered whether there are features of vaccination services in your target setting that parents might find undesirable or inconvenient?**\n\n【66】*   For instance, might vaccination involve (formal or informal) costs for parents? Or might parents experience long waiting times for vaccination? Or are regular vaccine stock‐outs an issue in your healthcare facility? Or might there be procedures that parents need to follow in order to obtain vaccination (e.g. those pertaining to the vaccination booklet) that they might find constraining or complicated to follow?\n    \n*   Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could be tailored to address the specific features of vaccination services that might diminish parents’ acceptance of vaccination or trust in vaccination programmes, or both, in your target setting? For instance, if vaccine stock‐outs are a regular feature of your health facility, can you identify what the underlying reasons for stock‐outs are and how these problems could be addressed? Could the logistical procedures parents need to follow for vaccination be potentially redesigned, so they are more responsive to parents' needs and circumstances? Could the physical environment at your health facility be reorganised to facilitate more efficient vaccination delivery? Could aspects of vaccination programmes (e.g. healthcare worker incentives for vaccination) that foster parents' distrust be rethought and potentially restructured?\n    \n\n【67】**6\\. Have you considered the ‘social’ nature of vaccination services, and how this might be experienced by parents?**\n\n【68】*   For instance, might some parents experience attendance of vaccination services as a positive social event, one whereby they receive affirmation about themselves and their children? Alternatively, might some parents (e.g. poorer women, immigrants, fathers) feel judged or alienated by others when attending vaccination services?\n    \n*   Have you considered whether the intervention(s) could draw upon and promote the positive social aspects of vaccination services? At the same time, could the delivery of vaccination be rethought and potentially restructured so that less integrated parents might feel less judged or alienated when attending vaccination services?\n    \n\n【69】**7\\. Have you considered how parents in your target setting feel about the interactions they have with healthcare workers?**\n\n【70】*   For instance, do they feel supported or mistreated by healthcare workers? Do they feel they can have open, respectful discussions with healthcare workers in a caring, sensitive, and non‐judgemental way? Do they feel they can ask healthcare workers questions and receive clear and respectful answers? Do parents perceive the vaccination information they receive from healthcare workers as impartial, balanced, independent, and transparent?\n    \n*   Have you considered intervention(s) that specifically target healthcare workers ‐ for instance, by making them aware of the influence their interactions with parents may have, providing them with training in communication skills or increased supervision and support, or adapting the types of vaccination information healthcare workers have access to and provide to parents? (See Ames 2017b for further guidance on tailoring vaccination information for parents.)\n    \n\n【71】### Implications for future research\n\n【72】We have developed these implications for research based on the overview of studies included in this review and our GRADE‐CERQual assessments of the review findings.\n\n【73】There is a need for better reporting of methods in qualitative studies, including those from more sociological and anthropological health research traditions. In particular, future qualitative studies should provide more detailed and transparent reporting of sampling methods and data analysis. These studies should also pay more attention to, and provide evidence for, the researchers’ roles in the study and their prior assumptions and standpoints, and how these may have impacted on the process and findings of the study (i.e. researcher reflexivity).\n\n【74】Qualitative research about parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination needs to include a broader spectrum of contexts and population groups. In particular, more studies are needed in the regions of South America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Moreover, more studies with parents from higher socioeconomic groups in LMICs and amongst minority or more marginalised groups in HICs would be beneficial. For example, the findings from a study included in this review amongst parents from higher socioeconomic groups in Brazil revealed that these parents may hold neoliberal values and views similar to those held by parents in HICs. It would be useful for studies in other LMICs to explore this issue further. Similarly, the findings from one study included in this review amongst Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in Britain revealed that socioeconomic challenges in accessing vaccination services may reduce these parents' acceptance of vaccination in a similar way to many parents in LMICs. It would be useful for studies to determine the relevance of this issue amongst parents from other marginalised or minority groups in HICs.\n\n【75】Future studies should also consider the perceptions of fathers, to help give us a better understanding of their viewpoints and how gender identities, roles, and relations might influence ideas and practices regarding childhood vaccination. This understanding would facilitate further development of conceptual and theoretical models in this area. Finally, more qualitative research is needed on the drivers of childhood vaccination acceptance and active demand (as opposed to hesitancy and refusal), which could provide important insights into how vaccination acceptance uptake might be sustained over time.\n\n【76】Future quantitative studies on vaccination acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance that examine levels of influence beyond individual factors (i.e. to also incorporate community or contextual factors) would be worthwhile. Future trials should consider incorporating interventions that target a broader array of factors influencing parents' vaccination views and practices, with consideration of the factors identified in this review. Specifically, there is a need for more interventions which target parents’ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents, and the context‐specific factors potentially contributing to parents' distrust in vaccination.\n\n【77】In future updates of this review, we will consider how studies from non‐anglophone countries might be better represented; for example, by broadening the scope of regional databases searched, employing an alternative (potentially more aggregative) qualitative synthesis approach, or adding review authors who speak additional languages so that studies published in a wider range of languages can potentially be included. Moreover, for findings which were downgraded in the GRADE‐CERQual assessments, in future updates of this review, we will consider whether any studies that were included but not sampled could contribute data to enhance confidence.\n\n【78】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【79】Open in table viewer\n\n【80】Summary of findings 1. Summary of qualitative findings (SoQF) table\n\n| **Summary of review findings**  | **Studies contributing to the review finding**  | **GRADE‐CERQual assessment of confidence in the evidence**  | **Explanation of GRADE‐CERQual assessment**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  |\n| **Finding 1: religious beliefs.** Some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the religious beliefs they held, and the view that illness, including in children, can only be prevented by divine providence. These parents expressed religious objections to vaccination.  | Renne 2010 ; Reich 2016  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about adequacy, moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 2: the ‘fragile’ infant.** An understanding of infants and their immune systems as fragile and still in a state of development was common amongst parents across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups. Numerous parents characterised infants and young children as weak and vulnerable, and in need of protection against multiple social, biological, or spiritual threats. This perception was associated with both reduced and increased acceptance of childhood vaccination.  | Bisht 2000 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Limaye 2020  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 3: primacy of ‘nature’ and ‘the natural’.** Some parents, predominantly from HICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their understanding of health and illness as holistic or naturalistic. This understanding conceives many biomedical interventions, including vaccination, as unnatural intrusions that are unnecessary or harmful. Various parents who held this view also engaged in certain ‘natural’ health‐promoting activities or “salutogenic parenting”, which for them further negated the need for vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 4: individualised health, immunity, and vaccine‐response trajectories.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a view that children possess unique bodies and immune systems, and therefore individual vaccine needs and vulnerabilities. As such, these parents frequently assessed the risks and benefits of vaccines as they pertain to their specific child, rather than in general. If the risks were seen to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these parents tended to be less accepting of childhood vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Smith 2017  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 5: claiming parental expertise.** Many parents from HICs held a view of themselves as experts of their child, possessing the best understanding of their child’s health strengths and vulnerabilities. They in turn considered themselves best placed to judge their child’s vaccination needs and risks.  | Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data), and minor concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 6: personal choice and responsibility.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, perceived healthcare decision‐making, including vaccination, to be a matter of personal responsibility and choice. In cases where the risks of a vaccine or vaccination in general were thought to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these values of personal responsibility and choice were often prioritised over collective responsibility. These parents in turn tended to be less accepting of vaccination for their children.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  |\n| **Finding 7: social networks shape vaccination ideas and practices.** Parents' vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups, were influenced by the vaccination views and experiences of their social networks. These networks included relatives, peers, neighbours, and additional significant others in the community. However, the views and practices of other parents, and particularly other mothers, were especially influential.  | Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Ruijs 2012 ; Brunson 2013 ; Varghese 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 8: vaccination ideas and practices shape social networks.** Parents' vaccination views and practices also shaped their social networks. Shared vaccination ideas and practices were a powerful force in building social relations and ties. While this phenomenon occurred amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes, it may be particularly significant for parents who are less accepting of vaccination. In these cases, parents may be afforded access to various types of social resources, in turn potentially reinforcing both their group affiliation and vaccination views and practices.  | Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Ward 2017 ; Reich 2016  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about adequacy and about coherence (ambiguous data), and minor concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  |\n| **Finding 9: distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination.** Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to a lack of, or breakdown in, trust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination ‐ most particularly government, the pharmaceutical industry, and science. The reasons for this distrust were complex and contextually situated, embedded in political events, relations, and processes within specific times and places.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Varghese 2013 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded due to moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 10: generalised decline in trust of authority and expert systems.** For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination may be part and parcel of a more generalised contemporary trend of decreasing trust in authorities and expert systems.  | Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance), moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data) and adequacy, and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 11: agendas and interests underpinning the expert systems implicated with vaccination.** For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their concerns about the agendas or interests embedded in these systems. Many of these parents were particularly concerned about the economic interests of these systems, and especially the economic interests of the pharmaceutical industry, which they perceived to be negatively influencing vaccination programmes.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Varghese 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 12: current and past controversies.** Some parents' distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to particular ‘scandals’ or ‘controversies’ related to vaccination specifically or health‐related issues more broadly. The occurrence of such scandals, and the manner in which they were perceived to have been handled, caused some parents to feel misled by authorities and to question their legitimacy in protecting the public’s health.  | Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and coherence (contradictory and ambiguous data), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment.** Some parents' distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their experiences of marginalisation, inadequate public services, or misalignment between their own priorities and those of the state. These experiences undermined trustful and benevolent state‐citizen relations, leading many parents to distrust government and government‐sponsored programs, including vaccination.  | Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ; Smith 2017  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about coherence (contradictory data) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  |\n| **Finding 14: socio‐economic challenges in accessing vaccination services.** Parents living in resource‐limited settings frequently face numerous socioeconomic challenges to accessing vaccination services, including practical questions of geography and transport, childcare constraints, and family economics and household work pressures. As a result of these challenges, some of these parents were less accepting of vaccination due to the time, effort, and opportunity costs that accessing vaccination involved.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 15: undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics.** Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics. These features, common to vaccination services within resource‐limited settings, included resource constraints that affect vaccine supply and costs and health facility waiting times, and constraining organisational procedures.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 16: vaccination as a social event.** Vaccination may be a social event where people gather and interact with each other. Some parents found this to a positive experience, whereby they received affirmation about themselves and their children. This potentially motivated attendance at childhood vaccination services. For other parents, the social nature of vaccination services was a negative experience, whereby they felt judged by, disapproved of by, or alienated from others. This potentially demotivated attendance of childhood vaccination services.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and adequacy, and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 17: interactions with frontline healthcare workers.** Parents' vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts and population groups, were mediated by the face‐to‐face interactions or personal relations they had with frontline healthcare workers. Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to mistreatment from healthcare workers, and when they felt the vaccination information provided to them was simplistic and unbalanced. In contrast, some parents were more accepting of vaccination due to positively‐received engagements with healthcare workers, whereby they felt supported, listened to and respected, and whereby healthcare workers shared balanced information and personal stories about themselves as parents.  | Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  |\n| **Finding 18: neoliberal logic.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a worldview informed by neoliberal discourses. These discourses understand health as individualised, and health‐related risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a ‘good’ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing one’s own, individual health‐related risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that ‘doctor knows best’, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parents’ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about coherence (ambiguous data), and minor concerns about methdological limitations  |\n| **Finding 19: social exclusion.** Some parents, predominantly from LMICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful government‐citizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors in turn led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs and distress it creates.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Dugas 2009 Renne 2010 ; McKnight 2014 Hussain 2015 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about both relevance (partial relevance) and coherence (ambiguous data)  |\n\n【82】Background\n----------\n\n【83】Vaccination is considered one of the most effective public health interventions for reducing infant and child morbidity and mortality globally ( CDC 1999 ; WHO 2018a ). Vaccination programmes have led to the global eradication of smallpox, and large reductions in disability and death from polio, measles, tetanus, rubella, and diphtheria ( CDC 1999 ; Andre 2008 ). To be successful, vaccination programmes depend on high levels of vaccination uptake. Not only does this provide direct protection for vaccinated individuals, it also induces indirect protection for the overall community ('herd immunity') by slowing transmission of disease ( Fine 2011 ). This in turn decreases the risk of infection amongst those who remain susceptible in the community, and helps prevent disease outbreaks.\n\n【84】In 2016, over 19 million children did not receive the full series of basic vaccinations globally, which resulted in numerous vaccine‐preventable disease outbreaks and child deaths ( Feldstein 2017 ). While low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) bear the largest proportion of under‐vaccinated or non‐vaccinated children ( Feldstein 2017 ), high‐income countries (HICs) are also affected by suboptimal vaccination. National coverage rates in LMICs and many HICs remain below aspirational targets, and have shown only modest progress toward meeting those targets, despite concerted efforts to improve vaccination uptake ( Corben 2016 ; de Figueiredo 2016 ). National vaccination estimates also mask subnational and subgroup variations, and the low vaccination coverage rates in certain populations ( Omer 2009 ; Scheifele 2014 ; Hill 2015 ; Hull 2017 ).\n\n【85】The reasons for suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage are commonly categorised into ‘supply‐side’ and ‘demand‐side’ issues ( Lewin 2011 ), although the distinction between these terms is not well‐defined in the immunisation literature ( Hickler 2017 ). ‘Supply‐side’ factors tend to relate to the provision of vaccines and vaccination services, including, for example, availability and accessibility of effective vaccines, adequate health systems to support their delivery, and health personnel to administer the vaccines ( Lewin 2011 ; WHO 2013a ; WHO 2018a ). Several studies, in both HICs and LMICs, have found 'supply‐side' factors to be significant reasons for children not being up‐to‐date with their vaccinations ( Rainey 2011 ; Machingaidze 2013a ; Pearce 2015 ; Nadeau 2016 ). Studies have also found that interventions that target 'supply‐side' barriers – such as integrating vaccination with other services ( Oyo‐Ita 2016 ), or reducing missed opportunities for vaccination ( Jaca 2018 ) – are effective in improving childhood vaccination coverage.\n\n【86】'Demand‐side' factors generally relate to the recipients of vaccines and vaccination services, including factors such as service‐users' knowledge, understanding, attitudes, beliefs, intentions, decision‐making and behaviours ( Lewin 2011 ; Hickler 2017 ). In research and policy, more attention has traditionally been placed on 'supply‐side' issues, to the neglect of more 'demand‐related' issues ( Hickler 2015 ; Suk 2015 ). However, this is changing, with an increased global focus on the demand side of vaccination in recent years (see below: 'Why is it important to do this synthesis?'). Various studies and some reviews have revealed that a growing number of parents are questioning vaccines, seeking alternative vaccination schedules, and deciding to delay or refuse vaccination for their children, both in high‐ and low‐income settings ( Larson 2014 ; Dube 2015 ; Corben 2016 ). Yet we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what, and how, different factors influence parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and why some parents may be less accepting of vaccination for their children ( Corben 2016 ; WHO 2018a ). Qualitative research can contribute to this understanding and help inform policy and practice, including the development of more relevant, acceptable, and effective interventions to promote public acceptance and uptake of childhood vaccination.\n\n【87】### Description of the topic\n\n【88】There is debate in the literature regarding how we should name the fact that some people decide not to vaccinate. Various concepts and definitions have been used, sometimes interchangeably, including: nonacceptance, refusal, hesitancy, confidence, trust, demand, uptake. However, there is agreement in the literature that traditional understandings of individuals and groups as either ‘anti‐’ or ‘pro‐’ vaccines are inadequate. Rather, vaccination views and practices are thought to exist along a continuum, from nonacceptance of all vaccines to active support of all immunisation recommendations ( Feemster 2013 ; Larson 2014 ; NVAC 2015 ). Vaccine hesitancy is seen to fall in the middle of this continuum. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines vaccine‐hesitant individuals as: \"a heterogeneous group who hold varying degrees of indecision about specific vaccines or vaccination in general. Vaccine hesitant individuals may accept all vaccines but remain concerned about vaccines, some may refuse or delay some vaccines, but accept others; some individuals may refuse all vaccines\" ( WHO 2014 ).\n\n【89】There is also agreement in the literature that vaccination views and practices are complex, and influenced by multiple factors that may vary by time, place, and vaccines ( Dube 2013 ; Larson 2014 ; MacDonald 2015 ; Corben 2016 ). Several contrasting theoretical frameworks have been proposed in an attempt to understand these influencing factors. The WHO developed the 'Three C' framework, including axes of confidence (trust in effectiveness and safety of vaccines and the systems that deliver them), complacency (low perceived risk of vaccine‐preventable diseases), and convenience (affordability and access) ( WHO 2013b ; MacDonald 2015 ). Betsch and colleagues added two additional items to this framework (calculating and collective responsibility), to encompass cost‐benefit reasoning and concerns for the protection of others ( Betsch 2015 ; Betsch 2018 ). The ‘C frameworks’ seek to identify the psychological determinants of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal, drawing on psychological models of decision‐making behaviour, such as the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). In contrast, Peretti‐Watel and colleagues have reformulated the ‘C frameworks’ to incorporate the major structural features of contemporary societies ( Peretti‐Watel 2015 ). Their model conceptualises vaccine hesitancy as a two‐dimensional decision‐making process, that depends on people’s level of commitment to modern society’s risk culture, or “healthism”, and their trust in the authority of healthcare providers and mainstream medicine.\n\n【90】Alternative approaches have drawn on adaptations of ecological models of health behaviour to identify the multiple and interrelated levels of influence impacting on vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance ( Sturm 2005 ; Callreus 2010 ; WHO 2013b ; Larson 2014 ). For example, the WHO has developed a 'Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix', which categorises factors under three domains: contextual influences, including sociocultural and health systems factors; individual and group influences, including those arising from personal perceptions of a vaccine; and vaccine‐ or vaccination‐specific issues, including individual assessments of risks and benefits and the effects of the mode of administration ( WHO 2013b ; MacDonald 2015 ).\n\n【91】There is, therefore, no agreed framework for understanding the factors influencing vaccination views and practices. In addition, while current models have provided important insights into what factors potentially influence vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance, few provide a comprehensive and theoretical understanding of how these factors operate and interact ( Cooper 2019 ). In addition, few existing models are based on empirical qualitative evidence. For example, the WHO’s 'Three C' framework was developed by reviewing existing conceptual models for grouping vaccine hesitancy determinants, and by taking into consideration model complexity, understandability, global applicability, breadth of factors considered, and potential usefulness in informing the development of vaccine hesitancy indicators and survey questions ( MacDonald 2015 ). Similarly, the WHO’s 'Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix' was derived from determinants identified in a commissioned systematic (quantitative) review of determinants, the collective experience and insights of members of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) working group on vaccine hesitancy, and consultation with experts working in the field ( Larson 2014 ; MacDonald 2015 ). The commissioned systematic review of determinants concluded that \"\\[f\\]uture consideration of qualitative studies in all regions would help…enhance understanding around decision‐making processes and the ways in which explanatory factors come together to influence vaccination behavior\" ( Larson 2014 ).\n\n【92】The research question we aimed to address in this review is: what factors influence parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and how do those factors exert influence? In addition to identifying what factors might be most relevant, we also sought to build theory about how different factors come together to reduce acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. This might contribute to the development or refinement of conceptual models of vaccination acceptance, built on a broader evidence‐base and more theoretical in nature.\n\n【93】In this review, we focus on factors that may ‘enhance’ or ‘reduce’ acceptance of vaccination as a way of capturing the continuous, as opposed to categorical nature, of vaccination views and practices. If a study reported factors associated with a specific vaccination stance (e.g. delayed vaccination, nonacceptance, hesitancy, etc.), this was captured by the review findings. We also focused specifically on studies that reported on the views of parents and informal caregivers, and not those of other relevant stakeholders. This is because our intention was to understand the influencing factors considered important by, and meaningful to, vaccine target users themselves. If they reported that others had an influence on their vaccination views and practices, this was captured by the review findings.\n\n【94】### Why is it important to do this synthesis?\n\n【95】Currently, there is a large global focus on the demand side of vaccination. Various international working groups have been established to investigate this topic: a working group on vaccine hesitancy within the WHO's SAGE was formed in 2012 ( Schuster 2015 ); a working group on vaccine confidence was established in the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in the USA in 2013 ( NVAC 2015 ); and an informal working group on vaccine demand was initiated in 2015, under the leadership of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and in collaboration with the WHO ( Hickler 2017 ). In addition, in 2018, the WHO's SAGE indicated that \"\\[d\\]emand‐related issues like vaccine hesitancy are complex, and subject to multiple influences. The need is pressing to better understand the drivers of and barriers to vaccination uptake and to build national capacities to develop and implement tailored strategies to promote demand for immunisation services\" ( WHO 2018a ). A year later, in 2019, the WHO also identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the ten main threats to global health in 2019 ( WHO 2019 ). This increased focus on the demand side of vaccination is the consequence of several factors, including settings with low or stagnated rates of vaccination ( de Figueiredo 2016 ; Hull 2017 ); recent global outbreaks of largely eliminated vaccine‐preventable diseases, such as measles, which have been linked to under‐vaccination ( Dabbagh 2018 ; Larson 2018a ); concerns about the rise of vaccine hesitancy ( Hickler 2015 ; Lane 2018 ); more vaccines becoming available; and more diseases becoming the focus of eradication campaigns ( WHO 2013a ). The COVID‐19 pandemic, and current global roll‐out of COVID‐19 vaccination programmes, has further heightened international concerns about, and focus on, vaccine hesitancy and refusal ( NASEM 2021 ; WHO 2021 ).\n\n【96】To support decision‐making within vaccination programmes regarding effective strategies to increase and sustain public uptake of childhood vaccination, it is important to understand which factors enhance and reduce acceptance of vaccination. In particular, understanding parents' and informal caregivers' reasons for their vaccination views and practices could help inform the development of interventions to promote acceptance and uptake of vaccines that are better aligned with the norms, views, expectations, and potential concerns of target users, thereby potentially enhancing their acceptability and effectiveness. As stressed by Larson and colleagues, \"emphasis should be placed on listening to the concerns and understanding the perceptions of the public to inform risk communication and to incorporate public perspectives in planning vaccine policies and programmes\" ( Larson 2011 ).\n\n【97】Qualitative research is well‐placed for exploring complex perceptions, practices, and decision‐making, and for understanding how different factors influence these. Data arising from qualitative studies can help answer questions regarding what people think about vaccines, their practices around vaccination, their vaccination decision‐making processes, and the reasons for these views, practices, and decisions. A better understanding of these issues, and their impact in different settings, can help identify what factors influence parental vaccination decision‐making, and how they do so. This, in turn, can help us think through which interventions may be most appropriate for enhancing vaccination acceptance and uptake, and why.\n\n【98】Various reviews have focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination (see Table 1 for a summary of these reviews). Many of these reviews are dated, limited in geographical scope (i.e. include studies only from HICs), focused on specific vaccines or broader populations than children, and are not ‘systematic’ in their approach. In addition, few existing reviews include qualitative studies, and amongst those that do, in most cases, the results were synthesised quantitatively or in a narrative summary. Carrying out an up‐to‐date qualitative review that systematically explores the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, from the perspective of parents and informal caregivers and across a variety of regions and vaccines, will provide a single point of access for synthesised qualitative evidence on childhood vaccination acceptance to inform immunisation policy and strategies.\n\n【99】Open in table viewer\n\n【100】Table 1.

As the review authors explain, communication is one of many interacting factors that may influence parents' and informal caregivers' decisions to take their children for vaccination, and communication alone will therefore not address all aspects of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal. Therefore, our review builds upon the Ames 2017b review by identifying the range of factors (in addition to vaccination communication and information) that may influence parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and by explaining how these factors potentially operate to impact on vaccination acceptance.\n\n【105】This qualitative evidence synthesis also supplements existing Cochrane Reviews of the effectiveness of different interventions for improving childhood vaccination coverage and uptake ( Saeterdal 2014 ; Oyo‐Ita 2016 ; Jacobson‐Vann 2018 ; Kaufman 2018 ). It may provide partial explanations for the heterogeneity of results across these Cochrane Reviews, as well as contribute to the development of more relevant, acceptable, and effective interventions in the future.\n\n【106】The results from this synthesis may improve our understanding of the reasons for enhanced or reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination from the perspective of parents and informal caregivers. These results can be used to generate hypotheses about why and how certain interventions to improve vaccine uptake might be more effective than others, for whom, and in which contexts, for subsequent subgroup analyses in future reviews of intervention effectiveness.\n\n【107】Finally, this review provides insights from qualitative review data, which could be used in the development or refinement of conceptual models explaining the demand side of vaccination, so that these models are informed by a larger evidence base and are potentially more theoretically grounded.\n\n【108】Objectives\n----------\n\n【109】*   Explore parents’ and informal caregivers’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, and the factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance of routine childhood vaccination.\n    \n*   Develop a conceptual understanding of what and how different factors reduce parental acceptance of routine childhood vaccination.\n    \n*   Explore how the findings of this review can enhance our understanding of the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness ( Saeterdal 2014 ; Oyo‐Ita 2016 ; Jacobson‐Vann 2018 ; Kaufman 2018 ).\n    \n\n【110】Methods\n-------\n\n【111】### Criteria for considering studies for this synthesis\n\n【112】#### Types of studies\n\n【113】We included primary studies that used qualitative study designs such as ethnography, phenomenology, case studies, grounded theory studies, and qualitative process evaluations. We included studies that used both qualitative methods for data collection (e.g. focus group discussions, individual interviews, observation, diaries, document analysis, and open‐ended survey questions), and qualitative methods for data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis, framework analysis, grounded theory). We excluded studies that collected data using qualitative methods but did not analyse the data using qualitative analysis methods (e.g. open‐ended survey questions where the response data were analysed using descriptive statistics only). We included mixed methods studies where it was possible to extract the data that were collected and analysed using qualitative methods. We included studies regardless of whether or not they were linked to an intervention. We did not exclude any studies based on our assessment of methodological limitations, but utilised this information to assess our confidence in the synthesised findings.\n\n【114】#### Topic of interest\n\n【115】The topic of interest of this synthesis was the range of factors which influence parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination from the perspective of parents and informal caregivers _._\n\n【116】#### Types of participants\n\n【117】We included studies that reported on views, practices, or factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance regarding routine childhood vaccination, as given by parents or informal caregivers. By ‘informal caregiver’, we mean anyone who is directly involved in caring for the child or making the decision to vaccinate the child, or who has the responsibility to take the child for vaccination ( Ames 2017b ). We also included studies if they reported on the views, practices, or factors influencing acceptance, hesitancy or nonacceptance regarding routine childhood vaccination as given by prospective parents (e.g. pregnant women, their partners, or both). We excluded studies if they only reported what healthcare providers, policymakers, programme administrators and managers, or other immunisation stakeholders said about the vaccination views, practices, acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance of parents and informal caregivers or the factors influencing these.\n\n【118】#### Types of interventions\n\n【119】We included studies about parents’ or informal caregivers’ vaccination views, practices, acceptance, hesitancy, or nonacceptance regarding routine childhood vaccination, irrespective of the vaccination setting or mode of delivery. Vaccination settings and modes of delivery included, for example, vaccination provided at healthcare facilities or fixed outreach sites, or by mobile health teams in communities ( Machingaidze 2013b ).\n\n【120】By ‘routine’ childhood vaccination, we mean WHO‐recommended routine vaccines for children under six years of age as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). This included the following vaccines or combinations of vaccines ( WHO 2018b ).\n\n【121】*   Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG).\n    \n*   Hepatitis B.\n    \n*   Polio:\n    \n    *   Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV);\n        \n    *   Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).\n        \n*   Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP)\n    \n*   _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib).\n    \n*   Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV).\n    \n*   Rotavirus.\n    \n*   Measles.\n    \n*   Mumps.\n    \n*   Rubella.\n    \n*   Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).\n    \n*   Japanese encephalitis.\n    \n*   Yellow fever.\n    \n*   Tick‐borne encephalitis.\n    \n*   Typhoid.\n    \n*   Cholera.\n    \n*   Meningococcal.\n    \n*   Hepatitis A.\n    \n*   Seasonal influenza.\n    \n\n【122】We excluded the following vaccines because children under six years of age do not routinely receive them as part of the EPI.\n\n【123】*   Human papillomavirus (HPV).\n    \n*   Rabies.\n    \n*   Haemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 (H1N1), and other epidemic vaccinations.\n    \n\n【124】We excluded studies on hypothetical vaccines, future vaccines, or vaccination trials. We also excluded studies if it was not possible to separate out the data on views of routine childhood vaccination from views of vaccination in other age groups (e.g. adolescents, adults) or views on vaccination in general.\n\n【125】#### Setting\n\n【126】We included studies from any setting globally where childhood vaccination is provided. These settings could include healthcare facilities, fixed outreach sites, or mobile health teams in communities.\n\n【127】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【128】#### Electronic searches\n\n【129】We searched PDQ‐Evidence ( pdq-evidence.org ) for related reviews, as well as the following electronic databases for eligible studies from 1974 to 3 June 2020.\n\n【130】*   PDQ‐Evidence, Epistemonikos Foundation\n    \n*   MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations and Daily 1946 to June 02, 2020, Ovid\n    \n*   Embase 1974 to 2020 June 02, Ovid\n    \n*   CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature)1980‐present, EbscoHost\n    \n*   Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics).\n    \n*   APA PsycInfo 1806 to May Week 4 2020\n    \n\n【131】We chose these databases as we anticipated that they would yield the highest number of results based on preliminary, exploratory searches. We developed search strategies for each database, using guidelines developed by the Cochrane Qualitative & Implementation Methods Group for searching for qualitative evidence ( Harris 2018 ). We did not apply any limits on language or geographic location. We searched all databases from 1974 to capture parents’ and informal caregivers’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination since the introduction of the WHO’s EPI. We included a methodological filter for qualitative studies. Search strategies for all databases are given in Appendix 1 .\n\n【132】#### Searching other resources\n\n【133】In addition to database searching, we handsearched references of all included studies and key references (i.e. relevant systematic reviews).\n\n【134】### Data collection, management, and synthesis\n\n【135】#### Selection of studies\n\n【136】We collated records identified from different sources into one database and removed duplicates. Two independent review authors then used Covidence ( www.covidence.org/ ) to assess each record for eligibility (SC, BS, ES). At this stage, we discarded abstracts that were clearly irrelevant to the topic of this review and abstracts published in languages other than English, French or German (see 'Language translation' for more details). At this stage, we also decided to exclude dissertations, because of the very high numbers of dissertation abstracts identified and the difficulties we experienced in accessing their full texts. We retrieved the full texts of all abstracts identified as potentially relevant. Two independent review authors (SC, BS, ES) then used Covidence to assess each full‐text article for inclusion, according to predefined criteria. For both the title/abstract and full‐text screening, review authors resolved disagreements through  discussion or, when required, by seeking a third review author’s opinion. Where appropriate, we contacted the study authors for further information.\n\n【137】#### Language translation\n\n【138】Only articles published in languages spoken by the review authors were selected for inclusion. This meant that only articles in French, English, and German were included. The resources needed and difficulties associated with translating papers reporting qualitative research in the context of a qualitative evidence synthesis are common issues across synthesis approaches. However, these issues are arguably particularly challenging with more interpretive (as opposed to aggregative) synthesis approaches. In these cases, an in‐depth and nuanced understanding of the meaning of complex conceptual data is essential ( France 2014 ; Noyes 2018 ). To ensure analytical rigour, we therefore decided to exclude studies published in languages not spoken by the review authors.\n\n【139】#### Sampling of studies\n\n【140】In contrast to reviews of intervention effectiveness, the inclusion of large numbers of primary studies in qualitative evidence syntheses can impair the quality of the analysis ( Ames 2019a ). Large volumes of data may hinder a detailed and in‐depth engagement with the data and make it difficult to move from a descriptive or aggregative analysis to a more interpretive analysis. Moreover, unlike reviews of intervention effectiveness, which aim to be exhaustive in order to achieve statistical generalisability, syntheses of qualitative studies aim for depth of understanding and conceptual generalisability ( Hannes 2013 ).\n\n【141】Numerous studies met our inclusion criteria – 145 studies, described in 176 full texts (173 articles and 3 books) – and we considered this number too large to analyse adequately and undertake an interpretive meta‐ethnography. Therefore, we purposefully sampled  a selection of studies to be included in the synthesis ( Suri 2011 ), using 3 sampling criteria in the following order: ‘conceptual richness’, ‘relevance’, and ‘geographical spread’. Our sampling approach draws on the guidance provided by Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care ( EPOC 2017 ), and the sampling approach developed and used for a related review on perceptions and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination ( Ames 2019a ).\n\n【142】There is growing recognition that meta‐ethnography requires conceptually‐rich studies, since more descriptive findings usually have too little depth to allow an interpretive synthesis ( Britten 2012 ; France 2014 ; France 2019 ). Various meta‐ethnographies have found that studies that lacked interpretation beyond basic description limited the analysis ( Atkins 2008 ; Garside 2008 ; Campbell 2011 ), while another meta‐ethnography found that the synthesised findings remained the same when only conceptually‐rich papers were included in the analysis ( Malpass 2009 ). Therefore, we decided to use ‘conceptual richness’ as our primary sampling criterion, to ensure that those studies included in the analysis were conceptually rich enough to enable translation and explanation of concepts which go beyond the settings of individual studies.\n\n【143】While there is a tool to assess the data richness of qualitative studies ( Ames 2019a ), to our knowledge, there is no existing tool to assess the conceptual richness of qualitative studies. Therefore, we developed our own assessment scale by drawing on the typology of the type and nature of qualitative findings developed by Sandelowski 2007 . This typology conceives qualitative findings as being located along a continuous spectrum based on the degree of abstraction of analysis and interpretation of the data, or what is referred to as the extent of ‘data transformation’. At one end of the spectrum are more descriptive findings; that is, findings that describe patterns in the data. At the other end of the spectrum are interpretive or explanatory findings. These transformed findings have a high level of abstraction and provide theoretical interpretations or explanations of the patterns in the data.\n\n【144】We created a simple 1 to 5 scale for categorising studies on this spectrum of data transformation ( Figure 1 ). Employing the terms used by the original authors of the typology, we defined our scores as follows.\n\n【145】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【146】Figure 1\n\n【147】* * *\n\n【148】* * *\n\n【149】Conceptual richness 5‐point scale (adapted from the typology of qualitative findings developed by Sandelowski 2007 )\n\n【150】*   A score of 1: _thematic survey:_ concepts or themes may be used to label, present, or organise portions of data. These concepts or themes may be developed in situ (i.e. invented by the researcher from the data collected in a study) or from theoretical or empirical literature outside the study.\n    \n*   A score of 3: _conceptual/thematic description:_ findings that explore and interpret patterns of association in portions of data or link these patterns to key theoretical concepts. In contrast to thematic surveys in which in situ or imported concepts or themes are used to label or order portions of data, in conceptual/thematic descriptions, concepts or themes are used to interpretively reframe portions of data.\n    \n*   A score of 5: _interpretive explanation:_ interpretive or explanatory findings that provide theoretical interpretations or explanations of the patterns in the data. In contrast to findings that consist of conceptual/thematic descriptions of segments of data representing one or more elements of an experience, interpretive explanations offer a coherent model, single thesis, or line of argument which provides integrated explanations of phenomena or events.\n    \n\n【151】Using this conceptual‐richness scale, two reviewers (SC, BS) independently scored 25 studies. Comparison of their assessments revealed a fair degree of consensus. Therefore, one reviewer (SC) performed the assessment on the remaining eligible studies, which was subsequently checked by a second reviewer (BS). We sampled all studies that scored a 3 or higher on the scale, which comprised 30 studies from 56 articles.\n\n【152】Meta‐ethnography requires studies that are not only conceptually rich, but which are also likely to make an important contribution to the synthesis ( Noblit 1988 ; Campbell 2011 ). Thus, a study may be conceptually rich, but very little of the data may relate to the question of interest of the synthesis. For example, a study which focuses on parents’ experiences of promoting infant health and development may be conceptually rich, but the data in relation to vaccination specifically may be conceptually thin. Similar to Ames and colleagues ( Ames 2019a ), we therefore employed a second sampling criterion of ‘relevance’ to assess the studies that had already been sampled. We did this by re‐examining the studies that scored 3 or higher on the conceptual‐richness scale to assess their relevance with regards to the phenomenon of interest of the synthesis. Here, we asked the question: ‘Is the study conceptually rich in relation to the question of interest of the synthesis?’, and employed a simple ‘yes/no’ approach to answer this question. Through this process, we removed three studies from our pool of sampled studies, as most of their data and focus were outside of the scope of the synthesis. This resulted in 27 studies from 53 articles sampled.\n\n【153】Finally, and similar to Ames and colleagues again ( Ames 2019a ), we considered the geographic distribution of the sampled studies. Our review sought to develop a global understanding of the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, including similarities and differences across different settings. Moreover, as the majority of existing reviews on the demand side of childhood vaccination have been limited to studies from HICs (see Table 1 ), we felt it was important to ensure our review comprised a more representative geographical spread of findings. Therefore, we extracted information on the WHO region and income level (HIC or LMIC) of all included studies and considered the geographic representation of sampled studies. We agreed that the regional and income‐level distribution of sampled studies was adequate, and as such made the decision to not undertake any further sampling. Therefore, we sampled and included a total of 27 studies from 53 articles in the analysis.\n\n【154】#### Data extraction\n\n【155】We extracted contextual and methodological data for each sampled study using a form designed specifically for this review. We used this form to extract the following information (where available): study author; date of publication; country of study; high‐income country/low‐ and middle‐income country; WHO region; participant details, including total number of participants, participant group (first‐time parent/informal caregiver, older parent/informal caregiver, etc.), gender, socioeconomic status; type of vaccine; objectives or aim; study design, including overarching methodological approach, guiding theoretical or conceptual framework, data collection and analysis methods; other contextual details (any key political, historical, and cultural factors of potential relevance).\n\n【156】#### Assessment of methodological limitations in the included studies\n\n【157】Our inclusion criteria specified that included studies needed to use both qualitative data collection and analysis methods. This constituted a basic quality threshold, as we excluded studies that used qualitative methods to collect data but not to analyse these data. In addition, two review authors (SC, BS) independently assessed methodological limitations for each study using criteria employed in previous Cochrane Reviews ( Ames 2017b ; Munabi‐Babigumira 2017 ; Ames 2019b ; Karimi‐Shahanjarini 2019 ; Houghton 2020 ). These criteria were originally based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool ( CASP 2018 ), but they have since gone through several iterations. For instance, we did not include questions about the appropriateness of qualitative methodology or the specific research design used, as these were already covered in our inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion between the two review authors or through consultation with a third review author (ES). The adapted tool includes the following eight questions, which we used to assess methodological limitations.\n\n【158】*   Are the setting(s) and context described adequately?\n    \n*   Is the sampling strategy described, and is this appropriate?\n    \n*   Is the data collection strategy described and justified?\n    \n*   Is the data analysis described, and is this appropriate?\n    \n*   Are the claims made/findings supported by sufficient evidence?\n    \n*   Is there evidence of reflexivity?\n    \n*   Does the study demonstrate sensitivity to ethical concerns?\n    \n*   Any other concerns?\n    \n\n【159】We conducted a pilot on three sampled studies to assess the feasibility of using this tool and to ensure integrity of the assessment. We did not use our quality assessments to exclude studies, but rather to judge the relative contribution of each study to the development of explanations and relationships and as part of the assessment of how much confidence we have in each finding (see below). Our assessments for each study are reported in the Methodological limitations table in Appendix 2 .\n\n【160】#### Data management, analysis, and synthesis\n\n【161】We used a meta‐ethnographic approach, drawing on the analytical steps outlined originally by Noblit and Hare ( Noblit 1988 ), and the eMERGe meta‐ethnography reporting guidance ( France 2019 ). Meta‐ethnography is an interpretive, rather than aggregative, qualitative synthesis approach which is well‐suited to producing new concepts or theories ( France 2014 ; Noyes 2018 ). As the central aim of this synthesis was to derive a new conceptual understanding of the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination, we decided that a meta‐ethnographic approach was the most appropriate synthesis method. Meta‐ethnography involves induction and interpretation to translate and synthesise conceptual data identified within included studies into higher‐order interpretations. The analysis is built up study by study, in a manner that both preserves the context of the primary data within individual studies, and facilitates an understanding of how concepts in different studies are related to each other ( France 2019 ).\n\n【162】Our analysis comprised various stages, which we describe separately and in detail below (see Figure 2 for a flow diagram of the analysis phases). In practice, however, the different stages and processes of the analysis were blurred and iterative, unfolding in a manner that “cannot be reduced to mechanistic tasks\" ( Britten 2002 ). The final findings of our synthesis were the outcome of acombination of deep immersion in the data, detailed reading and prior knowledge of theory, team discussion and compromise, as well as rigour, reflection, and creativity. Ultimately, these processes continued until we reached an understanding of our phenomenon of interest, an understanding which is inevitably incomplete but one with which we were satisfied.\n\n【163】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【164】Figure 2\n\n【165】* * *\n\n【166】* * *\n\n【167】Flow diagram to illustrate analysis phases\n\n【168】##### Stage 1: extraction of study author interpretations (second‐order findings) and development of brief study summaries\n\n【169】The first stage of the analysis involved undertaking a close reading and rereading of all studies to identify and extract study author interpretations (second‐order findings), as well as a selection of corresponding participant quotes (first‐order findings) for illustrative purposes. During this stage, we also developed a brief, structured summary for each study, capturing the study aims and context, the theory or theories used to explain findings or link concepts, and the study's line of argument. Data extraction for each paper, as well as the structured study summaries, was conducted by one review author (SC), checked by a second author (BS or ES), and followed by discussion and resolution of any queries.\n\n【170】###### Key issues and considerations\n\n【171】*   When undertaking the data extraction, we understood research participants’ quotes as reflecting first‐order findings, and study authors’ interpretations as second‐order findings ( Britten 2002 ). However, we recognised that this distinction is blurred, as study authors select and interpret participant quotes to demonstrate second‐order findings ( Schutz 1971 ).\n    \n*   We extracted concepts, themes, and the study's line of argument as second‐order findings. Here, we understood concepts as having some analytic or conceptual power, in contrast to themes which are more descriptive and comprise data simply organised and presented without much transformation or evidence of second‐order conceptualisation by the researcher ( Britten 2012 ). When extracting concepts, we also extracted (where available) the theory or theories underpinning their meaning. Drawing on more recent definitions provided by Noblit ( Noblit 2016 ; Noblit 2019 ), we understood a line of argument to be an overarching explanation, interpretation, or ‘storyline’ of a phenomenon. Therefore, while themes and concepts may describe or explain segments of data, a line of argument provides a broader theory or single thesis which links and potentially integrates different concepts and themes (see Figure 3 ).\n    \n*   We tried as much as possible to use the study authors’ own words or a close paraphrase, with little re‐interpretation, when extracting second‐order findings.\n    \n*   Data extraction occurred across the full texts, as second‐order findings were often reported and developed throughout the articles and books.\n    \n*   Many studies were reported in several articles or books included in the review. We therefore performed data extraction for each individual article or book first, and then amalgamated these extractions into a single Word document for each study, removing duplicate findings.\n    \n\n【172】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【173】Figure 3\n\n【174】* * *\n\n【175】* * *\n\n【176】Types and definitions of qualitative research findings (drawing on Noblit 1988 ; Britten 2002 ; Malpass 2009 ; Sandelowski 2007 )\n\n【177】##### Stage 2: determining how the studies are related\n\n【178】The next stage in the analysis involved comparing and contrasting the primary studies to decide how they were related and, therefore, how they could be synthesised. One author (SC) led this process, with discussion and input from two other authors (BS, ES). Here, we compared three aspects of the studies: the meaning of their key concepts or themes, their central aim or focus, and their theoretical approaches ( Noblit 1988 ).\n\n【179】###### Comparing the meaning of study concepts and themes\n\n【180】To compare how studies related in terms of their concepts and themes, we created a list of the second‐order findings, including a summary of their meaning, for each study. Although there was an immediately obvious similarity between study concepts and themes, we felt that the numerous second‐order findings necessitated some preliminary form of organising to enable adequate comparison. We therefore performed a basic thematic analysis at this point, following a process similar to others ( Pound 2005 ; Atkins 2008 ), to group the concepts and themes inductively within and between studies into categories of shared meaning. Through this process, we developed seven broad thematic categories of meaning.\n\n【181】###### Comparing study aim/focus and theoretical approaches of studies\n\n【182】We compared the central aim, as well as the theoretical approaches, of studies by reading the structured summaries we had previously developed for each study, returning to the original articles where necessary. The commonalities in study aims were clearly evident, which was unsurprising, given the relatively tightly focused aim and research question of our review, and associated search and sampling strategies ( France 2019 ).\n\n【183】The relationship between the studies’ theoretical approaches was less obvious. Using the structured summaries, we made a list of the main theory or theories that studies used to explain, describe, or predict findings or link concepts, so we could examine them more closely. There were many similar, but also diverse, theories across the studies. However, on investigation, we considered them to be mutually commensurate in their politics and underpinning epistemological assumptions ( Bevan 2007 ). Our assessment was both enabled and informed by many of the review authors’ understanding and prior knowledge of the theories employed by studies.\n\n【184】###### Outcome of the comparisons\n\n【185】From these comparisons, we concluded that the general conceptual coherence between studies, their similarities in topic and focus, and their epistemological compatibility meant that, in general, the studies were reciprocally related. While no study was a complete refutation of another, our comparisons did reveal various specific findings within and between studies that were incongruent, inconsistent, or in opposition. For example, in some studies, the concept of ‘infant fragility’ was found to enhance vaccination acceptance, whereas in other studies, it was found to reduce vaccination acceptance. We therefore conducted both a ‘reciprocal’ and a ‘refutational’ translation (see 'Stage 3') for the similar and the disconfirming findings, respectively ( France 2019 ).\n\n【186】##### Stage 3: development of overarching (‘translated’) second‐order findings\n\n【187】The next stage of the analysis comprised the translation of the studies into each other to produce overarching or 'translated' second‐order concepts and themes. This entailed comparing the second‐order concepts and themes across the studies so as to ‘match’ those describing a similar idea, albeit with a different label (reciprocal translation), and to identify and explain deviant cases (refutational translation). One review author (SC) led the process of translation, with discussion, input, and verification from two other authors (BS, ES) in the early stages, and from all review authors in the later stages.\n\n【188】We began the translation process by grouping the studies according to income group (HIC or LMIC), and then, as others have done ( Atkins 2008 ; Malpass 2009 ; Campbell 2011 ), by the date of publication within each of the income groups. Using this grouping, we then approached the reciprocal translations in a way similar to that of Campbell 2011 . We systematically compared the second‐order findings from study 1 with study 2, and then the synthesis of these studies with study 3, and so on. We conducted our comparisons within the seven thematic categories we had developed through our thematic analysis in stage 2. We followed this process chronologically for studies within each income group until all the studies had been translated into each other. Once we had a list of translated findings for each income group, we then translated the findings from the two income groups into each other.\n\n【189】For the refutational translations, we juxtaposed apparent incongruencies, inconsistencies, and oppositions to “take into account the implied relationship between them” ( Noblit 2019 ). That is, we explored whether they might be explained by differences in participants, settings, or study design, or whether the differences pointed to other potential variations in the phenomenon of interest ( Booth 2013 ; France 2019 ).\n\n【190】The translation processes culminated in the identification of 17 translated second‐order findings, each with several related subconcepts or subthemes. Each second‐order finding represents a specific factor influencing parental views and practices regarding childhood vaccination. We created a list of all second‐order findings, and accompanied each with a brief narrative summary.\n\n【191】###### Key issues and considerations\n\n【192】*   We needed to make decisions about the order in which to translate the studies. Through our thematic analysis in the previous stage, we had observed several similar second‐order findings amongst the studies in HICs and amongst those in LMICs, or what felt like a conceptual coherence within (and less between) these two country income groups. It therefore made sense to us to arrange the studies, firstly, according to income group (HIC or LMIC). Grouping the studies in this way enhanced our understanding of this particular contextual issue, although this grouping may also have limited our analysis in other ways (see ‘Limitations of the review’). The studies in our review spanned over 20 years and, therefore, like Atkins 2008 , we were interested in ascertaining the potential impact that any changes over time in vaccination policy, programmes, and/or research may have on the findings. Therefore, and in a similar way to others ( Atkins 2008 ; Malpass 2009 ; Campbell 2011 ), after grouping the studies by income group, we then arranged the studies by date of publication within each of the income groups. However, similar to Atkins 2008 , we found it difficult to discern the potential impact of any changes over time in vaccination policy, programmes, and/or research. Our decision to organise and synthesise the studies chronologically within income groups therefore appears to have had little impact on the analysis and findings.\n    \n*   We used the seven thematic categories we had developed in stage 2 as the basis of the translation. However, these initial categories were gradually reconfigured, merged, added to, or removed as the processes unfolded.\n    \n*   When labelling the reciprocally translated second‐order findings, sometimes we used the terminology from one study which adequately incorporated the ideas of others (e.g. the concept of “salutogenic parenting”). At other times, we created a new label which we felt appropriately encompassed the meaning of the related concepts (e.g. the concept of the “fragile infant”). We drew on Noblit and Hare’s  criteria for assessing the adequacy of metaphors (economy, cogency, range, apparency, credibility) ( Noblit 1988 ), when considering how to name our translated second‐order findings.\n    \n*   Whilst conceptually distinct, the reciprocal and refutational translations were not performed separately but were integrated in a back and forth process and as part of our unfolding analysis and interpretations.\n    \n\n【193】##### Stage 4: development of third‐order findings\n\n【194】The final stage of the analysis comprised synthesising the translated second‐order findings to create higher‐level findings, also referred to as ‘third‐order’ findings ( Britten 2002 ) (see Figure 3 ). One review author (SC) led the synthesis process, with discussion, input, and verification from two other authors (BS, ES) in the early stages, and from all review authors in the later stages.\n\n【195】###### Key processes undertaken\n\n【196】This stage comprised various back and forth processes:\n\n【197】*   We repeatedly read and compared the lists and summaries of the translated second‐order findings, frequently returning to the original study articles and books to clarify meanings.\n    \n*   We drew many visual diagrams and mind‐maps to aid our interpretations of the translated second‐order findings and their potential inter‐relationships.\n    \n*   We revisited the overarching line of argument of each study ( Noblit 2019 ), as captured in our structured study summaries. These helped us to gain a fuller understanding of context, and provided a way of checking whether our emerging interpretations were capturing the collective voice of the studies.\n    \n*   We used our refutation translations to test our emerging interpretations, and to integrate and contextualise them further ( Finfgeld‐Connett 2014 ).\n    \n*   We examined the various theories used by the studies included in the review more closely. In some cases, we also obtained the original theoretical sources cited by study authors to refamiliarise ourselves with the relevant theory.\n    \n*   We also examined the various conceptual or theoretical models developed or used by the studies included in the review, as well as those developed in the existing literature external to the studies included in the review (see 'Description of the topic'). Here, three models proved useful and informed our thinking: the three‐layered analytical framework developed by Leach 2007 (study included in the review); the two‐dimensional vaccine hesitancy model developed by Peretti‐Watel 2015 (paper external to the studies included in the review); and the three‐dimensional ‘Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix’ developed by the WHO 2013b (paper external to the studies included in the review). While these models informed our interpretations, none were able to fully ‘hold’ or account for all of our translated second‐order findings.\n    \n\n【198】Through these different processes, we developed various third‐order findings: four themes; two concepts; and one overarching line of argument.\n\n【199】**Four themes:** the seven original thematic categories (from stage 2) were refined and reconceptualised into four third‐order themes. Taken together, these themes provide an organising framework for the seventeen translated second‐order findings (from stage 3). Each theme represents a category of factors influencing parental views and practices around childhood vaccination (see Figure 4 ).\n\n【200】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【201】Figure 4\n\n【202】* * *\n\n【203】* * *\n\n【204】Second‐order findings organised by the third‐order themes\n\n【205】**Two concepts:** the 17 translated second‐order findings were also reinterpreted and conceptually integrated to produce two third‐order concepts which we labelled as: ‘neoliberal logic’ and ‘social exclusion’. Each concept encapsulates a potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. These third‐order concepts were the product of a combination of the 17 translated second‐order findings, as well as theory and conceptual models imported from existing literature, identified in the included studies, and originally developed by the review authors ( Colvin 2018 ) (see Figure 5 ).\n\n【206】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【207】Figure 5\n\n【208】* * *\n\n【209】* * *\n\n【210】Second‐order findings that contributed to each third‐order concept\n\n【211】**One overarching line of argument:** finally, we also integrated all of the findings to develop one overarching line of argument. This provides a conceptual and more overarching explanation for how one might conceptualise parental views and practices regarding childhood vaccination. It resembles a reinterpretation of meaning across studies, and represents more than an aggregative descriptive account ( Barnett‐Page 2009 ) (see Figure 6 ).\n\n【212】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【213】Figure 6\n\n【214】* * *\n\n【215】* * *\n\n【216】All second‐ and third‐order findings and their relationships\n\n【217】###### Key issues and considerations\n\n【218】*   Throughout the synthesis process, we were mindful of the importance of remaining grounded in the context and meaning of the primary study data ( Noyes 2018 ). Our structured summaries of each study were particularly useful in this regard, helping us preserve the meaning of concepts and their interrelationships within specific studies as the analysis unfolded. Throughout the analysis process, we frequently returned to these structured study summaries and also the full texts of studies for clarification and further elucidation of concepts and themes.\n    \n*   Most studies genuinely and appropriately incorporated the theory or theories they indicated using, most likely due to our sampling of only conceptually‐rich studies for the analysis. That said, there were a few studies that mentioned using a particular theory, yet its actual incorporation in the analysis appeared limited. In such cases, the findings from these studies were mainly used to confirm, rather than further develop, our emerging interpretations. Therefore, while all studies contributed to the analysis and synthesis, some studies played a more confirmatory role.\n    \n*   Many of the review authors had considerable prior knowledge of the different theories employed by the studies, which facilitated our analysis. At the same time, however, this also meant that the boundaries between our own reading of the theories and how they related to the study findings, and those of the study authors, were not always easy to separate.\n    \n*   During our discussions, we made a conscious effort to consider potential alternative interpretations or explanations, which was facilitated by the constitution of the review team and inclusion of review authors from diverse academic disciplines.\n    \n\n【219】#### Implications for practice\n\n【220】Once we had finalised our review findings, we examined each finding to identify factors that could influence the design and implementation of interventions to promote childhood vaccination acceptance or uptake. Based on this, we developed prompts for future policy‐ and decision‐makers (see Appendix 3 : 'Moving from review findings to implications for practice'). These prompts are presented in the 'Implications for practice' section. These prompts are not intended to be recommendations, but are phrased as questions to help policy‐ and decision‐makers consider the implications of the review findings within their context.\n\n【221】#### Assessment of confidence in the synthesis findings\n\n【222】We used the GRADE‐CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to summarise our confidence in various review findings ( Lewin 2018 ). These included 19 review findings in total: the 17 second‐order findings (study author interpretations) and the two third‐order concepts (review author interpretations). GRADE‐CERQual assesses confidence in the evidence, based on the following four key components.\n\n【223】*   Methodological limitations of included studies: the extent to which there are concerns about the design or conduct of the primary studies that contributed evidence to an individual review finding.\n    \n*   Coherence of the review finding: an assessment of how clear and cogent the fit is between the data from the primary studies and a review finding that synthesises those data. By cogent, we mean well‐supported or compelling.\n    \n*   Adequacy of the data contributing to a review finding: an overall determination of the degree of richness and quantity of data supporting a review finding.\n    \n*   Relevance of the included studies to the review question: the extent to which the body of evidence from the primary studies supporting a review finding is applicable to the context (perspective or population, phenomenon of interest, setting) specified in the review question.\n    \n\n【224】After assessing each of the four components, we made a judgement about the overall confidence in the evidence supporting the review finding. We judged confidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. The final assessment was based on consensus among the review authors. All findings started as high confidence and were then graded down if there were important concerns regarding any of the CERQual components. Two review authors (SC, BS) led the GRADE‐CERQual assessments of the second‐order findings, and all review authors conducted the assessments of the findings for the third‐order concepts. Few GRADE‐CERQual assessments have been conducted on conceptual findings. Therefore, in our ‘Evidence profiles’, we include a greater than usual amount of detail on how we reached our assessments of the third‐order concepts.\n\n【225】#### Summary of qualitative findings tables and evidence profiles\n\n【226】To facilitate understanding and use of the review findings, we present them in a summary of qualitative findings (SoQF) table (see summary of findings Table 1 ). The table displays a structured summary of each review finding and references to the studies contributing data to each finding. It also provides our assessment of confidence in the evidence, as well as an explanation of this assessment, based on the GRADE‐CERQual approach ( Lewin 2018 ). All review findings that were assessed using GRADE‐CERQual are reported in the SoQF table regardless of their associated level of confidence.\n\n【227】We present detailed descriptions of our confidence assessment in the evidence profiles ( Appendix 4 ).\n\n【228】#### Integrating the review findings with the Cochrane intervention reviews\n\n【229】We identified existing Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness focused on interventions to improve coverage or uptake of vaccination ( Saeterdal 2014 ; Oyo‐Ita 2016 ; Jacobson‐Vann 2018 ; Kaufman 2018 ). As part of our data synthesis, we explored how we could integrate the findings from these related reviews with those of our review. Here, we used a matrix‐model approach similar to Candy 2011 and Ames 2017b . Two authors (SC, BS) used a matrix‐model approach to create a comparative table that explored whether the underlying theories or components of the interventions included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness reflected or targeted the factors influencing parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination identified by our review.\n\n【230】To create the matrix, we first reviewed our four overarching themes of factors influencing parental views and practices around childhood vaccination, and devised questions which reflected their central idea or meaning. Theme four ('Access‐supply‐demand interactions') contained various core ideas and so, for this theme, we created various questions to reflect this.\n\n【231】*   Have parents’ broader health beliefs and practices been considered, and the meanings, concerns, or questions about vaccination these may give rise to?\n    \n*   Have the social networks and groups (e.g. social, cultural, religious, geographical) with which parents are affiliated been considered and potentially included?\n    \n*   Have parents’ perceptions of the authorities associated with vaccination programmes (e.g. government, healthcare workers, medical researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, global health agencies, or other relevant stakeholders) been considered? Has an attempt been made to address parents’ potential distrust of these authorities?\n    \n*   Has an attempt been made to address the social or economic challenges parents face in accessing vaccination services?\n    \n*   Has an attempt been made to address features of vaccination services that parents might find undesirable or inconvenient?\n    \n*   Have parents’ experiences of the social nature of vaccination services, as a place where people gather and interact, been considered?\n    \n*   Has an attempt been made to ensure positive interactions between healthcare workers and parents, including ensuring healthcare workers are supportive, willing to have non‐judgemental discussions with parents about their questions and concerns regarding vaccination, and provide information that parents perceive as impartial, balanced, and unbiased?\n    \n\n【232】Secondly, we created a table listing these seven questions. We then assessed whether the underlying theories or components of the interventions included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness reflected or targetted the influencing factors. We did this by creating a summary of the underlying theories or components of each intervention, and then applying the seven questions to each intervention. Each question could be answered as yes, no, partially, or not reported/unclear, to indicate whether the influencing factor was reflected in the underlying theories or components of the intervention. We listed all of the studies from the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness in our matrix table, and added our assessment for each of the seven questions.\n\n【233】After removing duplicates, there were a total of 54 interventions from the related effectiveness reviews. As the scope of Jacobson‐Vann 2018 was broader than childhood vaccination, we only assessed trials from that review which focused on interventions for childhood vaccination. We gathered information about the interventions only from the publications included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness; we did not search for additional information in related publications or from study authors.\n\n【234】Results\n-------\n\n【235】### Results of the search\n\n【236】We found 145 studies that met our inclusion criteria ( Figure 7 ). We sampled 27 of these studies for inclusion in the analysis. All of the sampled studies were published between 1995 and 2020.\n\n【237】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【238】Figure 7\n\n【239】* * *\n\n【240】* * *\n\n【241】Study flow diagram\n\n【242】### Description of the studies\n\n【243】In this section, we describe the studies that we included and sampled. For a more detailed description of these studies, as well as the studies that were included but not sampled, see the Characteristics of included studies .\n\n【244】#### Setting\n\n【245】Eleven studies were based in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs): Brazil (n = 1) ( Barbieri 2017 ), India (n = 4) ( Bisht 2000 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Varghese 2013 ; Hussain 2015 ), Burkina Faso (n = 1) ( Dugas 2009 ), Central African Republic and Burkina Faso (n = 1) ( Giles‐Vernick 2016 ), Gambia (n = 1) ( Leach 2007 ), Guinea (n = 1) ( Millimouno 2006 ), Ethiopia (n = 1) ( McKnight 2014 ), Nigeria (n = 1) ( Renne 2010 ).\n\n【246】Sixteen studies took place in high income countries (HICs): Australia (n = 1) ( Ward 2017 ), USA (n = 5) ( Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Carrion 2018 ; Limaye 2020 ), Canada (n = 1) ( Dube 2016 ), United Kingdom (UK, n = 7) ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Johnson 2014 ; Smith 2017 ), France (n = 1) ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), Netherlands (n = 1) ( Ruijs 2012 ). These assignments are based on the World Bank’s classification of income level as of June 2019.\n\n【247】In terms of WHO regions, six studies were conducted in Africa ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ), seven in the Americas ( Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Limaye 2020 ), four in South‐East Asia ( Bisht 2000 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Varghese 2013 ; Hussain 2015 ), nine in Europe ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ruijs 2012 ; Johnson 2014 ; Smith 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), one in the Western Pacific ( Ward 2017 ), and none in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n【248】Six studies, all undertaken in the UK, focused exclusively on the MMR vaccine ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Johnson 2014 ; Smith 2017 ). Three studies focused exclusively on polio vaccines: two of these were undertaken in India ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Hussain 2015 ), and one in Nigeria ( Renne 2010 ). The rest of the studies (n = 18) focused on all childhood vaccines or childhood vaccination in general.\n\n【249】#### Respondents\n\n【250】In all of the studies, authors sought the perspectives of parents and informal caregivers, such as grandmothers, although it was not possible to distinguish between the viewpoints of these groups during the analysis.\n\n【251】Twelve studies explored the perspectives of mothers only ( Rogers 1995 ; Bisht 2000 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Leach 2007 ; Varghese 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; McKnight 2014 ; Dube 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Limaye 2020 ).\n\n【252】Two studies reported focusing on parents from specific minority groups: one study in the Netherlands explored the perspectives of orthodox Protestant parents from various villages in the ‘Dutch bible belt’ ( Ruijs 2012 ), and one study in the UK examined the perspectives of site‐dwelling Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in South East England ( Smith 2017 ).\n\n【253】Nine studies reported including parents from diverse socioeconomic groups: five of these studies were conducted in Europe ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ); three in the Americas ( Brunson 2013 ; Carrion 2018 ; Limaye 2020 ), and one in South East Asia ( Hussain 2015 ). Six studies reported including parents exclusively from higher socioeconomic groups: two of these studies were conducted in Europe ( Rogers 1995 ; Johnson 2014 ), three in the Americas ( Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ), and one in the Western Pacific ( Ward 2017 ). One study (conducted in Ethiopia) reported that the majority of parents were peasants who lived just above subsistence level ( McKnight 2014 ). Eleven studies did not report on the socioeconomic status of the participants: five of these studies were conducted in Africa ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ); three in South East Asia ( Bisht 2000 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Varghese 2013 ); two in Europe ( Ruijs 2012 ; Smith 2017 ); and one in the Americas ( Dube 2016 ).\n\n【254】Five studies only included parents who did not vaccinate their child(ren) according to the national EPI recommended schedule (e.g. refused vaccination, partially vaccinated, delayed some or all vaccinations), including two studies conducted in the USA ( Reich 2016 ; Carrion 2018 ), one study in Ethiopia ( McKnight 2014 ), one study in the UK ( Rogers 1995 ), and one study in Australia ( Ward 2017 ). One study, undertaken in the UK, only included parents with concerns about immunisation ( Brownlie 2005 ).\n\n【255】#### Methodology\n\n【256】Thirteen studies employed a long‐term ethnographic approach (sometimes spanning many years), including the use of multiple data collection strategies and various types of observational and participatory methods (e.g. simultaneous use of formal individual or group interviews, informal discussions, and participant and/or nonparticipant observations amongst the people and settings of interest) ( Bisht 2000 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Dugas 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Varghese 2013 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ).\n\n【257】Nine studies only conducted in‐depth, individual interviews ( Rogers 1995 ; Ruijs 2012 ; Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020 ).\n\n【258】Four studies only conducted focus group discussions ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Johnson 2014 ; Smith 2017 ), and one study conducted both individual interviews and focus group discussions ( Casiday 2007 ).\n\n【259】All studies employed interpretive analytical approaches and drew on a range of critical social theories, particularly from the fields of sociology and anthropology. These included, inter alia, critical theory on risk, trust, and uncertainty; idioms of distress and practices around health, disease, and therapy; science and technology; knowledge, power, and discourse; governmentality; subjectivity; social capital; and a range of other actor‐ and practice‐oriented social theories. Whilst studies utilised diverse critical social theories, there was a collective compatibility regarding their underpinning politics and epistemologies ( Bevan 2007 ).\n\n【260】### Methodological limitations of the studies\n\n【261】The findings from the majority of studies were supported by plentiful, conceptually‐rich data (i.e. depth, detail, and breadth of evidence). Most of the studies also provided detailed descriptions of the setting(s), and the broader socioeconomic and political contexts in which the research was conducted. This extensive reporting of data and context may be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that many of the studies were described in multiple sources: the 27 sampled studies were reported in a total of 53 full texts, including three books. Moreover, many of the articles were also published in social science journals, which are frequently less stringent with word limits in comparison to health research journals.\n\n【262】Across most of the studies, however, there was generally poor reporting of the methods employed, a relatively common characteristic of sociological and anthropological research ( Green 2004 ). In particular, most studies provided little or no detail of both the sampling strategies employed and data analysis methods. Evidence of reflexivity and sensitivity to ethical concerns were also limited in the majority of studies. Thus, the methodological limitations of most studies primarily related to poor or inadequate reporting, which made it challenging for us to assess the appropriateness of the research methods utilised. Details of the assessments of methodological limitations for individual studies can be found in Appendix 2 .\n\n【263】### Confidence in the review findings\n\n【264】We used the GRADE‐CERQual approach to grade our confidence in 19 review findings. We graded seven as high confidence, eight as moderate confidence, and four as low confidence.\n\n【265】Our main concerns were connected to the methodological limitations of the studies and the relevance of the data. Common methodological limitations included limited evidence of researcher reflexivity and sensitivity to ethical considerations, as well as poor reporting of sampling and data analysis methods. The data were often assessed as being only partially relevant, mainly because the studies contributing to the finding came from specific countries (e.g. only HICs); or included a subset of the population of interest (e.g. only parents who do not accept vaccination according to the recommended schedule); or focused on specific vaccines (e.g. only MMR or only polio vaccines). We downgraded some findings due to concerns about coherence, usually because of some ambiguous data. Many of the review findings were interpretive or explanatory in nature, and as such, were often complex and comprised multiple aspects. In cases where there was strong evidence for some aspects of the review finding, but insufficient data to support other aspects, we downgraded the review finding due to concerns about coherence. Our explanation of the GRADE‐CERQual assessment for each review finding is shown in the evidence profiles ( Appendix 4 ).\n\n【266】### Review findings\n\n【267】We present summaries of the findings and our assessments of confidence in these findings in the summary of findings Table 1 . We present detailed descriptions of our confidence assessments in the evidence profiles ( Appendix 4 ). The different types of findings we developed, and their relationships, are graphically depicted in Figure 3 , Figure 4 , Figure 5 , and Figure 6 .\n\n【268】#### 1\\. Themes\n\n【269】In the following themes, we have synthesised the views and interpretations of the **study authors** regarding the factors influencing parental views and practices around routine childhood vaccination, and have used direct study participant and study author quotes to contextualise and illustrate meaning.\n\n【270】##### Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness\n\n【271】Parents' ideas and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination may be influenced by their broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness generally, and specifically with regards to their children, and their perceptions of the role of vaccination within this context. That is, the way parents think about vaccination may be shaped by their conceptions of child health specifically, influences on it, and strategies to protect it and prevent illness. As suggested by the authors of various studies ( Bisht 2000 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ), what appears to matter with regards to acceptance of vaccination (or not), is whether parents’ own ideas about child health (and associated therapeutic traditions) fit with their own ideas about vaccines and what they can do. In other words, parents may accept vaccination even if they hold views about health and vaccination that fail to match or even contradict biomedical understandings of health, disease, and immunity. At the same time, parents may reject vaccination even if they hold 'correct' biomedical views about health and vaccination. What seems important regarding vaccination acceptance (or not), is whether parents' subjective beliefs about vaccines are compatible (or incompatible) with their subjective beliefs about health and illness.\n\n【272】Six specific second‐order findings emerged within this broader theme as implicated in vaccination views and practices: 1) religious beliefs; 2) the ‘fragile’ infant; 3) primacy of ‘nature’ and ‘the natural’; 4) individualised health, immunity, and vaccine‐response trajectories; 5) claiming parental expertise; and 6) personal choice and responsibility.\n\n【273】###### Finding 1: religious beliefs. Some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the religious beliefs they held, and the view that illness, including in children, can only be prevented by divine providence. These parents expressed religious objections to vaccination (low confidence).\n\n【274】Two studies, one in the Netherlands ( Ruijs 2012 ), and one in Nigeria ( Renne 2010 ), revealed that some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the religious beliefs they held. For example, many orthodox Protestant parents in a study in the Netherlands held the view that illness, including in children, can only be prevented by divine providence, and as such, expressed religious objections to vaccination: “Whether I have my children vaccinated or not does not matter to me because I don’t believe in it. I believe that if God wants to spare my children from an accident, then He will spare them from it” ( Ruijs 2012 , the Netherlands, participant quote). Similarly, while many Muslim parents in a study in Northern Nigeria accepted vaccination for their children, others viewed vaccination as unnecessary or even possibly dangerous ( Renne 2010 ). As suggested by the author of this study, this view was underpinned by these parents’ understanding of prayer as the only sufficient and real protection against disease, which they believed to ultimately come from God: “If God wishes, the one who had immunisation will be sick but the one who didn’t have immunisation will be in good health” ( Renne 2010 , Nigeria, participant quote).\n\n【275】###### Finding 2: the ‘fragile’ infant. An understanding of infants and their immune systems as fragile and still in a state of development was common amongst parents across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups. Numerous parents characterised infants and young children as weak and vulnerable, and in need of protection against multiple social, biological, or spiritual threats. This perception was associated with both reduced and increased acceptance of childhood vaccination (high confidence).\n\n【276】An understanding of infants and their immune systems as fragile and still in a state of development was ubiquitous amongst parents across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups ( Bisht 2000 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Limaye 2020 ). Numerous parents characterised infants and young children as weak and vulnerable, and in need of protection against multiple social, biological, and spiritual threats. However, the studies revealed refutational findings in the way this common understanding of infancy impacted upon vaccination, reducing acceptance in some studies and increasing acceptance in other studies. We interpreted this refutation as related to differences in study settings and associated potential sociocultural variations in how vaccines, and what they do, are commonly understood.\n\n【277】Various studies from the USA and United Kingdom revealed that some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the perception they had of infancy as precarious ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Limaye 2020 ). This perception gave rise to several specific concerns about vaccination. Some of these parents were concerned about unnecessary pain and suffering they perceived vaccination would cause ( Brownlie 2005 ; Smith 2017 ): “It was just the fact that you don’t want to inflict pain on this wee helpless baby” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote). Other parents’ concerns centred on what they saw as the overwhelming effects of vaccination, which they feared an infant is too weak to withstand ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Limaye 2020 ). Many parents pointed to the side effects or adverse reactions that sometimes occur with vaccination as evidence of this overwhelming effect ( Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). In certain instances, this view underpinned parents’ decision to delay or postpone vaccination for when their child was older and their immune system supposedly stronger: “I’ll revisit \\[vaccination\\] with him when he gets older… his body will be bigger, his immune system will be stronger then” ( Brunson 2013 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【278】Many parents who were concerned about the overwhelming effects of vaccination on infants were particularly uneasy about the combined vaccines, such as the triple MMR vaccination, or vaccination schedules requiring multiple vaccines simultaneously ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). They queried whether infants have the capacity to handle combined or multiple vaccines, commonly describing these as “excessive” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK, participant quote), “too much at one go” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote), an “unnecessary overload into such a young body” ( Smith 2017 , UK, participant quote), or as one parent recounted her reaction to her doctor’s suggestion that her baby be given six vaccines in one day: “I was like, ‘my child is eighteen pounds and you’re gonna give her six shots today?’ I said, ‘No. No. We’re not doing that’” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote). These concerns underpinned some parents’ decision to develop their own, more evenly spaced‐out immunisation schedules or to seek out separate injections, not necessarily available as part of state‐funded, routine immunisation programmes ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ).\n\n【279】In contrast, the findings from studies in multiple African countries (Gambia, Guinea, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso, and Ethiopia) ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ), and a study in India ( Bisht 2000 ), suggest that the common understanding of the fragility of infants contributed to enhancing many parents’ acceptance of vaccination. Various authors of these studies stated that, in many West African ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ), and South Asian countries ( Bisht 2000 ), there is a common belief that injections, including vaccines, are powerful substances which go directly into the blood and play multiple positive roles: preventative, strength‐building, and curative. This perception is clearly conveyed by one parent’s description that, “Vaccines build up the strength, like Ravita's \\[her daughter\\] cough was cured after she was given the injection \\[vaccine\\]” ( Bisht 2000 , India, participant quote). Further, the authors of these studies suggest that many parents in various West African and South Asian countries also frequently understand the side effects or adverse reactions that sometimes occur with vaccination as signs of the effectiveness of vaccines in the body ( Bisht 2000 ; Millimouno 2006 ; McKnight 2014 ). As this quote from a parent in Guinea aptly illustrates, “The reactions felt by the infant after vaccination are normal. They show that this is eliminating the illnesses found in the body” ( Leach 2007 , Gambia, participant quote).\n\n【280】Many parents in these studies in Africa and India therefore had understandings of vaccines that did not neatly align with biomedical notions of immunity and vaccination. Yet their acceptance of vaccination appeared to relate to the congruency between their own understanding of vaccination and what it does, and their own understanding of infants and what they need. As such, many parents in these settings strongly accepted vaccination, and incorporated it amongst the range of other practices they employed for protecting and promoting child strength and well‐being ( Bisht 2000 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). This is evident in the following description given by a parent from Guinea: “He received his first vaccination the day after his birth. To protect him against wind and illness, his father bought him clothes as a means of protection, and we tied a string to his right hand to stop him getting thin, because he was very fat. When a child is born we tie this string, made with Koranic writing, because when certain people praise the baby, he can start to have health problems” ( Leach 2007 , Guinea, participant quote).\n\n【281】###### Finding 3: primacy of ‘nature’ and ‘the natural’. Some parents, predominantly from HICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their understanding of health and illness as holistic or naturalistic. This understanding conceives many biomedical interventions, including vaccination, as unnatural intrusions that are unnecessary or harmful. Various parents who held this view also engaged in certain ‘natural’ health‐promoting activities or “salutogenic parenting”, which for them further negated the need for vaccination (high confidence).\n\n【282】Some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their understandings of health and illness, variably labelled by study authors as “holistic” ( Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017 ), “natural” ( Barbieri 2017 ), “naturalistic” ( Poltorak 2005 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Reich 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), “homeopathic” ( Rogers 1995 ), or “alternative” ( Dube 2016 ). As described by the authors of these studies, this understanding of health and illness posits that the body generally and the immune system more specifically are ‘naturally’ robust and balanced. From this perspective, many biomedical interventions, including vaccination, are seen as unnatural or artificial intrusions, ultimately compromising the body’s natural equilibrium and innate capabilities to prevent or cure diseases. Therefore, people who hold this view often have a strong preference for ‘natural’ health interventions over what they see as chemical or technologically‐mediated health interventions. Some study authors suggested that this view of health and illness is potentially more pervasive amongst parents from higher socioeconomic groups ( Rogers 1995 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), although the findings from other studies suggest that these views may occur across socioeconomic divides within HICs ( Casiday 2007 ; Brownlie 2005 ).\n\n【283】Parents holding this view of health and illness expressed a variety of interrelated concerns about vaccination. Some concerns centred around what was seen as the ‘artificial immunity’ granted by vaccines. Natural immunity – that is, immunity from diseases – was viewed by many of these parents as essential for the development of a child’s immune system, and also superior to the immunity conferred by vaccines ( Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ): “To develop the immune system you need to have certain diseases and afterwards, you’re stronger and you develop antibodies” ( Dube 2016 , Canada, participant quote). Some parents suggested that vaccines could also harm the immune system, or undermine the body’s natural immune capabilities ( Poltorak 2005 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Carrion 2018 ). Other concerns related to what were perceived as the chemicals, preservatives, and adjuvants within vaccines, and the potentially toxic and harmful effect of these ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ): “Aluminum, mercury, I don’t want to pollute my child’s body with that… I think the body reacts better to diseases if it is clean” ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 , France, participant quote). As implied by this parent and suggested by various study authors ( Poltorak 2005 ; Reich 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), many parents who were worried about the toxicity of vaccines were particularly apprehensive about those containing aluminium or mercury.\n\n【284】An additional trepidation expressed by parents concerned what was seen as the ‘unnatural’ way injectable vaccines enter the body, a mode of absorption which was described as different to the route that viruses or bacteria antigens enter the body ( Rogers 1995 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ): “If you inject something into the blood stream it doesn't go through the normal sort of defense mechanisms of the body” ( Rogers 1995 , UK, participant quote). Some study authors found that this concern underpinned parents’ rejection of injectable vaccines, but acceptance of oral vaccines ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ).\n\n【285】Many parents who expressed a ‘holistic’ view of health and illness also described engaging in a range of ‘natural’ health‐promoting and immune‐boosting activities ( Rogers 1995 ; Reich 2016 ), or what study authors referred to as “salutogenic parenting” ( Ward 2017 ), or “labour‐intensive parenting practices” ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). These activities included, for example, reducing exposure to environmental chemicals and toxins (e.g. living ‘off the grid’; eating organic or home‐grown food, or both; avoiding plastics and cleaning products in the home), pursuing ‘alternative’ schooling, natural births, long‐term breastfeeding, and using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In addition to enhancing the natural immunity of their children and protecting them from illness, some parents believed these activities also negated or reduced the need for vaccination ( Rogers 1995 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). These beliefs are aptly depicted in the following comment made by a parent from Australia: “I grow vegetables and I have chickens I mean, I feed my children organic food, I cook everything from scratch. I don't give them processed food. We have no chemicals in the house. We don't drink fluoridated water, we drink rainwater which has been filtered. So why would I then go and put all those chemicals in my child?” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote).\n\n【286】###### Finding 4: individualised health, immunity, and vaccine‐response trajectories. Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a view that children possess unique bodies and immune systems, and therefore, individual vaccine needs and vulnerabilities. As such, these parents frequently assessed the risks and benefits of vaccines as they pertain to their specific child, rather than in general. If the risks were seen to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these parents tended to be less accepting of childhood vaccination (high confidence).\n\n【287】Studies from various HICs (USA, Canada, United Kingdom) found that numerous parents are of the view that children possess unique bodies and immune systems, and thus also individual vaccine needs and vulnerabilities ( Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). This finding also emerged in one study conducted in an LMIC: this belief was found to be commonplace amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups in a study conducted in São Paulo, Brazil ( Barbieri 2017 ). This idea of the individuality or particularity of each child meant that, for many parents, the risks and benefits of vaccination are not set values that can be meaningfully captured by population‐level data or generalised risk calculations. As proposed by this parent, and capturing the views of many other parents, “I think statistics are a bit meaningless from a ‘I want to protect my baby point of view’” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote). Rather, children were thought to possess unique vaccine needs and vulnerabilities that vary depending on their particular composition and socio‐familial circumstances. Consequently, and as articulated by the authors of one study, for many parents, vaccination benefits, risks, and safety tend to be situated within the individual, with these notions framed “not in general”, but “for my child” ( Poltorak 2005 ).\n\n【288】Thus, when deciding whether to vaccinate their child (or not), many parents “individualised” or “particularised” ( Poltorak 2005 ) the risks and benefits of vaccination for their individual child. This approach to vaccination was pertinently revealed in parents’ accounts of their vaccination decision‐making processes. Here, many parents described a meticulous process of considering the various strengths and weaknesses of their child which may make them more (or less) vulnerable to disease or to vaccination adverse effects ( Rogers 1995 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). Several characteristics were commonly considered in this regard, including a child’s current and past health status, their socio‐familial living circumstances, and the family’s health history and potential genetic predispositions. For example, when evaluating the appropriateness of a specific vaccine or vaccines in general, many parents described assessing their child’s health status, often taking into account aspects related to their birth, feeding and sleeping patterns, dietary intolerances, allergies, and current or past illnesses ( Rogers 1995 ; Casiday 2007 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). These factors were considered important for determining whether their child might be less resilient or of an especially weak constitution. For many parents, this additional fragility was perceived to reduce their capacity to handle vaccines and to increase their susceptibility to adverse vaccination outcomes. This underpinned some parents’ decision to avoid or delay vaccination until their child’s constitution had strengthened or a period of particular susceptibility had passed: “When he was small ‐ he was really small, he got pneumonia. Because he’d had pneumonia I didn’t want to give him the needle” ( Smith 2017 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【289】Another factor commonly considered by many parents when making a vaccination decision for their child was the health history and potential genetic predispositions of their family ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Reich 2016 ). A history of family conditions, such as allergies, digestive disorders, cancer, autism, and various other neurological or autoimmune problems, was identified by many parents as making vaccination particularly risky for their child: “I think if my husband’s family didn’t have this thing, my daughter’s uncle who we think has Crohn’s, if that wasn’t there then I’d be ‘fine, I’ll put her in for it’” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【290】An additional consideration for many parents was their socio‐familial living circumstances ( Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). For example, some parents considered whether they intended to send their child to nursery school, or whether, as a family, they plan to travel overseas a lot in the future – scenarios which they felt would enhance their child’s risk of contracting a vaccine‐preventable disease and thus increase their need for vaccination ( Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ).\n\n【291】Many parents were also of the view that a healthy living environment potentially reduces a child’s need for vaccination ( Poltorak 2005 ). Those parents who held a ‘holistic’ understanding of health and illness (see above, \"‘Primacy of ‘nature’ and ‘the natural’’), were particularly confident that the lifestyle their family leads mitigates disease risk and renders vaccination unnecessary for their child. This belief is illuminated by this parent’s explanation for why she decided not to vaccinate her daughter: “We also are very conscious about how she eats and how, you know, that she eats mostly organic food… I made all of her food at home the first—when she started solids—and so we try to keep her immune system strong in that sense as well” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【292】Many parents considered these different factors related to their child, their family, and their living circumstances simultaneously. The following narrative by one parent clearly captures the type of thought processes many parents conveyed in this regard: “My child suffers with severe eczema… therefore I did not want her to have MMR when her eczema is still so bad, and make it worse. My first child has always caught chest infections from colds plus doesn’t eat a varied diet. He is not particularly robust. We have a strong family history of very bad hay fever, eczema, asthma and food allergies” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【293】Depending on the individual risk‐benefit assessment made, parents may reject all vaccines, or design what the authors of one study described as a more “personalised approach to vaccination” ( Poltorak 2005 ). That is, they may develop delayed, slow, or alternative vaccine schedules for their child, choosing to have some vaccines which they consider beneficial and safe, against the illnesses which they believe require protection, at a time when they consider to be most appropriate ( Poltorak 2005 ; Reich 2016 ). Ultimately, they may seek to tailor the recommended vaccination schedule according to what they perceive as their child’s specific vaccination needs and vulnerabilities.\n\n【294】As these needs and vulnerabilities potentially change, so too do many parents’ risk assessments and associated vaccination decisions. As suggested by various study authors, parents’ individualised risk assessments are often not static or fixed, but change as personal, familial, or environmental factors change ( Rogers 1995 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ). Many parents explicitly highlighted the nonfinality of their vaccination decisions, and how they would reconsider their decision if and when circumstances change. As one parent put it, “I never am settling for what I’ve decided upon thus far… It’s not a decision that it’s just very black and white and once it’s made it’s made, it’s very fluid…” ( Brunson 2013 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【295】###### Finding 5: claiming parental expertise. Many parents from HICs held a view of themselves as experts of their child, possessing the best understanding of their child’s health strengths and vulnerabilities. They in turn considered themselves best placed to judge their child’s vaccination needs and risks (moderate confidence).\n\n【296】Studies from various HICs (USA, Australia, United Kingdom, France) found that another common perception amongst parents is a view of themselves as experts of their children ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). That is, many parents felt that they know their own children better than anyone else and have the best understanding of their children’s unique health strengths and vulnerabilities. One study author explicitly ascribed this view of parental expertise to two main factors: a sense of instinct or experiential intuition that parents perceive to come from being a parent, and the widespread information‐seeking activities that many parents described undertaking ( Reich 2016 ). Other studies corroborated this study author’s view on the reasons for this perception of parental expertise ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ).\n\n【297】In terms of the first factor, numerous parents spoke about the “gut feeling” or “instinct” ( Johnson 2014 , UK, participant quote), “intuition” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), or “mommy gut” ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote), that they have about their own children. Some study authors referred to this type of knowledge as “experiential expertise” ( Poltorak 2005 ), or as “maternal epistemology” ( Carrion 2018 ), which they defined as the knowledge which is gained and maintained from the daily observations and interactions of parents with their children, and which provides them with a sense of intimate knowledge about their children. This sense that parents have of themselves was encapsulated in the widespread remarks made by parents that “you know best” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), and “just go and follow your instincts in the end” ( Johnson 2014 , UK, participant quote), or as one parent articulated categorically, “It’s really gonna come down to your gut. You know what you know about your child, and weighing the risks and benefits in your own mind… you’re the only person who knows what you know” ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【298】The second factor underpinning parents' sense of themselves as experts of their children was the extensive information‐seeking activities that many described undertaking around health‐related issues, including vaccination ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ). Numerous parents reported investing tremendous amounts of energy into “doing their research” ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote), “reading widely” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote), and “gathering as much information as we could” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), to proactively inform themselves about vaccination. As one parent put it: “It was a long, drawn out process. I mean we went back and forth… we made worksheets and we read books and went to workshops and brought back information” ( Brunson 2013 , USA, participant quote). Like this parent, numerous parents highlighted consulting many and varied forms of information from different sources so they could obtain multiple perspectives ( Petts 2004 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Sobo 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). Several parents also described questioning and being critical of all the sources of vaccination information they consulted, and particularly the internet and social media ( Petts 2004 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). Indeed, the internet and social media were portrayed by some parents as “sensationalism”, creating “hype”, and “blowing risks out of proportion” ( Petts 2004 , UK, participant quotes). Many parents explained that these sources need to be viewed with considerable caution as “anybody could put anything on the Internet” ( Casiday 2007 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【299】Therefore, and as suggested by various study authors, many parents engaged “reflexively rather than passively” with regards to vaccination information ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), or as the authors of another study put it, “\\[w\\]hile the media are identified as important sources of information, there is no evidence to suggest that parents passively receive and act upon such risk messages” ( Petts 2004 ). Some parents even recounted in detail the strategies they undertook to filter and critically appraise the information they consulted ( Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). One parent from a study in France typifies the type of narrative many parents provided regarding the processes they undertake to assess the validity of information: “The internet I cross‐check and I make sure that info A is not a copy‐paste of info B and vice versa… because often if I’ve seen it on many sites… if you look it’s the same original info that’s spread, that people pick up from one another… and I try to have several really different sources” ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 , France, participant quote).\n\n【300】The studies revealed inconsistent (refutational) findings around how parents experience this process of seeking information about vaccination and consulting multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of information. Some studies found that it created anxiety and confusion for many parents ( Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017 ). In contrast, one study found that parents highly enjoyed their information‐seeking activities and actually celebrated the varied perspectives they came across, or what the study authors referred to as “valorised multivocality” ( Sobo 2016 ). This study found that these parents purposively sought out diverse or conflicting opinions, and were suspect of anyone who held one‐sided views. We did not identify any obvious methodological or theoretical explanations for these different findings. We interpreted it to mean that parents' experiences of seeking information about vaccination and consulting numerous sources of information vary.\n\n【301】However, what did appear to be common amongst parents across these studies was the value and importance placed on seeking widespread information about vaccination, even if it may cause anxiety or confusion. Many parents understood educating yourself about health‐related issues, including vaccination, as a sign of good parenting and evidence of one’s commitment to one’s children ( Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ). This emerged most pertinently in the vaccination advice so many parents reported giving (or would give) to other parents, where it was very common for parents to make remarks such as: “I would say… just do your research” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote), and that “\\[m\\]y only piece of advice would be just to do as much reading and research” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), or as one parent explained, “I think as long as you research, and you are making an informed decision, then whatever decision you’re making is the right one whether you vaccinate or not” ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote). As noted by the author of this study, for this parent, like many others, a ‘right’ vaccination decision was determined by the process used to produce it (rather than the outcome), and whether it was underpinned by a thorough process of information seeking ( Carrion 2018 ).\n\n【302】###### Finding 6: personal choice and responsibility. Many parents, predominantly from HICs, perceived healthcare decision‐making, including vaccination, to be a matter of personal responsibility and choice. In cases where the risks of a vaccine or vaccination in general were thought to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these values of personal responsibility and choice were often prioritised over collective responsibility. These parents in turn tended to be less accepting of vaccination for their children (high confidence).\n\n【303】Another common perception amongst parents in various HICs (USA, United Kingdom, Australia) was that health‐related decisions, including those pertaining to vaccination, are matters of personal choice ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ). This finding also emerged in one study conducted in an LMIC: this perception was found to be commonplace amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups in a study conducted in São Paulo, Brazil ( Barbieri 2017 ). Parents’ accounts about vaccination in these studies were replete with discourses relating to personal choice and the right to choose. As one parent unambiguously stated with regards to the advice she would give to a friend about vaccination, “I would tell her… to really know that it is her baby and it’s her choice. It is not her doctor’s choice, it is not her mom’s choice, it’s not her neighbour’s choice, and it is not her school’s choice ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【304】As suggested by the authors of one study ( Poltorak 2005 ), and supported by the findings of other studies ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ), the importance attributed to personal choice in vaccination decision‐making was closely linked, and in some cases predicated upon, a strong sense of personal responsibility that many parents expressed with regards to their child. Numerous parents saw themselves as personally responsible for their children’s health and healthcare decision‐making, holding themselves individually accountable for their health outcomes ( Rogers 1995 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Johnson 2014 ). The sense of self‐blame many parents conveyed with regards to making the wrong health‐related choices for their children was palpable. Vaccination choices were no exception, as manifest in recurring statements such as: “I couldn’t forgive myself if my child became autistic” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK, participant quote), “ultimately I would be responsible” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), “you could only blame yourself really” ( Petts 2004 , UK, participant quote), or as one parent lamented, “\\[a\\]lthough it might be a very, very small percentage risk, it’s your child and if it gets that, you have to deal with that for the rest of your life, I mean would you ever forgive yourself? To feel that you were responsible and that you could have prevented that” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【305】Making the right health‐related choices and taking responsibility thus materialised in the studies as a sign of good parenting and a moral imperative for countless parents. Many studies found that this strong sense of personal responsibility around vaccination decisions also took precedence over societal considerations for many parents ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Reich 2016 ). That is, while most parents understood claims of social or collective responsibility with regards to vaccination, for many, this was of lesser importance than their sense of individual responsibility to protect their own child. When justifying their vaccination decisions, many parents stated unequivocally how “\\[i\\]t’s solely, I just want what’s best for my children” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote), or “I am not prepared to risk my child’s health” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK, participant quote), or as one parent confessed, “I did think about benefits to other children but it was very much secondary to what was best for Molly” ( Petts 2004 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【306】##### Theme 2: social communities and networks\n\n【307】For many parents, their vaccination ideas and practices, and the social networks in which they are embedded, exist in a potentially mutually reinforcing relationship, both shaping and being shaped by each other ( Leach 2007 ).\n\n【308】###### Finding 7: social networks shape vaccination ideas and practices. Parents vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups, were influenced by the vaccination views and experiences of their social networks. These networks included relatives, peers, neighbours, and additional significant others in the community. However, the views and practices of other parents, and particularly other mothers, were especially influential (high confidence).\n\n【309】Studies across diverse countries, contexts, and populations demonstrated how parents’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination were shaped by the vaccination views and practices of the social networks in which they reside ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Ruijs 2012 ; Brunson 2013 ; Varghese 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). Even parents in the studies that talked about vaccination as a matter of individual responsibility and choice revealed in their narratives the social situatedness of both this conceptualisation and their vaccination decisions. As the authors of one study suggested ( Leach 2007 ), and supported by other authors ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), “a sense of individual responsibility does not suggest that people are simply thinking and acting as atomised individuals; rather, it goes along with the forging of social relations and forms of community”.\n\n【310】The studies revealed that when parents make decisions about vaccination, together with other issues regarding child health and health care, they do so as members of societies and communities. Health and health care are topical issues that frequently generate much discussion in social settings: parents interact and talk with members of their community, they share their personal opinions and experiences, they exchange advice, and they learn from each other ( Leach 2007 ). While community members include relatives, peers, neighbours, and other significant members of the community,  across numerous studies, other parents emerged as particularly influential.\n\n【311】Several parents described the interactions they have with other parents as especially valuable and helpful ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Johnson 2014 ; Dube 2016 ). Numerous parents spoke about how “I talk a lot to other mothers” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK, participant quote), and “\\[i\\]t is the experiences of my friends, my close friends that also have children” ( Dube 2016 , Canada, participant quote), or as one mother succinctly put it, “certainly people do talk to health professionals… but I think most people talk to other mums” ( Petts 2004 , UK, participant quote). As reflected in these excerpts, many parents also suggested the gendered nature of the sociality of vaccination decision‐making. That is, in many settings, mothers were revealed to be the primary vaccination decision‐maker for their children, and therefore the interactions between particularly female relatives, peers, neighbours, and community members emerged as especially strong in shaping vaccination decisions ( Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ).\n\n【312】Various studies revealed how, in many social situations and communities, vaccination is a valued and legitimate social practice, or what study authors referred to as the “social normalisation of vaccination” ( Petts 2004 ), or a “culture of immunisation” ( Barbieri 2017 ). Consequently, vaccination for many parents in these situations may be an automatic or habitual practice that generates little deliberation. Several parents revealed this element of routinisation in relation to childhood vaccination; a sense that this is just what all parents do ( Brownlie 2005 ; Brunson 2013 ; Varghese 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ). Many described their acceptance of vaccination from an ‘everyone does it’ point of view, as exemplified by this parent's explanation: “I think what it still boils down to that’s just what’s expected of you … it’s a society thing isn’t it? This is when your child has these things so you do it” ( Johnson 2014 , UK, participant quote). Many other parents shared this parent’s view, providing similar accounts of how “\\[i\\]t’s the first time I’ve thought about it ( Barbieri 2017 , Brazil, participant quote), or that “I hadn’t really given it huge amount of thought” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote), and that it was a foregone conclusion to “just turn up and get it done” ( Petts 2004 , UK, participant quote). For other parents, a ‘culture of vaccination’ made it a practice that was difficult to evade, as it would entail potential stigmatisation and condemnation from others ( Brownlie 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Varghese 2013 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). This was starkly illustrated in a study from Burkina Faso, where a parent provided an impassioned description of the social pressures of vaccination: “When they tell you to come out \\[to vaccinate your child\\] one day and everybody comes out… you can’t refuse!” ( Giles‐Vernick 2016 , Burkina Faso, participant quote).\n\n【313】However, in other situations and communities, vaccination hesitancy or nonacceptance is a socially desirable stance; a norm imbued with high social value. In these situations, various parents explained how their decision not to vaccinate their children was just following that tradition ( Ruijs 2012 ; Brunson 2013 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). One parent clearly articulated this view when she explained why she had delayed vaccinations for her two sons who were born in Santa Cruz, California: “Santa Cruz is very much a hippie area… So very much I was indoctrinated into the hippie ways when my kids were born… and there’s no other way to be in Santa Cruz… if you tried to bottle feed in public in Santa Cruz you would get the filthiest looks on the planet” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote).\n\n【314】Similarly, parents in one study highlighted how they started questioning vaccination when they found themselves in a new social group or setting in which nonacceptance of vaccination was highly valued ( Ward 2017 ). The authors of this study found that this change in sentiment facilitated these parents’ integration and sense of belonging within their new social circumstances. Many parents also described the difficulties they faced going against the social norm of vaccination nonacceptance. They spoke about the blame and ostracism they had experienced (or would experience) if they vaccinated their child in such settings. This view is clearly reflected in the following statement from a parent in India: “Nobody here is too keen about injections. It is difficult for me to take initiative… I am in favour of this \\[vaccination\\]. But if I decide alone and take the child for vaccination and after that if the child develops even a cold, all blame will be on me” ( Varghese 2013 , India, participant quote).\n\n【315】Therefore, the social networks in which parents resided constituted a powerful force, influencing the vaccination views they held and the actions they were willing or unwilling to take. Various study authors attempted to explain how and why this is the case, similarly suggesting that it may relate to the manner in which views about vaccination – whichever stance is taken – form an integral part of parents’ identification processes ( Brunson 2013 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). That is, and as articulated by the authors of one study, the practice of vaccination is “an act of identification ‐ of opting in ‐ of proclaiming ‘I belong’ and ‘I share your values’” ( Sobo 2016 ). In other words, through their vaccination views and practices, parents proclaim their affiliation or social communion with particular communities and associated in‐group norms and values. These authors go on to suggest how, in circumstances when nonacceptance of vaccination or vaccination hesitancy is a social norm, the “opting out” of vaccination can be understood as a “positively prosocial act” of accepting or “opting in” to the values, identities, and lifestyles of a particular community. Conformity to the norms, values, and lifestyles of a social group can be very rewarding for individuals, whereas noncompliance can have negative consequences. As one study shows, drawing on sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of capital ( Bourdieu 1977 ; Bourdieu 1984 ), vaccination and nonvaccination, like many other social practices (eating, food, school choices, birth practices, etc.) are ascribed high value or ‘symbolic capital’ within different communities and settings ( Ward 2017 ). Enactment of practices with high symbolic capital promoted social inclusion for parents and a sense of belonging. However, enacting practices of low value or ‘symbolic capital’ strained social relations and contributed to social exclusion and ostracism for many parents.\n\n【316】###### Finding 8: vaccination ideas and practices shape social networks. Parents' vaccination views and practices also shaped their social networks. Shared vaccination ideas and practices were a powerful force in building social relations and ties. While this phenomenon occurred amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes, it may be particularly significant for parents who are less accepting of vaccination. In these cases, parents may be afforded access to various types of social resources, in turn potentially reinforcing both their group affiliation and their vaccination views and practices (moderate confidence).\n\n【317】Various studies demonstrated how, at the same time that parents’ social networks influenced their vaccination ideas and practices, through these ideas and practices social networks were also being forged, consolidated, or reinforced ( Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). In other words, and as articulated by the authors of one study, vaccination views and practices were also implicated in the making of different types of kinships and collectivities ( Leach 2007 ).\n\n【318】Through shared vaccination ideas and practices, parents were able to forge new social relations, or to affirm or strengthen existing ones. For example, authors of one study in the United Kingdom found that the sharing of similar views around the MMR vaccination provided a “common camaraderie among mothers”, the “fomenting of relationships with other mothers”, and the “affirming of a new and growing identity as mother” ( Poltorak 2005 ). Similar conclusions were drawn from authors of studies in the USA ( Reich 2016 ), Australia ( Ward 2017 ), Gambia ( Leach 2007 ), and Guinea ( Millimouno 2006 ), where they found that collective mobilisation around vaccine choices and potential dilemmas enabled parents to develop a sense of community amongst themselves, or as the authors of one study put it, to “reinforce kin and friendship ties” and “contribute to and reinforce a valued local community of mothers” ( Leach 2007 ).\n\n【319】This building of communities through shared vaccination ideas and practices was found to occur amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes ‐ those who accepted vaccination, those who were hesitant towards vaccination, and those who refused vaccination ( Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ). However, two studies suggested that this phenomenon, and its consequences, are particularly significant for parents who are less accepting of vaccination ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). In these cases, the social networks parents acquire through their vaccination ideas and practices frequently provide various types of resources or ‘social capital’ for these parents. For example, they may be afforded with validation for their vaccination choices, further information and support, and acceptance from ‘like‐minded’ others who are often similarly on the fringe of mainstream society ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). As one vaccine‐hesistant parent described, “I feel like in certain circles, I'm kind of an oddball. I try to surround myself with people that are like‐minded because then you feel—it makes you feel more relaxed or like you fit in a little bit more” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote). Similarly, another parent who had refused vaccination for her children explained how she had developed a “community of other mothers” who all had similar views about vaccination, and how “I guess I’m surrounded by a cohort of people now who are very similar, so I guess we support each other in that way” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote). As suggested by the authors of these two studies, this social capital may serve as a buffer against the disapproval parents who are less accepting of vaccination frequently receive from more mainstream society regarding their vaccination choices. At the same time, through such processes, both parents’ affiliations with particular social networks and their vaccination views and practices are potentially further maintained and mutually reinforced ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ).\n\n【320】##### Theme 3: political events, relations, and processes\n\n【321】Parents' ideas and practices regarding childhood vaccination may be influenced by, and sometimes enmeshed with, wider political issues and concerns. As aptly summed up by the authors of one study, “\\[v\\]accination is at one and the same time a microtechnological and macro‐political experience” ( Leach 2007 ). These macro‐political issues may range from broader state structures and governmental processes, to global institutions and relations, to ethnic or religious interactions, to economic orders, to the political economy of science. Parental vaccination views and practices are sometimes a means to oppose these wider political processes, relations, and orders.\n\n【322】###### Finding 9: distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination. Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to a lack of, or breakdown in, trust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination ‐ most particularly, government, the pharmaceutical industry, and science. The reasons for this distrust were complex and contextually situated, embedded in political events, relations, and processes within specific times and places (moderate confidence).\n\n【323】The notion of distrust emerged across numerous studies as a particularly pervasive concept for understanding the role that wider political concerns play in shaping some parents' ideas and practices regarding childhood vaccination ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Varghese 2013 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). That is, a lack of, or breakdown in, trust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination ‐ most particularly, government, the pharmaceutical industry, and science ‐ materialised strongly in parents’ vaccination discourses. We found that the reasons for such distrust were complex and varied, but could usefully be divided into four main subthemes: 1) generalised decline in trust of authority and expert systems; 2) agendas and interests underpinning the expert systems implicated with vaccination; 3) current and past controversies; and 4) marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment.\n\n【324】The authors of one study, however, provide a divergent perspective ( Leach 2007 ). These authors question whether distrust is a helpful or appropriate concept for understanding the political dimensions of vaccination acceptance. They are critical of the vague and highly generalised ways in which the term is frequently used, which they suggest conceals the intricacies of particular political events, relations, and processes of which a so‐called breakdown in trust is a part. More than these issues, however, they argue that the concept of distrust, even when disaggregated and contextualised, may actually obscure more than it reveals. As they explain, “\\[in\\] our analyses of vaccination practices…the notion of trust rarely proved helpful. When we used it, on reflection, it is rather as our informants did: as a convenient shorthand to express a more complex, embedded set of meanings that it was perhaps not the moment to articulate in full” ( Leach 2007 ).\n\n【325】Taking heed of their critique, in our description of the political issues at play, we have therefore attempted to move away from what these authors refer to as the “shorthand, universalising qualities” of the concept of distrust, to explaining why trusting relations between parents and institutions in all their “rich diversity and texture” might break down ( Leach 2007 ). Various concepts that these authors propose as alternatives to 'trust' are incorporated in other sections of this review (see, for example, ‘Finding 16: vaccination as a social event’ and ‘Finding 17: interactions with frontline healthcare workers’).\n\n【326】###### Finding 10: generalised decline in trust of authority and expert systems. For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination may be part and parcel of a more generalised contemporary trend of decreasing trust in authorities and expert systems (low confidence).\n\n【327】Various studies (from the United Kingdom and Australia) attributed some parents' distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination to a more generalised decline in trust in authorities and expert systems ( Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017 ). Various parents in these studies, whether explicitly or by implication, assigned their nonacceptance of, or hesitancy towards, vaccination to their more general feelings of distrust towards government and what it promotes. This was clearly reflected in comments made by parents, such as “I don’t trust like I used to”, and “all governments have lost credibility nobody believes them anymore” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote), or in the words of one parent, “\\[i\\]ntrinsically we don't trust them \\[Government\\]. Whoever they are, whatever party, there's always a suspicion” ( Casiday 2007 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【328】One study, however, explicitly refuted this finding ( Poltorak 2005 ). The authors of this study rejected the notion of a deepening decline of trust more generally, suggesting that it is a simplistic and misleading linear interpretation of history that presumes, naively, that trust existed previously, and is only breaking down more recently. The data from their study suggested that levels of distrust in authorities, and associated impact on vaccination, ebb and flow dynamically over time and in relation to specific social and political contexts of the day.\n\n【329】###### Finding 11: agendas and interests underpinning the expert systems implicated with vaccination. For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their concerns about the agendas or interests embedded in these systems. Many of these parents were particularly concerned about the economic interests of these systems, and especially the economic interests of the pharmaceutical industry, which they perceived to be negatively influencing vaccination programmes (moderate confidence).\n\n【330】Studies in various countries (Australia, USA, United Kingdom, Canada, France, India, Central African Republic) found that many parents had concerns about the socio‐political agendas or interests embedded in vaccination programmes. Many of these parents were particularly concerned with what they perceived as the financial interests underpinning vaccination programmes, which in turn led them to question the motivations of those promoting vaccination ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Varghese 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ).\n\n【331】For example, parents in various studies in Britain mentioned the targeted payment scheme, introduced in the country in the 1990s, whereby doctors were paid according to the percentage of their patients who were fully immunised ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Carrion 2018 ). Many parents described how this scheme caused them to question the advice and information provided by healthcare providers, as they felt their impartiality could be compromised by such incentives: “What I was really concerned about was that they were in no position to have an unbiased view because they are paid a lump sum and they have to get a percentage of children vaccinated… She couldn’t possibly be objective about it” ( Rogers 1995 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【332】For many parents, most particularly those from HICs, their concerns about the economic interests of the expert systems promoting vaccination specifically centred on the pharmaceutical industry ( Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ). Countless parents in these countries perceived the pharmaceutical industry and its profit motive to be a major force behind vaccination programmes: “Some of the reasons for my reticence toward vaccination come from the fact that vaccines are produced by drug companies that have yes, interest in health but, above all, commercial interests” ( Dube 2016 , Canada, participant quote). Many parents perceived these commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies to be tainting vaccination systems, including biasing the systems of research, the intentions of health professionals, and the procedures of government. For example, several parents were suspicious of vaccination research, suggesting that studies on vaccines are frequently funded by pharmaceutical companies which are likely to skew or conceal results about risks and inefficacies ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). Illustrating these concerns, one parent explained, “It’s biased because it was paid‐for studies. They’ll take the numbers and twist them” ( Reich 2016 , USA, participant quote). Various parents also perceived the profit motives of pharmaceutical companies to be tainting the intentions of health professionals ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ). For example, they alluded to pharmaceutical companies paying doctors to promote vaccines at conferences or subsidising their medical training which, according to this parent and others, ultimately means that “\\[d\\]octors just do what they’re told by the pharmaceutical companies” ( Carrion 2018 , USA, participant quote). Finally, some parents thought that pharmaceutical companies also cast a shadow over the procedures of government, or as one parent put it, “I feel like the pharmaceutical company is getting…a huge say in…how the government chooses to go with those things” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote).\n\n【333】###### Finding 12: current and past controversies. Some parents' distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to particular ‘scandals’ or ‘controversies’ related to vaccination specifically or health‐related issues more broadly. The occurrence of such scandals, and the manner in which they were perceived to have been handled, caused some parents to feel misled by authorities and to question their legitimacy in protecting the public’s health (low confidence).\n\n【334】Some parents’ mistrust in the institutions implicated in vaccination may be linked to particular ‘scandals’ or ‘controversies’ related to vaccination specifically or health‐related issues more broadly. The occurrence of such scandals, and the manner in which they are perceived to have been handled, may cause people to feel misled by government or biomedicine, or both, and to question the legitimacy of these institutions in protecting the public’s health ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ). Moreover, and as described by various study authors ( Brownlie 2005 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ), health‐related controversies and how they are interpreted do not take place in a vacuum but occur within particular political contexts and historical moments, and are therefore also shaped by these. Health‐related scandals may therefore produce or exacerbate suspicion of government and scientific institutions, suspicions which may spill over into views and practices regarding vaccination. These issues were demonstrated in various studies in different countries (Britain, India and Nigeria) with diverse political contexts ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ).\n\n【335】For example, several parents in Britain explicitly mentioned various current and past health‐related controversies as contributing to their hesitancy towards vaccination ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ). One commonly‐cited event was the Wakefield measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) controversy, which involved the publication of a now‐retracted research paper in _The Lancet_ in 1998 which linked the combined MMR vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders. Many parents spoke about this controversy, and specially about what they perceived as the British government’s mishandling of it, including what they saw as a defensive and heavy‐handed approach taken ( Casiday 2007 ), how the issue was politicised by some Members of Parliament ( Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ), and the fact that the Prime Minister at the time refused to say whether his son had received the MMR vaccine ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ). According to the authors of all these studies, the view that the British government had mismanaged the controversy seriously undermined many parents' confidence in governmental pronouncements that the MMR vaccine was safe, both at the time of the controversy and for some time afterwards ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ).\n\n【336】Many parents in Britain described the MMR vaccine controversy as just one of various health‐related controversies which they felt had been mismanaged by government and which contributed to their distrust of government. Parents cited, for example, the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) controversy, and the debates over genetically‐modified foods, as other incidents where they felt the government had lied to the public and pushed a dubious or hidden agenda ( Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ). The effect of these controversies was aptly summed up by one parent who concluded, “Because of their history of government mismanagement of public health issues in this country I think a lot of people are very, very suspicious when the government says 'oh there's nothing to worry about, don't you worry” ( Casiday 2007 , UK, participant quote).\n\n【337】One study in Britain refuted these findings, with very few parents in this study mentioning these types of controversies as influencing their trust in the government and vaccination, and several parents even actively denying any link when asked directly ( Poltorak 2005 ). The authors of this study themselves reported surprise at this finding, given the findings from other studies in the country. They interpreted this refutation as potentially related to the fact that trust (or a lack thereof) in government may be less relevant than the issue of parents’ personal confidence in their own decision‐making processes. That is, the value of personal choice and responsibility for some parents in Britain almost implicitly assumes, and takes into account, governmental fallibility. As the study authors note, “\\[p\\]eople’s contemporary anxieties about state‐led technocracies reflect the emergence of individuated perspectives and political philosophies surrounding health, lifestyle and choice that are rooted far more deeply than are a few instances of government reputational damage” ( Poltorak 2005 ).\n\n【338】Other pertinent examples of the role health scandals may play in fuelling mistrust in authorities and, in turn, vaccination, are the controversial Trovan clinical drug trial and state boycott of the polio vaccine that both took place in Northern Nigeria. As outlined in a study conducted in Northern Nigeria which explored parents’ perceptions of the Polio Eradication Initiative, the Trovan controversy involved a Pfizer‐organised clinical trial of the antibiotic Trovan in Kano State in the north during the 1996 cerebrospinal meningitis epidemic in the country ( Renne 2010 ). Several children died during the trial, and a lawsuit was filed against Pfizer for failing to fully inform participants of the risks, for ‘low‐dosing the control drug’, and for withholding the fact that approved treatment for meningitis was available. The study found that this incident, and what the author describes as the government’s failure to properly oversee it, was mentioned by numerous parents. Many of these parents attributed their suspicions of polio immunisation to this incident, which for them, served as evidence that both Western pharmaceutical companies and local government cannot be trusted. Many parents in this study also spoke about the 2003/2004 polio vaccine boycott, whereby various political and religious leaders questioned the safety of the oral polio vaccine, which led to the boycott of polio immunisation campaigns in five states in Northern Nigeria. According to the author of this study, although the ban was eventually lifted, its impact lingered within communities, who continued to question the safety of polio immunisation and the agendas of vaccination programmes more generally ( Renne 2010 ).\n\n【339】The Trovan trial and polio vaccine boycott, and the impact they had on parents’ vaccination acceptance, need to be understood within the broader milieu in which they occurred. The Renne 2010 study showed in detail how Nigeria has a long and painful history of (medical) colonialism, North‐South religious and political tensions, as well as more recent postcolonial inequalities and top‐down global public health initiatives. As suggested by the study author, parents’ perceptions of these controversies and associated suspicions of vaccination are therefore embedded in these much wider relationships between global institutions, Nigerian federal and state institutions, and their citizens ( Renne 2010 ).\n\n【340】A final example of how particular health‐related controversies can produce and exacerbate mistrust in authorities, and the associated impact on vaccination views and practices, is the \"Family Planning Program\" of the 1970s in India. A study in India revealed how distrust of the government and resistance to polio vaccination amongst some Muslims was linked, at least in part, to historical fears pertaining to the controversial \"Family Planning Program\" of the 1970s which promoted sterilisation as a means of population control ( Hussain 2015 ). Various Muslim parents in this study believed that Muslims were specifically targeted for sterilisation during the program, and that polio vaccination was a continuation of this agenda. This is clearly illustrated by one Muslim parent’s characterisation of the Family Planning Program and polio immunisation: “Before they had done forced sterilisation, now the government is not doing this, but doing this through the polio program so that there can be no future generations…. That same program is repeating. It is happening in another guise. In another life” ( Hussain 2015 , India, participant quote). Like the abovementioned study in Nigeria, this study also revealed how perceptions of this controversy, and the impact it had on parents’ vaccination acceptance, were embroiled in the intricacies of a much wider political economy of ethnic, religious, and class relations and identities in India, both historical and contemporary (see 'Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment’ below for further details in this regard).\n\n【341】###### Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment. Some parents' distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their experiences of marginalisation, inadequate public services, or misalignment between their own priorities and those of the state. These experiences undermined trustful and benevolent state‐citizen relations, leading many parents to distrust government and government‐sponsored programs, including vaccination (moderate confidence).\n\n【342】Various studies revealed how some parents’ mistrust in the institutions implicated in vaccination, and their associated reduced acceptance of vaccination, are related to their experiences of marginalisation ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ; Smith 2017 ), or experiences of deficiencies in basic infrastructure and functioning public services ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ), or the neglect or sidelining of issues and concerns that they themselves prioritise ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ). Through all these experiences, people may lose confidence that those in power have their best interests at heart, increasingly questioning the real intentions of their actions and what they promote. Vaccination, often a major state‐run and freely‐available public health intervention, provides a fertile ground for such resentment to play out. These issues were demonstrated in studies amongst Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers in Britain ( Smith 2017 ), Muslim communities in India ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Hussain 2015 ), and in Nigeria ( Renne 2010 ).\n\n【343】For example, two studies in India explored the reasons for resistance to the polio eradication initiatives in the Uttar Pradesh state in the late 2000s ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Hussain 2015 ). Both studies found that, while resistance occurred within all sectors of society, it was disproportionately higher amongst the poorest Muslim communities. One study suggested that this was linked to the historically‐rooted social marginalisation many Muslims have experienced in India ( Hussain 2015 ). According to these authors, the legacy of colonialism, the Partition, and the rise of Hindu nationalism in the 1990s have rendered Muslims a sociological minority within Indian society and the victims of ethnic violence and socio‐political exclusion. Moreover, segregated, Muslim‐majority slums have suffered significant underdevelopment, characterised by weak basic public services, including healthcare services. The study authors found that this contributed to a sense of ‘otherness’ amongst many Muslims in India, widespread anger, and a deep‐seated mistrust of government and government‐sponsored programs, including vaccination ( Hussain 2015 ).\n\n【344】Numerous Muslim parents in both studies expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of basic services afforded to them ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Hussain 2015 ). Many questioned the benefits of the polio vaccination programme when, in their view, very little else had been provided for their advantage. Some conveyed resentment at what they perceived as the government’s failure to provide basic infrastructure, while compelling them to vaccinate. Many also expressed anger at what they perceived as a misalignment of their own priorities and those of the government. That is, some saw polio vaccination as the “government’s need… not mine” ( Chaturvedi 2009 , India, participant quote), ultimately taking priority over what they perceived as their more pressing needs, such as food, basic sanitation, employment, and other diseases, such as diarrhoeal illnesses and malaria. As one parent in Jeevangarh shouted, clearly expressing her frustration, “We have malaria here...I tell them not to come to my door... we are in so much misery... the children have diarrhea and you are forcing them to take this other medicine… If the child is sick make the child feel better first!” ( Hussain 2015 , India, participant quote).\n\n【345】Similar findings were revealed in a study from Northern Nigeria ( Renne 2010 ). This study showed how, during the 1990s, many Northern Nigerian states experienced a deterioration of public infrastructure due to a complex set of factors: political instability and neoliberal reforms emphasising a rolling‐back of the state and cost‐recovery for basic services. The author of the study argues that this has, in turn, undermined the benevolence of state‐citizen relations and fostered much public distrust of government. Many parents in this study mentioned distrust of the government as a major reason for rejecting the Polio Eradication Initiative. More specifically, they expressed suspicions of the motives of government, promoting a vaccine ostensibly offered for their benefit, when other services were notably neglected and underserviced. Several parents were also distrustful of the polio vaccine, which was given for free and vigorously promoted, when other vaccines and healthcare services often incurred costs and more effort to obtain: “We are looking for medicine in the hospital to give to our children and we can’t get it but this one \\[polio vaccine\\], they are following us to our houses to give it. I don’t trust this polio vaccine” ( Renne 2010 , Nigeria, participant quote). Many parents were also angered by the focus on polio, when, for them, other diseases, such as malaria, measles, and meningitis, were seen to pose much bigger threats to the lives of their children. As indicated by the study author, since the polio immunisation programme was not driven by their principal priorities and concerns, many parents experienced it as a top‐down initiative that therefore couldn’t be trusted ( Renne 2010 ).\n\n【346】The studies in both India ( Chaturvedi 2009 ; Hussain 2015 ), and Nigeria ( Renne 2010 ), revealed that nonacceptance of vaccination could be used as a mechanism for some parents to have their principal concerns and priorities addressed. For example, various parents in India agreed to vaccinate their children only if roads were built and other medical services provided ( Chaturvedi 2009 ). Similarly, the study in Nigeria reported that several parents had told healthcare workers that their acceptance of the polio vaccination for their children would be dependent on the government simultaneously providing them with other basic primary healthcare services ( Renne 2010 ). According to the study author, these demands were met with the implementation of Immunisation Plus Days in 2006 and 2007, a broader‐based public health initiative that provided polio vaccines together with other services such as vitamin A drops, deworming medicines, and drugs and bednets to protect against malaria. Many parents in the study expressed considerable support for this initiative, and an associated change in their views about polio vaccination, as clearly illuminated by this parent’s comment: “Really, it is a good thing they are doing… I will agree for the polio people to do polio for my child because I need the bednet” ( Renne 2010 , Nigeria, participant quote). In fact, the study found that, in a reversal of earlier rejection of vaccination, some parents actually took their children to receive multiple doses of the polio vaccine at different sites so they could get additional bednets. Demand was so great that vaccine supplies eventually ran out.\n\n【347】##### Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions\n\n【348】Parents' ideas and practices regarding childhood vaccination may be influenced by their access to and experiences of vaccination delivery institutions and their frontline healthcare workers. That is, there is a complex interplay between access‐supply and demand dimensions of vaccination or what the authors of one study termed “unfolding supply‐demand dynamics” ( Millimouno 2006 ). Across the studies, we identified four particular subthemes with regards to these dynamics: 1) socioeconomic challenges in accessing vaccination services; 2) undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics; 3) vaccination as a social event; and 4) interactions with frontline healthcare workers.\n\n【349】###### Finding 14: socioeconomic challenges in accessing vaccination services. Parents living in resource‐limited settings frequently face numerous socioeconomic challenges to accessing vaccination services, including practical questions of geography and transport, childcare constraints, and family economics and household work pressures. As a result of these challenges, some of these parents were less accepting of vaccination due to the time, effort, and opportunity costs that accessing vaccination involved (high confidence).\n\n【350】Studies within resource‐limited settings revealed how livelihood struggles can pose significant barriers to accessing vaccination services. Whilst parents in these contexts may hold a general belief in the value of vaccination for their children, socioeconomic challenges may reduce their acceptance of vaccination ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). These challenges may include practical questions of geography and transport, childcare constraints, and family economics and household work pressures. For example, parents in studies from multiple African countries (Gambia, Guinea, Ethiopia, Central African Republic, and Burkina Faso) spoke about the long distances they have to travel (up to 40 km in some localities), often by foot, to reach the nearest site where vaccination is provided ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). Similar findings emerged in a study amongst site‐dwelling Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in Britain ( Smith 2017 ). These parents frequently reside in geographically‐ and socially‐isolated locations, often poorly served by public transport and other services, which hindered their ability to access immunisation services. Many parents also highlighted the difficulties they experience finding someone to care for their other children or family members who cannot be left at home alone while they make the trip to the clinic ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ). Parents emphasised how taking their child for vaccination requires arranging for someone to look after these other family members or enduring the additional burden of bringing them along.\n\n【351】At the same time, many parents in these settings in Africa and Britain spoke at length about the constant, daily juggling of economic activities and domestic tasks that they have to undertake so as to keep their households afloat ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). As described by the authors of all these studies, vaccination constitutes one of the many basic priorities for these parents, and therefore needs to be fitted into an often already demanding daily schedule. They suggest that the day‐to‐day demands of living ultimately make taking time out for vaccinating a challenge for many of these parents, frequently resulting in a trade‐off with another activity that is of central importance for their survival. This balancing act was clearly captured by one parent from Bangui, Central African Republic, who explained, “My children haven’t gotten all of their vaccinations… I have to work every day at the market… If I don’t go to the market, my family won’t have any money. I know that I had to bring my children to receive their vaccinations. But I couldn’t do it” ( Giles‐Vernick 2016 , Central African Republic, participant quote). Numerous parents provided analogous accounts to this one, similarly attributing their avoidance or delay in vaccinating their children to the time, effort, and opportunity costs that vaccination involved for them.\n\n【352】###### Finding 15: undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics. Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics. These features, common to vaccination services within resource‐limited settings, included resource constraints that affect vaccine supply and costs, and health facility waiting times, and constraining organisational procedures (moderate confidence).\n\n【353】Studies in resource‐limited settings also revealed that some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics, even if they held a general belief in the value of vaccination for their children ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). Common undesirable features revealed by these studies included resource constraints that affect vaccine supply ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ), and organisational procedures that impact vaccination delivery ( Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ).\n\n【354】Healthcare facilities within resource‐limited settings are often plagued by financial constraints, resulting in poor health infrastructure, such as a lack of cold chain equipment, overcrowded facilities and long waiting times, vaccine shortages and stock‐outs, and informal charging for vaccination. All of these systemic issues may impact on parents’ views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). For example, it can be particularly frustrating for parents who have overcome the access challenges they face in getting to the clinic, only to find that there are no vaccines available. Many parents suggested that this could lead to their future nonattendance ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ). Moreover, according to various study authors, the financial constraints faced by many health facilities within low‐resource settings has resulted in some of these facilities charging, albeit informally, for vaccination services that are officially free to parents ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). The authors explained that, while this practice may be formally denounced, various facilities have found that this the only way to ensure a regular supply of vaccines ( Leach 2007 ), and stable incomes for healthcare workers within contexts of irregular payment of meagre salaries ( Dugas 2009 ). These studies revealed that, for many parents, especially those from the poorest families, these costs may be unaffordable and impede vaccination, as communicated by this parent from Kissidougou, Guinea: “I did not have the means to follow vaccination for my child ‐ for each vaccine one needs to hand over a sum of money. It is for lack of money that my child does not follow vaccination… It is not refusal” ( Leach 2007 , Guinea, participant quote).\n\n【355】In addition to resource constraints that affect vaccination delivery, the organisational procedures parents must follow in order to obtain vaccination may be perceived as undesirable, and constitute an additional deterrent to vaccination for some parents. In particular, studies in Guinea ( Leach 2007 ), Burkina Faso ( Dugas 2009 ), and Ethiopia ( McKnight 2014 ), found that many parents experienced the requirement that they have their vaccination booklet available at each vaccination session constraining and a potential hindrance to vaccination. As these studies showed, the vaccination booklet is meant to be a reference document that parents and healthcare workers can consult to keep track of a child’s vaccination status. However, many parents found it very difficult to keep the booklet safe and in a usable state. Yet, according to various parents in these studies, if they attend vaccination services without their child’s vaccination booklet or with a booklet in a poor condition, they may be refused vaccination ( Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ). Many parents also spoke about the sense of shame they experience if they lose their vaccination booklet or if they have to present it in a poor condition. Ultimately, parents may forego vaccination to prevent such refusal or shame ( Dugas 2009 ).\n\n【356】###### Finding 16: vaccination as a social event. Vaccination may be a social event where people gather and interact with each other. Some parents found this to be a positive experience, whereby they received affirmation about themselves and their children. This potentially motivated attendance at childhood vaccination services. For other parents, the social nature of vaccination services was a negative experience, whereby they felt judged by, disapproved of by, or alienated from others. This potentially demotivated attendance atchildhood vaccination services (low confidence).\n\n【357】Studies conducted in Gambia and Guinea revealed how vaccination services are social settings: places where people gather and interact with each other ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ). According to the authors of these studies, this ‘socialness’ of vaccination services can be a source of enjoyment and a valued social event for some. However, for others, it can be a place of worry and alienation. Both studies found that, in urban and peri‐urban settings in their respective countries, vaccination attendance at the clinic on the designated day is commonly a social occasion, an event where mothers and their children are ‘on show’ to others and where their status is often publicly displayed. As these studies revealed, this can be a very positive experience for some, with vaccination attendance serving as an occasion to show pride in one’s wealth and baby. For example, a young mother in peri‐urban Gambia recounted how, “I would find something suitable for my baby, I would also dress beautifully, put on matching shoes, take my bag and go to the clinic. As an adolescent, I loved to draw attention, and I did it ( Leach 2007 , Gambia, participant quote). Both studies revealed how experiences of vaccination services as a positive social event can be a powerful motivator for attendance of vaccination services.\n\n【358】However, as noted by the authors of both studies ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ), the socialness of vaccination services also places mothers and their children open to scrutiny, which for some can be a source of fear and marginalisation. Both studies found that poorer and less integrated mothers (such as immigrants or sex workers), and mothers with a thin or unwell baby, often fear the unwanted attention on themselves or their baby that vaccination attendance may potentially bring. Some of these mothers therefore avoided or delayed vaccination for their child in order to eschew judgement and disapproval from others. Both these studies also found that infant health facilities have become highly feminised spaces, attended by pregnant and postnatal women who are often accompanied by their mothers, female neighbours, and other female kin. According to the authors of both studies, this has resulted in many fathers feeling uncomfortable in these spaces, sometimes even delaying vaccination until the child’s mother or a female relative was available to take the child to the clinic.\n\n【359】###### Finding 17: interactions with frontline healthcare workers. Parents' vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups, were mediated by the face‐to‐face interactions or personal relations they have with frontline healthcare workers. Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to mistreatment from healthcare workers, and when they felt the vaccination information provided to them was simplistic and unbalanced. In contrast, some parents were more accepting of vaccination due to positively‐received engagements with healthcare workers, whereby they felt supported, listened to, and respected and whereby healthcare workers shared balanced information and personal stories about themselves as parents (high confidence).\n\n【360】Many parents experience vaccines and vaccination services through the face‐to‐face encounters they have with frontline healthcare workers. As demonstrated by various studies, these engagements can therefore play an important role in shaping how many parents assess expert claims about immunisation and think about vaccination ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020 ).\n\n【361】For some parents, the engagements they have with frontline healthcare workers are coloured by the broader, more macro‐level distrust they may have in the expert systems implicated in vaccination (see ‘Theme 3: political events, relations, and processes’) ( Brownlie 2005 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). As explained by the authors of one study, frontline workers may be seen as representatives of, or “access points” to, these more remote expert systems, and thus parents may distrust healthcare workers and what they promote by implication ( Ward 2017 ). However, what emerged across many studies was the influence of the quality of the actual face‐to‐face interactions or personal relations parents have with frontline healthcare workers ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020 ).\n\n【362】Various studies, across diverse contexts and populations, demonstrated how some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of mistreatment or poor communication from frontline healthcare workers ( Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ). For example, several parents from various African countries (Ethiopia, Guinea, Gambia, and Burkina Faso) reported that parents who miss vaccinations, come late, or have lost, forgotten, or failed to keep their vaccination booklet in a good condition are often blamed and condemned by healthcare workers and subjected to embarrassing, humiliating, or neglectful treatment ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ). For instance, parents described how healthcare workers commonly labelled parents as ‘defaulters’, shouted at or insulted them in front of other parents, sent them to the back of the queue, or ignored them. Lots of parents feared this mistreatment, or what the authors of one study conceptualised as “symbolic violence” ( McKnight 2014 ), and as a consequence, decided to forgo subsequent vaccination sessions if they had missed previously scheduled vaccinations, could not locate their vaccination booklet, or their booklet was in a poor condition ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ). As one parent painfully exclaimed, “The reason why we don’t take our children is the workers at the health centre don’t admit us if we have missed the date of the appointment. They insult us for being late. So we fear to go there for vaccination because they offended us” ( McKnight 2014 , Ethiopia, participant quote). Various study authors suggested that healthcare workers treat parents in this way because they erroneously attribute non‐ or delayed‐vaccination to ignorance or child neglect, failing to appreciate the socioeconomic struggles many parents face in negotiating clinic attendance ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ).\n\n【363】Mistreatment from healthcare workers, and how this can negatively impact on parents' vaccination acceptance, was similarly revealed in studies from HICs, including in the United Kingdom ( Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Smith 2017 ), and Australia ( Ward 2017 ). Parents in these studies described incidences with healthcare workers where they had raised their concerns, asked questions, or expressed their opinions about vaccination, and had in turn been “patronised or intimidated” ( Poltorak 2005 , UK participant quote), or responded to in ways they experienced as “disrespectful” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote), “rude and dismissive”, “condescending”, and “disempowering” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quotes). Other parents in these studies spoke about being “pressured” or “emotionally manipulated” into vaccinating their children by healthcare workers ( Casiday 2007 , UK, participant quotes). Many of these parents explicitly stated how this type of treatment led them to distrust their healthcare worker and the vaccination advice or information they provided, as clearly conveyed by this parent: “My GP… she was so rude and dismissive… each interaction like that erodes my trust further” ( Ward 2017 , Australia, participant quote).\n\n【364】Many parents’ descriptions of the negative interactions they have had with healthcare workers centred specifically on the way in which information about vaccination is communicated. Parents from a range of countries (USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and India) expressed frustration at what they perceived as the simplistic and unbalanced vaccination information provided to them by healthcare workers ( Casiday 2007 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ). Many parents indicated that healthcare providers only talk about the benefits of vaccination, remaining silent or defensive about the potential risks or side effects of vaccination: “They don’t tell you the side effects of having these vaccines they don’t tell you this side of it” ( Smith 2017 , UK, participant quote). Many of these parents explained that this made them distrustful of their healthcare worker and sceptical of the vaccination advice or information they provide ( Casiday 2007 ; Hussain 2015 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ).\n\n【365】Various studies, across diverse settings and populations, also demonstrated how affirming interactions and forms of communication with frontline healthcare workers can enhance parents’ acceptance of vaccination for their children ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020 ). Numerous parents described the positive influence of healthcare workers who were supportive and empathetic, who listened to their concerns and genuinely engaged with their questions, who respected views that they did not necessarily share, and who provided balanced and nuanced information about vaccination. Parents highlighted how these types of engagements built their trust in their healthcare worker and the vaccination recommendations he or she provided: “I really trust \\[my son’s\\] doctor. I really like her… Like, she listens to me” ( Limaye 2020 , USA, participant quote).\n\n【366】Many parents spoke specifically about the value of healthcare workers' sharing personal stories or information about themselves as parents ( Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ). These more personally‐focused interactions may enhance relations of familiarity and, in turn, parents’ faith in healthcare workers and what they say ( Brownlie 2005 ). As this parent implied, “I think I would have confidence in my own GP if he were to say ‘well I have had all my children vaccinated’. If the health professional were to say ‘I would have no hesitation to have my own children vaccinated’ well then, I would trust their decision” ( Brownlie 2005 , UK, participant quote). More personally‐focused interactions may also allow parents to more easily voice and discuss their particular concerns about their children and vaccination ( Poltorak 2005 ).\n\n【367】#### 2\\. Third‐order concepts\n\n【368】In the following two concepts, we present the views and interpretations of the **review authors** regarding potential pathways to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination.\n\n【369】##### Finding 18: neoliberal logic. Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a worldview informed by neoliberal discourses. These discourses understand health as individualised, and health‐related risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a ‘good’ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing one’s own individual health‐related risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that ‘doctor knows best’, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parents’ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination (moderate confidence).\n\n【370】One potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination can be captured by the concept of ‘neoliberal logic’. This concept encapsulates the interconnected and frequently coexisting ideas held by many parents, which come together to create a particular logic of care regarding vaccination. This logic of care was common amongst parents across socioeconomic divides in HICs. It also emerged amongst parents from middle‐ and higher‐ socioeconomic groups in Brazil ( Barbieri 2017 ). This logic can be characterised as follows. With a view of their child’s health as individualised and inevitably fragile, parents attempt to separate out the risks of disease and the potential benefits of vaccines as they pertain to their specific child. With a view of themselves as experts of their children and a skepticism of the expert systems implicated with vaccination, parents perceive themselves as best placed to conduct this risk‐benefit calculus for their child. With a strong conviction that they are singularly responsible for their child’s health, they see this risk assessment as a moral obligation and the vaccination decision taken as ultimately a matter of personal choice.\n\n【371】This particular logic of care is not an ‘individual’ belief held by a select few. Rather, it is deeply rooted in, and reflects, trends in thinking that have become ubiquitous within contemporary, industrialised societies. Within these contexts, the ideas of individual responsibility and personal choice have become dominant values in recent decades. This is related to the processes of individualisation and a rollback of the state to a political agenda stressing citizens’ own rights and responsibilities. Drawing on the works of sociologists Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens ( Giddens 1990 ; Giddens 1991 ; Beck 1992 ), many study authors highlight how we are currently living within a ‘risk society’ era ( Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Sobo 2016 ). In this era, risks have intensified in magnitude and become increasingly global:  international disease outbreaks, nuclear war, environmental pollution, global warming, accidents, terrorism, and so forth. The nature and scope of contemporary risks make them more difficult than in the past to calculate and control, creating a climate of increased vulnerability. At the same time, central institutions and systems (government, industry, science) are increasingly viewed as partly responsible for, and unable to control, the types of risks thrown up by the processes of modernisation. Distrust and suspicion of these institutions have therefore become pervasive features of contemporary social life.\n\n【372】Within this context, there has been an intensification of concern with assessing, avoiding, and managing risk, processes which have become increasingly individualised and understood as matters of personal responsibility and choice. Drawing on the thinking of French philosopher Michel Foucault ( Foucault 1977 ; Foucault 1989 ; Foucault 1991 ), various study authors highlighted how people are increasingly required to become ‘responsibilised’ citizens who self‐govern their lives, remain actively aware of dangers and opportunities, and who recognise that they themselves are accountable for their own well‐being ( Petts 2004 ; Ward 2017 ). Ultimately, making decisions in terms of individual choice and responsibility has become a moral imperative and has infiltrated many domains of life.\n\n【373】Health and healthcare are no exception in this regard, where individual responsibility for one’s own health (or that of one’s children) has become a major societal value. Using the theory of “healthism”, originally coined by Robert Crawford ( Crawford 1980 ; Crawford 2004 ), various study authors demonstrate how people are encouraged to empower themselves to become “active” ( Sobo 2016 ), and “enterprising and entrepreneurial” ( Peretti‐Watel 2019 ), healthcare consumers who undertake “self‐initiated health promoting behavior” ( Rogers 1995 ). Within this neoliberal logic, health has also become a moral imperative and an essential aspect of self‐worth, whereby a ‘failure’ to look after one’s health or to make ‘good’ healthcare choices is seen as a moral transgression ( Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ). The ‘holistic’ or ‘natural’ health movement is a product, at least in part, of this heightened preoccupation with personal health and the individual lifestyle modifications thought to promote or maintain it ( Crawford 1980 ; Crawford 2004 ).\n\n【374】This ideology of ‘healthism’ dovetails with, and is reinforced, by a contemporary public health paradigm that strongly promotes the values of ‘patient choice’, ‘patient empowerment’, ‘self‐management’, and ‘shared decision‐making’ in health and healthcare practices. As suggested by several study authors, health promotion policy and practice consistently urge people to be independent and self‐efficacious, to educate themselves on health‐related issues and to fully participate in making decisions to optimise their own (and their families’) health and well‐being ( Rogers 1995 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Brunson 2013 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ).\n\n【375】Views regarding childhood vaccination for many parents in HICs therefore need to be understood within this context and the forms of neoliberal subjectivity it has produced. These kinds of vaccination views, informed by neoliberal discourses, were common amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes in HICs: those who accepted vaccination, those who were hesitant towards vaccination, and those who refused vaccination. However, for certain parents, these views were experienced as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages. Some of these parents were particularly uneasy with the population‐level risk‐benefit statistics that vaccination promotion discourses provide, which they felt disregarded their child’s individual vaccination needs and vulnerabilities. Other parents resented the emphasis such discourses placed on community obligation and the health of the ‘herd’, when being a good parent is associated with taking personal responsibility for what’s best for one’s own child. Other parents resented the claim of ‘doctor knows best’ underpinning vaccination promotion messages, when they considered themselves to have the best knowledge of their child’s strengths and vulnerabilities. Many of these parents had an inherent distrust for health authorities, and therefore objected to vaccination promotion messages asking them to be ‘a blind follower of the state’ and to ‘uncritically trust’ what health authorities promote. Some parents also pointed to and resented the inconsistencies between these messages and other health promotion discourses which advocate for independent, reflexive decision‐making and personal choice.\n\n【376】Therefore, the source of conflict certain parents perceived between vaccination promotion messages and their views about health and healthcare informed by neoliberal discourses varied. However, what appeared common for these parents, and what potentially separated them from other parents who accepted vaccination, was that this experienced tension was absolute and unacceptable. This, in turn, may have led them to resist vaccination promotion messages and be less accepting of vaccination.\n\n【377】##### Finding 19: social exclusion. Some parents, predominantly from LMICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful government‐citizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors, in turn, led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs, and distress it creates (moderate confidence).\n\n【378】Another potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination may be captured by the concept of ‘social exclusion’. Here we define social exclusion as a state in which individuals, communities, or areas are unable to participate fully in the economic, social, political, and cultural life of society, as well as the process leading to and sustaining such a state ( United Nations 2016 ). Studies included in this review revealed how social exclusion may entail various different dimensions: poverty and inequality, including deficiencies in and poor access to basic infrastructure and functioning vaccination and other public services; residential segregation; a lack of political representation or power; discrimination; and unequal respect for and protection of rights. All of these different dimensions of social exclusion may lead parents to be less accepting of vaccination through varying mechanisms of effect. Experiences of social exclusion may rupture trustful government‐citizenry relations, in turn leading excluded communities to lose confidence that those in power have their best interests at heart. They may become increasingly sceptical of initiatives ostensibly offered for their advantage, when they are disadvantaged in so many other aspects of their lives. In such cases, parents may be less accepting of vaccination for their children because they do not trust the safety of vaccines, the motivations of those delivering them, or the real benefits of vaccination programmes.\n\n【379】Experiences of social exclusion may also generate a climate of alienation from, and anger towards, the state and others in society. Socially‐excluded communities may, in turn, resent having to take part in ‘public good’ initiatives when they feel estranged from the public in whose interests they must cooperate, and disenfranchised by the authorities asking for their participation. They may begrudge being asked to vaccinate when what they consider to be their principal concerns are neglected. In such cases, childhood vaccination may be rejected by parents as a form of resistance to authorities, or what one study author – following political scientist James Scott ( Scott 1985 ) – calls a “weapon of the weak” ( Renne 2010 ). That is, it may provide socially‐excluded parents with a degree of agency within contexts where they are fundamentally disempowered. For some, and as suggested by various study authors, nonacceptance of vaccination may actually be used more overtly as a mechanism to bring about change, a “bargaining point” ( Chaturvedi 2009 ), or “negotiating tool” ( Hussain 2015 ), to have their principal concerns and priorities addressed. While this might be considered “dangerous development”, as suggested by the authors of one study ( Hussain 2015 ), it is arguably also a strategic and potentially desperate response to oppressive contexts where lives and livelihoods are fundamentally threatened.\n\n【380】Experiences of social exclusion, particularly when social exclusion includes poverty and inequality, may also produce substantial frustration and demotivation around vaccination. The studies included in this review revealed how economically‐disadvantaged communities frequently face major structural barriers to accessing vaccination services, whether due to long distances needed to travel to access vaccination, childcare constraints, competing livelihood activities and domestic tasks ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017 ). Many studies also found that, if these economic struggles and situational constraints are overcome, parents are then frequently met with suboptimal vaccination services, including vaccine shortages and stock‐outs, overcrowded facilities, long waiting times, informal charges, and mistreatment from healthcare workers ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ). In such cases, and as suggested by various study authors ( Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; McKnight 2014 ), parents’ acceptance of vaccination may be reduced, albeit more passively, due to the extensive time, effort, (opportunity) costs, and distress that vaccination entails for them.\n\n【381】#### 3\\. Overarching line of argument\n\n【382】In the following line of argument, we present the views and interpretations of the **review authors** regarding how one might conceptualise, more broadly, parental views and practices regarding childhood vaccination.\n\n【383】The overarching line of argument emerging from the analysis of the data is as follows: parents’ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination can be conceptualised as complex and dynamic social processes that reflect multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. That is, parents’ vaccination decisions usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances. Such decisions usually emerge through interacting and relating, rather than through a deliberative calculus at a single moment in time. As such, vaccination views ‐ whatever position is taken ‐ may be best understood as a ‘process’, rather than an a priori or fixed ‘stance’. The procedural nature of vaccination views also means that parents' vaccination views and practices change or can potentially change.\n\n【384】Moreover, parents’ vaccination views and practices are influenced by multiple forces and carry a variety of meanings: social, political, structural, moral, as well as biological. Through their vaccination choices, parents are often reflecting their experiences of, and the meanings they attach to, broader relations, entities, and processes ‐ big and small, past and present, directly and indirectly related to vaccination. These include, for example, parents’ engagements with other parents, peers and community members, with healthcare institutions and their providers, with the state, with science and medicine, with global institutions and programmes, with former colonial powers. Sometimes, parents’ vaccination views and practices are more explicitly commenting on and even challenging the nature of these relations, entities, and processes. Therefore, through their vaccination decisions, parents are often communicating not just what they think about vaccines, but also who they are, what they value, and with whom they identify.\n\n【385】As such, reduced vaccination acceptance is often not about ‘ignorance’ or ‘misinformation’. Rather, it forms an integral part of the wider social milieu in which parents live. Nor is reduced vaccination acceptance necessarily about irrational forms of thinking. The wider social milieu in which parents live frequently contains features that make vaccination hesitancy or nonacceptance not only possible, but seem entirely logical ‐ whether in the neoliberal world of more affluent parents or the disadvantaged world of more socially‐excluded parents. While the logic may not conform to the logic of vaccination programmes, it makes sense within the political, moral, structural, and conceptual landscapes of those worlds. Ultimately, recognising these logics on their own terms could provide avenues for more effectively and sensitively bridging the goals of immunisation programmes with those of parents who decide against vaccination for their children.\n\n【386】### Results of integrating the review findings with the Cochrane intervention reviews\n\n【387】The results of our comparison of the findings from our qualitative evidence synthesis and the findings from the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness are presented in the matrix in Figure 8 . The matrix provides a summary of how the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents’ vaccination views and practices are (or not) reflected in the underlying theories or components of the interventions in the studies included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness ( Saeterdal 2014 ; Oyo‐Ita 2016 ; Jacobson‐Vann 2018 ; Kaufman 2018 ).\n\n【388】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【389】Figure 8\n\n【390】* * *\n\n【391】* * *\n\n【392】Matrix model applying key findings from the qualitative synthesis to studies included in the Cochrane Reviews of interventions\n\n【393】The following are links to the references of the studies included in the relevant Cochrane effectiveness reviews: Young 1980 ; Soljak 1987 ; Tollestrup 1991 ; Oeffinger 1992 ; Szilagyi 1992 ; Kemper 1993 ; Stehr‐Green 1993 ; Alto 1994 ; Campbell 1994 ; Linkins 1994 ; Ferson 1995 ; Brugha 1996 ; Bjornson 1997 ; Lieu 1997 ; Bolam 1998 ; LeBaron 1998 ; Lieu 1998 ; Wood 1998 ; Rodewald 1999 ; Dini 2000 ; Mason 2000 ; Vivier 2000 ; Kempe 2001 ; Daley 2002 ; Quinlivan 2003 ; Daley 2004a ; Daley 2004b ; LeBaron 2004 ; Maluccio 2004 ; Morris 2004 ; Barham 2005 ; Kempe 2005 ; Irigoyen 2006 ; Pandey 2007 ; Andersson 2009 ; Djibuti 2009 ; Hambidge 2009 ; Usman 2009 ; Banerjee 2010 ; Dicko 2011 ; Jackson 2011 ; Lemstra 2011 ; Owais 2011 ; Usman 2011 ; CDC 2012 ; Dombkowski 2012 ; Robertson 2013 ; Saitoh 2013 ; Dombkowski 2014 ; Bangure 2015 ; Brown 2016 ; Haji 2016 ; Hu 2017 ; Saitoh 2017 .\n\n【394】In summary:\n\n【395】*   the factor most commonly targeted amongst the interventions was features of vaccination services that parents might find undesirable or inconvenient, with 14 (26%) of interventions reflecting or partially reflecting this influencing factor.\n    \n*   eight interventions (15%) addressed the issue of trust/distrust of authorities associated with vaccination programmes. Seven of these focused specifically on providing a range of basic services or goods along with vaccination, which the findings from our review suggested could help alleviate distrust in vaccination programmes and those delivering them.\n    \n*   Seven interventions (13%) targetted the social or economic challenges parents face in accessing vaccination services, followed by six interventions (11%) which considered or partially considered parents’ broader health beliefs and practices, and the concerns or questions about vaccination these may give rise to.\n    \n*   Only five interventions (9%) considered the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, and only three interventions (5%) considered the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents. Our review findings on the influence of social networks (finding 7) and healthcare workers (finding 17) on parents' vaccination acceptance were both assessed as having high confidence.\n    \n*   None of the interventions appeared to consider parents’ experiences of the social nature of vaccination services.\n    \n*   Interventions with multiple components were more likely to include more elements that could be mapped onto the findings of our review than those with single components.\n    \n\n【396】For various interventions, it was unclear whether the intervention failed to reflect or target an influencing factor, or alternatively, whether the researchers conducting the intervention studies did not report an influencing factor. In these cases, we may have gained greater clarity about the intervention if we had searched for additional information in related publications or from study authors, rather than relying solely on the information provided in the publications included in the related Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness.\n\n【397】### Review author reflexivity\n\n【398】Throughout the review process, none of us held a neutral position regarding vaccination. At the outset of the review, we all believed that childhood vaccination is an important individual and public health intervention. We all fully accepted childhood vaccination according to the recommended schedules. This was based on our shared view that vaccines are mostly safe and beneficial for individuals, and that most individuals can each absorb minimal risk to safeguard those in our communities who are most vulnerable. One member of the team had the experience of unintentionally delayed and incomplete vaccination for her children, which provided her with a more nuanced experience of parental decision‐making about childhood vaccinations. In addition, we all held the view that individuals have a right to make their own healthcare decisions, including about vaccination. Moreover, we believed that it is important for people to have easy access to balanced and transparent information about vaccination, including about adverse effects, evidence gaps, and uncertainties. We recognised that there are many potential tensions between public health, community obligation, and individual choice, tensions which we tried to hold and grapple with throughout the review process.\n\n【399】While the review did not change any of our views about vaccination, we have all been required to engage seriously with the complex logics underpinning parents’ vaccination views and practices that may differ from our own. Through this process, many of us have recognised parts of ourselves in these views and practices, and have in turn gained a more nuanced and less judgmental understanding of diverse perspectives.\n\n【400】Much of the research on the demand side of vaccination focuses on understanding what parents think, feel, and do regarding vaccines. While we as a review team shared this interest, we also wished to provide a critical and contextualised understanding of these views, emotions, and practices. This motivation informed, at least in part, our choice of a meta‐ethnographic analysis approach and associated decision to use 'conceptual richness' as our primary sampling strategy. These decisions inevitably also shaped the interpretive process and synthesis of the findings. Before undertaking the review, many of us had considerable prior knowledge of existing conceptual frameworks on the demand side of vaccination, as well as many of the social theories employed by the studies included in the review. We anticipated that these former understandings could both enhance and negatively impact upon the interpretive process and synthesis of the findings. We therefore employed various strategies to mitigate this potentially negative impact, and to mitigate other ways in which we might inappropriately skew the interpretation of the data and our own review findings. The team regularly discussed progress and preliminary findings, with the aims of identifying assumptions in the data synthesis, clarifying procedures and choices, and documenting various challenges faced in the review process. These discussions were greatly enhanced by our having a multidisciplinary review team, which enabled both the exploration of multiple perspectives and productive contestation. Our review team comprised authors with disciplinary backgrounds in sociology (SC), anthropology (BS, AS, CC), psychology (NL, SC), health systems (NL, CW), vaccinology (CW), and epidemiology (BS, ES, CC, CW). During our team discussions, we also tried to remain mindful of our presuppositions and, as a team, to support each other to question our own viewpoints. We also used refutational analysis techniques (‘disconfirming analyses’) as an integral part of the data analysis. We identified various incongruencies, inconsistencies, and refutations in the data, which we explored and accounted for in our synthesis of the findings. This process deepened our interpretations and further enhanced the reflexive stance of the review team.\n\n【401】A final strategy we used to try operationalise a reflexive stance was to write ourselves explicitly into the text of the review findings; for example, by commonly making statements such as “we interpreted this to mean”, or “we did not identify”, or “we have attempted to move away from”. Through this approach, we hoped to make the interactions between the studies and our own views and positions more visible, and to provide review findings that ultimately reflect a “view from somewhere” ( Harraway 1988 ) rather than “a view from nowhere” ( Nagel 1986 ).\n\n【402】Discussion\n----------\n\n【403】### Summary of the main findings\n\n【404】For a summary of the main findings, see the Plain Language Summary.\n\n【405】### Comparison with other reviews and implications for the field\n\n【406】The findings of our qualitative evidence synthesis have various commonalities with the findings from a related Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis on perceptions and experiences of communication about routine childhood vaccination ( Ames 2017b ). Ames and colleagues also highlighted the importance of frontline healthcare workers in influencing parents' vaccination intentions. For example, like our review, Ames and colleagues found that parents want healthcare workers to answer their questions, provide impartial and balanced information (about both the benefits and risks of vaccination), and be caring, sensitive, and receptive to their concerns. The Ames 2017b review similarly revealed the positive impact of the presence of these factors on parents' vaccination views and practices, but also the negative impact when these factors are absent. Ames and colleagues also revealed the importance of trust/distrust in the context of vaccination. For example, the review found: that parental attitudes towards vaccination influenced which vaccination information sources they trusted; that parents who trusted their health workers also trusted the information they provided; and that some parents distrusted information sources linked to the government. Our review supports and extends these findings by revealing how, in addition to influencing views about information sources, parents' trust or distrust in healthcare workers, government, and other forms of authority also impacts upon their views and practices about vaccination. Ames and colleagues indicated that communication is one of many interacting factors that may influence parents' and informal caregivers' decisions to take their children for vaccination, and communication alone will therefore not address all aspects of vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, or refusal. Our review provides insights into what these other aspects may be.\n\n【407】The findings from our review also have commonalities with findings from other qualitative and mixed‐methods reviews focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination ( Mills 2005 ; Brown 2010 ; Larson 2014 ; Dube 2018 ), although none of these reviews had the same focus or scope as our review. Two of these were qualitative reviews that synthesised beliefs, attitudes, and practices toward childhood vaccination in high‐income contexts specifically ( Mills 2005 ; Dube 2018 ). Two were mixed‐methods reviews that focused on the factors influencing decision‐making regarding combination childhood vaccination in high‐income contexts specifically ( Brown 2010 ), and the factors affecting vaccine hesitancy and its determinants globally ( Larson 2014 ).\n\n【408】As with our findings, all four of these reviews found that childhood vaccination views and practices are complex social processes influenced by multiple factors ‐ sociocultural, political, economic, historical, ideological, psychological, moral as well as biological ( Mills 2005 ; Brown 2010 ; Larson 2014 ; Dube 2018 ). Therefore, these reviews, like ours, challenge common understandings of vaccination hesitancy or nonacceptance as individual phenomena resulting primarily from ‘ignorance’ or irrational forms of thinking (i.e. ‘knowledge‐deficit’ approaches).\n\n【409】Many of the factors we identified as influencing parental vaccination views and practices were also identified in these reviews. For example, all four reviews highlighted the significant role of trust or distrust in government, biomedicine, and pharmaceutical companies, and how a lack of or decline in trust in these entities can contribute to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination amongst parents ( Mills 2005 ; Brown 2010 ; Larson 2014 ; Dube 2018 ). Our review reflects this finding, but also elaborates on it by demonstrating the complex and contextually‐situated nature of this distrust, and how the absence or decline of trust may be linked to political events, relations, and processes within specific times and places.\n\n【410】Moreover, parents’ relationship and interactions with healthcare workers were also identified as important factors shaping parents’ vaccination views and practices in three of these reviews ( Mills 2005 ; Brown 2010 ; Dube 2018 ). As in our review, these reviews found that the manner in which healthcare workers treat parents – and specifically whether parents feel respected, supported, and listened to (or not) by healthcare workers – can influence what parents think and do regarding vaccination for their children. The interplay between access‐supply and demand dimensions of vaccination were also highlighted in three reviews ( Mills 2005 ; Brown 2010 ; Larson 2014 ). As in our review, these reviews showed how practical barriers to accessing vaccination and challenges around vaccine supply can reduce parents’ acceptance of vaccination for their children. Similarly to our review, two reviews also identified social networks and norms, as well as parents’ broader ideas and practices surrounding health and illness, as additional important factors influencing parental vaccination views and practices ( Larson 2014 ; Dube 2018 ).\n\n【411】Two reviews found that many parents hold perspectives similar to what our review conceptualised as a ‘neoliberal logic’ ( Brown 2010 ; Dube 2018 ). In their mixed‐methods review, Brown 2010 found that lower vaccine uptake was associated significantly with parents who valued the right to choose whether to vaccinate, who engaged in personal research on vaccination, and who had a preference for ‘naturally‐acquired’ immunity. Relatedly, in their qualitative review, Dube 2018 found that parents who expressed hesitancy towards or who refused vaccination for their children commonly expressed strong feelings of personal responsibility to their children and highlighted the importance of personal choice. These parents often also placed considerable emphasis on ‘healthy, natural lifestyles’, and conveyed resentment over the pressures they felt to risk their own child’s safety for public health benefits. Both reviews also found that, when making decisions about vaccination for their children, many parents prioritised individual risk assessments over generalised or population‐level statistics of risks and benefits. Our own review reflects these findings, but also enhances them by trying to bring them together theoretically through our concept of a ‘neoliberal logic’. There is a persepctive in some health literature that the neoliberal values of individual responsibility and choice are more common amongst higher socioeconomic groups (e.g. Lindbladh 2003 ). The findings from our review does not support this perspective, but rather suggests that, at least in HICs, neoliberal values and views may be held by parents across the socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n【412】Many reviews focused on the demand side of childhood vaccination included studies only from HICs (see Table 1 for a summary of these reviews). Our review addresses this gap by incorporating, and comparing the findings of, studies from both HICs and LMICs. We identified both differences and commonalities in the findings between these study groups. One of the main differences relates to potential sociocultural variations in ideas and practices surrounding health and illness, and associated perceptions of the role of vaccination. For example, we suggested that a ‘neoliberal logic’ of health may be more applicable to parents in HICs as a potential pathway to reduced acceptance of childhood vaccination. However, one study conducted in Brazil included in our review ( Barbieri 2017 ), found this type of logic to be very common amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups. More research is needed to determine the relevance of this finding amongst parents from middle and higher socioeconomic groups in other LMICs. Another main difference our review found between findings from HIC and LMIC studies was the role of access challenges and suboptimal vaccination services and delivery logistics. These issues, common in many resource‐limited settings, emerged as impacting negatively on vaccination acceptance amongst parents in many LMICs. However, access challenges were found to be an important issue impacting upon vaccination acceptance amongst Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller parents in one study in Britain included in this review ( Smith 2017 ). More research is therefore needed to determine the relevance of this issue amongst parents from other minority or marginalised groups in HICs.\n\n【413】There were, however, also many commonalities that emerged in the studies from HICs and LMICs. The mutually‐reinforcing relationship between parents’ vaccination ideas and practices and the social networks in which they are embedded was found in both HIC and LMIC studies. Moreover, a pertinent finding that emerged across study groups was the impact of distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination on vaccination acceptance. Similarly, the interactions parents have with frontline healthcare workers, and how these can positively and negatively influence vaccination acceptance, was another common finding between studies in HICs and LMICs. At the same time, our four third‐order themes and overarching line of argument were able to 'hold' and account for the findings from both HIC and LMIC studies.\n\n【414】Ultimately, the _specific configurations_ of influencing factors, and the particular conditions, relations, and dynamics in which they are rooted, may differ between HIC and LMIC (and potentially other) contexts. Yet we would argue that the _broader categories_ of influencing factors developed and applied in this review, and our overarching conceptualisation of vaccination, are potentially applicable across country income divides.\n\n【415】The findings from our review support and also enhance various existing conceptual and theoretical models of the demand side of vaccination. Our concept of ‘neoliberal logic’ aligns with, and provides empirical support for, the theoretical framework of vaccine hesitancy proposed by Peretti‐Watel and colleagues ( Peretti‐Watel 2015 ). This framework conceptualises vaccine hesitancy as a two‐dimensional decision‐making process that depends on people’s level of commitment to modern society’s risk culture, or “healthism”, and their trust in the authority of healthcare providers and mainstream medicine. Our review’s concept of ‘social exclusion’ provides possible insights into how this framework might be expanded to incorporate other major structural features of contemporary societies, thereby enhancing its potential generalisability.\n\n【416】The four third‐order themes of our review also align with, and provide empirical support for, existing socio‐ecological conceptual models of vaccination acceptance, including the WHO’s ‘Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix’ ( Sturm 2005 ; Callreus 2010 ; WHO 2013b ; Larson 2014 ). These models understand vaccination decision‐making as shaped by interrelated factors operating at multiple levels (e.g. intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community). Our review identifies several factors which may be important at different levels of influence. Our review also provides insights into how these factors might function and interact to influence vaccination views and practices. In particular, through our third‐order concepts of ‘neoliberal logic’ and ‘social exclusion’, our review provides a theorised understanding of two potential mechanisms or pathways through which different factors, at different levels, might interact to reduce vaccination acceptance.\n\n【417】These mechanisms or pathways may also supplement the core theoretical constructs of the various ‘C frameworks’. The 'C frameworks' draw on psychological models (e.g. the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour, amongst many others) to understand the psychological processes underpinning vaccination decision‐making ( WHO 2013b ; Betsch 2015 ; MacDonald 2015 ; Betsch 2018 ). While the constructs of these frameworks have been recognised as highly relevant, these frameworks have also been criticised for prioritising individual processes over more social processes ( Larson 2014 ; Corben 2016 ; Dube 2018 ). Informed by critical social theories, the two third‐order concepts developed in this review (‘neoliberal logic’ and ‘social exclusion’) provide insights into potential social processes or mechanisms underpinning vaccination decision‐making. Therefore, these could potentially be used to complement and extend the core psychological constructs of the ‘C frameworks’.\n\n【418】In terms of the four related published Cochrane Reviews of intervention effectiveness, as revealed in the matrix in Figure 8 , many of the overarching factors our review identified as influencing parents' vaccination views and practices were underrepresented in the interventions tested in the studies. In particular, relatively few interventions considered or targeted parents’ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, and the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents. No interventions appeared to consider parents’ experiences of the social nature of vaccination services. Moreover, seven of the eight interventions that addressed the issue of trust/distrust in vaccination focused specifically on providing a range of basic services or goods along with vaccination. Our review found that inadequate public services or goods may be just one of the many complex reasons for parents' distrust of vaccination. Future trials should consider incorporating interventions that target a wider array of factors influencing parents' vaccination views and practices. Specifically, there is a need for more interventions which target parents’ broader health beliefs and practices, the social networks and groups with which parents are affiliated, the interactions and forms of communication between healthcare workers and parents, and the context‐specific factors potentially contributing to parents' distrust in vaccination.\n\n【419】### Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence\n\n【420】The studies included in this review encompassed diverse countries and socioeconomic settings. The sampling approach we used (see 'Sampling of studies' above) was geared towards including only conceptually‐rich studies, and as such, the evidence of this review has a relatively high degree of depth, detail, and breadth. Moreover, nearly half (n = 13) of the studies used a long‐term ethnographic approach (sometimes spanning many years), including various types of observational and participatory methods. This may have enabled researchers to develop an in‐depth understanding of parents’ unarticulated thoughts and actual practices, in addition to what they explicitly said. These insights may have further enhanced the completeness of the findings. It is possible, however, that our inclusion of studies published only in English, German, or French led to the omission of findings from cultural contexts where these languages are not the norm. Similarly, our use of a purposeful sampling approach may have led to the omission of findings relevant to particular populations, settings, and experiences. For example, our sampling approach resulted in all eligible studies from the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region being excluded from the analysis.\n\n【421】All of the studies we included explored parental views and practices regarding routine childhood vaccination. Yet a large majority of studies focused their analyses and findings on those views and practices associated with reduced acceptance (e.g. hesitancy or nonacceptance) of routine childhood vaccination. In addition, many studies only included parents who were hesitant towards or nonaccepting of routine childhood vaccination. This focus of the included studies is thus reflected in the findings of our review, which tend to concentrate on the factors associated with reduced acceptance of routine childhood vaccination. Factors that reduce and those that enhance vaccination are not necessarily binary categories that can be populated by their opposites. A greater focus specifically on the factors that enhance acceptance of routine childhood vaccination would add important insights into how acceptance might be sustained over time.\n\n【422】While most of the studies targetted parents, the majority were conducted with mothers or female caregivers only. When fathers or male caregivers were included, the researchers generally did not distinguish between mothers' and fathers’ perspectives, nor did they explore any potential gender‐based differences in their analysis. Thus, we are uncertain whether fathers have the same perspectives and practices regarding childhood vaccination.\n\n【423】Our review excluded studies that focused on hypothetical vaccines, future vaccines, and vaccines given in response to an outbreak situation, as we were interested in gaining a general understanding of parents’ views and practices towards routine childhood vaccination. It is therefore unclear whether the findings of this review can be appropriately applied to nonroutine vaccines, such as those given in an outbreak. Moreover, some included studies focused on specific vaccines: six studies (all from the UK) focused exclusively on the MMR vaccine, and three studies (in India and Nigeria) focused exclusively on the polio vaccine. These vaccines in these settings have a particularly controversial history, including the publication of a now‐retracted research paper linking the combined MMR vaccine to colitis and autism spectrum disorders ( Godlee 2011 ), which was well known to the British public, and the historical, widespread social resistance to, and boycott of, the polio vaccine in India and Nigeria, respectively ( Larson 2011 ). Many of the findings of this review rely heavily on findings from these studies. It is possible that parents’ views and practices regarding childhood vaccination were different in settings where these controversies occurred, compared to settings where they did not.\n\n【424】### Limitations of the review\n\n【425】All of the studies included (and sampled) in our review were published in English, although various German and French studies were included at the full‐text screening stage. The scarcity of studies identified from non‐anglophone countries may be partly attributble to the fact that we did not include regional databases as part of our search strategy (e.g. the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, LILACS; Biblioteca Regional de Medicina, BIREME; African Index Medicus). We also made the decision to only include studies published in languages spoken by the review authors, which meant that only articles in French, English, and German were eligible for inclusion. This decision was based on our use of a meta‐ethnographic approach, an interpretative synthesis methodology that depends upon an in‐depth and nuanced understanding of the meanings of complex conceptual data (see ‘Language translation’ for more details). Ultimately, the absence of studies from non‐anglophone countries means that we may have missed important findings of studies from cultural contexts where English is not the norm, a key limitation of our review.\n\n【426】The volume of data included in the analysis meant that it was feasible for only one review author (SC) to lead the data analysis processes, albeit with regular discussion with, input, and verification from other review authors. We recognise that these processes are inherently interpretive: more than one review author undertaking these processes independently may have produced different interpretations and enhanced the exploration of alternative explanations. The volume of data also meant that, in the early stages of the analysis, we organised the data into preliminary broad themes which served as the basis for the translations. While this initial grouping was pragmatic, it may have constrained the emergence of new categories and interpretations during the subsequent translation and synthesis stages. Finally, based on our initial sense of a commonality in findings amongst studies in HICs and amongst those in LMICs, our analysis involved grouping the studies according to country income level. While this approach helped preserve one important aspect of context during the translation and synthesis processes, it may have also impacted on the overall interpretations of the synthesis.\n\n【427】Figures and Tables -\n\n【428】Figure 1\n\n【429】Conceptual richness 5‐point scale (adapted from the typology of qualitative findings developed by Sandelowski 2007 )\n\n【430】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【431】Figures and Tables -\n\n【432】Figure 2\n\n【433】Flow diagram to illustrate analysis phases\n\n【434】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【435】Figures and Tables -\n\n【436】Figure 3\n\n【437】Types and definitions of qualitative research findings (drawing on Noblit 1988 ; Britten 2002 ; Malpass 2009 ; Sandelowski 2007 )\n\n【438】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【439】Figures and Tables -\n\n【440】Figure 4\n\n【441】Second‐order findings organised by the third‐order themes\n\n【442】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【443】Figures and Tables -\n\n【444】Figure 5\n\n【445】Second‐order findings that contributed to each third‐order concept\n\n【446】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【447】Figures and Tables -\n\n【448】Figure 6\n\n【449】All second‐ and third‐order findings and their relationships\n\n【450】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【451】Figures and Tables -\n\n【452】Figure 7\n\n【453】Study flow diagram\n\n【454】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【455】Figures and Tables -\n\n【456】Figure 8\n\n【457】Matrix model applying key findings from the qualitative synthesis to studies included in the Cochrane Reviews of interventions\n\n【458】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【459】Summary of findings 1. Summary of qualitative findings (SoQF) table\n\n| **Summary of review findings**  | **Studies contributing to the review finding**  | **GRADE‐CERQual assessment of confidence in the evidence**  | **Explanation of GRADE‐CERQual assessment**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  | **Theme 1: ideas and practices surrounding (child) health and illness**  |\n| **Finding 1: religious beliefs.** Some parents were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to the religious beliefs they held, and the view that illness, including in children, can only be prevented by divine providence. These parents expressed religious objections to vaccination.  | Renne 2010 ; Reich 2016  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about adequacy, moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 2: the ‘fragile’ infant.** An understanding of infants and their immune systems as fragile and still in a state of development was common amongst parents across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups. Numerous parents characterised infants and young children as weak and vulnerable, and in need of protection against multiple social, biological, or spiritual threats. This perception was associated with both reduced and increased acceptance of childhood vaccination.  | Bisht 2000 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Limaye 2020  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 3: primacy of ‘nature’ and ‘the natural’.** Some parents, predominantly from HICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their understanding of health and illness as holistic or naturalistic. This understanding conceives many biomedical interventions, including vaccination, as unnatural intrusions that are unnecessary or harmful. Various parents who held this view also engaged in certain ‘natural’ health‐promoting activities or “salutogenic parenting”, which for them further negated the need for vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 4: individualised health, immunity, and vaccine‐response trajectories.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a view that children possess unique bodies and immune systems, and therefore individual vaccine needs and vulnerabilities. As such, these parents frequently assessed the risks and benefits of vaccines as they pertain to their specific child, rather than in general. If the risks were seen to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these parents tended to be less accepting of childhood vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Smith 2017  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 5: claiming parental expertise.** Many parents from HICs held a view of themselves as experts of their child, possessing the best understanding of their child’s health strengths and vulnerabilities. They in turn considered themselves best placed to judge their child’s vaccination needs and risks.  | Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data), and minor concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 6: personal choice and responsibility.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, perceived healthcare decision‐making, including vaccination, to be a matter of personal responsibility and choice. In cases where the risks of a vaccine or vaccination in general were thought to outweigh the benefits for their particular child, then these values of personal responsibility and choice were often prioritised over collective responsibility. These parents in turn tended to be less accepting of vaccination for their children.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  | **Theme 2: social communities and networks**  |\n| **Finding 7: social networks shape vaccination ideas and practices.** Parents' vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts, and population groups, were influenced by the vaccination views and experiences of their social networks. These networks included relatives, peers, neighbours, and additional significant others in the community. However, the views and practices of other parents, and particularly other mothers, were especially influential.  | Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Ruijs 2012 ; Brunson 2013 ; Varghese 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 8: vaccination ideas and practices shape social networks.** Parents' vaccination views and practices also shaped their social networks. Shared vaccination ideas and practices were a powerful force in building social relations and ties. While this phenomenon occurred amongst parents across the spectrum of vaccination attitudes, it may be particularly significant for parents who are less accepting of vaccination. In these cases, parents may be afforded access to various types of social resources, in turn potentially reinforcing both their group affiliation and vaccination views and practices.  | Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Ward 2017 ; Reich 2016  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about adequacy and about coherence (ambiguous data), and minor concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  | **Theme 3: political events, relations and processes**  |\n| **Finding 9: distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination.** Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to a lack of, or breakdown in, trust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination ‐ most particularly government, the pharmaceutical industry, and science. The reasons for this distrust were complex and contextually situated, embedded in political events, relations, and processes within specific times and places.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Varghese 2013 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded due to moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 10: generalised decline in trust of authority and expert systems.** For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination may be part and parcel of a more generalised contemporary trend of decreasing trust in authorities and expert systems.  | Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Ward 2017  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance), moderate concerns about coherence (contradictory data) and adequacy, and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 11: agendas and interests underpinning the expert systems implicated with vaccination.** For some parents, distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their concerns about the agendas or interests embedded in these systems. Many of these parents were particularly concerned about the economic interests of these systems, and especially the economic interests of the pharmaceutical industry, which they perceived to be negatively influencing vaccination programmes.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Varghese 2013 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 12: current and past controversies.** Some parents' distrust of the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to particular ‘scandals’ or ‘controversies’ related to vaccination specifically or health‐related issues more broadly. The occurrence of such scandals, and the manner in which they were perceived to have been handled, caused some parents to feel misled by authorities and to question their legitimacy in protecting the public’s health.  | Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and coherence (contradictory and ambiguous data), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 13: marginalisation, inadequate public services, and priority misalignment.** Some parents' distrust in the institutions or systems implicated with vaccination was linked to their experiences of marginalisation, inadequate public services, or misalignment between their own priorities and those of the state. These experiences undermined trustful and benevolent state‐citizen relations, leading many parents to distrust government and government‐sponsored programs, including vaccination.  | Chaturvedi 2009 ; Renne 2010 ; Hussain 2015 ; Smith 2017  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about coherence (contradictory data) and methodological limitations  |\n| **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  | **Theme 4: access‐supply‐demand interactions**  |\n| **Finding 14: socio‐economic challenges in accessing vaccination services.** Parents living in resource‐limited settings frequently face numerous socioeconomic challenges to accessing vaccination services, including practical questions of geography and transport, childcare constraints, and family economics and household work pressures. As a result of these challenges, some of these parents were less accepting of vaccination due to the time, effort, and opportunity costs that accessing vaccination involved.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Finding 15: undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics.** Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to undesirable features of vaccination services and delivery logistics. These features, common to vaccination services within resource‐limited settings, included resource constraints that affect vaccine supply and costs and health facility waiting times, and constraining organisational procedures.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about relevance (partial relevance), and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 16: vaccination as a social event.** Vaccination may be a social event where people gather and interact with each other. Some parents found this to a positive experience, whereby they received affirmation about themselves and their children. This potentially motivated attendance at childhood vaccination services. For other parents, the social nature of vaccination services was a negative experience, whereby they felt judged by, disapproved of by, or alienated from others. This potentially demotivated attendance of childhood vaccination services.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007  | **Low confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of serious concerns about relevance (partial relevance) and adequacy, and minor concerns about methodological limitations  |\n| **Finding 17: interactions with frontline healthcare workers.** Parents' vaccination views and practices, across diverse settings, contexts and population groups, were mediated by the face‐to‐face interactions or personal relations they had with frontline healthcare workers. Some parents were less accepting of vaccination due to mistreatment from healthcare workers, and when they felt the vaccination information provided to them was simplistic and unbalanced. In contrast, some parents were more accepting of vaccination due to positively‐received engagements with healthcare workers, whereby they felt supported, listened to and respected, and whereby healthcare workers shared balanced information and personal stories about themselves as parents.  | Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Millimouno 2006 ; Casiday 2007 ; Leach 2007 ; Dugas 2009 ; McKnight 2014 ; Hussain 2015 ; Dube 2016 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019 ; Limaye 2020  | **High confidence**  |  |\n| **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  | **Third‐order concepts**  |\n| **Finding 18: neoliberal logic.** Many parents, predominantly from HICs, held a worldview informed by neoliberal discourses. These discourses understand health as individualised, and health‐related risks and decisions as matters of individual choice and responsibility. Furthermore, these discourses suggest that being a ‘good’ and responsible person in the world means consistently assessing one’s own, individual health‐related risks, seeking and questioning evidence about such risks, proactively avoiding and managing such risks, and understanding that one is singularly accountable for the outcomes that ensue. Some parents experienced this worldview as in conflict with vaccination promotion messages, which tend to be informed by other types of discourses. The discourses underpinning vaccination promotion messages frequently emphasise generalised risk and safety statistics, claim that ‘doctor knows best’, ask people to trust authorities and follow what they promote, and advocate for social responsibility and the health of the community. Parents’ perceived tension between the discourses informing their own worldview and those of vaccination promotion messages led some to resist these messages and be less accepting of vaccination.  | Rogers 1995 ; Petts 2004 ; Brownlie 2005 ; Poltorak 2005 ; Casiday 2007 ; Brunson 2013 ; Johnson 2014 ; Dube 2016 ; Reich 2016 ; Sobo 2016 ; Barbieri 2017 ; Smith 2017 ; Ward 2017 ; Carrion 2018 ; Peretti‐Watel 2019  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about coherence (ambiguous data), and minor concerns about methdological limitations  |\n| **Finding 19: social exclusion.** Some parents, predominantly from LMICs, were less accepting of childhood vaccination due to their experiences of social exclusion. Social exclusion may involve economic disadvantage, residential segregation, a lack of political representation or power, discrimination and unequal protection of rights, and a myriad of socioeconomic barriers to good quality public services, including vaccination. Social exclusion weakened trustful government‐citizen relations, generated feelings of alienation from, and resentment towards, the state and others, and gave rise to frustration and demotivation in the face of structural challenges. These factors in turn led some parents who are socially excluded to distrust vaccination, to refuse vaccination as a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change, or to avoid vaccination due to the time, effort, (opportunity) costs and distress it creates.  | Millimouno 2006 ; Leach 2007 ; Chaturvedi 2009 ; Dugas 2009 Renne 2010 ; McKnight 2014 Hussain 2015 ; Giles‐Vernick 2016 ; Smith 2017  | **Moderate confidence**  | Finding downgraded because of moderate concerns about both relevance (partial relevance) and coherence (ambiguous data)  |\n\n【461】Figures and Tables -\n\n【462】Summary of findings 1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We will assess the effect of the topical application of oils versus that of other topical oils, emollients, placebo or no treatment:\n\n【3】1\\. in the prevention of dry skin in term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) newborn infants; and\n\n【4】2\\. in the treatment of dry skin in term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) newborn infants.\n\n【5】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】### Description of the condition\n\n【8】Dry skin is a common occurrence in the first few months of an infant's life ( Saijo 1991 ). Dry skin has been defined as “a cutaneous reaction pattern reflecting abnormal desquamation of diverse etiologies” ( Madison 2003 ). In normal skin, corneocytes are shed from the skin in small enough quantities that they are not visible to the naked eye; however, in dry skin, the skin appearance becomes rough and flaky if this normal process is disturbed in any way. In an infant, this is a normal process of adaptation to life outside the uterus.\n\n【9】Atopic eczema (synonym atopic dermatitis) is an inflammatory skin condition characterised by dry and scaly skin, redness, blistering and itching. It affects up to 30% of children aged 2 to 15 years in the UK ( Gupta 2004 ). Affected children are also predisposed to allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis ( Gustafsson 2000 ). It is suggested that approximately 60% of sufferers develop atopic eczema in their first year of life ( Bieber 2008 ). Prevalence has increased to this current level from approximately 5% of children in the 1940s ( Taylor 1984 ). During that time the genetic structure of skin has not changed; however, the way that we care for an infant’s skin has changed, with an increase in use of soaps, other harsh detergents and oils ( Cork 2009 ; Danby 2011a ).\n\n【10】Infant skin is physiologically different to adult skin. The stratum corneum is 30% thinner and the epidermis is 20% thinner in infants than in adults ( Stamatas 2010 ). This difference in skin structure results in increases in permeability and dryness in infant skin. Infant skin is also more vulnerable to the use of topical treatments, as the ratio of infant body surface to body weight is higher than that for adults; hence, the risk that such therapies will be absorbed through the skin is greater in infants than in adults ( Nikolovski 2008 ). As the infant skin barrier continues to develop during the first year of life ( Stamatas 2011 ), infants are vulnerable to this risk throughout this period. Infant skin is prone to an increased rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and reduced stratum corneum hydration because it contains fewer lipids and natural moisturising factors, and less melanin than adult skin ( Chiou 2004 ; Nakagawa 2004 ). Infants may also experience a weakening of the skin barrier due to their elevated skin surface pH. High skin surface pH (low acidity) results in increased activity of proteases, which breakdown corneodesmosomes (the supportive component of the stratum corneum), and hinders the activity of enzymes that are required for lipid processing ( Hachem 2003 ; Cork 2009 ).\n\n【11】These differences in both structure and function between infant and adult skin suggest that infant skin is more vulnerable to environmental factors, including infant skin care products. The use of some topical oils and emollients on infant skin may therefore contribute to the development of adverse skin conditions, including atopic eczema, whereas other topical oils may have a positive effect and prevent the development of this condition ( Danby 2011a ; Danby 2011b ; Danby 2013 ).\n\n【12】### Description of the intervention\n\n【13】Parents want to use skin products that make their infant look and smell nice ( Lavender 2009 ; Furber 2012 ). The application of oil is commonly recommended by health professionals to new parents for use on their newborn infant’s skin ( Lavender 2009 ; Cooke 2011 ), in order to prevent or treat dryness or for massage. The use of emollients is not commonly recommended; however, parents have the choice of a diverse range of emollient infant skin care products from numerous manufacturers. In a UK national survey ( Cooke 2011 ), 52% of maternity and neonatal units recommended the use of oil; 82% of these units recommended olive oil to parents for use on their infant’s skin and 20% recommended sunflower oil. Health professionals, such as midwives and health visitors, believe these oils to be natural and, therefore, not harmful to infant skin ( Lavender 2009 ). Infant skin conditions can cause parental anxiety ( Adalat 2007 ). Parents will often adhere to advice given to them by health professionals with regard to the care of a newborn infant ( Lavender 2009 ).\n\n【14】### How the intervention might work\n\n【15】Some oils have been shown to have a positive effect on skin barrier function ( Darmstadt 2004 ; Darmstadt 2008 ; Danby 2013 ), whereas others may impair this function ( Naik 1995 ; Darmstadt 2002a ; Jiang 2003 ; Danby 2013 ). Research has shown that olive oil of a certain composition (i.e. a high ratio of oleic acid to linoleic acid) may adversely affect skin barrier function in mice ( Darmstadt 2002a ; Jiang 2003 ) and adults ( Naik 1995 ; Danby 2013 ). This composition of oil disrupts the lipid structure of the stratum corneum, and is a potential risk factor in the development or exacerbation of atopic eczema. Optimal sunflower oil (i.e. a high ratio of linoleic acid to oleic acid) has been shown in the same population to promote skin barrier repair ( Darmstadt 2004 ; Darmstadt 2008 ; Danby 2013 ).\n\n【16】The use of emollients or moisturisers is common in skin care regimens. They act by preventing water loss or by actively hydrating the skin ( Elson 2011 ). The main reason to use emollients in skin care is to protect the integrity of the skin barrier. For healthy term infants, this is not clinically necessary; however, those infants at risk (such as those with a family history of atopic eczema) may benefit from the regular use of emollients ( Frieden 2011 ). An oil is also an emollient that helps to prevent water loss and lubricates the skin.\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】Societal interest in ‘natural’ products is high ( Allemann 2009 ), especially in parents of newborn infants ( Cottingham 2007 ). There is a readiness among parents to use oil for infant skin care, and a readiness among maternity professionals to recommend it. There is a misconception that because a product is ‘natural’ it must be ‘safe’ ( Lavender 2009 ; Bedwell 2012 ). Oils have been used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and perfumery industries for many years. Although oils are governed by guidelines for the testing and research of cosmetics ( Council of the European Communities 1976 ), these are not as rigorous as those governing the use of medicines in humans ( Department of Health 2004 ). This means that oils have been used as medicinal and homeopathic remedies for many years without any collection and analysis of toxicological data. The infant skin surface area in relation to body weight is high and absorption is relative to the surface area exposed ( Rutter 1987 ). Topical applications may cause irritation, damage or systemic effects through absorption of the oil in to the body.\n\n【19】Infection is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in low‐resource countries ( Darmstadt 2002a ). The vulnerability of infant skin and the use of oils that may be harmful, combined with poor hygiene conditions, have the potential for increased hazards of infection. Nosocomial sepsis is more common in preterm infants, in whom the stratum corneum is not fully mature ( Conner 2009 ) and the skin does not have the protective benefit of vernix ( Yoshio 2003 ), than in term infants. Several studies ( Darmstadt 2002b ; Darmstadt 2004 ; Edwards 2004 ; Darmstadt 2005 ; Darmstadt 2008 ; Kiechl‐Kohlendorfer 2008 ) and a Cochrane systematic review ( Conner 2009 ) have considered topical applications for preterm infants, but no review has considered the evidence in term infants.\n\n【20】We know that 45% and 60% of atopic eczema cases occur in the first six months and year of life, respectively ( Bieber 2008 ). This period of time is when midwives, maternity workers and other infant health professionals have the most influence with parents. Health professionals find it difficult to give evidence‐based advice to new parents, as there is insufficient evidence to guide practice. It is therefore important to systematically review what evidence there is, to provide a high‐quality basis for clinical practice and informed decision‐making. Some oils are potentially harmful; however, others may provide some benefit. Given the rise in the prevalence of atopic eczema, it is timely to evaluate current evidence in order to provide the most appropriate advice for parents and health professionals.\n\n【21】This review will assess the effects of topical oils and emollients in the prevention or treatment of dry skin compared to the use of alternative oils and emollients or no treatment in term infants. The review will complement the body of work held in the _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_ , which includes reviews such as those investigating the prevention of infection in preterm infants ( Conner 2009 ; Seliem 2009 ) and the prevention of napkin dermatitis in infants ( Davies 2009 ).\n\n【22】A systematic review will provide:\n\n【23】1.  an evidence base to inform parents and health professionals in their practice with healthy term newborn infants, rather than remain in confusion regarding which oil or emollient, if any, to recommend or use; and\n    \n2.  highlight any area that requires further investigation.\n    \n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】We will assess the effect of the topical application of oils versus that of other topical oils, emollients, placebo or no treatment:\n\n【26】1\\. in the prevention of dry skin in term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) newborn infants; and\n\n【27】2\\. in the treatment of dry skin in term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) newborn infants.\n\n【28】Methods\n-------\n\n【29】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【30】#### Types of studies\n\n【31】All randomised and quasirandomised controlled trials (including cluster and parallel trials, and trials in which the infant serves as his/her own control) comparing the topical application of oils with the topical application of other oils, emollients or placebo, or with no treatment will be considered.\n\n【32】#### Types of participants\n\n【33】We will include newborn term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) infants receiving the application of topical oils or emollients:\n\n【34】1\\. for the prevention of dry skin within the first 28 days following birth; or\n\n【35】2\\. for the treatment of dry skin within the first 28 days following birth.\n\n【36】There is no upper gestational age limit for eligibility.\n\n【37】For the purposes of this review, dry skin will be diagnosed using a validated skin assessment scoring tool ( Lane 1993 ; Lund 2001 ) or skin surface hydration measurement tool (e.g. a Corneometer®), or by clinical observation by a midwifery, neonatal or dermatology health professional.\n\n【38】We will include infants with normal skin and infants with a family history of atopic eczema. Normal infant skin variations, such as erythema neonatorum, erythema toxicum or milia, will not be considered as skin disorders, and will therefore be included. A family history of atopic eczema will be defined as \"at least one of mother, father or sibling who has a medical diagnosis of atopic eczema/atopic dermatitis and who is treated with topical steroidal treatment\". Infants diagnosed with an impairment of epidermal integrity, abnormal epidermis or dermis, such as collodion infant or congenital ichthyosis, will be excluded.\n\n【39】We will exclude newborn preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation at birth) infants, as this population has been included in another review ( Seliem 2009 ).\n\n【40】#### Types of interventions\n\n【41】All of the stated interventions will be considered separately for both the prevention and treatment of dry skin.\n\n【42】**Intervention**\n\n【43】1.  Application of topical oils, which may include any type of oil (such as olive oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, borage oil, evening primrose oil, other vegetable oil) compared with placebo or no topical applications\n    \n2.  Application of topical emollients compared with placebo or no topical applications\n    \n\n【44】**Other Interventions**\n\n【45】1.  Intervention oil versus another topical oil\n    \n2.  Intervention emollient versus another topical application (such as emollient, gel, cream, lotion or powder)\n    \n3.  Intervention oil versus another topical application (such as emollient, gel, cream, lotion or powder)\n    \n\n【46】It is expected that other products, such as soaps or bathing products, may be used on the infants in the trials. It is also expected that there will be variations in the dose, area, frequency and duration of application of the interventions. If there are substantial differences across trials, data will not be pooled but reported separately. Where combinations of topical applications are applied, data from a combination of treatments will not be pooled with data for single treatments.\n\n【47】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【48】Where appropriate, data will be pooled or, if necessary (and appropriate), dichotomised. Outcomes will be analysed at baseline and at further time points up to 28 days (e.g. 7, 14, 28 days).\n\n【49】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【50】1.  Change in skin surface hydration, measured using a Corneometer® or similar validated tool, within 28 days following birth\n    \n2.  Change in TEWL, measured using an Aquaflux, Tewameter® or similar validated tool, within 28 days following birth\n    \n\n【51】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【52】1.  Change in skin assessment scores, measured using the Neonatal Skin Condition Score ( Lund 2001 ) or the Skin Condition Grading Scale ( Lane 1993 ) within 28 days following birth.\n    \n2.  Systemic or cutaneous infection, confirmed by diagnosis more than 48 hours after birth, as determined by culture of swabs from a normally sterile skin site\n    \n3.  Change in skin surface pH, measured using a Skin‐pH‐meter or similar validated tool, within 28 days following birth\n    \n4.  Atopic eczema, confirmed by clinical diagnosis by a dermatologist\n    \n5.  Clinical observations of adverse skin conditions (visible signs of skin barrier dysfunction such as erythema/rash), measured using a Mexameter® or similar validated tool, or documented clinical examination, within 28 days following birth\n    \n6.  Maternal satisfaction with regard to using oils for infant skin care or condition of infant's skin, as measured by questionnaire response\n    \n7.  Other skin‐related outcomes not identified a priori by the reviewers but reported by trial authors\n    \n\n【53】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【54】We will use the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.\n\n【55】#### Electronic searches\n\n【56】We will identify randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, latest issue of _The Cochrane Library_ ). We will identify all other trials from MEDLINE (1966 to current), EMBASE (1980 to current), CINAHL (1982 to current), Dissertation Abstracts (1980 to current) and SIGLE (2000 to current). We will list the full search strategies for these databases in the review. We will identify ongoing clinical trials through searching www.clinicaltrials.gov .\n\n【57】We will not apply any language restrictions. We will use the following text words or medical subject heading terms: infant, neonate, newborn, baby, plant oils, oils, emollients, oleic acid, oleic, linoleic, skin barrier function, epidermal barrier function, skin scores, atopic march, dry skin, atopic eczema, atopic dermatitis.\n\n【58】#### Searching other resources\n\n【59】We will search for further studies in the reference lists of all identified articles. We will not apply language, start date or geographical restrictions. We will approach the clinical research departments of all major pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies to request access to their unpublished research (see Appendix 1 ). We will contact subject experts to identify ongoing, unpublished research. Abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research, the American Pediatric Society, and the European Society for Paediatric Research, and published in the journal _Pediatric Research,_ will be handsearched. We will include trials presented in abstract form only if sufficient data are available from the abstract, or from contact with the author.\n\n【60】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【61】We will use the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.\n\n【62】#### Selection of studies\n\n【63】Two review authors (AC, TL) will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third review author (SV or MC).\n\n【64】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【65】We will design a form for the extraction of data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors (AC, TL) will extract data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third review author (SV/MC). We will enter data into Review Manager ( RevMan 2011 ) and check them for accuracy.\n\n【66】We will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details when information regarding the above is unclear.\n\n【67】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【68】Two review authors (AC, TL) will independently assess the risk of bias in each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third review author (SV/MC).\n\n【69】**(1)    Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)**\n\n【70】For each included study we will describe the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.\n\n【71】We will assess the method as:\n\n【72】*   adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);\n    \n*   inadequate (any non‐random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【73】**(2)    Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)**\n\n【74】For each included study we will describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【75】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【76】*   adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);\n    \n*   inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【77】**(3)    Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)**\n\n【78】We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors, participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will judge studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We will assess the methods for blinding separately under the headings: participants, personnel and outcomes.\n\n【79】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【80】*   adequate;\n    \n*   inadequate;\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【81】**(4)    Incomplete outcome date (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)**\n\n【82】We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total numbers of randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion, where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re‐include missing data in the analyses that we undertake.\n\n【83】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【84】*   adequate (where fewer than 20% of the data are missing);\n    \n*   inadequate (where more than 20% of the data are missing);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【85】**(5)    Selective reporting bias**\n\n【86】We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.\n\n【87】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【88】*   adequate (where it is clear that all of the study’s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);\n    \n*   inadequate (where not all of the study’s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【89】**(6)    Other sources of bias**\n\n【90】We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.\n\n【91】We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:\n\n【92】*   yes;\n    \n*   no;\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【93】**(7)    Overall risk of bias**\n\n【94】We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias, and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through sensitivity analyses ( _see_ ‘ Sensitivity analysis ’).\n\n【95】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【96】_**Dichotomous data**_\n\n【97】We will present results as summary risk ratios and risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data. If statistically significant, we will present the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial or harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH).\n\n【98】_**Continuous data**_\n\n【99】We will use the weighted mean difference for continuous data if outcomes are measured in the same way in all trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine data from trials that measure the same outcome using different methods. We will present these data with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【100】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【101】_**Randomised trials where participant serves as own control**_\n\n【102】We will include these trials along with individually randomised trials. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both types of study if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs.\n\n【103】_**Cluster randomised trials**_\n\n【104】We will include cluster randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes by means of the methods described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ , using an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population ( Higgins 2011 ). If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and an interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will seek statistical advice for this part of the analysis.\n\n【105】We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.\n\n【106】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【107】For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect using sensitivity analyses.\n\n【108】For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention‐to‐treat basis (i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and analyse all participants in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention). The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.\n\n【109】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【110】We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta‐analysis using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. We will identify heterogeneity using the following categories: less than 25%, no heterogeneity; 25% to 40%, low heterogeneity; 50% to 74%, moderate heterogeneity; and 75% or greater, high heterogeneity. We will explore substantial heterogeneity (≥ 75%), if identified, using subgroup analyses.\n\n【111】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【112】Where we suspect reporting bias ( _see_ ‘Selective reporting bias’), we will attempt to contact study authors asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results using sensitivity analyses.\n\n【113】We will create funnel plots using Review Manager version 5.2 ( RevMan 2011 ) and assess the presence of publication bias by visual inspection of the plots for funnel plot asymmetry. Unfortunately, where the effect measure for dichotomous outcomes is the relative risk (or risk ratio), as is the case for potentially two of the outcomes in this review (skin assessment scores and maternal satisfaction), there is limited evidence to underpin the statistical assessment of funnel plot asymmetry ( Higgins 2011 ). Therefore, we will limit our assessment of funnel plot asymmetry to a visual inspection only.\n\n【114】#### Data synthesis\n\n【115】Statistical analyses will be performed using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Review Manager version 5.2 ( RevMan 2011 ) will be used for meta‐analyses. We will use fixed‐effect meta‐analyses for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect (i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods are judged to be sufficiently similar). If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if we detect substantial statistical heterogeneity ( _see_ ‘ Assessment of heterogeneity ’), we will attempt to explain the heterogeneity identified in the fixed‐effect model based on differences in clinical, quality or other characteristics between studies.\n\n【116】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【117】We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses based on:\n\n【118】1.  setting: high‐income countries (gross national income (GNI) per capita $4036 or more) versus low‐income countries (GNI per capita $4035 or less ( World Bank 2012 ));\n    \n2.  ethnicity: white versus black and minority ethnic;\n    \n3.  family history of atopic eczema (“at least one of father, mother, or sibling, who has a medical diagnosis of atopic eczema and who has had topical steroid treatment”) versus no family history of atopic eczema.\n    \n\n【119】For fixed‐effect meta‐analyses, we will conduct planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by Deeks 2001 .\n\n【120】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【121】We will perform sensitivity analyses based on trial quality, separating high‐quality trials from trials of lower quality. We will define high quality, for the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, as a trial having adequate allocation concealment and a ‘reasonably expected loss to follow up’ (classified as less than 10%). We will restrict sensitivity analyses to primary outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs in reducing aggression and associated impulsivity.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The term aggression has been used to define a broad range of behaviours, which generally involve non‐accidental harm. This includes violence, defined by the World Health Organisation as _‘the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death or psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation.’_ Worldwide, violence is considered to be a major public health issue ( World Health Organization 2002 ), and survey data on criminal violence in the UK has revealed that in the year 2006/7 there were just under 2½ million violent crimes in private households. Aggression is also used to describe other disturbed behaviour, such as intentional damage to property or hostile agitation.\n\n【7】Two broad subtypes of aggression have been identified; instrumental and reactive ( Barratt 1999 ; Berkowitz 1993 ; Vitiello 1997 ). Instrumental aggression is more controlled and consciously goal‐directed. Reactive aggression, which is considered to be far more prevalent ( Nelson 2007 ), involves an emotionally driven reaction to frustration or perceived threat. A key feature of reactive aggression is impulsivity. Impulsivity describes a tendency to act on impulse, i.e. a sudden or involuntary inclination or tendency to act without premeditation or reflection.\n\n【8】There is a well established link between mental disorder and aggression. Aggressive behaviour is an integral part of some disorders. It should be noted that the conventional diagnostic systems, ICD 10 and DSM IV, have been shaped by the medical model that relies on the identification of symptoms to determine pathology. However, mental disorder diagnoses, especially those associated with aggression, give undue prominence to behaviours rather than underlying process disturbances. Consequently there is the tautological problem that the diagnostic criteria are used both to identify the disorder and to characterise the disorder. However many mental disorders including antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder appear to be aetiologically heterogeneous rather than distinct unitary phenomena. In the case of ‘intermittent explosive disorder’, extreme aggression is the defining feature. In this condition there is failure to resist aggressive impulses with a disproportionate response to stress (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association 2000 ). A study of psychiatric out‐patients found the life‐time prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder to be 7.3% ( Kessler 2006 ).\n\n【9】A history of aggression can contribute to the diagnosis of certain personality disorders. A _‘very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression’_ is a diagnostic feature of dissocial personality disorder under ICD‐10 ( World Health Organization 1993 ). The broader category of antisocial personality disorder within DSM‐IV includes the criterion _‘irritability and aggressiveness as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults_ ’.  Key features of borderline personality disorder under DSM‐IV are emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, which may be manifest in _‘inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g. frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)’_ . The ICD‐10 equivalent, ‘emotionally unstable personality disorder’, refers to _‘liability to outbursts of anger or violence’._ Impulsivity is also a diagnostic criterion in these two personality disorders.\n\n【10】Certain developmental disorders may also present with aggressive behaviour. Two of the four conduct disorder symptom clusters involve aggression (DSM‐IV‐TR). The _‘aggression to people and animals’_ cluster include items such as _‘often initiates fights’, ‘has used a weapon’_ and _‘has been physically cruel to people’._ There is also a _‘destruction of property’_ cluster which includes _‘has deliberately destroyed others’ property’_ . Oppositional defiant disorder is characterised by _‘a pattern of negativistic, hostile and defiant behaviour’_ (DSM‐IV‐TR).\n\n【11】There are other mental disorders which do not have aggression as a specific diagnostic criterion, but which have been found to be associated with an increased risk of aggression. Substance abuse disorders are strongly associated with aggression ( Nestor 2002 ). Epidemiological studies have established a modest but significant relationship between psychosis and violence ( Brennan 2000 ; Arseneault 2000 ; Fazel 2006 ). In the developmental period, attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder, which involves a loss of impulse control, is associated with aggression ( Staller 2007 ).  Across mental disorders, key traits that are associated with aggression are impulse control and affect regulation ( Nestor 2002 ).\n\n【12】It has long been recognised that aggression can be a feature of organic brain conditions ( Haller 2006 ). Aggressiveness may be specifically associated with frontal and temporal lobe damage ( Anderson 1999 ; Hawkins 2000 ). A diagnostic criterion of organic personality disorder is _‘irritability and/or outbursts of anger and aggression’_ ( World Health Organization 1993 ). A specific relationship between epilepsy and aggression has also been found in adults ( Kanemoto 1999 ; van Elst 2000 ) and children ( Connor 1996 ).\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】The use of antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of aggression has a relatively long track‐record (e.g. Tyrer 1988 ; Stein 1992 ) and there are some supporting data ( Goedhard 2006 ). Using a double‐blind crossover design phenytoin has been shown to be associated with a reduction in the frequency of acts of aggression by individuals in a community sample ( Stanford 2001 ) and in a prison sample ( Barratt 1997 ). A similar effect has been found with carbamazepine and sodium valproate ( Gardner 1986 ; Kavoussi 1989 ; Lindermayer 2000). The effect may be specific to impulsive aggression as opposed to instrumental aggression ( Barratt 1997 ; Stanford 2001 ).  There is some empirical support for the anti‐aggression effect of other antiepileptics, such as divalproex ( Hollander 2003 ; Hollander 2005 ), lamotrigine ( Tritt 2005 ) and topiramate ( Gobbi 2006 ).\n\n【15】An antiepileptic drug is defined here as one normally used prophylactically to reduce the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures. We will consider pharmacological interventions where an antiepileptic drug is given not only as monotherapy but also as an adjunctive intervention. The review will focus on studies of persistent/serious aggression. We will include, but not confine ourselves, to studies of individuals resistant to other interventions.\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】Impulsive reactive aggression reflects a high arousal state ( Haller 2006 ; Nelson 2007 ). It has been proposed that repeated acts of aggression, specifically of a reactive sort, may be underpinned by neuronal hyperexcitability, and there is some empirical support for this ( Keele 2005 ). Therefore drugs which reduce neuronal excitability, and specifically those classed as antiepileptics or anticonvulsants, could theoretically be expected to lower the likelihood of reactive aggressive outburst.\n\n【18】The precise mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. At a neurochemical level, an imbalance of gabaminergic systems is thought to be associated with aggression ( Nelson 2007 ; Siever 2008 ), and gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been found to suppress aggression in animal models ( Miczek 2002 ). Therefore it follows that pharmacological antiepileptic agents that act on gabaminergic neurons, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and valproate, may have a beneficial effect on aggressive behaviour.\n\n【19】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【20】Poorly controlled aggression is prevalent in society. It results in emotional and physical damage to victims, and is associated with considerable costs and distress. Medication has potential to provide one treatment option, and may be particularly relevant to individuals who seek treatment but who find difficulty engaging in psychological interventions. There is some evidence that antiepileptic drugs may be effective, but there are currently no clinical guidelines. A systematic review of the current evidence base is therefore timely.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs in reducing aggression and associated impulsivity.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】Randomised controlled trials in which participants have been randomly allocated to an experimental group and a control group.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】Individuals of any age, of either sex, from any cultural background, and in any setting who have displayed recurrent aggression as defined by the authors of the study. We will include participants diagnosed with a mental illness, personality disorder, impulse disorder, or who have received a brain injury, but will exclude people with dementia. We will include studies where antiepileptics are used to treat people with epilepsy, but only if they have also displayed recurrent aggression.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Any antiepileptic drug (including all antiepileptic drugs listed in Section 4.8 of the British National Formulary) in any dosage, used for any length of time, and measured against a placebo.\n\n【31】For the purpose if this review, an antiepileptic drug is defined as one used prophylactically to reduce the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures. Drugs used in the acute treatment of status epilepticus but which are not generally prescribed for the prophylaxis of epileptic seizures (such as chlormethiazole, diazepam, fosphenytoin, lorazepam, midazolam, paraldehyde) are excluded. We will not include studies where antiepileptic drugs are used to treat acute presentations, as in rapid tranquillisation procedures.\n\n【32】We will include studies where the antiepileptic drug being evaluated is given as an adjunct to another drug not classed as an antiepileptic or as an adjunct to a psychological intervention. Comparisons might therefore include:\n\n【33】*   Antiepileptic versus placebo\n    \n*   Antiepileptic plus other drug treatment versus placebo plus other drug treatment\n    \n*   Antiepileptic plus psychological treatment versus placebo plus psychological treatment\n    \n\n【34】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【35】A number of validated instruments have been developed for the measurement of aggression. To date, however, no single measure has been identified as a superior and we therefore anticipate finding a range of outcome measures in studies identified for inclusion in this review.\n\n【36】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【37】_(a) Primary outcomes_\n\n【38】1\\. Aggression (self‐reported): reduction in aggressive behaviour or aggressive feelings; continuous outcome, measured through improvement in scores on the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Buss 1992 ), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay 1989 ) or similar validated instrument.\n\n【39】2.  Aggression (observer‐reported): reduction in aggressive behaviour; continuous outcome, measured through improvement in scores on the _Modified Overt Aggression Scale_ (MOAS; Malone 1994 ) or the _Overt Aggression Scale‐Modified_ (OAS‐M, Coccaro 1991 ) or similar validated instrument; or as number of observed incidents.\n\n【40】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【41】_(b) Secondary outcomes_\n\n【42】1\\. Impulsivity: self‐reported improvement in impulsivity; continuous outcome, measured through reduction in scores on the _Barratt Impulsivity Scale_ (BIS: Patton 1995 ) or similar validated instrument.\n\n【43】2\\. Hostility: improvement in hostility; continuous outcome, measured through reduction in scores on the hostility subscale of the observer‐reported _Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale_ , on the hostility subscale of the self‐reported _SCL‐90_ ( Derogartis 1973 ) or using a similar validated instrument.\n\n【44】3\\. Anger: self‐reported improvement in anger expression and control; continuous outcome, measured through reduction in scores on the _State‐Trait Anger Expression Inventory‐2 (_ STAXI‐II; Spielberger 1999 ) or similar validated instrument.\n\n【45】4\\. Quality of life: self‐reported improvement in overall quality of life; continuous outcome, measured through improvement in scores on the European quality of life instrument (EuroQol ( EuroQoL group 1990 )) or similar validated instrument.\n\n【46】5\\. Satisfaction with care: continuous outcome; measured through improvement in scores on the _Client Satisfaction Questionnaire_ (CSQ‐8; Attkisson 1982 ) or similar validated instrument.\n\n【47】6\\. Non‐compliance: measured as proportion of participants discontinuing treatment; continuous\n\n【48】7\\. Adverse events: measured as incidence of overall adverse events and of the three most common adverse events; dichotomous outcome, measured as numbers reporting.\n\n【49】Outcomes will be divided into short term (within one month), medium term (between one month and six months) and long term (between six and twelve months).\n\n【50】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【51】#### Electronic searches\n\n【52】The following electronic databases will be searched:\n\n【53】‐ Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n\n【54】‐ MEDLINE\n\n【55】‐ EMBASE\n\n【56】‐ CINAHL\n\n【57】‐ CENTRAL (the most recent edition of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register)\n\n【58】‐ PsycINFO\n\n【59】‐ Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials on aggression\n\n【60】‐ metaRegister of Controlled Trials\n\n【61】The search terms for MEDLINE will be as follows:\n\n【62】(exp Homicide/ OR homicid$.tw.

We will also examine bibliographies of systematic review articles published in the last five years to identify relevant studies.\n\n【69】We will contact authors of relevant studies to enquire about other sources of information and the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished data. Pharmaceutical companies will be contacted to request information about any published/unpublished trials using antiepileptics in the treatment of people with recurrent aggression.\n\n【70】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【71】#### Selection of studies\n\n【72】Titles and abstracts will be identified, read and reviewed independently by two reviewers (NH & MF) against the inclusion criteria. Full copies of studies which appear to meet the inclusion criteria will be assessed by two independent reviewers. Uncertainties concerning the appropriateness of studies for inclusion in the review will be resolved through consultation with a third reviewer (RN). Reviewers will not be blinded to the name(s) of the study author(s), their institution(s) or publication sources at any stage of the review.\n\n【73】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【74】Data will be extracted independently by two reviewers (NH & MF) using a data extraction form. Data will be entered into RevMan 5. Where data are not available in the published trial reports, we will contact the authors and ask them to supply the missing information.\n\n【75】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【76】_Assessment of risk of bias in included studies_\n\n【77】For each included study, two reviewers (NH & MF) will independently complete the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2008 , section 8.5.1). Any disagreement will be resolved through consultation with a third reviewer (RN). We will assess the degree to which:\n\n【78】·       the allocation sequence was adequately generated (‘sequence generation’)\n\n【79】·       the allocation was adequately concealed (‘allocation concealment’)\n\n【80】·       knowledge of the allocated interventions was adequately prevented during the study (‘blinding’)\n\n【81】·       incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed\n\n【82】·       reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting\n\n【83】·       the study was apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias\n\n【84】Each domain will be allocated one of three possible categories for each of the included studies: ‘Yes’ for low risk of bias, ‘No’ for high risk of bias, and ‘Unclear’ where the risk of bias is uncertain or unknown.\n\n【85】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【86】For dichotomous (binary) data, the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be used to summarise results within each study. The odds ratio is chosen because it has statistical advantages relating to its sampling distribution and its suitability for modelling, and is a relative measure so can be used to combine studies. For continuous data, such as the measurement of impulsiveness and aggression on a scale, the mean score for each outcome as determined by a standardised tool will be compared between the two groups to give a mean difference (MD), again with a 95% confidence interval. Where possible, these comparisons will be made at specific follow‐up periods: (1) within the first month, (2) between one and six months, and (3) between six and twelve months. Where possible, endpoint data will be presented. Where both endpoint and change data are available for the same outcomes, then only the former will be reported.\n\n【87】Continuous data that are skewed will be reported in a separate table, and treatment effect sizes will not be calculated to minimise the risk of applying parametric statistics to data that departs significantly from a normal distribution. We will define skewness as occurring when, for a scale or measure with positive values and a minimum value of zero, the mean is less than twice the standard deviation ( Altman 1996 ).\n\n【88】We will use the weighted mean difference (WMD) where the same outcome measures are reported in more than one study. The standardised mean difference (SMD) will be used where different outcome measures of the same construct are reported.\n\n【89】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【90】(a) Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【91】Where trials have used clustered randomization, we anticipate that study investigators would have presented their results after appropriately controlling for clustering effects (robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If it is unclear whether a cluster‐randomized trial has used appropriate controls for clustering, the study investigators will be contacted for further information. Where appropriate controls were not used, individual participant data will be requested and re‐analysed using multilevel models which control for clustering. Following this, effect sizes and standard errors will be meta‐analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse method ( Higgins 2008 ). If appropriate controls were not used and individual participant data is not available, statistical guidance will be sought from the Cochrane Method Group and external experts as to which method to apply to the published results in attempt to control for clustering. If there is insufficient information to control for clustering, outcome data will be entered into RevMan using individuals as the units of analysis, and then sensitivity analysis will be used to assess the potential biasing effects of inadequately controlled clustered trials ( Donner 2001 ).\n\n【92】(b) Crossover trials\n\n【93】When conducting a meta‐analysis combining the results of crossover trials, we will use the inverse variance methods recommended by Elbourne ( Elbourne 2002 ). Where data presented from a crossover trial is restricted (and more information is not available from the original investigators) we will use the presented data within the first phase only, up to the point of crossover.\n\n【94】(c) Multi‐arm trials\n\n【95】All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be included in this review.\n\n【96】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【97】We will contact the original investigators to request any missing data and information on whether or not it can be assumed to be ‘missing at random’.\n\n【98】For dichotomous data: we will report missing data and dropouts for each included study and will report the number of participants who are included in the final analysis as a proportion of all participants in each study. We will provide reasons for missing data in the narrative summary and will assess the extent to which the results of the review could be altered by the missing data by, for example, a sensitivity analysis based on consideration of 'best‐case' and 'worst‐case' scenarios ( Gamble 2005 ). Here, the 'best‐case' scenario is that where all participants with missing outcomes  in the experimental condition had good outcomes, and all those with missing outcomes in the control condition had poor outcomes, and the 'worst‐case' scenario is the converse ( Higgins 2008 , section 16.2.2).\n\n【99】For missing continuous data, we will provide a qualitative summary. The standard deviations of the outcome measures should be reported for each group in each trial. If these are not given, we will impute standard deviations using relevant data (for example, standard deviations or correlation coefficients) from other, similar studies ( Follmann 1992 ) but only if, after seeking statistical advice, to do so is deemed practical and appropriate.\n\n【100】We will report separately all data from studies where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow‐up, and will exclude these from any meta‐analyses. In studies with less than 50% drop out rate, we will consider people leaving early to have had the negative outcome, except for adverse effects such as death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25 to 50%) will be subjected to sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this group results in a substantive change in the estimate of effect of the primary outcomes, we will not add data from these studies to trials with less attrition, but will present them separately.\n\n【101】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【102】We will assess the extent of between‐trial differences and the consistency of results of any meta‐analysis in three ways: by visual inspection of the forest plots, by performing the Chi squared test of heterogeneity (where a significance level less than 0.10 will be interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity), and by examining the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic ( Higgins 2008 ; section 9.5.2). The I <sup>2 </sup> statistic describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We will consider I <sup>2 </sup> values less than 30% as indicating low heterogeneity, values in the range 31% to 69% as indicating moderate heterogeneity, and values greater than 70% as indicating high heterogeneity. We will attempt to identify any significant determinants of heterogeneity categorised at moderate or high.\n\n【103】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【104】Funnel plots (effect size versus standard error) will be drawn to assess publication bias if sufficient studies are found. Asymmetry of the plots may indicate publication bias, although they may also represent a true relationship between trial size and effect size. If such a relationship is identified, the clinical diversity of the studies will be further examined as a possible explanation ( Egger 1997 ).\n\n【105】#### Data synthesis\n\n【106】We will undertake a quantitative synthesis of the data using both fixed and random effects models. Meta‐analysis will be performed where we consider studies to have sufficiently similar participants, interventions, comparators and outcome measures.  In carrying out meta‐analysis, the weight given to each study will be the inverse of the variance so that the more precise estimates (from larger studies with more events) are given more weight.\n\n【107】In addition, the weighted average of the results of all the available studies will be used to provide an estimate of the effect of antiepileptic drugs for aggression and impulsiveness. Where appropriate and if a sufficient number of studies are found, we will use regression techniques to investigate the effects of differences in the study characteristics on the estimate of the treatment effects. Statistical advice will be sought before attempting meta‐regression. If meta‐regression is performed, this will be executed using a random effects model.\n\n【108】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【109】If sufficient studies are found, we will undertake subgroup analysis to examine the effect on primary outcomes of:\n\n【110】(1) participants’ age\n\n【111】(2) participants’ principal diagnosis, e.g. personality disorder, learning disability, ADHD)\n\n【112】(3) setting (inpatient; custodial; outpatient/community)\n\n【113】(4) class of antiepileptic drug\n\n【114】Where we find a number of studies with participants aged less that 18 years, we will perform sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of including/excluding this younger sample.\n\n【115】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【116】If there is sufficient data, we will undertake sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of the overall findings in relation to certain study characteristics. _A priori_ sensitivity analyses are planned for:\n\n【117】(1) concealment of allocation\n\n【118】(2) blinding of outcome assessors\n\n【119】(3) extent of dropouts", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy and safety of B‐TURP compared to M‐TURP for treating patients with LUTS secondary to BPO.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】There is evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) ( Mamoulakis 2009 ) and RCT‐based meta‐analyses ( Mamoulakis 2009a ) that bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (B‐TURP) carries some advantages over its ancestor, the conventional monopolar TURP (M‐TURP) in the management of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO).\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Male LUTS include urinary storage symptoms (daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, incontinence), voiding symptoms (slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining, terminal dribble), and post micturition symptoms (sensation of incomplete emptying, post micturition dribble). Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is histologically characterized by cellular proliferation of the epithelial and stromal tissues of the prostate. It is a non‐malignant condition that inevitably affects almost every aging male and there is a general agreement on its progressive nature ( Djavan 2002 ). Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) refers to an increase in size of the prostate due to BPH. About 50% of men with BPH will develop BPE, 25% to 50% will present LUTS and approximately 50% of men with LUTS have bladder outlet obstruction ( CG97 LUTS: NICE guideline, 2010 ). BPH‐related obstruction, namely BPO (obstruction that has been proven by pressure flow studies, or is highly suspected from flow rates and if the gland is enlarged ( Abrams 2009 ) without any suspicion for prostate cancer), can be associated with bothersome LUTS that reduce the quality of life (QoL). The incidence rate of LUTS/BPH is high and increases linearly with age, as shown by a large retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands ( Verhamme 2002 ). It has been estimated to be 15 ‰ man‐years overall, increasing from 3 cases per 1000 man‐years at the age of 45‐49 years to 38 cases per 1000 man‐years at the age of 75 to 79 years, and remaining constant thereafter. Around 4.5 million visits were recorded to physician offices for a primary diagnosis of BPH and almost 8 million visits were made with a primary or secondary diagnosis of BPH during the year 2000 in the United States. Within this year, the estimated direct treatment cost was $1.1 billion (USD) exclusive of outpatient pharmaceuticals ( Wei 2008 ). Surgery for LUTS secondary to BPO is the 10th most common operation in the National Health Service UK ( Kirby 2010 ). Consequently, the tremendous impact of the disease on the QoL and health care cost justifies additional research into therapeutic resource use, effectiveness and cost benefit of treatment strategies.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】TURP has been considered the gold standard for the surgical management of LUTS secondary to BPO mainly due to its well‐documented long‐term efficacy ( Reich 2006 ). Traditionally, it is carried out with a monopolar electrosurgical unit (ESU) using a non‐conductive hypo‐osmolar irrigation medium such as as mannitol, sorbitol, or glycine solutions, which may place the patient at risk of dilutional hyponatraemia and transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome. In M‐TURP an active electrode (loop) transmits energy into the prostate, and a return one completes the circuit at the skin level (skin pad). Since the system works in a nonconductive solution, the body serves as the conduit between electrodes. The longer the distance between electrodes (more body tissue must be traversed), the higher the voltage needed to drive current to the return electrode. Consequently, in M‐TURP systems, excessive voltage is required to push energy through the body. Thus, M‐TURP is usually performed using high energy setting, the loop is often over‐energized, and energy travelling/cutting is too fast through tissue with minimal coagulation effect ( Issa 2008 ).\n\n【10】Despite a decreasing trend over time, M‐TURP complications may still occur ( Rassweiler 2006 ). Procedural negative outcomes have been reduced due to significant technological improvements achieved during the recent years but complications such as TUR syndrome, bleeding and urethral strictures remain a concern ( Rassweiler 2006 ; Hawary 2009 ). In a large scale, multicenter, observational study on patients with LUTS secondary to BPO submitted to TURP it was shown that mortality rate has decreased (0.1%) but morbidity, although reduced, is still considered high (11.1%) ( Reich 2008 ). Nevertheless, In the absence of strong, high quality evidence favouring newer surgical methods, including minimally invasive techniques ( Burke 2010 ; Ahyai 2010 ), M‐TURP remains clinically effective ( Lourenco 2008 ; Lourenco 2008a ; Lourenco 2008b ).\n\n【11】Incorporation of bipolar technology represents a recent technical modification of TURP. In B‐TURP systems, the active and return poles are incorporated into the electrode design. The circuit is completed between the poles at the site of surgery. Therefore, the energy remains confined at the resection site instead of travelling through the body. Consequently, B‐TURP systems require less energy/voltage compared to M‐TURP systems to complete the circuit because of the relatively less tissue (resistance) encountered. B‐TURP addresses the fundamental flaw of M‐TURP by allowing performance in a conductive fluid medium (normal saline). Consequently, the risks of dilutional hyponatraemia and TUR syndrome are expected to be eliminated, allowing for longer and safer resection ( Issa 2008 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】During M‐TURP, most of the energy is converted to heat at the prostate level, rather than been dissipated through the non‐conductive irrigation medium, and the effect of cutting and/or coagulation is achieved.\n\n【14】During B‐TURP, energy is transmitted from the active electrode to the surrounding conductive solution. As a result, the water evaporates, creating an interface gas layer that surrounds the loop, and poses resistance to the energy flow. By adding voltage to the gas layer, sodium ions get excited, orange radiation is emitted, and a highly energized state of matter (the plasma) is formed around the active electrode that gives a characteristic glowing appearance to the loop. The plasma consists of charged particles that move freely. They can be easily cleaved to cause initial tissue disruption at a molecular level, allowing subsequent relatively low voltage to separate tissue. Plasma formation needs therefore high current initially. Subsequently, plasma maintenance requires minimal voltage and energy. Thus, B‐TURP systems can utilize plasma formation on the surface of the electrode to minimize the voltage needed to enable tissue resection. The coagulation mechanism is different. Initial heating effect occurs, but plasma formation is prevented because voltage is kept at a low level and the current cannot overcome the high gas layer resistance. The energy dissipates as heat within the vessel walls resulting in coagulum formation by tissue and blood that seals the bleeders. Instead of the orange glow of energized plasma associated with cutting, white tissue blanching is observed, which indicates the coagulum formation and collagen shrinkage ( Issa 2008 ).\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Despite the fact that B‐TURP has been introduced since years, it seems that its true merits over M‐TURP still remain obscured ( Reich 2009 ). We recently conducted a comparative effectiveness meta‐analysis ( Mamoulakis 2009a ), the largest one published to date ( Ahyai 2010 ; Burke 2010 ; Lourenco 2008 ; Lourenco 2008a ; Mamoulakis 2010 ), focusing on the comparison of efficacy and safety of the two techniques. Best available evidence was provided thus, for the first time, showing that no clinically relevant differences exist in short‐term efficacy (at 12 months of follow up), and complication rates (acute urine retention (AUR) after catheter removal, blood transfusions or urethral strictures). Nevertheless, it was concluded that B‐TURP is preferable due to a more favourable safety profile (elimination of TUR syndrome, less bleeding: lower clot retention and blood transfusion rates with the use of Gyrus device (ACMI Southborough, MA, USA)), shorter irrigation and catheterization duration. In addition, the lack of well‐designed international/multicenter RCTs and the generally low methodological quality of the existing trials was underlined. To the best of our knowledge, at least nine new RCT‐based papers have been recently published ( Chen 2009 ; Chen 2010 ; Fagerstrom 2010 ; Kong 2009 ; Michielsen 2010 ; Michielsen 2010a ; Singhania 2010 ; Acuña‐López 2010 ), including results from the first international multicenter trial ( Mamoulakis 2011 ). This flurry of trials has resulted in an increase of around 50% of the existing RCT‐based publications (>90% increase in the total number of patients evaluated). We aim at providing updated information by including the data from all published RCTs after our previous systematic literature search end (19 February 2009) and at rating the quality of the existing evidence by adopting the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach ( Balshem 2011 ; Guyatt 2008 ; Guyatt 2011a ; Guyatt 2011b ; Guyatt 2011c ; Guyatt 2011d ; Guyatt 2011e ; Guyatt 2011f ; Guyatt 2011g ; Guyatt 2011h ).\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the efficacy and safety of B‐TURP compared to M‐TURP for treating patients with LUTS secondary to BPO.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】RCTs comparing B‐TURP with M‐TURP for the treatment of patients with LUTS secondary to BPO.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Patients with LUTS secondary to BPO as defined above ( Abrams 2009 ), having an indication for TURP.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】B‐TURP or M‐TURP as defined above.\n\n【27】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【28】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【29】The main outcome measures for efficacy will include:\n\n【30】*   International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire results (including QoL score) measured at 3‐ to 6‐month intervals postoperatively until the maximum follow up point recorded;\n    \n*   re‐TURP.\n    \n\n【31】The main outcome measures for safety will include postoperative occurrence of:\n\n【32】*   drop in serum sodium level;\n    \n*   TUR syndrome;\n    \n*   drop in haemoglobin level;\n    \n*   need for blood transfusion;\n    \n*   clot retention;\n    \n*   AUR after catheter removal;\n    \n*   urinary tract infections;\n    \n*   meatal stenosis;\n    \n*   bladder neck contracture;\n    \n*   urethral strictures;\n    \n*   urinary Incontinence;\n    \n*   erectile dysfunction;\n    \n*   retrograde ejaculation;\n    \n*   death (mortality) from all causes.\n    \n\n【33】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【34】*   Operation time\n    \n*   Duration of bladder irrigation\n    \n*   Catheterization time\n    \n*   Hospitalisation time\n    \n*   Postoperative maximum flow rate (Qmax)\n    \n\n【35】Primary and secondary outcomes, as defined above, have been classified by the review authors as critical, important or not‐important from patient’s perspective for making decision. GRADE working group strongly recommends including up to seven critical outcomes in a systematic review to be assessed via GRADE approach. Thus, the final decision on the selection of the seven outcomes to be rated has been based on a consensus among the review authors.\n\n【36】In this systematic review, GRADE methodology will be applied for assessing the quality of evidence of the following outcomes:\n\n【37】*   postoperative IPSS questionnaire results;\n    \n*   TUR syndrome;\n    \n*   blood transfusion;\n    \n*   clot retention;\n    \n*   AUR after catheter removal;\n    \n*   urethral strictures;\n    \n*   catheterization time.\n    \n\n【38】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【39】The literature will be systematically searched with the assistance of a clinical librarian to detect all RCTs comparing B‐TURP with M‐TURP in patients with LUTS secondary to BPO. No temporal, regional, publication status, or language restrictions will be set. If necessary, official translations into English or Dutch will be obtained through the independent Dutch Interpretation and Translation Center ( http://www.tvcn.nl/en/ ).\n\n【40】#### Electronic searches\n\n【41】The following electronic databases will be used up to January 2012: Medline (from 1950 onwards), Embase (from 1980 onwards), Science Citation Index (form 1975 onwards), and the Cochrane Library (from 1950 onwards). The search strategy that will be followed is summarized in ' Appendix 1' . Searches of other electronic sources ( www.google.com ) will also be performed using the general terms \"bipolar\" AND \"prostate\".\n\n【42】#### Searching other resources\n\n【43】The official web sites of the manufacturers of all currently commercially available B‐TURP systems will be also checked. The reference lists of all selected papers will be handsearched for potentially relevant trials.\n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】Two review authors (CM & DU) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of the articles identified from the search for relevance and design. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion, and final decision will be based on a consensus. Of the trials that seem to meet the inclusion criteria, or are impossible to reject with certainty based on title and abstract, a full text copy of the article will be obtained. Any published RCT in the form of full paper comparing B‐TURP with M‐TURP for the treatment of patients with LUTS secondary to BPO that reports on any primary or secondary outcome of interest defined, will be eligible for inclusion. Citations in abstract form, trials that studied different interventions (e.g., transurethral vaporization of the prostate or laser technology), and non‐RCTs will be excluded.\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】Two review authors (CM & DU) will independently extract and summarise study characteristics and outcomes of the selected trials, including information on study design, subject characteristics, interventions, follow‐up, treatment outcomes, and adverse events using a predefined data extraction sheet. One review author will enter quantitative data into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (RevMan 5.1) software, and the other review author will check it. Unreported complications will be considered to be not recorded unless specifically stated as not occurring. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, and final decision will be based on a consensus.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】The methodological quality assessment of the selected RCTs will be based on the Dutch Cochrane Collaboration checklist, which is in accordance with Table 8.5.a of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2009 ). This tool addresses six specific domains, namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. baseline imbalance, source of funding). Blinding and completeness of outcome data will be assessed for each outcome separately. We will complete a risk of bias table for each eligible study. It will also be done by the two investigators independently. We will present our assessment of the risk of bias using a \"risk of bias summary figure\", which presents all judgments in a cross‐tabulation of study by entry. This display of internal validity indicates the weight the reader may give to the results of each study.\n\n【51】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【52】When appropriate, the mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) will be presented for continuous outcomes. The absolute risk reduction, i.e. risk difference (RD), will be presented for dichotomous outcomes, which is an absolute effect measure that expresses the difference between the experimental and the control event rates. This will allow calculation of the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH). If data can be pooled, depending on heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ), summary estimates of treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for every comparison and the P value for the overall treatment effect will be added.\n\n【53】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【54】Trials to be included should randomise individual patients with LUTS secondary to BPO into either M‐TURP or B‐TURP arm (parallel group design). Quasi‐randomised trials will not be used.\n\n【55】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【56】Missing data (e.g. mean values or standard deviations) or additional information required will be sought and retrieved from authors/sponsors of trials, who will be contacted if necessary, whenever possible.\n\n【57】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【58】Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I <sup>₂ </sup> statistic. In the absence of heterogeneity (I <sup>₂ </sup> < 30%), a fixed‐effect model will be used. A random‐effects model will be used for mild heterogeneity (I <sup>₂ </sup> 30% to 60%). For I <sup>₂ </sup> \\> 60% we will refrain from performing a meta‐analysis.\n\n【59】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【60】The presence of publication bias, if any, will be evaluated using funnel plots ( Egger 1997 ).\n\n【61】#### Data synthesis\n\n【62】Available efficacy and safety RCT data will be meta‐analysed, if applicable, in RevMan 5.1 software. Quality of evidence will be rated using the GRADE Working Group GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro 3.6) software.\n\n【63】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【64】The various bipolar systems (Vista Coblation/controlled tissue resection (CTR) system (ACMI, Southborough, MA, USA); Gyrus (ACMI Southborough, MA, USA); TURis <sup>® </sup> (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan); S(a)line Resectoscope (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany); Tekno Tom (Tekno‐Medical, Tuttlingen, Germany); AUTOCON <sup>® </sup> II 400 ESU (Karl Storz Endoscope, Tuttlingen, Germany)) share a common feature, namely the ability to perform in normal saline ( Rassweiler 2007 ; Issa 2008 ). However, some of them are considered \"quasi‐\" rather than \"true\" bipolar systems because they do not meet the definition that requires both electrodes be attached to a single port (International Electrotechnical Commission 1998; www.iec.ch ). Therefore, each one follows distinct electrophysiological principles regarding current flow due to the different configuration‐arrangement of the active and neutral electrode (mainly the position and shape of the latter) at the resectoscope, which may result in significant clinical effects Faul 2008 . Consequently, efficacy, and principally safety should be cautiously and separately evaluated for each system ( Faul 2008 ). For this reason, subgroup analysis of the different bipolar systems used in RCTs will be performed to check for potential differences.\n\n【65】Furthermore, subgroup analysis of the different hypo‐osmolar solutions used for M‐TURP in RCTs will be performed to check for potential differences. Finally, subgroup analyses will be optionally (if possible) carried out, considering patient or disease factors reported to influence TURP outcomes (preoperative prostate volume or prostate resection weight: >60 gm, 30‐60 gm and <30 gm; preoperative catheterization state: patients on catheterization vs. patients not on catheterization) ( Reich 2008 ).\n\n【66】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【67】Sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on the methodological quality of the studies and pending results of clinical/statistical assessment of heterogeneity. In the case of clinical or statistical heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses will be attempted to facilitate the meta‐analysis by omitting trials with an apparent reason for heterogeneity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the effects of interventions to enhance adherence to airway clearance treatment and exercise therapy in people with CF and their effects on health outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations, exercise capacity, health‐related QoL and healthcare costs.\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which affects exocrine glands (predominantly lungs and pancreas) throughout the body. A genetic mutation affecting the CF membrane trans‐regulator protein (CFTR) acts on chloride channels, leading to excessive reabsorption of sodium and water across cell membranes; this produces dehydrated extracellular fluid and subsequently thick secretions ( Ratjen 2009 ). In the lungs, airway liquid depletion impairs mucociliary transport, making thick secretions difficult to clear; these accumulate causing repeated respiratory tract infection, poor mucociliary clearance, persistent bacterial colonisation and irreversible damage ( Hurt 2012 ). Indeed, respiratory failure is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in CF ( Radtke 2017 ). Consequences of progressive respiratory disease (productive cough, haemoptysis, breathlessness and reduced exercise capacity) ( Bott 2009 ), plus pancreatic insufficiency characterised by poor absorption of protein and fat ( Ratjen 2009 ), with subsequent malnutrition ( O'Sullivan 2009 ), result in a reduced quality of life (QoL) ( Britto 2004 ; Dobbin 2005 ).\n\n【8】Physiotherapy is an integral and essential component for managing CF ( Bott 2009 ; CF Trust 2017 ; NICE 2017 ). Physiotherapy may comprise multimodal interventions, e.g. the management of musculoskeletal conditions and stress urinary incontinence ( Button 2016 ); however, the cornerstone of treatment (and therefore the focus of this review) involves the assessment and management of cardiovascular capacity (exercise) ( Radtke 2017 ), and airway clearance ( Sherman 2019 ; Wilson 2019 ) with or without the use of non‐invasive ventilation ( Moran 2017 ). There is significant variation in the range of physiotherapy management options for people with CF, but the treatment regimen is invariably acknowledged as burdensome for the patient and carer(s) across the course of their life. The median number of treatments per day for an adult with CF is seven, which constitutes an average daily treatment duration of between 108 min to three hours ( Dodd 2000 ; Sawicki 2009 ). Consequently, given the reported time burden, non‐adherence to physiotherapy is an ongoing challenge in the treatment of CF ( O'Donohoe 2014 ). Self‐reported adherence to airway clearance in adults with CF is approximately 30% ( Meyers 2006 ), with a documented decline of up to 50% in adherence in adolescence ( Arias Llorente 2008 ). Non‐adherence to exercise (defined as planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity with the aim of improving or maintaining physical fitness ( Casperson 1985 )) has also been described; however, it is suggested that the perception of exercise therapy is generally viewed more positively by individuals with CF given its focus on health promotion rather than illness management ( Rand 2014 ). Factors such as the impact on activities of daily living and social functioning, treatment burden, accidental or purposeful forgetting, no perceived benefit of and \"being unpleasant\" have been identified as influencing non‐adherence ( Arias Llorente 2008 ; Conway 1996 ; Dodd 2000 ; George 2010 ). Poor adherence to all aspects of CF treatment has been associated with an increased number of infective pulmonary exacerbations and the need for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy ( Eakin 2011 ). The consequences of poor physiotherapy adherence are significant both for individuals with CF (reduced QoL, malaise and mortality) and in terms of healthcare costs ( Wildman 2014 ).\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Individuals with CF require an extensive, complex treatment regimen focused on medication, airway clearance techniques and exercise participation ( Bott 2009 ; NICE 2017 ). Adherence is defined as \"the extent to which a person's behaviour (i.e. taking medication, following a diet and/or executing lifestyle changes), corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider\" ( WHO 2003 ). Adherence and persistence to treatment in CF varies by specific intervention; adherence is generally poorer for ACT when compared to most medication use ( Myers 2006 ). Poor adherence to physiotherapy has been estimated to be about 60% ( Bregnballe 2011 ); it leads to an increase in episodes of acute infection and hospital admission, which may contribute to premature death ( Meyers 2006 ). Barriers to physiotherapy adherence in people with CF are multifactorial ( Abbott 1994 ; Bregnballe 2011 ; Conway 1996 ; Geiss 1992 ; George 2010 ; Sawicki 2009 ), in particular the high time‐demand of daily management is evidenced ( Arias Llorente 2008 ; Bernard 2004 ; Bregnballe 2011 ). Although adherence to physiotherapy treatment varies between individuals, it is particularly poor in adolescents and young adults with CF ( Arias Llorente 2008 ; Bregnballe 2011 ; Conway 1996 ; Eakin 2011 ; George 2010 ; O'Donohoe 2014 ). Clinical variables (e.g. disease severity), demographic characteristics and knowledge for the condition have not been demonstrated as reliable predictors of treatment adherence ( Sherman 2019 ). Contemporary work has considered the application of social cognitive theory, in particular the influence of psychosocial variables such as self‐efficacy and self‐confidence in overcoming barriers to treatment components, as well as the influence of subjective norms ( Bishay 2016 ; George 2010 ; Sherman 2019 ).\n\n【11】Interventions that aim to enhance adherence to physiotherapy in people with CF may improve functional and health‐related QoL; these include psycho‐educational interventions (leaflets, videos, apps aimed at increasing knowledge and understanding), psychotherapeutic or motivational interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), contingent privileges or rewards, setting realistic expectations, motivational interviewing), or organisational interventions (self‐management diary, electronic reminders, technology‐based interventions such as active gaming, apps, tele‐care) ( Duff 2010 ). Evaluation of these strategies will provide evidence to inform clinical practice and improve healthcare outcomes for people with CF.\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】The development of complex prophylactic management and treatment options for symptomatic relief has led to an increased median predicted survival age from young childhood to over 40 years of age ( Preston 2014 ); however, although adherence to these interventions is essential for efficacy ( Eakin 2011 ; Sawicki 2009 ), adherence to physiotherapy airway clearance techniques and exercise remains lower than other treatments ( Meyers 1999 ). Identifying patient‐reported barriers to treatment adherence has been considered essential for developing approaches targeted at modifiable factors ( Sherman 2019 ). Psycho‐educational interventions target knowledge and understanding of the condition and treatment benefits and barriers; some studies have suggested that there are significant gaps in knowledge across people with CF and their families ( Lonabaugh 2018 ), or that the information is suppressed as part of an individual's coping style ( Duff 2010 ). Psychotherapeutic and motivational approaches are broadly aimed at reducing stress, improving coping styles and strategies, and exploring ambivalence or enhancing behaviour change in favour of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen ( Goldbeck 2014 ). Organisational interventions assist in the organisation and time management of treatments, e.g. providing active reminders or prompts, scheduling strategies, or tailoring treatments to lifestyle or life‐stage, e.g. encouraging exercise through active video gaming.\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Physiotherapy is generally considered to be an integral and essential component of the management of CF ( Bott 2009 ; NICE 2017 ). The consequences of poor physiotherapy adherence may be potentially significant both for individuals with CF (repeated respiratory infection, reduced exercise tolerance, breathlessness, reduced QoL, malaise and reduced life expectancy) and in terms of healthcare costs (increased use of pharmacology, GP access and hospital admission). As such, evidence‐based strategies to inform clinical practice and improve adherence to physiotherapy management are believed to be significant for improving QoL for the individual and reducing economic burden; this area of research has been raised as a priority by the James Lind Alliance Priority Cystic Fibrosis Setting Partnership ( Rowbotham 2019 ). The need to assess the efficacy of strategies to improve adherence to physiotherapy management is of paramount importance to optimise healthcare outcomes.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To assess the effects of interventions to enhance adherence to airway clearance treatment and exercise therapy in people with CF and their effects on health outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations, exercise capacity, health‐related QoL and healthcare costs.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】We plan to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Observational studies, case studies and cross‐over RCTs will not be eligible for inclusion.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】Adults and children (from aged eight years upwards) with CF; the lower limit of eight years is based on the age at which specialist units expect children with CF to manage their physiotherapy independently (with potential supervision, but not active involvement, of parents). We will include populations of either gender, any ethnicity, any stage of disease and based in either a hospital or community setting.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】We plan to include any intervention aimed at enhancing adherence to physiotherapy versus no intervention, usual care or another intervention aimed at enhancing adherence to physiotherapy. We will not compare adherence to two different physiotherapy regimens.\n\n【26】Interventions may include:\n\n【27】*   educational (increasing knowledge and understanding);\n    \n*   behavioural (CBT, contingent privileges or rewards, setting realistic expectations);\n    \n*   organisational (self‐management diary, electronic reminders); or\n    \n*   technology (active gaming, apps, tele‐care).\n    \n\n【28】We plan to evaluate adherence using these interventions to one or more of the following components of physiotherapy management; cardiovascular capacity (exercise) with or without the use of non‐invasive ventilation, and airway clearance with or without the use of non‐invasive ventilation.\n\n【29】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】1.  Adherence\n    \n    1.  electronic monitoring (% of completed treatments)\n        \n    2.  confirmed observed participation by parent or carer or healthcare professional (% of completed treatments)\n        \n    3.  self‐reported diary (% of completed treatments)\n        \n\n【32】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【33】1.  Frequency of hospitalisation for respiratory infection (requirement for non‐routine IV antibiotics)\n    \n2.  Frequency of non‐hospitalised respiratory infection (requirement for home unplanned, rescue or non‐routine IV antibiotics)\n    \n3.  Lung function\n    \n    1.  forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) (L and % predicted)\n        \n    2.  forced vital capacity (FVC) (L and % predicted)\n        \n    3.  FEV <sub>1 </sub> /FVC %\n        \n    4.  lung clearance index (LCI)\n        \n4.  QoL measures using a disease‐specific tool (e.g. Cystic fibrosis Health‐Related Quaility of Life questionnaire ( Quittner 2005 )) or a non‐specific tool (SF36)\n    \n5.  Adverse events (any adverse advent associated with the intervention reported by authors (e.g. haemoptysis, pneumothorax, respiratory distress, death)\n    \n6.

We will report data from three time‐periods: immediate or short term (less than one month); medium term (one to six months); and long term (greater than six months) _._\n\n【35】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【36】There will be no restrictions regarding language or publication status.\n\n【37】#### Electronic searches\n\n【38】The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Information Specialist will conduct a systematic search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register for relevant studies using the following terms: physiotherapy AND treatment adherence.  \n  \nThe Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane Library), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals ‐ _Pediatric Pulmonology_ and the _Journal of Cystic Fibrosis_ . Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of three major cystic fibrosis conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant section of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's website .\n\n【39】We will additionally search the following electronic databases to identify published articles and additional studies for inclusion in this review.\n\n【40】*   MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to present)\n    \n*   SCOPUS Elsevier (1823 to present)\n    \n*   AMED EBSCO (Allied and Complementary Medicine; 1985 to present)\n    \n*   PsychINFO APA Publishing (1806 to present)\n    \n*   CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1982 to present)\n    \n*   LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database ( www.bireme.br ); 1982 to present)\n    \n\n【41】We will also search online trials registries:\n\n【42】*   the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( apps.who.int/trialsearch );\n    \n*   US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov );\n    \n*   ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com );\n    \n*   HSRProj (Health Services Research Projects in Progress ( //hsrproject.nlm.nih.gov/ ).\n    \n\n【43】The database search strategies can be found in the appendices ( Appendix 1 ).\n\n【44】#### Searching other resources\n\n【45】We will check the bibliographies of included studies and any relevant systematic reviews identified for further references to relevant studies _._\n\n【46】We plan to search the following conference proceedings (last 10 years where available):\n\n【47】*   American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference ( www.thoracic.org );\n    \n*   European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress ( www.ersnet.org );\n    \n*   British Thoracic Society (summer and winter meetings) ( www.brit-thoracic.org.uk );\n    \n*   UK Cystic Fibrosis Conference (UKCFC) ( www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk ).\n    \n\n【48】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【49】#### Selection of studies\n\n【50】Two review authors (MOJ and FM) will independently check search results for eligible studies. Initially, both authors will screen the titles and abstracts of identified studies. If it is clear from the study title or abstract that the study is not relevant or does not meet the selection criteria, we will exclude it. If eligibility is unclear, then we will retrieve the full paper and assess this; we will also retrieve full papers for all studies that appear to meet the selection criteria. Both authors will also assess non‐English papers and if necessary, translate these with the assistance of a native speaker. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion and consensus. Where we do not achieve resolution, a third author (AH) will consider the paper(s) in question ( Higgins 2011 ). We will keep a full record of decisions and their rationale. We will contact experts and organisations in the field to obtain additional information on relevant trials.\n\n【51】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【52】Two review authors (MOJ and FM) will independently extract data using a standardised form. We will resolve discrepancies by consensus; if we are unable to reach agreement, a third author (AH) will consider the paper.\n\n【53】The form will include:\n\n【54】*   study design;\n    \n*   sample size (intervention and control groups);\n    \n*   country of origin;\n    \n*   study population (age, gender);\n    \n*   details of the intervention (educational (increasing knowledge and understanding); behavioural (CBT, contingent privileges or rewards, setting realistic expectations); organisational (self‐management diary, electronic reminders); or technology (active gaming, apps, tele‐care)\n    \n*   results for outcomes (primary and secondary outcomes as described above) and adverse events split by time point;\n    \n*   risk of bias assessments.\n    \n\n【55】Where papers do not present sufficient data to enter a study into the meta‐analysis, we will contact study authors to request access to the missing data.\n\n【56】We will compare data between the intervention and control group at the end of the intervention period, plus the end of intervention and any follow‐up period. We will report data from all time‐periods, e.g. immediate or short term (less than one month); medium term (one to six months); and long term (greater than six months). Where studies report multiple measures, we will use data taken at the time‐point closest to these thresholds. If the studies use multiple interventions we will summarise the results for outcomes separately. We will look at the effect of any intervention on the adherence to ACT and the adherence to exercise separately; we will analyse and present the comparisons of different interventions separately.\n\n【57】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【58】Two review authors (MOJ and FM) will independently assess the risk of bias (ROB) in included studies using the Cochrane ROB assessment tool outlined in chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2017 ). Where we disagree, we will resolve differences through discussion and if we do not achieve resolution for the paper(s) in question, a third author (AH) will consider the judgement. Where the quality of studies is unclear, we will attempt to contact the study authors for clarification.\n\n【59】We will assess ROB based on Cochrane criteria, summarising ROB for each outcome of interest within a study.\n\n【60】We will assess the following criteria (using yes, no or unclear judgements).\n\n【61】*   Adequate sequence generation?\n    \n*   Adequate allocation concealment?\n    \n*   Adequate blinding of assessors?\n    \n*   Incomplete outcome data adequately assessed?\n    \n*   Free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?\n    \n*   Free of other bias?\n    \n\n【62】It may be possible that therapists or clinicians will not be blinded in all studies of this kind of intervention; in this situation we will not assess these criteria, but will reflect the potential impact of incomplete blinding in the discussion of the results.\n\n【63】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【64】For continuous variables (adherence (% of completed treatments), hospital admission (frequency and duration), non‐hospitalised infection (frequency and duration), lung function tests and QoL) we will use the pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the measure of treatment effect. Where different studies have used a variety of measures, we will use the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs to report the pooled treatment effect. We will use the mean (and standard deviation (SD)) post‐intervention for each group in the meta‐analyses. Where these data are unavailable, we will use the the mean (and SD) change from baseline for each group. For dichotomous outcomes (adherence (confirmed observed participation) and reported adverse events), we will use the pooled risk ratio (RR) as the measure of treatment effect.\n\n【65】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【66】Where studies report multiple measures, we will use data taken at the time‐point closest to our stated thresholds (see above). If the studies use multiple interventions, we will summarise the results for outcomes separately. We will analyse and present comparisons of different interventions separately. An included study may be designed such that investigators compare two different adherence interventions against a control group, but it is likely the two arms will have different participants; we will analyse the two interventions separately. If the participants are the same for both arms, this may result in double‐counting.\n\n【67】The unit of analysis will be the participant; cross‐over studies are not eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【68】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【69】Where insufficient data are available to enter a study into a meta‐analysis, we will contact the study authors to request access to the missing data. We will not impute missing data. Where data are missing and we can not obtain these from the study authors, we will acknowledge this as a limitation.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【71】We will assess heterogeneity and its impact using the Chi² test and the I² test ( Deeks 2017 ). We will interpret I² values of approximately 30% to 75% as moderate heterogeneity and values over 75% as substantial heterogeneity. However, we will interpret the importance of observed I² values with reference to the magnitude of effects and the strength of evidence for heterogeneity as obtained from the Chi² test.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【73】We will report on selective outcome reporting as detailed in Assessment of risk of bias in included studies . Where sufficient data are available (i.e. at least 10 studies), we will explore possible publication bias and small study effects using funnel plots and test for funnel plot asymmetry using Egger’s test.\n\n【74】#### Data synthesis\n\n【75】Where sufficient data are available, we will pool data for each outcome using a random‐effects meta‐analysis. We will conduct separate meta‐analyses to examine effects of: (1) interventions to improve adherence to airway clearance treatment; and (2) interventions to improve adherence to exercise, compared to no treatment or usual care. Where studies examine effects of multiple interventions, we will include participants from each arm in separate meta‐analyses. We will used a random‐effects model as we expect there to be variation between studies in terms of participants and interventions. Where sufficient data are not available for a given outcome we will describe the findings narratively.\n\n【76】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【77】We plan to undertake a subgroup analysis according to age, i.e. children (8 to 12 years of age), adolescents (12 to 18 years) and adults (18 years and over), if the available data allow. Where studies include children and adolescents (e.g. 8 to 18 years) or adolescents and adults (e.g. 12 years and over), and we are unable to extract data for each age group, we will conduct separate subgroup analyses for children and adolescents, or adolescents and adults.\n\n【78】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【79】Where sufficient data are available, we will conduct sensitivity analyses on the basis of risk of bias, specifically the effect of excluding studies at overall high risk of bias. We will define overall high risk of bias as having a judgement of a high risk of bias against at least one criteria.\n\n【80】#### Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\n\n【81】The 'Summary of findings' tables will provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all important outcomes for a given comparison ( Schünemann 2017a ). This will provide patient‐important outcomes for decision making by healthcare professionals and caregivers. We will use the GRADE approach to evaluate the literature and reflect the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of the effect is correct ( Schünemann 2017b ). We will generate a table for each comparison that is presented in the review ( Appendix 2 ), and where data allow we will undertake a subgroup analysis based on age. The outcomes presented in each table will include, in order of priority:\n\n【82】1.  adherence to treatment (% completed treatments) (reported using SMD for all results combined in the medium term (from one to six months));\n    \n2.  frequency of hospitalisation in the medium term (from one to six months);\n    \n3.  frequency of non‐hospitalised respiratory infection in the medium term (from one to six months);\n    \n4.  change from baseline in exercise capacity (by either shuttle walking test, 6‐minute walk, Step Test or CPET) (reported using SMD for all results combined in the medium term (from one to six months));\n    \n5.  change from baseline in QoL (using a disease‐specific tool (e.g. Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire) or a non‐specific tool (SF36) (reported using SMD for all results combined in the medium term (from one to six months));\n    \n6.  change from baseline in FEV <sub>1 </sub> , % predicted (medium term (from one to six months);\n    \n7.  change fro baseline in FVC % predicted (medium term (from one to six months).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the effects of interventions delivered in educational settings to prevent self‐harm and suicide in young people (up to the age of 25) and examine whether the relative effects on repetition of self‐harm are modified by education setting.\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Suicide and self‐harm are both highly distressing and we acknowledge that the content of this protocol (and the review that will follow) is sensitive. We acknowledge that the content, and in particular the figures presented below, represent individuals and those who care for them, and acknowledge the impact for these people.\n\n【8】There is a range of operational definitions of self‐harm, and in this review we have adopted the broad term “self‐harm”. Self‐harm refers to intentional self‐poisoning or self‐injury, irrespective of motive or the extent of suicidal intent ( Hawton 2003 ; NICE 2011 ). This is inclusive of the term \"Non‐Suicidal Self Injury\" (NSSI) and suicide attempt, terms which are used in this background at times when cited studies have measured these specific constructs.\n\n【9】In most high‐income countries, the classification of suicide is part of the births and deaths registration process and a finding of suicide is the outcome of a death review by a coroner or medical examiner. There are variations in the extent to which official findings of suicide reflect the true suicide rate ( Gunnell 2012 ; Tait 2015 ; personal communication).\n\n【10】There is a range of estimates of both self‐harm and suicide because of the different methods of ascertainment. Overall, the peak prevalence of self‐harm is in young people ( Nock 2008 ), making this an important age group to focus on. Estimates of community rates of self‐harm vary greatly, with relatively few nationally representative studies that are up‐to‐date, partly reflecting the significant cost of conducting such studies. A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis (statistical analysis combining the results of several studies) of longitudinal studies (participants are repeatedly observed over time) of adolescents and young adults suggests that females have an elevated risk of suicide attempt (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.50) and males for death by suicide (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.6) ( Miranda‐Mendizabal 2019 ). A meta‐analysis of community‐based studies of self‐harm by adolescents 12 to 18 years old conducted between 1990 and 2015 suggests a lifetime prevalence of 16.9% (95% CI 15.1 to 18.9), with higher prevalence among females (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.88) ( Gillies 2018 ). Self‐cutting was the most commonly reported method (45%), with around half of participants reporting one to two episodes of self‐harm. The prevalence of self‐harm increased with age with a mean age of starting of 12.81 years (95% CI 11.78 to 13.84). Among those who had sought help, friends and family were the most commonly reported source of help and fewer than 10% had sought hospital treatment ( Gillies 2018 ). A recent, repeated cross‐sectional study of community‐based adolescents undertaken in New Zealand suggests that the prevalence of suicide attempts has increased since 2000. This study showed that indigenous and ethnic minority youth were particularly likely to report suicide attempts ( Fleming 2020 ).\n\n【11】Estimates of self‐harm in young adults are likely to be influenced by the greater number of studies among university students, which tend to report higher prevalence than community‐based studies. A large international collaboration, the World Mental Health International College Student Survey, surveyed 13,984 students across eight countries and found lifetime prevalence of 32.7% for suicidal ideation, 17.5% for plans to attempt suicide and 4.3% for suicide attempts ( Mortier 2018 ).\n\n【12】Hospital‐treated self‐harm events are an important proxy measure of self‐harm in the community, although, as noted above, the majority of episodes of self‐harm do not result in hospital attendance. Sentinel surveillance studies (where data are gathered from a selected group of individuals or sites rather than an entire population) of self‐harm in the Europe, Australasia and the USA have yielded varying estimates. These range from 61.12/100,000 in New Zealand using routinely reported official government data to 283.54/100,000 across several European countries including the UK, Italy and Turkey ( Carter 2016 ). Older studies suggested a preponderance of female presentations; however this pattern appears to be changing. Around one in four young people who present to hospital with self‐harm will repeat. This group is around thirty times more likely to die by suicide in the 12 months after their hospital presentation compared with their same aged peers, with males, older adolescents, those using self‐injury, and those attending hospital more than once particularly at risk of death by suicide ( Hawton 2020 ).\n\n【13】In a recent review of community studies of NSSI, Swannell and colleagues estimated the pooled lifetime prevalence to be 17.2% (8.0 to 26.3) in adolescents (10 to 17 years), 13.4% (4.5 to 22.3) in young adults (18 to 24 years) and 5.5% (1.7 to 16.3%) in adults (25 years and older) with equivalent prevalence across gender ( Swannell 2014 ). There are mixed findings on whether the prevalence of NSSI is increasing over time, with variations in methodology accounting for a good deal of the observed differences. However, at least one robust repeated cross‐sectional study of NSSI in England between 2000 and 2014 suggests an increase, particularly evident for females, from 6.5% in 2000 to 19.7% in 2014 ( McManus 2019 ).\n\n【14】Globally, suicide was the second leading cause of death among those aged 15 to 29 years in 2016. Males are around three times more likely than females to die by suicide in high income countries although women are more likely to die, in several countries including Bangladesh and China ( WHO 2019 ). Based on WHO data from 2010 to 2016, the rates of suicide among young people aged 10 to 19 years is 4.83 for males and 1.95 per 100,000 for females, with highest rates observed in former Soviet countries and New Zealand ( Glenn 2020 ).\n\n【15】People who have engaged in self‐harm are at much greater risk of future episodes of self‐harm and suicide than the general population ( Hawton 2012a , Hawton 2015a ). Evidence suggests that the risk of suicide is elevated 30‐fold in the year following hospitalisation for self‐harm with males, older adolescents, self‐injury (rather than poisoning), and repeated self‐harm associated with particularly elevated suicide risk ( Hawton 2020 ).\n\n【16】Both self‐harm and suicide are associated with a complex array of risk factors. There is a large literature examining risk factors associated with self‐harm and suicide in young people with broad convergence on key risk factors that include: early adversity including as a result of structural determinants (like economic and social policies) that result in poverty and discrimination; parental death and other family factors such as a family history of self‐harm and marital discord, separation or divorce; experiences of physical and/or sexual abuse; mental health disorders broadly but, particularly, mood and alcohol and substance use, and personality factors such as hopelessness and personality disorder; stressful life events; and previous self‐harm or exposure to self‐harm or suicide in others or in the media; and access to means ( Beautrais 2000 , Hawton 2012b , Witt 2018a ).\n\n【17】Despite robust evidence about these risk factors, a clear case has also been made against using these risk factors in clinical settings to stratify people according to likely future risk and allocate interventions accordingly ( Carter 2017 ). This points to the need to ensure interventions are delivered broadly, in a multisystem and multilevel way (universal, selected and targeted approaches), target modifiable risk factors and are evidence‐based.\n\n【18】### Description of the intervention\n\n【19】In general, suicide prevention occurs across three levels: universal programmes that target a whole population; selective programmes that target subgroups who experience risk factors for suicide or self‐harm; and indicated programmes that target specific individuals who display symptoms or behaviours indicative of risk for suicide ( Institute of Medicine 1994 ; Robinson 2013 ; Robinson 2018a ; Robinson 2018b ; Singer 2019 ; WHO 2014 ).\n\n【20】Common universal suicide prevention programmes include, but are not limited to, mental health and/or suicide awareness education programmes and skills development programmes that are delivered to the whole educational institution. These are designed to teach students specific skills that act as protective factors, such as coping and problem‐solving skills, which more recently may be delivered via digital means ( Robinson 2013 , Robinson 2018a ; Robinson 2018b ). Universal programmes are either administered by qualified external personnel, or by teachers who are known to the students but trained in the specific intervention.\n\n【21】While not limited to only these programmes, there are several common selective suicide prevention approaches. Gatekeeper training programmes involve training adults who engage with young people to recognise young people in distress and provide support. Peer support programmes involve training peers with some specific skills given a young person might be more likely to disclose to peers ( Rowe 2014 ). Screening programmes involve trained school staff or external personnel administer self‐report questionnaires, or interviews to identify at‐risk students, with identified students referred for mental health treatment, or to take part in a specific prevention programme ( Gould 2003 ; Mo 2018 ; Robinson 2013 ; Robinson 2018a ; Robinson 2018b ; Singer 2019 ).\n\n【22】Indicated suicide prevention interventions target students who have engaged in self‐harm or have suicidal ideation and provide specific interventions. These interventions, for example, cognitive behavioural therapy and dialectical behavioural therapy ( Brent 2013 ; Hawton 2015b ; Ougrin 2015 ; Robinson 2018b ), have typically been developed, tested and delivered in clinical settings rather in education‐based settings.\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】The interventions in this area are varied and so work in diverse ways to ultimately reduce self‐harm and suicide. Broadly, these interventions are designed to detect and treat those with modifiable risk factors, including treating mental illness associated with suicide, or have a broader aim of building resiliency by increasing protective factors.\n\n【25】Universal interventions often aim to increase mental health and self‐harm/suicide prevention literacy and increase the likelihood of people seeking help when it is needed. It is likely that increased help‐seeking is due to increased literacy as well as by reducing stigma and improved attitudes to mental health and self‐harm and suicide ( Rowe 2014 ). There is also a role for increasing protective factors such as coping skills and problem‐solving skills (often grounded in therapeutic approaches used in treatment settings such as cognitive behaviour therapy).\n\n【26】Selective interventions are more directly focused on ensuring detection to facilitate access to care via specific screening for young people at risk or because adults who engage with young people, as well as peers can recognise who might need support.\n\n【27】The mechanisms of change of the various indicated interventions that exist vary depending on the underlying theoretical model. A range of psychological interventions is used to prevent self‐harm and suicide ( Hawton 2015b ; Robinson 2018b ) and key mechanisms of change are outlined in the Cochrane Review on these interventions used in clinical settings. For example, cognitive behavioural therapy is designed to identify, challenge, and modify the unhelpful way that young people might interpret events and emotions that can lead to self‐harm or thoughts of suicide. Dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) focuses on reducing life‐threatening behaviours by increasing young people’s abilities both to accept, and to change, painful emotions and other responses.\n\n【28】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【29】Self‐harm and suicide in young people are significant public health issues that cause distress for the young people themselves, their peers and family, and lead to substantial healthcare costs ( Kinchin 2017 ; Sinclair 2011 ). Young people may not want to, nor be able to, access support in treatment settings ( Rowe 2014 ). There is widespread public and political belief that educational settings are a logical and appropriate place in which to provide prevention and treatment, and a growing expectation that well‐being support will be provided within educational settings ( Barry 2017 ; Denny 2018 ; Ministry of Education 2017 ). At the same time, there is concern about possible iatrogenic effects (i.e. that harms will be caused by introducing the intervention e.g. teachers and counselling staff may feel more overburdened, incompetent and isolated in their role as gatekeepers) ( Nadeem 2011 ; Te Maro 2019 ). The focus in this area has tended to be secondary schools, perhaps because young people (up to the age of 18 years) receive, or are entitled to, formal education in most high‐income countries. However, suicide is the second leading cause of death for those aged between 15 and 29 years globally, with little prevention focused on tertiary settings ( Robinson 2018b ). More recent reviews in this area have limited scope, e.g. based on only one database ( Katz 2013 ), provided only narrative summary ( Cusimano 2011 ; Robinson 2013 ; Robinson 2018a ), or are limited to narrowly defined populations ( Witt 2019a ). We are aware of one recent large systematic review of suicide prevention in young people that includes studies undertaken in education settings, including in university settings; however, as no risk of bias assessment was conducted ( Robinson 2018b ); therefore, the findings need to be interpreted with caution.\n\n【30】There is a need to provide a comprehensive high‐quality systematic review of self‐harm and suicide prevention programmes in all education settings (not limited to schools) and investigate the impact of the particular education setting on outcomes. This will support evidence‐informed decision‐making to facilitate rational investment in prevention efforts in educational settings.\n\n【31】Objectives\n----------\n\n【32】To assess the effects of interventions delivered in educational settings to prevent self‐harm and suicide in young people (up to the age of 25) and examine whether the relative effects on repetition of self‐harm are modified by education setting.\n\n【33】Methods\n-------\n\n【34】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【35】#### Types of studies\n\n【36】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials and cross‐over trials, although these are unlikely to be used in this field. Given the high likelihood of few RCTs and cluster‐RCTs, we will also include quasi‐randomised trials in the review. We will include non‐English studies, and both published and unpublished studies.\n\n【37】We will include studies where the primary aim of the study was to evaluate an intervention specifically designed to reduce self‐harm or prevent suicide.\n\n【38】#### Types of participants\n\n【39】##### Participant characteristics\n\n【40】Our review will include studies directly involving any young person (aged up to 25 years; based on WHO definition of youth and that most students are within this age range) attending any type of educational setting (e.g. school, training institute, college, university), as well as studies focusing on helping the adults who work in these settings to prevent self‐harm and suicide. Participants from both mainstream and alternative education will be included.\n\n【41】We will include general population groups to whom a universal suicide or self‐harm prevention intervention is delivered as well as populations deemed at risk to whom selected or indicated prevention intervention is delivered.\n\n【42】We will include those who have engaged in self‐harm (this is a population at risk of suicide). Self‐harm is defined as any intentional act of self‐poisoning or self‐injury, regardless of degree of suicidal ideation or intent to die ( Hawton 2003 ; NICE 2011 ). Therefore, it includes acts intended to result in death (often called suicide attempts) as well as those without suicidal intent (sometimes termed non‐suicidal self injury; NSSI) ( NICE 2011 ). This broader definition is used because suicidal intent is a multifaceted phenomenon, therefore it is often difficult to differentiate behaviours that are associated with the intent to die from those that are not associated with the intent to die ( Andover 2012 ; Nock 2006 ), and it is also the case that intent fluctuates ( Silverman 2007a , Silverman 2007b ) and regardless of intent, the risk of dying by suicide is elevated in those who engage in self‐harm ( Hawton 2015a ; Grandclerc 2016 ).\n\n【43】We will include studies that focus solely on NSSI and studies that focus solely on suicide attempts, as well as studies that include those with suicidal ideation even if they have not engaged in self‐harm.\n\n【44】##### Diagnosis\n\n【45】Participants are not required to have a psychiatric diagnosis to be included in the review; those with a psychiatric diagnosis will not be excluded as long as the primary aim of the study was prevention of self‐harm or suicide.\n\n【46】##### Comorbidities\n\n【47】We will exclude studies where participants are recruited primarily on the basis of the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis where self‐harm was a comorbid issue and not the focus of intervention. This includes excluding studies of those with diagnoses such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder where some behaviours of children and young people with this diagnosis may fit the definition of self‐harm described above.\n\n【48】##### Setting\n\n【49】We will include studies undertaken in any educational settings e.g. school, training institute, college, university. This includes where students and those working in educational settings are selected for an intervention within an educational setting or because they attend or work within an educational setting. It does not include trials where the intervention happens to be provided by an education provider but where the intervention is not exclusively relevant to educational settings e.g. gatekeeper training delivered by a University but those trained are not working or studying exclusively within an educational setting.\n\n【50】##### Subset data\n\n【51】In the case of studies in which only a subset of data is relevant, if the data for the subset can be isolated (including means, standard errors, participant details such as age, number), we will independently extract these data. For example, in a study that includes participants beyond the age of 25, we would aim to extract data for participants up to 25 years old. In the case where data for the relevant subset of participants cannot be isolated and extracted independently, and relevant information about the participants is available, we will include the data for the whole study as long as the majority of participants are under the age of 25 (mean/median age minus the standard deviation must be less than 25 or if numbers or interquartile ranges are provided 50% must be less than 25). The impact of the inclusion of such studies will be investigated using sensitivity analysis.\n\n【52】#### Types of interventions\n\n【53】##### Experimental interventions\n\n【54】We will include studies that test the efficacy of psychosocial universal, selected and indicated interventions that aim to prevent self‐harm and suicide.\n\n【55】We will exclude pharmacological interventions and postvention programmes (a separate review of postvention programmes is being undertaken). We will exclude studies that examine the efficacy of interventions delivered in education settings that aim to promote well‐being. While it is acknowledged that such interventions are impacting on pathways that may impact on self‐harm or suicide, unless the primary and explicit aim of the study is stated as reducing self‐harm or suicide (including measuring these as outcomes), these studies will not be included in this review.\n\n【56】##### Control conditions\n\n【57】Control conditions will include no intervention, usual care, waiting list (inactive control), or non‐pharmacological interventions that are not designed or used for suicide or self‐harm prevention (suicide prevention is not directly addressed and so they act as attention control). Attention controls could include, for example, educational physical health interventions (e.g. exercise, healthy eating), or educational mental health interventions (e.g. mental well‐being, peer support).\n\n【58】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【59】We will include studies that meet the above inclusion criteria regardless of whether they report on the following outcomes.\n\n【60】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【61】1\\. Self‐harm\n\n【62】While the aim of any suicide prevention intervention and, arguably, self‐harm intervention is to reduce the rate of suicide, suicide is a relatively rare event, particularly in intervention studies (that usually have a relatively small number of participants and are undertaken over a relatively short period of time). Given self‐harm represents a key risk factor for suicide ( Hawton 2015a ), it is likely that any reduction in self‐harm will have an impact on rates of suicide, therefore self‐harm is the best available proxy measure for suicide and will be the primary outcome in this review. This will be measured as a proportion of young people who engage in self‐harm post‐intervention. This could be measured by self‐report, significant other or assessor/clinician report, health records, and hospital representation. If multiple ascertainment methods are reported, we will use health record and hospital representation data in the first instance, given findings that these may provide more realistic estimates ( Mars 2016 ), although it is noted that for interventions that increase awareness, such as gatekeeper training, there may appear to be increases in incidents of self‐harm that are the result of ascertainment bias (i.e. a reported increase is more likely where rates of self‐harm are obtained via other/clinical report and hospital or health records).\n\n【63】Self‐harm, as noted, is defined as any intentional act of self‐poisoning or self‐injury, regardless of degree of suicidal ideation or intent to die and includes acts intended to result in death (often called suicide attempts) as well as those without suicidal intent (sometimes termed non‐suicidal self injury; NSSI). For this outcome, we will include self‐harm as defined by the authors of the study. Where, within one study, authors have measured several outcomes within this broad concept, e.g. both self‐harm and suicide attempts as separate constructs, we will present data for all outcomes within a subgroup analysis but won't include total scores across the subgroups of outcomes to ensure we don't double count participants within one trial who provide data for both outcomes.\n\n【64】2\\. Acceptability (rates of dropout).\n\n【65】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【66】3\\. Proportion of young people who engage in self‐harm at short‐term (up to and including three months), medium‐term (four to 12 months) and long‐term (> 12 months) follow‐up.\n\n【67】4\\. Frequency of repeated self‐harm measured as the total frequency of acts of self‐harm that each young people engaged in.\n\n【68】This could be measured by self‐report, significant other or assessor/clinician report, health records, and hospital representation.\n\n【69】5\\. Time to repeat self‐harm.\n\n【70】6\\. Suicidal ideation, measured using psychometrically validated measures e.g. Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire ( Reynolds 1987 )..\n\n【71】7\\. Hopelessness measured using psychometrically validated measures e.g. Beck Hopelessness Scale ( Beck 1974 ).\n\n【72】###### Timing of outcome assessment\n\n【73】Our primary outcome time point is at the end of the conclusion of the intervention (post‐intervention). We will also investigate effects at short‐term (one to three months after completion of the intervention), medium‐term (four to 12 months following completion of the intervention) and long‐term follow‐up (over 12 months after conclusion of the intervention). If there are several measurements within a particular time‐frame, we will use the longest term point within that time period, except for short‐term where we will use the closest time point to the post intervention assessment. This will most clearly enable us to examine if there is a diminishing effect over time.\n\n【74】###### Hierarchy of outcome measures\n\n【75】For studies in which there are multiple measures of the same construct (e.g. multiple measures of hopelessness), we will select the most commonly used measure across the included trials.\n\n【76】We will document any cases of prioritising outcomes.\n\n【77】**Co‐designed outcomes**\n\n【78】We undertook a process to co‐design outcomes for this review with young people. This activity comprised two face‐to‐face co‐design workshops and two online co‐design workshops (due to COVID lockdown). A full description of the methodology will be published in a separate paper. The outcomes of the co‐design workshop highlighted several key themes. Young people highlighted the broad diversity of experience and recovery, making the point that what works as an intervention and what young people would define as a good outcome will vary and be idiosyncratic to the individual. Related to this, they highlighted that recovery is not a straight forward linear process but is more dynamic and includes milestones such as the reduction in severity of self‐harm and might include relapse as part of the recovery journey. Therefore, the primary outcome for this review, as defined by clinicians and researchers as 'reduction in self‐harm', was not seen to reflect the true course of recovery. They noted that the idea of reduction being the goal might potentially have negative impacts, with relapse then seen as 'failure'. There was a more holistic approach to outcomes with a focus on those that were more strengths‐ or asset‐based and were not solely focused on the individual.\n\n【79】The two most important outcomes for young people that emerged were:\n\n【80】1\\. Better or more coping skills\n\n【81】2\\. A safer environment, more acceptance and understanding, at school\n\n【82】Rather than attempting to further refine these into more narrowly defined outcomes with associated measurement through the clinician/researcher lens, we have included these as a more broad domain and will examine included studies for outcomes that fit into the two broad domains. For example, coping skills might include specific measurement of coping via validated measures of coping, but maybe also include more specific skills‐based and behavioural outcomes such as increased physical or other activities, and increased meditation/mindfulness skills. A safer environment may include specific measures of, for example, perceived sense of connection and belongingness, as well as more broad outcomes such as greater skills of gatekeepers, such as teachers, and reduced stigma and discrimination.\n\n【83】Within each of these broad domains, we will present the range of relevant outcomes within the domain, as well as the measurement tools or approaches to this and provide a narrative summary of the results.\n\n【84】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【85】#### Electronic searches\n\n【86】An information specialist with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CCMD) Group will search the following bibliographic databases, using relevant subject headings, keywords, and search syntax appropriate to each resource.\n\n【87】*   Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) (all available years) ( Appendix 1 );\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (current issue);\n    \n*   Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onwards);\n    \n*   Ovid PsycINFO (all years) ( Appendix 2 );\n    \n*   Web of Science Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) (all years);\n    \n*   ERIC (1966 to present);\n    \n*   EBSCOhost Australian Education Index (AEI) (all years);\n    \n*   EBSCOhost British Education Index (BEI) (all years);\n    \n*   EBSCOhost Educational Research Abstracts (ERA) (all years).\n    \n\n【88】Embase, CINAHL and the international trial registries (World Health Organization's trials portal ( ICTRP ) and ClinicalTrials.gov ) will be searched via CENTRAL on the Cochrane Library. RCT records from these databases are added to CENTRAL via a highly sensitive, centralised search service ( Noel‐Storr 2020 ).\n\n【89】There will be no restriction on date, language or publication status applied to the searches.\n\n【90】#### Searching other resources\n\n【91】##### Grey literature\n\n【92】CCMD's information specialist will also search the following sources of grey literature (primarily for dissertations and theses):\n\n【93】*   Open Grey ( www.opengrey.eu/ );\n    \n*   ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global ( www.proquest.com/products-services/pqdtglobal.html );\n    \n*   DART‐Europe E‐theses Portal ( www.dart-europe.eu/ );\n    \n*   EThOS – the British Libraries e‐theses online service ( ethos.bl.uk/ );\n    \n*   Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) ( search.ndltd.org );\n    \n*   Open Access Theses and Dissertations ( oatd.org ).\n    \n\n【94】##### Reference lists\n\n【95】We will check the reference lists of all included studies and key reviews in this area to identify additional studies.\n\n【96】##### Correspondence\n\n【97】We will attempt to obtain further information on published and unpublished trials by contacting lead researchers in the field of suicide, and also organisations associated with suicide prevention. We will report any personal communication.\n\n【98】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【99】#### Selection of studies\n\n【100】Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of all studies within Covidence. The full text for studies considered likely to be relevant for inclusion will be independently assessed for inclusion according to the pre‐determined criteria (above). Disagreements will be resolved by discussion that may include a third member of the review team. We will collate multiple reports describing the same study so that unit of interest is the study, rather than the report. We will describe the reasons for exclusion of studies. We will record this process of study selection in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( Liberati 2009 ).\n\n【101】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【102】Using a standardised data extraction form, piloted on at least one included study, two review authors will independently extract data from the included studies. If necessary, a third team member will be consulted to resolve disagreements. We will extract data about the study design, participants, methods, outcome measurement, results, and other relevant information. One author will transfer this information in to 'Characteristics of included studies' table. A second review author will spot‐check 10% of the included studies study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. If the spot check reveals more than 20% of anomalies, all included studies will be checked.\n\n【103】##### Main planned comparisons\n\n【104】The main comparisons are as follows (with additional specific comparisons to be added depending on specific interventions of included studies):\n\n【105】###### Universal interventions vs control\n\n【106】1\\. Education/awareness and skills training‐based type programmes versus control\n\n【107】###### Selective interventions vs control\n\n【108】2\\. Gatekeeper training programmes versus control\n\n【109】3\\. Peer support type programmes versus control\n\n【110】4\\. Screening type programmes versus control\n\n【111】###### Indicated interventions vs control\n\n【112】5\\. CBT‐type interventions versus control\n\n【113】6\\. DBT‐type interventions vs control\n\n【114】**Multimodel interventions vs control**\n\n【115】7\\. Multimodel interventions vs control\n\n【116】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【117】We will evaluate the risk of bias associated with each study based on the Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool ( Higgins 2017 ), including recommendations for assessing risk of bias for cluster‐randomised controlled trials and cross‐over trials ( Higgins 2017 ). This tool assesses risk of bias in the following domains:\n\n【118】1.  Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For cluster‐randomised trials, we will specifically consider recruitment bias.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed?\n    \n3.  Blinding of a) participants and personnel, and b) outcome assessment, for each main outcome: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study for a) and b)?\n    \n4.  Incomplete outcome data for each main outcome: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For cluster‐randomised trials, we will specifically consider loss of clusters.\n    \n5.  Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For cluster‐randomised trials, we will specifically consider incorrect analyses, where clustering was not taken into account.\n    \n6.  Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?\n    \n\n【119】We will provide a description of what was reported to have happened in each study, and two review authors will independently make a judgement on the risk of bias for each domain, with consensus reached by discussion (that may include an additional review author in the case of disagreement) ( Higgins 2017 ).\n\n【120】We will classify a study as having a low risk of bias if all of the domains of the study outcome are associated with low risk, or if the majority of the domains are associated with low risk and the remaining domains are associated with unclear risk that is unlikely to seriously alter the results. We will classify a study as having unclear risk of bias if there is plausible bias that raises questions about the results in one or more domains, and the remainder of the domains are associated with low risk. We will classify a study as having high risk of bias if any domain is rated as high risk of bias. If necessary, a third team member will be consulted to resolve disagreements.\n\n【121】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【122】##### Binary data\n\n【123】For binary outcomes, such as the proportion of young people who engage in repeat self‐harm, we will summarise outcomes using the odds ratios (OR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals. In our 'Summary of Findings' tables, we will present estimates of risk difference, in addition to odds ratios, to aid interpretation, for a range of control group rates (lowest, highest and median rate derived from the placebo groups).\n\n【124】We will analyse time‐to‐event data (hazard ratios: HRs) using the generic inverse variance method ( Higgins 2017 ). If there is a mixture of studies using analyses of dichotomised and time‐to‐event data, and log‐rank estimates are reported, we will use Peto's method, subject to the required criteria being satisfied (Section 9.4.4.2, Higgins 2017 ).\n\n【125】##### Continuous data\n\n【126】We will use mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals where continuous variables (e.g. hopelessness) are measured on the same scale. Where continuous variables are measured on different scales, we will use standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【127】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【128】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【129】We will report the methods used to analyse cluster‐randomised trials, and whether the risk of unit of analysis error was dealt with appropriately. Where the analysis was carried out appropriately, we will consider the studies for meta‐analysis and use the reported effect sizes and standard errors in generic inverse variance meta‐analysis. Where the analysis was inappropriate, if the necessary information can be extracted, we may perform approximately correct analyses ( Higgins 2011 ). The approach used will be to adjust standard errors accordingly where a reliable estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) can be obtained, or, in the cases where a reliable estimate of the ICC cannot be obtained, we will use a summary measures approach and perform the analysis at the cluster level (for example, using the proportion of those in each cluster experiencing the event of interest).\n\n【130】##### Multiple treatment groups\n\n【131】For studies that involve multiple treatment groups, if the treatment groups are similar in rationale and nature (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy delivered via the internet and cognitive behavioural therapy delivered via telephone, with a control condition of treatment‐as‐usual), we will combine treatment groups to use a single pairwise comparison for a meta‐analysis (cognitive behavioural therapy delivered via the internet/telephone versus the control condition of treatment‐as‐usual). If there is a small number of studies in which more than one treatment group is of interest (e.g. education, psychological therapy, control), we will use the shared intervention groups approach outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2017 ).\n\n【132】##### Cross‐over studies\n\n【133】It is not likely that we will find any eligible cross‐over trials. If we do, we will only analyse cross‐over trials at the first phase of the trial to avoid unit of analysis issues (e.g. issues associated with the inability of those who die by suicide during one treatment to cross over to another treatment). When assessing risk of bias for any cross‐over trials, we will only consider the first phase of the trial, due to issues associated with the a) suitability of the design (e.g. prevention of suicidal behaviour does not approximate treatment of a chronic condition), and b) carry‐over effects (e.g. the high likelihood that phase one interventions will have lasting effects). If outcomes are only available from the first period of the trial, however, we will consider the outcomes to be at risk of bias.\n\n【134】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【135】We will deal with missing data as recommended in Higgins 2017 . We will contact study authors to request data and where authors have omitted standard deviations (SDs) for continuous measures, we plan to estimate these as outlined in Higgins 2017 .\n\n【136】We will assess missing data and dropouts for each study. In the review, we will report the number of participants included in each study's final analysis as a proportion of all participants in the study. Where missing data are substantial (> 5%) and Missing‐Not‐at‐Random is a more reasonable assumption, we will perform sensitivity analyses assuming the worst outcome for missing data and re‐running the analyses to see how the results are affected. We will discuss the results of any such sensitivity analyses as recommended in Higgins 2017 .\n\n【137】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【138】To assess heterogeneity, based on the recommendations in Higgins 2017 , we will initially visually inspect the meta‐analysis and then use the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, with a 95% confidence interval (I <sup>2 </sup> values of 0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: may represent considerable heterogeneity). In addition to the I _<sup>2 </sup>_ value ( Higgins 2017 ), we will present the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test and its P value and consider the direction and magnitude of the treatment effects. For meta‐analyses with few studies, the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test is underpowered to detect heterogeneity should it exist, so we will use a P value of 0.10 as a threshold of statistical significance.\n\n【139】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【140】If there are sufficient studies (10 or more), we will create funnel plots to investigate the relationship between study power and effect size. An asymmetric plot may indicate biases such as publication bias, location biases, poorer methodological quality of smaller studies, or a true difference related to smaller studies due, for instance, to differences in the delivery of the intervention to smaller samples. We will explore possible reasons for any asymmetry ( Egger 1997 ).\n\n【141】#### Data synthesis\n\n【142】We will combine quasi‐RCT and RCT data in the main analyses, and we will perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the findings regarding this decision.\n\n【143】In the first instance, we will adopt a common sense approach to assess whether meta‐analyses combining data from different studies are appropriate in terms of whether participants, interventions, and outcomes are sufficiently similar, and whether risk of bias is similar ( Kristjansson 2007 ).\n\n【144】We will use a random‐effects model to estimate the intervention effects. It is possible that even if the types of intervention are diverse, a meta‐analysis could usefully be carried out on studies of similar interventions, with similar research questions and similar outcomes, to provide an indication of the direction, but not the size, of any effect. If the heterogeneity of the available randomised studies prohibits a meta‐analysis, we will conduct a narrative synthesis.\n\n【145】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【146】If there are adequate numbers of studies, we will undertake subgroup analyses for the following groups for the primary outcome.\n\n【147】1.  Mainstream education and alternative education. Given that there are higher rates of suicide in alternative education settings (e.g. Kann 1998 ), it would be valuable to investigate whether the outcomes of interventions to prevent suicidal behaviour differ in alternative compared to mainstream educational settings.\n    \n2.  Primary vs secondary vs post‐secondary education settings. Each setting is associated with different developmental stages, with differences in rates of self‐harm and suicide risk observed across these settings.\n    \n3.  Non‐active vs active controls, given the impact on the magnitude of the treatment effect has been shown to vary dependent on the type of control group ( Witt 2018b ; Witt 2019b )\n    \n\n【148】Subgroup analyses are observational by nature ( Higgins 2017 ). We will therefore interpret the results of these prespecified analyses with caution. We will use any significant differences that are detected between studies to generate hypotheses for future potential research.\n\n【149】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【150】We will conduct sensitivity analyses, as outlined below, to test the robustness of the decisions made in the review process. It has been shown that studies that have an inherent high risk of bias due to their study design are likely to distort the overall summary statistics by either underestimating or overestimating the treatment effect ( Higgins 2017 ). Therefore, in the proposed review, we will conduct the following sensitivity analyses:\n\n【151】1.

It involves positioning of a suture (stitch) around the neck of the womb (cervix), aiming to give mechanical support to the cervix and thereby reduce risk of preterm birth. The effectiveness and safety of this procedure remains controversial. This is an update of a review last published in 2012.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess whether the use of cervical stitch in singleton pregnancy at high risk of pregnancy loss based on woman's history and/or ultrasound finding of 'short cervix' and/or physical exam improves subsequent obstetric care and fetal outcome.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of identified studies.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included all randomised trials of cervical suturing in singleton pregnancies. Cervical stitch was carried out when the pregnancy was considered to be of sufficiently high risk due to a woman's history, a finding of short cervix on ultrasound or other indication determined by physical exam. We included any study that compared cerclage with either no treatment or any alternative intervention. We planned to include cluster‐randomised studies but not cross‐over trials. We excluded quasi‐randomised studies. We included studies reported in abstract form only.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】This updated review includes a total of 15 trials (3490 women); three trials were added for this update (152 women).\n\n【15】**Cerclage versus no cerclage**\n\n【16】Overall, cerclage probably leads to a reduced risk of perinatal death when compared with no cerclage, although the confidence interval (CI) crosses the line of no effect (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04; 10 studies, 2927 women; _moderate quality evidence_ ). Considering stillbirths and neonatal deaths separately reduced the numbers of events and sample size. Although the relative effect of cerclage is similar, estimates were less reliable with fewer data and assessed as of low quality (stillbirths RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75; 5 studies, 1803 women; _low quality evidence_ ; neonatal deaths before discharge RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39; 6 studies, 1714 women; _low quality evidence_ ). Serious neonatal morbidity was similar with and without cerclage (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.18; 6 studies, 883 women; _low‐quality evidence_ ). Pregnant women with and without cerclage were equally likely to have a baby discharged home healthy (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.06; 4 studies, 657 women; _moderate quality evidence_ ).\n\n【17】Pregnant women with cerclage were less likely to have preterm births compared to controls before 37, 34 (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89; 9 studies, 2415 women; _high quality evidence_ ) and 28 completed weeks of gestation.\n\n【18】Five subgroups based on clinical indication provided data for analysis (history‐indicated; short cervix based on one‐off ultrasound in high risk women; short cervix found by serial scans in high risk women; physical exam‐indicated; and short cervix found on scan in low risk or mixed populations). There were too few trials in these clinical subgroups to make meaningful conclusions and no evidence of differential effects.\n\n【19】**Cerclage versus progesterone**\n\n【20】Two trials (129 women) compared cerclage to prevention with vaginal progesterone in high risk women with short cervix on ultrasound; these trials were too small to detect reliable, clinically important differences for any review outcome. One included trial compared cerclage with intramuscular progesterone (75 women) which lacked power to detect group differences.\n\n【21】**History indicated cerclage versus ultrasound indicated cerclage**\n\n【22】Evidence from two trials (344 women) was too limited to establish differences for clinically important outcomes.\n\n【23】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【24】Cervical cerclage reduces the risk of preterm birth in women at high‐risk of preterm birth and probably reduces risk of perinatal deaths. There was no evidence of any differential effect of cerclage based on previous obstetric history or short cervix indications, but data were limited for all clinical groups. The question of whether cerclage is more or less effective than other preventative treatments, particularly vaginal progesterone, remains unanswered.\n\n【25】PICOs\n-----\n\n【26】### PICOs\n\n【27】###### Population (6)\n\n【28】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   High Risk Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【29】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【30】*   Cerclage Of Uterine Cervix\n*   Suture Of Cervix\n\n【31】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【32】*   Ultrasound scan\n*   Physical Examination Maneuver Related To Cervical Spine\n*   Usual Care\n\n【33】###### Outcome (8)\n\n【34】*   Finding Of Neonate\n*   Premature Delivery\n*   Hospital discharge\n*   Morbidity Index\n*   Stillbirth\n*   Perinatal Death\n*   Neonatal Death\n*   Miscarriage\n\n【35】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The stitch is aimed to support the cervix and reduce risk of an early birth.\n\n【43】**Why is this important?**\n\n【44】The cervix stays tightly closed until towards the end of normal pregnancies, before starting to shorten and gradually soften to prepare for labour and delivery. However, sometimes the cervix starts to shorten and widen too early, causing either late miscarriage or an early birth. Inserting a cervical stitch may reduce the chance of late miscarriage or early birth.\n\n【45】**What evidence did we find?**\n\n【46】We searched for evidence up to 30 June 2016. This review includes 15 studies involving 3490 women (3 studies involving 152 women were added for this update).\n\n【47】Women with a stitch are less likely to have a baby who is born too early. Babies whose mothers had a stitch are also less likely to die during the first week of life. It is not clear whether a cervical stitch can prevent stillbirth or improve the baby's health once born.\n\n【48】**What does this mean?**\n\n【49】Inserting a stitch helps pregnant women who are at high risk avoid early births compared to no stitch. Inserting a stitch may also improve a baby's chance for survival. We found too few clinical trials to understand whether cervical stitch is more effective than other treatments for preventing early births, such as progesterone (a hormone drug used to prevent early birth). We found too few data to understand if it is better to have a stitch inserted early in pregnancy (based on the mother's previous history) or to wait to perform an ultrasound scan later in pregnancy to see if the cervix has become shortened.\n\n【50】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【51】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【52】### Implications for practice\n\n【53】Cervical cerclage prevents preterm births, but so does the natural progesterone given vaginally to women with a short cervix, without an increased risk of caesarean section ( Romero 2012 ). However, transvaginal sonography and prolonged treatment with progesterone may not be affordable for all. Also, the progesterone option may be unacceptable to women who have already had a successful pregnancy with cervical cerclage. Therefore, the decision on how best to minimise the risk of recurrent preterm birth in women at risk, either because of poor history or a short or dilated cervix, has to be personalised and based on the clinical circumstances, the skill and expertise of the clinical team and, most importantly, the woman's informed choice.\n\n【54】### Implications for research\n\n【55】*   Women with a short cervix on transvaginal sonography should be randomised to either cervical cerclage, natural progesterone, neither, or both. It would be important to report separately results for women who had routine transvaginal sonography screening (low risk) and for those who had serial ultrasound scans because of previous preterm birth or other risk factors.\n    \n*   Further randomised data that includes women with a dilated cervix found on physical examination (digital/speculum) would be welcome.\n    \n*   We need definitive studies to ascertain whether it is better for women at particularly high risk of preterm birth to have cervical cerclage early (as prophylaxis), or to have serial transvaginal scanning.\n    \n\n【56】All future studies should have neonatal morbidity as the primary outcome on which sample size calculations should be based. Such studies will have more than adequate power to address the impact on preterm births and most safety aspects. Studies that use gestational age as the primary outcome do so primarily to justify the smaller (more feasible) sample size. It is unlikely that these will have adequate power to answer the key question of whether there is a benefit for mother and baby.\n\n【57】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【58】Open in table viewer\n\n【59】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

closed, allowing the pregnancy to reach full term. Towards the end of pregnancy, the cervix starts to shorten and progressively becomes softer (more favourable) ‐ these changes are physiological preparations for normal labour and delivery.\n\n【68】Sometimes, the cervix starts to shorten and dilates too early, causing either late miscarriage or preterm birth. In the absence of uterine contractions, the cause of this pathological condition is considered to be cervical insufficiency (sometimes also called incompetence). The condition has been described as early as the 17th century ( Riverius 1658 ). It has been suggested that cervical insufficiency complicates about 1% of an obstetric population ( McDonald 1980 ) and 8% of a recurrent miscarriage population who have experienced mid‐trimester pregnancy losses ( Drakeley 1998 ). There is however, no consistent definition of cervical insufficiency ( Berry 1995 ) which hampers any attempt to establish the true incidence.\n\n【69】Some researchers have defined cervical insufficiency as \"the history of painless dilatation of the cervix resulting in second or early third trimester delivery and the passage, without resistance, of size nine Hegar dilator (an instrument which is used to measure the size of cervical dilatation in millimetres)\" ( Berry 1995 ). Other descriptions include: recurrent second trimester or early third trimester loss of pregnancy caused by the inability of the uterine cervix to retain a pregnancy until term ( Althuisius 2001 ) and a physical defect in the strength of the cervical tissue that is either congenital (inherited) or acquired, i.e. caused by previous damage ( Rust 2000 ).\n\n【70】### Description of the intervention\n\n【71】Cervical cerclage is one of the best known surgical procedures in obstetrics. It involves the positioning of a suture (stitch) around the neck of the womb (cervix), aimed to provide mechanical support to the cervix and keep the cervix closed during the pregnancy.\n\n【72】There are a number of proposed surgical methods designed to keep the cervix closed until the expected time of birth. All interventions require at least regional anaesthesia in the form of a spinal or epidural block. Shirodkar 1955 reported the insertion of a cervical stitch (suture) at around 14 weeks of pregnancy. The anterior vaginal wall is cut and the bladder reflected (pushed) back and upwards allowing an access close to the level of the internal cervical os by the vaginal route. A stitch, usually silk, tape, or other non‐absorbable material, is inserted around the cervix, enclosing it. McDonald 1957 described a simpler purse string stitch technique, whereby the stitch is inserted around the body of the cervix visible in the vagina in three or four bites. Athough the internal os is often not reached, the procedure is easier to perform with less bleeding. These techniques were described as elective (planned) procedures.\n\n【73】Total cervical occlusion is another proposed variation where, in addition to the standard cerclage, the external cervical os is closed with continuous nylon ( Saling 1984 ; Secher 2007 ). The rationale for this technique is based on the observation that the mucous plug has a double role in preventing preterm labour. The plug is a mechanical barrier between the vagina and uterus, but its intrinsic richness in immune components also makes it a very important element in defending the fetal compartment from ascending infections. Intuitively, protective nylon could keep the plug in situ, thereby increasing the innate defence of the cervical canal.\n\n【74】There has been some suggestion recently that suture material may have an important influence on the outcome of pregnancy. However, the surgical methods for cerclage, including the choice of material, are beyond the scope of this review.\n\n【75】Stitches are normally inserted via the vaginal route, but transabdominal cerclage has also been proposed. This approach is used for women when vaginal stitches have failed, or when a woman has a short, scarred cervix making vaginal stitch insertion technically difficult ( Anthony 1997 ; Gibb 1995 ). Initally, cerclage procedures have been carried out in early pregnancy around 12 weeks of gestation, but are increasingly being scheduled before pregnancy. Either way, during laparotomy, the bladder is reflected downwards away from the uterus and the cervical stitch is placed at the level of the internal cervical os. Vaginally inserted cervical stitches are either taken out at 37 weeks' gestation, or when the woman presents in labour, usually without an anaesthetic. Abdominal cervical stitches are left in place and the baby is delivered by caesarean section.\n\n【76】Cervical cerclage, by whichever technique employed, carries risks for the pregnancy. Surgical manipulation of the cervix can cause uterine contractions, bleeding or infection which may lead to miscarriage or preterm labour. These risks must be carefully balanced against the benefit from mechanical support of the cervix.\n\n【77】Cervical cerclage can either be inserted as a planned procedure based on previous history (history‐indicated), because of a short cervical length detected on transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound‐indicated), or as an emergency procedure when women with threatened miscarriage present at the hospital (physical exam‐indicated) ( Chanrachakul 1998 ; Wong 1993 ). Ultrasound‐ and physical exam‐indicated cerclages tend to be performed later in pregnancy; history‐indicated procedures are usually planned around 14 weeks.\n\n【78】### How the intervention might work\n\n【79】Intuitively, in the presence of a short cervix at ultrasound, or history of recurrent spontaneous mid‐trimester losses, reinforcing the cervix by positioning a mechanical support should prolong pregnancy and reduce the risk of preterm birth and its sequelae.\n\n【80】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【81】Controversies concerning cervical cerclage include effectiveness, safety and risk/benefit to both mother and unborn baby. The avoidance of surgical trauma to the cervix may be as effective as intervention. Grant 1989 reviewed the evidence for the benefits and hazards of treatment by cervical cerclage to prolong pregnancy and suggested that cervical cerclage in women with a previous mid‐trimester loss (or preterm delivery) may help to prevent one delivery before 33 weeks for every 20 stitches inserted ( Grant 1989 ). Since 1989 there have been a number of randomised and non‐randomised studies published, however, the issues surrounding effectiveness in preventing neonatal sequelae of prematurity, timing of cerclage and optimal techniques have not been addressed adequately. The evidence on which to base practice for physical exam‐indicated cerclage is even less robust. A meta‐analysis estimated the effectiveness of physical examination‐indicated cerclage versus expectant management in the setting of second‐trimester cervical dilatation (14 to 27 gestational weeks) ( Ehsanipoor 2015 ). The physical examination‐indicated cerclage was associated with a significant increase in neonatal survival and prolongation of pregnancy. However, as well as including randomised controlled trials, Ehsanipoor 2015 also included retrospective and prospective cohort studies in the meta‐analysis. A previous Cochrane Review on this topic did not find clear benefit, although heterogeneity was high for some important obstetric outcomes. In their meta‐analysis of individual patient data, Berghella 2005 concluded that cerclage could be beneficial in women with singleton pregnancies, short cervix and experience of prior preterm birth. In a similar meta‐analysis, no statistical significance was found for singleton pregnancies ( Jorgensen 2007 ). Both meta‐analyses showed no benefit for multiple gestation pregnancies. In an indirect comparison meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials, Conde‐Agudelo 2013 et al found that either cerclage or vaginal progesterone are equally efficacious in the prevention of preterm birth in women with sonographic short cervix in the mid trimester, singleton gestation and previous preterm birth.\n\n【82】A Cochrane Review investigating cervical cerclage for preventing preterm birth in multiple gestation pregnancies has been published ( Rafael 2014 ).\n\n【83】Objectives\n----------\n\n【84】To assess whether the use of cervical stitch in singleton pregnancy at high risk of pregnancy loss based on woman's history and/or ultrasound finding of 'short cervix' and/or physical exam improves subsequent obstetric care and fetal outcome.\n\n【85】Methods\n-------\n\n【86】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【87】#### Types of studies\n\n【88】All randomised trials comparing cervical stitch in singleton pregnancies of women considered to be at high risk of pregnancy loss. We planned to include cluster‐randomised studies but not cross‐over trials. We excluded quasi‐randomised studies. We included studies reported in abstract form only.\n\n【89】#### Types of participants\n\n【90】Women with singleton pregnancies considered to be at high risk for pregnancy loss based any of the following: woman's history (e.g. previous preterm birth); prior cervical surgery (loop excision, cone biopsy, surgical termination of pregnancy); short cervix on ultrasound scanning; or physical exam‐detected cervical changes (including emergency or rescue cerclage). Cervical cerclage for multiple pregnancies was investigated in another Cochrane Review ( Rafael 2014 ).\n\n【91】#### Types of interventions\n\n【92】Cervical stitch in singleton pregnancies considered for women to be at high risk for pregnancy loss.\n\n【93】##### Comparisons\n\n【94】1.  Cervical stitch (cerclage) versus no stitch according to clinical subgroups (history‐ versus ultrasound‐ versus physical exam‐indicated cerclage).\n    \n2.  Cervical stitch (cerclage) versus any alternative preventative treatment (e.g. progesterone or pessary).\n    \n3.  Any comparison of different cerclage protocols (history‐ versus ultrasound‐ versus physical exam‐indicated cerclage).\n    \n\n【95】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【96】We selected outcome domains based on consensus work undertaken to define core outcome measures for clinical research and evidence synthesis for pregnancy and childbirth generally ( Devane 2007 ) and for preterm birth prevention specifically ( van 't Hooft 2016 ).\n\n【97】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【98】*   Perinatal loss: all losses including miscarriages, stillbirth and neonatal deaths.\n    \n*   Serious neonatal morbidity (as defined by trialists).\n    \n*   Baby discharged home healthy (without obvious pathology ‐ as defined by trialists).\n    \n\n【99】It may seem unusual to not include preterm birth rates as the primary outcome. In the context of this review, preterm births should be regarded as a surrogate for mortality and morbidity. More importantly, there is a real possibility that prolongation of pregnancy may be misinterpreted as benefit, when in fact, an early birth in a setting with adequate neonatal care resources may be better for the infant.\n\n【100】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【101】###### Neonatal\n\n【102】*   Stillbirth: intra‐uterine death at 24 weeks or more weeks; or greater than 500 g fetal weight or reaching viability as defined by trialist.\n    \n*   Neonatal death before discharge.\n    \n*   Miscarriages: perinatal loss before 24 weeks.\n    \n*   Preterm birth (birth before 28, 34 and 37 completed weeks of pregnancy).\n    \n*   Serious intracranial pathology, e.g. intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia (as defined by trialists).\n    \n*   Serious respiratory morbidity, e.g. respiratory distress syndrome or oxygen dependency after 28 days of life.\n    \n*   Necrotising enterocolitis requiring surgery.\n    \n*   Retinopathy of prematurity.\n    \n*   Apgar less than seven at five minutes.\n    \n\n【103】###### Maternal\n\n【104】*   Caesarean section (elective and emergency).\n    \n*   Maternal infection requiring intervention, e.g. antibiotics or delivery.\n    \n*   Maternal side effects (vaginal discharge, bleeding, pyrexia not requiring antibiotics).\n    \n\n【105】We also planned to report non‐prespecified outcomes if they were reported by more than one included trial.\n\n【106】**Not prespecified outcomes**\n\n【107】*   Any intravenous, oral or combined tocolysis.\n    \n*   Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM).\n    \n*   Chorioamnionitis.\n    \n\n【108】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【109】The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.\n\n【110】#### Electronic searches\n\n【111】We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (30 June 2016).\n\n【112】The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth in the Cochrane Library and select the ‘ _Specialized Register_ ’ section from the options on the left side of the screen.\n\n【113】Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from:\n\n【114】1.  monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);\n    \n2.  weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);\n    \n3.  weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);\n    \n4.  monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);\n    \n5.  handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;\n    \n6.  weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.\n    \n\n【115】Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections ( Included studies ; Excluded studies ; Studies awaiting classification ; Ongoing studies ).\n\n【116】#### Searching other resources\n\n【117】We searched the reference lists of the studies identified. We did not apply any language or date restrictions.\n\n【118】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【119】Methods used in the previous version of this review are presented in Alfirevic 2012 . The following methods were used for this update to assess records identified as a result of the 2016 search.\n\n【120】#### Selection of studies\n\n【121】Two review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified as a result of the search for inclusion. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted the third review author.\n\n【122】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【123】We designed a data extraction form. Two review authors extracted data from eligible studies using the form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted the third review author. Data were entered into Review Manager software ( RevMan 2014 ) and checked for accuracy.\n\n【124】When information was unclear, we planned to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.\n\n【125】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【126】Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.\n\n【127】##### (1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【128】We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.\n\n【129】We assessed the method as:\n\n【130】*   low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (any non‐random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【131】##### (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【132】We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【133】We assessed the methods as:\n\n【134】*   low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【135】##### (3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)\n\n【136】We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.\n\n【137】We assessed the methods as:\n\n【138】*   low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;\n    \n*   low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.\n    \n\n【139】##### (3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)\n\n【140】We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.\n\n【141】We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:\n\n【142】*   low, high or unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【143】##### (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)\n\n【144】We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re‐include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.\n\n【145】We assessed methods as:\n\n【146】*   low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【147】##### (5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)\n\n【148】We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.\n\n【149】We assessed the methods as:\n\n【150】*   low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre‐specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre‐specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre‐specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【151】##### (6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)\n\n【152】We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.\n\n【153】##### (7) Overall risk of bias\n\n【154】We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the _Handbook_ ( Higgins 2011 ). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses ‐ _see_ Sensitivity analysis .\n\n【155】##### Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach\n\n【156】For this update, we assessed evidence quality using the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE handbook relating to the following outcomes:\n\n【157】1.  perinatal loss: all losses including miscarriages, stillbirth and neonatal deaths;\n    \n2.  serious neonatal morbidity (as defined by trialists);\n    \n3.  baby discharged home healthy (without obvious morbidity, as defined by trialists);\n    \n4.  Stillbirth: intra‐uterine death at 24 or more weeks or more than 500 g fetal weight or reaching viability as defined by trialists;\n    \n5.  neonatal death before discharge; and\n    \n6.  preterm birth before 34 completed weeks of pregnancy.\n    \n\n【158】GRADEpro GDT was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ) to create ’Summary of findings’ tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.\n\n【159】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【160】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【161】We presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous data.\n\n【162】##### Continuous data\n\n【163】No continuous data were analysed in this review. In future updates, if applicable, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.\n\n【164】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【165】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【166】For this update, we did not include any cluster‐randomised trials. If in future updates of the review we find cluster‐randomised trials, we will include these trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the _Handbook_ (Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6) ( Higgins 2011 ) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co‐efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial, or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster‐randomised trials and individually‐randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.\n\n【167】We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.\n\n【168】##### Cross‐over trials\n\n【169】Cross‐over trials are not feasible for the population of interest or for interventions relevant to this systematic review.\n\n【170】##### Other unit of analysis issues\n\n【171】Multiple pregnancy was not eligible for inclusion in this review. Where trials reported both singleton and multiple pregnancy, we used data for women with singleton pregnancies.\n\n【172】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【173】Levels of attrition were noted for included studies. In future updates, if more studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【174】Analyses for all outcomes were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention‐to‐treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.\n\n【175】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【176】We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta‐analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I² was greater than 30% and either Tau² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above 30%), we explained in the text possibly sources of clinical heterogeneity between trials. See also Data synthesis .\n\n【177】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【178】In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta‐analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate.\n\n【179】#### Data synthesis\n\n【180】We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager software ( RevMan 2014 ). We used fixed‐effect meta‐analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.\n\n【181】If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random‐effects meta‐analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random‐effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects. We also discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. If we used random‐effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².\n\n【182】Within each comparison, analyses for all outcomes are displayed according to clinical groups (history‐indicated, physical‐exam indicated, etc). Subgroup analysis was conducted only for comparison of cerclage versus no cerclage.\n\n【183】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【184】If we found substantial heterogeneity (I² > 30%) for our primary outcomes, and had adequate numbers of included trials in each relevant subgroup, we planned to investigate sources using subgroup analyses to consider whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if so, to use random‐effects analysis to investigate.\n\n【185】We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses for the main comparison (cerclage versus no cerclage). Five potential subgroups were examined: history‐indicated cerclage; one‐off ultrasound‐indicated cerclage in high‐risk women, serial ultrasound‐indicated cerclage, physical exam‐indicated cerclage (rescue cerclage) and one‐off ultrasound‐indicated cerclage in low or unspecified risk women. There were too few trials in each subgroup to make meaningful conclusions regarding differences in effect in subgroups. Forest plots show trials within the appropriate subgroup for display only.\n\n【186】If in future updates, if we have adequate numbers of trials, we will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan ( RevMan 2014 ). If evidence of subgroup differences are identified, we plan to report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.\n\n【187】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【188】For primary outcomes only, we carried out sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of trial quality, assessed as high quality if the trial reported adequate methods for sequence generation and allocation concealment and had no other clear markers of poor trial quality (unacceptable attrition, for example). We reported whether or not the exclusion of studies with substantial risks of bias changed the overall effect estimate or its interpretation.\n\n【189】Results\n-------\n\n【190】### Description of studies\n\n【191】#### Results of the search\n\n【192】An updated search (June 2016) identified 22 new reports. We also re‐assessed Althuisius 2001 , and included Althuisius 2003 , which had previously been listed as a report of this study. We also included two new studies (five reports) from the 2016 search ( Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ), added five additional reports of two already included studies ( MRC/RCOG 1993 (1 report); Owen 2009 (4 reports)). We also identified and excluded another report of a previously excluded study ( Secher 2007 ). We excluded six new studies ( Hui 2013; Israfil‐Bayli 2014 (two reports); Ismail 2014 ; Üçyiğit 2013 (two reports); Zakhera 2015 ; Zolghadri 2014 ). There are two ongoing studies ( Hezelgrave 2015 ; Koulalli 2014 ) and one study ( Ragab 2015 ) awaiting classification. See Figure 1 .\n\n【193】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【194】Figure 1\n\n【195】* * *\n\n【196】* * *\n\n【197】Study flow diagram\n\n【198】#### Included studies\n\n【199】##### Interventions\n\n【200】Most included studies (n = 10) compared cerclage versus no cerclage ( Althuisius 2001 ; Althuisius 2003 ; Berghella 2004 ; Ezechi 2004 ; Lazar 1984 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Owen 2009 ; Rush 1984 ; Rust 2000 ; To 2004 ). Of these, two studies required women in both the intervention (cerclage) and control (no cerclage) groups to undertake bed rest ( Althuisius 2001 ; Berghella 2004 ). Three studies incorporated a rescue arm for women randomised to the control group based on physical exam ( Owen 2009 ) or ultrasound‐detected changes of the cervix ( Althuisius 2001 ; Rust 2000 ).\n\n【201】Two studies compared cerclage versus progesterone for pregnant women with a history of preterm birth undergoing serial ultrasound who developed short cervix (< 25 mm) ( Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ). One study compared cervical cerclage versus weekly intramuscular injections of 17 OHP‐C ( Keeler 2009 ).\n\n【202】Two studies compared different management protocols for cervical cerclage: elective cerclage based on previous obstetrical history versus cerclage based on cervical changes on serial transvaginal ultrasound scans ( Beigi 2005 ; Simcox 2009 ).\n\n【203】##### Setting\n\n【204】Studies took place in many countries including: USA (4), UK (2), France (2), Netherlands (3), South Africa (2), Brazil, Slovenia, Greece, Chile, Iran, Nigeria, Romania, Hungary, Norway, Italy, Belgium, Zimbabwe, Iceland, Ireland, Belgium and Canada. Two trials took place in multiple countries ( MRC/RCOG 1993 ; To 2004 ).\n\n【205】##### Population\n\n【206】Only women at high risk of preterm labour were included in 11 studies. Risk of preterm labour was assessed based on previous obstetrical history (n = 5; Beigi 2005 ; Ezechi 2004 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Rush 1984 ; Simcox 2009 ) and serial ultrasound scans ( Owen 2009 ). Lazar 1984 used a mixed scoring system based on obstetrical history, serial ultrasound scans of the cervix and physical exam. Althuisius 2001 assessed risk of preterm labour based on previous obstetrical history in half the population and serial ultrasound scans of the cervix in the other half. Althuisius 2003 assessed women with ultrasound and physical exam. Ionescu 2012 and Chandiramani 2010 included pregnant women with both history of preterm birth and short cervix < 25 mm on serial ultrasound.\n\n【207】To 2004 included an unselected general obstetric population with the need for cerclage assessed using a one‐off ultrasound scan. Three studies included a mixed population, with indication for cerclage based either on serial ultrasound scans of the cervix in women at high risk of preterm birth, or a one‐off ultrasound scan in women at low risk ( Berghella 2004 ; Keeler 2009 ; Rust 2000 ).\n\n【208】Nine studies involved singleton pregnancies only ( Althuisius 2001 ; Beigi 2005 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; Keeler 2009 ; Lazar 1984 ; Owen 2009 ; Rush 1984 ; Simcox 2009 ; To 2004 ) and four assessed both singleton and multiple pregnancies ( Althuisius 2003 ; Berghella 2004 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Rust 2000 ). Two trials did not state if only singleton pregnancies were included ( Ezechi 2004 ; Ionescu 2012 ); however, Ezechi 2004 reported individual patient data for singletons only.\n\n【209】We classified trials according to clinical groups for display purposes only: pregnant women with a history of preterm birth ( Beigi 2005 ; Ezechi 2004 ; Lazar 1984 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Rush 1984 ; Simcox 2009 ); pregnant women with one‐off ultrasound ( To 2004 ); serial ultrasound ( Althuisius 2001 ; Owen 2009 ) or using both ultrasound protocols ( Berghella 2004 ; Rust 2000 ). We included Althuisius 2003 in the physical exam‐indicated subgroup. Three trials compared cerclage with natural progesterone ( Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ) or 17 OHP‐C ( Keeler 2009 ).\n\n【210】See Characteristics of included studies .\n\n【211】#### Excluded studies\n\n【212】We excluded a total of 17 studies; of these, six were excluded based on assessments for the 2016 search. Three studies included only twin pregnancies ( Dor 1982 ; Nicolaides 2001 ; Rust 2001 ); six compared different types of cervical cerclage ( Broumand 2011 ; Caspi 1990 ; Secher 2007 ; Tsai 2009 ; Üçyiğit 2013 ; Zolghadri 2014) . We excluded two studies that did not use adequate randomisation procedures ( Kassanos 2001 ; Von Forster 1986 ). Blair 2002 compared outpatient cerclage with inpatient cerclage. Hui 2013 compared Arabin pessary with no treatment for women with sort cervix at 20 to 24 weeks' gestation. Three trials compared suture materials ( Israfil‐Bayli 2014 ; Ismail 2014 ). Zakhera 2015 included women for cerclage on the basis of recurrent early bleeding in pregnancy; women did not have a short cervix or history of preterm birth. Varma 1986 is a study protocol, and we doubt that this trial was carried out.\n\n【213】See Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【214】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【215】The overall quality of most studies was good, with adequate reporting of sequence generation, allocation concealment and outcome data. However, several trials had insufficient information in published reports to inform assessment of these key domains. It is not feasible to blind cerclage treatment, and therefore, all trials were assessed at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding. We feel that the impact of lack of blinding in trials will vary by outcomes, and we took this into consideration for our GRADE assessments ( Characteristics of included studies ; Figure 2 ).\n\n【216】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【217】Figure 2\n\n【218】* * *\n\n【219】* * *\n\n【220】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study\n\n【221】#### Allocation\n\n【222】Six studies reported adequate methods for random sequence generation and concealment allocation ( Berghella 2004 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; Keeler 2009 ; Owen 2009 ; Simcox 2009 ; To 2004 ). Allocation concealment was judged as low risk of bias, but sequence generation was unclear in three studies ( Althuisius 2001 ; Althuisius 2003 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ). Six studies had both unclear sequence generation and concealment allocation ( Beigi 2005 ; Ezechi 2004 ; Ionescu 2012 ; Lazar 1984 ; Rush 1984 ; Rust 2000 ).\n\n【223】#### Blinding\n\n【224】Blinding of participants and personnel was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. Nevertheless, information on attempts to protect against biased assessment of the outcomes (detection bias) was available in one study ( Owen 2009 ). Chandiramani 2010 had adequate blinding for laboratory staff assessing the primary aim of the study (cytokine concentrations).\n\n【225】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【226】Eleven studies adequately addressed the issue of incomplete outcome data assessment (attrition bias) ( Althuisius 2001 ; Althuisius 2003 ; Berghella 2004 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ; Keeler 2009 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Owen 2009 ; Rust 2000 ; Simcox 2009 ; To 2004 ). In four studies, the quality of outcome data assessment was judged as unclear ( Beigi 2005 ; Ezechi 2004 ; Lazar 1984 ; Rush 1984 ). Only a few studies provided information on the number of women approached to take part in the study, the number eligible for inclusion, and the overall refusal rate. Although not sources of bias, high exclusion and refusal rates may affect the generalisability of findings and interpretation of results.\n\n【227】#### Selective reporting\n\n【228】With one exception( To 2004 ), trial protocols were not available to inform assessment of prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. Despite this, we judged nine studies to be free of selective reporting on the basis that prespecified data extraction forms were provided by the authors ( Althuisius 2001 ; Althuisius 2003 ; Berghella 2004 ; Ezechi 2004 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Owen 2009 ; Rush 1984 ; Rust 2000 ; To 2004 ). Selective reporting was judged as unclear in the remaining included studies ( Beigi 2005 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ; Keeler 2009 ; Lazar 1984 ; Simcox 2009 ).\n\n【229】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【230】We assessed 10 studies to be free of other sources of bias ( Althuisius 2001 ; Althuisius 2003 ; Beigi 2005 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Owen 2009 ; Rush 1984 ; Rust 2000 ; Simcox 2009 ; To 2004 ); three studies were judged as unclear ( Berghella 2004 ; Ezechi 2004 ; Ionescu 2012 ). Two studies were stopped early and considered to be of high risk of bias ( Keeler 2009 ; Lazar 1984 ).\n\n【231】##### Sensitivity analyses\n\n【232】To determine which studies to exclude in sensitivity analyses based on their quality, we referred to both adequate (low risk of bias) labelled sequence generation and adequate (low risk of bias) allocation concealment as essential criteria for adequate quality. If there were obvious additional sources of risk of bias, such as unacceptable attrition or the was trial stopped early, we also considered these factors. We assessed five studies ( Berghella 2004 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; Owen 2009 ; Simcox 2009 ; To 2004 ) to be at overall low risk of bias ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【233】### Effects of interventions\n\n【234】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Cerclage versus no cerclage\n\n【235】Some trial data included in the analyses for all perinatal losses and baby discharged home healthy outcomes were based on individual patient data meta‐analyses published in Jorgensen 2007 . Data for some trials may not match the published reports because we obtained data sets from trial authors (see Characteristics of included studies ).\n\n【236】The denominator used for the outcomes of neonatal death, baby discharged home healthy and Apgar less than seven at five minutes, was as far as possible, live births (where reported, we subtracted the number of stillbirths and miscarriages from the total number randomised to calculate live births). The denominator for all other outcomes was the total number of participants randomised. The all perinatal losses outcome includes miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death events.\n\n【237】Trial effect estimates are reported according to clinical groups based on indication for cerclage (history‐ or physical‐exam indicated) and trial protocol (one‐off or serial ultrasound) for Comparison 1. We pooled effect estimates for all analyses where heterogeneity was not substantial and did not formally discuss subgroup interaction tests. The small number of trials in clinical groups means these interaction tests are not valid. Plausible explanations for sources of substantial heterogeneity are provided.\n\n【238】GRADEpro GDT software is unable to analyse data split into clinical groups. Therefore, we collapsed the clinical groups for summary of findings outcomes from Comparison 1 and assessed these in Comparison 5 (Cerclage versus no cerclage (Summary of findings outcomes)).\n\n【239】#### Comparison 1. Cerclage versus no cerclage\n\n【240】Several trials in this comparison were split according to clinical groups as shown in the forest plots.\n\n【241】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【242】###### 1.1 All perinatal losses\n\n【243】Cerclage may lead to reduced risk of perinatal death when compared with no cerclage, although the confidence interval (CI) just crosses the line of no effect (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04; 10 studies, 2927 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.1 ).\n\n【244】###### 1.2 Serious neonatal morbidity\n\n【245】Treatment groups had similar rates of serious neonatal morbidity (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.18; 6 studies, 883 participants; low‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.2 ).\n\n【246】###### 1.3 Baby discharged home healthy\n\n【247】In four trials similar numbers of women with and without cerclage had healthy babies discharged home (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.06; 4 studies, 657 participants; moderate‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.3 ).\n\n【248】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【249】###### 1.4 Stillbirth and 1.6 Miscarriage\n\n【250】There was no evidence that cerclage had an impact on rates of stillbirth (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75; 5 studies, 1803 participants; low‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.4 ) or miscarriage (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; 7 studies, 2091 participants; Analysis 1.6 ).\n\n【251】###### 1.5 Neonatal deaths before discharge\n\n【252】There was no clear evidence that cerclage prevented neonatal deaths before discharge (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.39; 6 studies, 1714 participants; low‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.5 ).\n\n【253】###### 1.7 Preterm birth < 37 weeks, 1.8 Preterm birth < 34 weeks, 1.9 Preterm birth < 28 weeks\n\n【254】Cerclage was associated with reduced risk of preterm births before 37 weeks, with some heterogeneity noted (average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95; 9 studies, 2898 participants; I² = 39%; Analysis 1.7 ). Pregnant women who underwent cerclage were also less likely to give birth before 34 weeks' gestation (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89; 9 studies, 2415 participants; high‐quality evidence; Analysis 1.8 ) and also probably less likely to give birth before 28 weeks, although this result was marginal, with the CI meeting the line of no effect (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00; 8 studies, 2392 participants; Analysis 1.9 ).\n\n【255】Reporting of various aspects of neonatal morbidity was inconsistent and meta‐analyses showed no clear evidence of an effect from cerclage. There was marginally more respiratory morbidity in the cerclage group ( Analysis 1.11 ), but less intracranial pathology ( Analysis 1.10 ), less necrotising enterocolitis ( Analysis 1.12 ) and less retinopathy of prematurity ( Analysis 1.13 ) with cerclage. None of these differences reached statistical significance.\n\n【256】One small trial reported similar numbers of babies with Apgar score less than seven at five minutes in both treatment arms (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.15; 301 participants; Analysis 1.14 ).\n\n【257】###### 1.15 Caesarean section (emergency and elective)\n\n【258】Women with cerclage were more likely to have caesarean sections, although the CI for this result was marginal (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.40; 8 studies, 2817 participants; Analysis 1.15 ).\n\n【259】###### 1.16 Maternal side effects\n\n【260】Cervical cerclage was associated with a higher rate of maternal side effects (vaginal discharge and bleeding and pyrexia) although this result did not reach statistical significance and had substantial heterogeneity (average RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.89 to 5.69; 3 studies, 953 participants; I² = 66%; Analysis 1.16 ). An increased risk of pyrexia appears to be a particular problem, with three trials reporting significantly higher rates in cerclage groups (6% versus 2.4%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.23; 1245 participants; Analysis 1.17 ).\n\n【261】Two small trials reported similar numbers of women receiving any intravenous, oral or combined tocolysis in both arms (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.05; 2 studies, 217 participants; Analysis 1.18 ).\n\n【262】###### 1.19 Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (not prespecified)\n\n【263】There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of PPROM, although this analysis had substantial heterogeneity (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48; 6 studies, 2010 participants; I² = 33%; Analysis 1.19 ).\n\n【264】###### 1.20 Chorioamnionitis (not prespecified)\n\n【265】There were similar group rates of chorioamnionitis showing no evidence of benefit of cerclage, with the exception of Althuisius 2001 . However, Althuisius 2001 contributed to substantial heterogeneity in the analysis (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.72; 3 studies, 1506 participants; I² = 58%; Analysis 1.20 ).\n\n【266】##### Subgroup analysis\n\n【267】Where possible, five potential subgroups were examined: history‐indicated cerclage; one‐off ultrasound‐indicated cerclage in high risk women, serial ultrasound‐indicated cerclage, physical exam‐indicated cerclage (rescue cerclage) and one‐off ultrasound‐indicated cerclage in low or unspecified risk women. There were too few trials in each subgroup to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n【268】##### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【269】Three studies were assessed as high quality ( Berghella 2004 ; Owen 2009 ; To 2004 ) based on adequate reported methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment. Confidence intervals overlapped for estimates of primary outcomes, and conclusions regarding effect estimates for our primary outcomes did not change when trials of worse quality were removed from analyses (data not shown).\n\n【270】#### Comparison 2. Cerclage versus vaginal progesterone\n\n【271】Chandiramani 2010 compared cerclage and natural progesterone (Cyclogest) in a small randomised study nested in a larger prospective observational study. All pregnant women underwent serial ultrasound, but only those with a history of preterm birth who developed a short cervix (< 25 mm) at less than 24 weeks' gestation were randomised to receive treatment. Ionescu 2012 randomised pregnant women with short cervix (< 25 mm) at 19 to 24 weeks' gestation; this trial was reported as an abstract only, but received additional information and unpublished data through correspondence with the author. Few data per outcome limit the conclusions that can be made for this comparison.\n\n【272】There was considerable heterogeneity for several outcomes in this comparison. Differences in relative effects may be due to the different trial objectives (the primary outcome in Chandiramani 2010 was cervical cytokines); the dose of progesterone also differed (400 mg/day Chandiramani 2010 and 200 mg/day Ionescu 2012 ).\n\n【273】There were no group differences detected for any review outcome, apart from greater incidence of PPROM in the cerclage arm in a single small trial (N = 92)( Ionescu 2012 ).\n\n【274】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【275】###### 2.1 All perinatal losses\n\n【276】Cerclage and progesterone had similar efficacy to prevent perinatal deaths (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.48; 2 studies, 108 participants; Analysis 2.1 ).\n\n【277】###### 2.2 Serious neonatal morbidity\n\n【278】Two small trials reached different conclusions regarding the relative effect of progesterone on serious morbidity (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.52; 2 studies, 120 participants; I² = 84%; Analysis 2.2 ).\n\n【279】###### 2.3 Baby discharged home healthy\n\n【280】There were no clear differences in the number of babies who went home healthy (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07; 2 studies, 119 participants; Analysis 2.3 ).\n\n【281】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【282】###### 2.4 Stillbirth\n\n【283】There were no treatment group differences detected in rates of stillbirth (RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.12 to 62.17; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.4 ).\n\n【284】###### 2.5 Neonatal deaths before discharge\n\n【285】There were no treatment group differences detected for rates of neonatal death (RR 2.18, 95% CI 0.34 to 13.86; 2 studies, 120 participants; Analysis 2.5 ).\n\n【286】###### 2.6 Miscarriages\n\n【287】Similar numbers of pregnant women miscarried in each treatment group (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.01; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.6 ).\n\n【288】###### 2.7 Preterm birth < 37 weeks, 2.8 Preterm birth < 34 weeks, 2.9 Preterm birth < 28 weeks\n\n【289】Data were sparse, and results for preterm birth at all time points showed no evidence of a difference between treatments: preterm birth < 37 weeks (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.08; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.7 ); preterm birth < 34 weeks (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.01; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.8 ); preterm birth < 28 weeks (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.27; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.9 ).\n\n【290】There was no evidence of group differences for the following review outcomes: serious intracranial pathology (intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.17 to 5.28; 2 studies, 128 participants; Analysis 2.10 ); serious respiratory morbidity (respiratory distress syndrome or oxygen dependency after 28 days of life (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.04 to 6.41; 2 studies, 128 participants; I² = 64%; Analysis 2.11 ); Apgar less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.90, 95% CI 0.37 to 9.80; 2 studies, 120 participants; Analysis 2.14 ); caesarean section (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.47; 2 studies, 128 participants; I² = 70%; Analysis 2.15 ); and chorioamnionitis (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 23.61; 2 studies, 128 participants; I² = 54%; Analysis 2.21 ).\n\n【291】Ionescu 2012 reported very few events and no group differences for necrotising enterocolitis (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 71.78; 92 participants; Analysis 2.12 ) and retinopathy of prematurity (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.51; 92 participants; Analysis 2.13 ).\n\n【292】Ionescu 2012 reported very few maternal side effects (vaginal discharge, bleeding or pyrexia not requiring antibiotics) (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.79; 92 participants; Analysis 2.17 ) and no instances of maternal pyrexia in either treatment arm (RR not calculated due to zero events in both arms; 92 participants).\n\n【293】No trials reported maternal infection requiring intervention (antibiotics or delivery).\n\n【294】Progesterone led to fewer women with preterm premature rupture of membranes, although this result was based on a single trial ( Ionescu 2012 ) with few events and small sample size (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 61.42; 92 participants; Analysis 2.20 ).\n\n【295】##### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【296】There were too few studies in this comparison to conduct sensitivity analysis.\n\n【297】#### Comparison 3. Cerclage versus intramuscular progesterone\n\n【298】Keeler 2009 (79 participants) compared cerclage with weekly intramuscular injections of 17 α‐hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with a short cervix detected by transvaginal ultrasound scan. The study was interrupted after three years of recruitment because interim analysis did not reveal any obvious differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Therefore the results of this trial must be interpreted with caution ( Keeler 2009 ).\n\n【299】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【300】###### 3.1 All perinatal losses\n\n【301】There was no evidence of a difference in prevention of perinatal death (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.16; Analysis 3.1 ).\n\n【302】###### 3.2 Serious neonatal morbidity\n\n【303】There were similar rates of neonatal morbidity in treatment groups (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.74; Analysis 3.2 ).\n\n【304】###### 3.3 Baby discharged home healthy\n\n【305】Similar numbers of healthy infants were reported in both treatment arms (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.67; Analysis 3.3 ).\n\n【306】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【307】No trials reported the following secondary outcomes: stillbirth, neonatal death before discharge, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, serious intracranial pathology, serious respiratory morbidity, necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, Apgar less than seven at five minutes, caesarean section, maternal infection, maternal side effects or maternal pyrexia. Keeler 2009 (79 participants) provided data for the following analyses.\n\n【308】###### 3.6 Miscarriages\n\n【309】There was no clear evidence of an impact on the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.38 to 5.73; Analysis 3.6 ).\n\n【310】Data were sparse, and results for preterm birth at all time points showed no evidence of a difference between treatments.\n\n【311】###### 3.7 Preterm birth < 37 weeks\n\n【312】Cerclage and intramuscular progesterone were associated with similar risks of preterm birth (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.30; Analysis 3.7 ).\n\n【313】###### 3.9 Preterm birth < 28 weeks\n\n【314】There was no clear evidence of group differences for preterm birth less than 28 weeks, although data were few (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.97; Analysis 3.9 ).\n\n【315】###### 3.19 Preterm premature rupture of membranes\n\n【316】Pregnant women with cerclage and intramuscular progesterone experienced similar rates of preterm premature rupture of membranes (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.65; Analysis 3.19 ).\n\n【317】###### 3.20 Chorioamnionitis\n\n【318】Pregnant women in both treatment groups had similar rates of chorioamnionitis (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.88; Analysis 3.20 ).\n\n【319】##### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【320】There were too few studies in this comparison to conduct sensitivity analysis.\n\n【321】#### Comparison 4. Cerclage versus pessary\n\n【322】There were no included trials eligible for this comparison and therefore no data for any review outcome.\n\n【323】#### Comparison 5. Comparisons of different cerclage protocols\n\n【324】Simcox 2009 and Beigi 2005 compared the benefits of two cerclage protocols in women at high risk of preterm birth. In one group, the indication to perform cerclage was based on previous history, in the other women had cerclage only if the cervix was found to be short on transvaginal ultrasound (≤ 20 mm). The trials were not entirely comparable because only 20% of high risk women in Simcox 2009 received cerclage when assigned to elective management (80% were left untreated). Beigi 2005 treated all women; one arm were treated with elective cerclage and the other arm with serial transvaginal sonography followed by ultrasound‐indicated cerclage. Of the women randomised to this second arm, 54% received cerclage.\n\n【325】There was no significant difference in any of the primary and secondary outcomes in either of these trials. Miscarriage rate was the only prespecified outcome reported by both trials ( Analysis 5.6 ).\n\n【326】##### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【327】Simcox 2009 was assessed as a high‐quality study, but with only two studies included in this comparison, formal sensitivity analysis based on quality was not appropriate.\n\n【328】#### Comparison 6. Summary of findings outcomes\n\n【329】We include GRADE assessments in our reporting of Comparison 1; the outcomes reported under this comparison are identical to those above in Comparison 1.\n\n【330】Discussion\n----------\n\n【331】### Summary of main results\n\n【332】The evidence from 15 included randomised trials demonstrated that, compared with expectant management, the placement of cervical cerclage in women at risk of preterm birth reduced risk of preterm birth.\n\n【333】The key issue is whether such prolongation of pregnancy improves the outcome for the baby; there is a distinct possibility that a baby may be better off after an early birth in a setting with adequate neonatal care resources. The difference in all perinatal losses was not established because the upper limit for the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the pooled effect estimate crossed the line of no effect (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04; 10 studies, 2927 participants). Women with cerclage and expectant management had a similar rate of serious neonatal morbidity and a similar chance of having a healthy baby at discharge.\n\n【334】The key question regarding long‐term development in terms of neurological and respiratory outcomes was not addressed; most trials did not follow‐up mother and baby after discharge from hospital. Data for short‐term neonatal morbidity are also sparse because of inconsistencies between trials in terms of how this outcome was defined and reported.\n\n【335】In terms of safety, it is clear that cerclage is associated with a higher rate of maternal side effects, especially pyrexia. However, side effects tend to be self‐limiting (vaginal discharge and bleeding) or treatable (pyrexia) and do not appear to put maternal health at risk. The higher rates of caesarean section after cervical cerclage have not been reported previously. This is unsurprising given few participants in primary studies and relatively modest increase in absolute terms (3% absolute risk increase; 95% CI 0.06% to 5.5% increase). The exact mechanism is difficult to establish, but we were mindful that none of the trials was double‐blind. The decision to perform caesarean section is very subjective, and therefore, the knowledge of allocated treatment may have been a significant source of bias. It is possible that cervical cerclage causes damage to the cervix that increases the need for caesarean section. However, we also speculate that increased caesarean section is due to biased (more frequent) diagnosis of failed induction or failure to progress in labour when clinicians know that a woman had cervical cerclage earlier in pregnancy.\n\n【336】We prespecified three clinical scenarios based on the indications for cervical cerclage in current clinical practice:\n\n【337】1.  history‐indicated cerclage ‐ usually because of previous preterm births and sometimes referred to as elective cerclage;\n    \n2.  cerclage performed because a short cervix is found on transvaginal sonography (one‐off ultrasound indicated cerclage and serial ultrasound‐indicated cerclage); and\n    \n3.  physical exam‐indicated cerclage, also called emergency or rescue cerclage, when symptomatic women are found to have either significant cervical shortening or cervical dilatation detected on vaginal examination (performed digitally or with speculum).\n    \n\n【338】We found four trials of history‐indicated cerclage, five trials of ultrasound‐indicated cerclage and one small trial of physical exam‐indicated cerclage.\n\n【339】Women with previous preterm birth are often extremely anxious in subsequent pregnancies and there are an increasing number of specialist clinics for these women. The issue of prevention is clearly a hot topic, particularly when a cervix is found to be short on transvaginal sonography. Treatment options include daily vaginal pessaries of natural progesterone ( Fonseca 2007 ; Hassan 2011 ), weekly intramuscular injections of 17 α‐hydroxyprogesterone ( Meis 2003 ), or Arabin pessary ( Arabin 2003 ).\n\n【340】No robust conclusions could be made about cerclage versus alternative interventions such as vaginal and intramuscular progesterone or pessary. Two studies compared cerclage to vaginal progesterone ( Chandiramani 2010 ; Ionescu 2012 ). These two trials had different objectives (the primary outcome of the Chandiramani 2010 trial was cervical cytokines) and used different dose of progesterone ‐ differences which likely contributed to the significant heterogeneity noted in meta‐analyses.\n\n【341】Only Keeler 2009 attempted to compare ultrasound‐indicated cerclage with 17 α‐hydroxyprogesterone, but this trial was halted prematurely and was too small for any meaningful conclusions to be made. No included trials assessed cerclage versus pessary. These findings underline the necessity of high quality data.\n\n【342】There is also the question of whether it is better to perform a prophylactic procedure electively in early pregnancy, or wait and see if the cervix gets shorter before performing cerclage. Simcox 2009 and Beigi 2005 attempted to answer this question but both studies were quite small and important clinical outcomes were reported inconsistently, precluding meaningful comparisons and conclusions from pooled data. Interestingly, in the Simcox 2009 study only 20% of the women managed without ultrasound scans had cerclage, despite being identified as of high risk. An improved design may have been for women to be randomised only if clinicians were in equipoise whether to perform prophylactic cerclage or wait for ultrasound shortening of the cervix, as was the case in Beigi 2005 .\n\n【343】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【344】The consistency in the size and direction of effects across all clinical scenarios is reassuring. However, the lack of robust neonatal morbidity data and lack of long‐term follow‐up studies, in particular, are considerable weaknesses. As the data are emerging that natural vaginal progesterone has a more pronounced protective effect for women with a short cervix ( Fonseca 2007 ; Hassan 2011 ), the role of cervical cerclage in the prevention of preterm birth remains unclear.\n\n【345】There is often a lot of pressure to perform cervical cerclage in early pregnancy as a prophylaxis for women who have experienced late miscarriage in a previous pregnancy. Unfortunately, the results from Simcox 2009 and Beigi 2005 are inconclusive and further similar studies are urgently needed with strict inclusion criteria and firm management protocols.\n\n【346】We were unable to provide what would be considered as definitive evidence regarding benefits, or harms, associated with rescue cerclage, i.e. cerclage performed when women are found to have a dilated cervix in the second trimester of pregnancy. Published observational data are likely to be biased ( Pereira 2007 ), but consenting and randomising this group of patients is very difficult.\n\n【347】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【348】Overall, most included trials were at low risk of bias. Selective reporting of the results is always a concern when trial protocols are unavailable for review. We significantly minimised this risk by asking study authors to provide outcome data for prespecified outcomes, including individual patient data if available. It was particularly gratifying that the response was excellent and additional information was provided by Althuisius 2001 ; Chandiramani 2010 ; MRC/RCOG 1993 ; Owen 2009 ; Rush 1984 ; Rust 2000 and To 2004 .\n\n【349】Performance bias (blinding of personnel and participants) will always be an issue in cerclage trials; it is not practical to blind participants to the type of treatment. However, several key outcomes (perinatal mortality, serious neonatal morbidity) and gestational age at birth are objective and therefore, unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding.\n\n【350】For the comparison of cerclage versus no cerclage we assessed six primary and secondary outcomes using GRADE methods. Perinatal deaths evidence was assessed as moderate quality (good quality trials and adequate sample size); we downgraded the evidence one level because the confidence interval just crossed 1. We assessed evidence for preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation to be of high quality. Evidence for baby discharged home healthy was assessed as moderate quality, downgraded one level due to small sample size. Serious neonatal morbidity, neonatal death and stillbirth were all assessed as low quality due to small sample size and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect.\n\n【351】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【352】We followed the proscribed Cochrane methods for reducing bias in the process of writing a systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature and have no reason to believe any relevant trials were left out. We completed study selection, appraisal and data extraction in duplicate.\n\n【353】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【354】#### Systematic reviews\n\n【355】An indirect meta‐analysis compared progesterone and cerclage for women with ultrasound‐detected short cervix (< 25 mm), singleton pregnancy and history of preterm birth. Treatments were estimated to be of similar efficacy for preventing preterm birth. Compared with placebo or no cerclage, both interventions reduced the risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks and composite perinatal morbidity and mortality ( Conde‐Agudelo 2013 ).\n\n【356】A recent network meta‐analysis compared use of cerclage, progesterone and pessary. The review included 40 trials and 11,637 women and found pessary ranked best for preterm birth before 37 weeks, followed by progesterone with cerclage not more effective than control. For births before 34 weeks, no single treatment (cerclage, pessary or progesterone) was significantly better than control ( Jarde 2016 ).\n\n【357】An individual patient data meta‐analysis comparing cerclage versus no cerclage in patients at high risk of preterm labour did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of perinatal loss in the cerclage group ( Jorgensen 2007 ). Furthermore, the main indication for cerclage (obstetric history versus short cervical length) did not influence the effect estimate for pregnancy loss.\n\n【358】A meta‐analysis by Berghella 2011a compared cerclage versus no cerclage in a subgroup of women with short cervix and previous preterm delivery. Berghella 2011a reported a significant decrease in preterm births in the cerclage group, together with a significant decrease in composite perinatal mortality and morbidity. When considered individually, perinatal mortality and composite morbidity decreased in the cerclage group (perinatal mortality 8.8% versus 13.8% and composite neonatal morbidity 8.2% versus 14.3% respectively), although statistical significance was not achieved. These data were broadly in accordance with our results.\n\n【359】Berghella and colleagues published a separate meta‐analysis comparing history‐indicated cerclage with ultrasound‐indicated cerclage in women at high risk for preterm labour ( Berghella 2011b ). Berghella 2011b did not identify any differences in terms of preterm birth or perinatal outcomes between management strategies and concluded that women with prior preterm birth may be monitored safely with ultrasound‐indicated cerclage. Berghella 2011b suggested that history‐indicated cerclage should be reserved for women with three prior early preterm births or second‐trimester losses.\n\n【360】Our analysis did not find significant differences in key primary and secondary outcomes; however, we urge caution in interpreting data. Unlike Berghella 2011b , we excluded Kassanos 2001 from our analysis, because this was likely to be a quasi‐randomised study. Data from Althuisius 2001 were not included because primary randomisation was to prophylactic cerclage or no treatment. Two included studies comparing history‐indicated with ultrasound‐indicated cerclage ( Beigi 2005 ; Simcox 2009 ) are not entirely comparable because in Simcox 2009 only 20% of women randomised to the elective cerclage group received the intervention. For this reason, we feel that it is too premature to conclude that both management strategies are equally safe.\n\n【361】##### Emergency cerclage\n\n【362】A recent meta‐analysis pooled data on the use of emergency cerclage in pregnant women with singleton pregnancy and cervical dilation of at least 0.5 cm. Evidence comparing cerclage with no cerclage from 10 studies (1 randomised controlled trial and 9 cohort studies) and 757 women showed an association between emergency cerclage and improved neonatal survival as well as prolongation of pregnancy for approximately one month ( Ehsanipoor 2015 ).\n\n【363】A retrospective study of 158 pregnant women receiving emergency cerclage for cervical dilation and bulging membranes (mean gestation 21.45 weeks; SD 2.23) reported that cerclage placement led to live birth for 130/158 women. The study authors compared women with dilation > 3 cm and women with dilation < 3 cm; survival, birthweight and suture‐to‐delivery interval were all greater for women with cervical dilation < 3 cm ( Zhu 2015 ).\n\n【364】#### Observational evidence\n\n【365】A retrospective, multicentre cohort study examined a specific subset of pregnant women with singleton pregnancy. All included women had a preterm birth before 37 weeks for their first pregnancy. All women had ultrasound‐indicated cerclage for short cervix (< 25 mm) during their second pregnancy. At the third singleton pregnancy, women received either history‐indicated cerclage or transvaginal ultrasound screening. The cohort study compared outcomes from the third pregnancy; 38 women received cervical length screening and 64 women underwent cerclage. Pregnancy outcomes were similar for women managed with either cerclage or ultrasound, but just under half of women receiving ultrasound screening developed short cervix < 25 mm and required cerclage ( Suhag 2015 ).\n\n【366】Khalifeh 2016 argued for a cervical length screening programme for all pregnant women, with cut‐off of < 25 mm as standard; the study authors proposed that such a test is acceptable to women, effective in preventing the prevalent condition of preterm birth, and cost‐effective.\n\n【367】Figures and Tables -\n\n【368】Figure 1\n\n【369】Study flow diagram\n\n【370】Navigate to

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of sequential inactivated poliovirus vaccine‐oral poliovirus vaccine (IPV‐OPV) immunisation schemes compared to either OPV or IPV alone.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Please see the Glossary in Appendix 1 for acronyms used in the text.\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Poliomyelitis is an acute communicable disease of humans mainly affecting children under five years of age. It may be caused by wild poliovirus (WPV) of which there are three strains (serotypes one, two, and three), or as a consequence of using oral polio vaccine (OPV).\n\n【8】Wild poliovirus spreads from person to person by faecal‐to‐oral transmission, particularly when sanitary conditions are poor, or by the oral‐to‐oral route. The virus enters the body through the oral and nasal cavities, replicates in the gastrointestinal tract, and is then shed, through faeces, into the environment. Initial symptoms of polio infection include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Five to 10 percent of those paralysed die when their breathing muscles become immobilised ( WHO 2014a ). Most paralytic disease in the pre‐vaccination era was caused by poliovirus type one.\n\n【9】Since the introduction of oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV), four of the six regions of the World Health Organization have now been certified free of wild poliovirus: the Americas (1994), Western Pacific (2000), Europe (2002), and South East Asia (2014). Approximately 80% of the world’s people now live in polio‐free areas ( CDC 2014 ). In 2014, only three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) remain polio‐endemic (constant presence of polio), down from more than 125 in 1988. ( WHO 2014a ). The virus continues to circulate unabated in these less‐developed countries because of poor seroconversion rates among the recipients of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) ( Faden 1993 ) and programmatic issues. According to global polio surveillance data, 106 polio cases had been reported by 25 June 2014 from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria. In 2013, a total of 416 polio cases were reported from the following countries: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syrian Arab Republic ( CDC 2014 ). Failure to eradicate polio from these last few countries could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world. Thus, as long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio.\n\n【10】While there is no cure for polio, polio vaccines can protect a child for life ( WHO 2014a ). However, continued use of OPV has been linked to **vaccine‐associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP)** and **vaccine‐derived polioviruses (VDPVs)** . VAPP is defined as an event of paralysis that occurs in a vaccinee between 7 and 60 days after receiving the dose of OPV, with the neurological deficit remaining 60 days after the onset. The incidence of VAPP is rare (affecting 1 in 2.7 million children receiving their first dose). VDPVs are Sabin viruses, which have mutated during replication and have attained neurovirulence. VDPVs can be further subcategorised into circulating vaccine‐derived poliovirus ( **cVDPV** ), which circulate in populations that are seriously under‐vaccinated; immunodeficiency‐related vaccine‐derived poliovirus ( **iVDPV** ), which occurs in people who are unable to develop an immune response (i.e. those with rare immunodeficiency disorders); and ambiguous vaccine‐derived poliovirus ( **aVDPV** ), isolated cases of which very little is known. While the incidence of VDPVs is also rare, the number of cases with type two cVDPV has increased in recent years (65 cases during 2013 and 27 cases as of May 2014), thus complicating the epidemiology of polio as well as vaccine selection and scheduling for supplementary immunization activities in many countries ( WHO 2014b ).\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Immunisation against poliovirus infection represents one of the world's greatest medical achievements. The incidence of poliomyelitis has declined dramatically since the introduction and widespread use of **Inactivated Polio Vaccine** ( **IPV** ), and live **Oral Polio Vaccine** ( **OPV** ). It is now recommended that all children should receive four doses of vaccine before entering school. Regimens of **IPV only** , **OPV only** or **sequential IPV and OPV** are acceptable. Each regimen has advantages and disadvantages. In special circumstances, one of the regimens is preferred or recommended.\n\n【13】**‐ Oral polio vaccine (OPV)** contains a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine‐virus (Sabin virus). Low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC) rely on OPV to control WPV transmission because of its low cost, ease of administration, induction of mucosal immunity, and transmission of OPV viruses from OPV‐vaccinated children to their non‐immune contacts to induce immunity (herd immunity). There are four different types of OPV: OPV (trivalent OPV), monovalent OPV type one (mOPV1), monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3), and bivalent OPV (bOPV).\n\n【14】Trivalent OPV (all three serotypes) has simplified immunisation schedules and consequently is the vaccine of choice for routine immunisation and achieving global polio eradication. Three doses given at least two months apart are sufficient to develop an optimal immune response; antibody prevalence to all three types approximates 96% after the third dose ( McBean 1988 ), with 84% to 98% of those vaccinated showing detectable serum antibody to all three types five years after primary immunisation ( Krugman 1977 ).\n\n【15】In developing countries, however, multiple doses of trivalent OPV, given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) ( Sutter 2000 ), has been shown to produce active immunity in only a small proportion of infants. Following this three‐dose regimen, low seroconversion rates have been documented in many locations, averaging 73% for type one, 90% for type two and 70% for type three ( Patriarca 1991 ). Diarrhoeal disease and co‐infection with other enteroviruses at the time of immunisation are major factors that affect immunity following immunisation.\n\n【16】With the eradication of WPV type two by 1999 and continued circulation of WPV types one and three in select geographic areas, bivalent OPV (both serotype one and three) was introduced in endemic areas. Like monovalent OPV (either serotype one or serotype three) bivalent poliovirus vaccines were developed to support global polio eradication efforts in resource‐limited settings ( Caceres 2001 ; Grassly 2006 ; Sutter 2010 ). It is an attractive approach because these formulations have superior immunogenicity than trivalent OPV for the corresponding serotype ( Caceres 2001 ; Grassly 2006 ; Sutter 2010 ), and given the absence of interference from type two poliovirus in the trivalent formulation, may be more effective in treating outbreaks caused by a single poliovirus type ( Grassly 2009 ).\n\n【17】**‐ Inactivated poliovirus vaccine** ( **IPV** ) is an inactivated (dead) form of the poliovirus, which is produced from the three serotypes. Unlike OPV, IPV never causes VAPP, and hence is the vaccine of choice for routine immunisation in the United States (US) and other high‐income countries.\n\n【18】**‐ Sequential immunisation schedules** of at least three doses, starting with one or more doses of IPV and followed by one or more doses of OPV, could offer the same benefits of both vaccines and avoid the risk associated with OPV alone.\n\n【19】### How the intervention might work\n\n【20】The introduction of enhanced potency IPV has stimulated the prospects of using OPV and IPV simultaneously. The combined vaccine schedule will reduce the frequency of VAPP and provide good mucosal immunity. Recent studies suggest that two doses of enhanced potency IPV followed by two doses of OPV provide excellent systemic and local immunity against polioviruses one, two, and three. At least two doses of IPV are necessary to induce greater than 90% protective antibody against polioviruses before the first dose of OPV is administered ( McBean 1988 ; Faden 1993 ; Asturias 2007 ). A recent systematic review found that IPV did not induce sufficient intestinal mucosal immunity to reduce the fecal vaccine virus shedding after challenge with OPV, although there was some evidence that it could reduce the quantity of virus shed ( Hird 2012 ). A study comparing the immune response of IPV only, OPV only, or IPV followed by OPV in Guatemalan infants found it to be safe and effective ( Asturias 2007 ).\n\n【21】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【22】In January 1997, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended, for the US, the adoption of a sequential inactivated poliovirus vaccine‐oral poliovirus vaccine (IPV‐OPV) immunisation schedule ( ACIP 1997 ). The schedule of IPV at 2 months and 4 months of age followed by OPV at 12 to 18 months and again at 4 to 6 years was intended to minimise the risk for VAPP while maintaining population immunity to the potential introduction of WPV. This switch to an IPV‐containing schedule represented one of the most significant changes to US vaccine policy ( Faden 1993 ; Kew 2004 ; WHO 2009 ). There was considerable concern that parents might not want their children to receive numerous simultaneous injections, that physicians might be reluctant to administer multiple injections at a single visit, and that the change to a sequential IPV‐OPV vaccination schedule would lead to reduced vaccination coverage of children. However, a study which followed children in two large west coast US health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and evaluated a number of different measures of their immunisation coverage at one and two years of age ( CDC 1999 ) showed that the changeover from an all‐OPV schedule to one containing IPV had little, if any, negative impact on vaccine coverage. In one HMO, use of IPV was associated with a small increase in the likelihood of vaccinations being up to date at two years of age. Conversely, in the other, IPV was associated with a small increase in the likelihood of having a missed‐opportunity visit, defined as visits at which at least one but not all recommended vaccinations were administered ( Davis 2001 ).\n\n【23】At this moment, 194 countries from all WHO regions use OPV vaccine schemes, while only 52 use IPV ( WHO 2013 ). Although the WHO strategy is to stop OPV vaccination completely and replace it with IPV vaccination, this goal is not yet close, and the sequential IPV‐OPV vaccination schedule could have an important role during the transition. A systematic review of the evidence about sequential IPV‐OPV vaccination schedules could facilitate an evidence‐based decision‐making process.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effectiveness, safety, and immunogenicity of sequential inactivated poliovirus vaccine‐oral poliovirus vaccine (IPV‐OPV) immunisation schemes compared to either OPV or IPV alone.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】Randomised controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), uncontrolled before and after studies (UBA), interrupted time series studies (ITSs) and controlled interrupted time series studies (CITSs) that meet the inclusion criteria listed in the EPOC 2011a data collection checklist (See Appendix 2 ).\n\n【30】For vaccine‐associated paralytic polio (VAPP) only, we will also accept uncontrolled before‐and‐after (UBA) nationwide studies evaluating the impact of changing the vaccination policy to sequential IPV‐OPV vaccination schemes (See Appendix 2 ).\n\n【31】#### Types of participants\n\n【32】People entitled to receive IPV‐OPV vaccination schemes.\n\n【33】#### Types of interventions\n\n【34】**Intervention**\n\n【35】*   Sequential IPV‐OPV schedule: one or more doses of IPV followed by one or more doses of OPV.\n    \n\n【36】**Comparisons**\n\n【37】*   IPV alone.\n    \n*   OPV alone.\n    \n*   Non‐sequential combinations of IPV‐OPV.\n    \n\n【38】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【39】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【40】*   Paralytic polio.\n    \n\n【41】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【42】*   Vaccine‐associated paralytic polio (VAPP).\n    \n*   Vaccine‐derived poliovirus (VDPV) shedding in stool.\n    \n*   Protective immune responses (humoral and intestinal immunity).\n    \n*   Vaccination coverage of children.\n    \n*   Safety.\n    \n\n【43】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【44】#### Electronic searches\n\n【45】We will search the following databases from their inception dates:\n\n【46】1.

First, authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts of studies identified from the searches, discarding any irrelevant records. Second, authors will independently examine the full text of all potentially relevant studies to identify those which meet the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements will be discussed among all review authors until a consensus is reached.\n\n【55】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【56】We will use an adapted electronic version of the data collection checklist ( EPOC 2011a ) of the Cochrane Collaboration's Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Review Group.

All review authors will discuss any disagreements until they reach a consensus. We will consider risk of bias in the analysis (see ' Data synthesis ' and ' Sensitivity analysis '), and we will fully describe it in the 'Characteristics of included studies' tables.\n\n【74】For RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, we will assess the risk of bias associated with the following domains from the ‘Risk of bias’ tool: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential threats to validity as defined in Table 8.5.d: Criteria for judging risk of bias in the ‘Risk of bias’ assessment tool ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【75】We will assess the risk of bias for each criterion as 'low risk', 'high risk', and 'unclear risk' (for further details see Appendix 3 ) . When criteria are scored as 'unclear', one review author will attempt to obtain further information from the authors of the trial.\n\n【76】For CBAs, we will use the following criteria: baseline measurement; characteristics for studies using second site as control; blinded assessment of primary outcome(s); reliable primary outcome measure(s); follow‐up of professionals (protection against exclusion bias); and follow‐up of patients. For UBAs, we will use the same criteria with the exception of baseline measurement and characteristics for studies using second site as control.\n\n【77】For ITS studies, we will assess the risk of bias associated with the following seven domains: intervention independent of other changes; shape of intervention effect pre‐specified; intervention unlikely to affect data collection; blinding of outcome assessors to intervention allocation; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias ( EPOC 2013 ).\n\n【78】For CITSs, as for CBAs, we will include three additional domains that assess design‐specific threats to validity covered by the Cochrane EPOC group: imbalance of outcome measures at baseline; comparability of intervention and control group characteristics at baseline; and protection against contamination ( EPOC 2013 ) (See criteria for assessment of risk of bias in Data extraction and management ).\n\n【79】For each included study, we will report our assessment of risk of bias as 'low risk', 'high risk', and 'unclear risk' for each domain together with a descriptive summary of the information that influenced our judgment (for further details see Appendix 4 ).\n\n【80】We will incorporate 'Risk of bias' assessments by generating a 'Risk of bias' summary graph using Review Manager 2012 , and by incorporating these judgements in evaluating study limitations while preparing 'Summary of findings’ tables ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【81】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【82】For dichotomous variables, we will calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We will use the Peto odds ratio (OR) for very infrequent outcomes. We will report the risk difference (RD) where the result obtained by using this association measure is different from the RR. For continuous variables, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for the same outcomes measured using similar scales (such as immune responses), but calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI when the same outcomes are measured by different scales.\n\n【83】ITS and CBA studies will be analysed separately from randomised and quasi‐RCTs.\n\n【84】**ITS and Controlled ITS (CITS)**\n\n【85】The most basic approach is to graph the time series, and look for trends and patterns.The results for the outcomes will be presented as changes along two dimensions: change in level and change in slope. Change in level is the immediate effect of the policy, and it is measured as the difference between the fitted values for the first post‐intervention data point (one month after the intervention) minus the predicted outcome one month after the intervention based on the pre‐intervention slope only. The relative change in level will be calculated by dividing the change in level by the predicted outcome one month after the intervention based on the pre‐intervention slope only and then multiplying by 100%.\n\n【86】Change in slope is the change in the trend from pre‐ to post‐intervention that reflects the 'long‐term' effect of the intervention. Since the interpretation of change in slope could be difficult, we will present the long‐term effects in a similar way to how we calculate and present the relative immediate effects.\n\n【87】**CBA studies**\n\n【88】For CBA studies, we will report relative effects. For continuous variables, we will report, if possible, the relative change, adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measures; that is (the absolute post‐intervention difference between the intervention and control groups ‐ the absolute pre‐intervention difference between the intervention and control groups) divided by the post‐intervention level in the control group. We will reanalyse CBA studies as ITS studies if possible, using the methods described above.\n\n【89】**Uncontrolled BA**\n\n【90】For uncontrolled BA studies, we will report relative effects. For continuous variables, we will report the relative change, if possible.\n\n【91】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【92】Studies in which clusters of individuals are randomised (cluster‐RCTs, cluster quasi‐RCTs) or allocated (cluster CBAs) to intervention groups, but where inference is intended at the level of the individual, need to be analysed appropriately to account for correlation of observations within clusters. Standard statistical methods assume independence of observations, and their use in these types of studies will generally result in artificially small P values and overly narrow confidence intervals for the effect estimates ( Ukoumunne 1999 ). These studies can generally be reanalysed by making assumptions about the intracluster correlation (ICC). We will obtain estimates of the ICC by contacting study authors or imputing them from data presented in the study. Where this is not feasible, we will use external estimates from similar studies, if available ( Campbell 2000 ). If this is not possible, we will not combine the findings of these studies in a meta‐analysis, but we will present the results in an additional table.\n\n【93】If possible, we will combine the adjusted measures of effects of cluster‐RCTs with the results of non‐cluster trials to adjust adequately the results of the cluster trials. We will also perform a Sensitivity analysis on meta‐analyses, including cluster‐RCTs in which we compare the effect estimates with and without the inclusion of the cluster trials.\n\n【94】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【95】If information is missing or unclear, the review authors will contact the study investigators for additional information or clarification. To reduce the risk of overly positive answers, we will use open‐ended questions (as recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 )).\n\n【96】We will impute missing continuous data when necessary (for example, calculating standard deviations from standard errors and probability values or using standard deviations from other studies), and we will clearly report decisions in the review. We will manage missing dichotomous data through an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis based on the available data (all participants analysed in the group to which they were allocated, whether they received the allocated intervention or not).\n\n【97】We will also perform a Sensitivity analysis , assigning the worst outcome to those lost to follow‐up to assess the impact of a 'worse case' scenario.\n\n【98】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【99】Statistical heterogeneity exists if observed intervention effects are more different from each other than one would expect due to random error (chance) alone. We will obtain an initial visual overview of heterogeneity through scrutinising the forest plots and looking at the overlap between confidence intervals around the estimate for each included study. To quantify the inconsistency across studies, and thus the impact of heterogeneity on the meta‐analysis, we will use the I² statistic to detect heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ). In the latter case, we will define an I² of > 50% as revealing substantial heterogeneity. We will also interpret the significance of the I² test in light of (i) the magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (for example, a confidence interval for the I², or the P value as compared to the Chi² test).\n\n【100】We will assess observable heterogeneity among the study questions and methods to determine whether meta‐analysis is appropriate. We will also look at the study participants, settings, interventions, and reported outcomes. We will pay particular attention to the homogeneity of methodology (such as variances in blinding and concealment of allocation) within and across included studies.\n\n【101】We plan to categorise studies and pool data based on type of schedule (timing of the first dose, type of doses' sequence), and study population. We will pool data from studies that are clinically homogeneous; that is, when we consider participants, interventions, and outcome measures to be similar. For trials that are clinically heterogeneous or present insufficient information for pooling, we will provide a descriptive analysis. If statistical heterogeneity is found, we will examine it in a Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity and a Sensitivity analysis , as outlined below.\n\n【102】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【103】To reduce possible publication bias, we will employ strategies to search for and include relevant unpublished studies. These strategies will include searching the grey literature and prospective trial registration databases to overcome time‐lag bias.\n\n【104】To investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias, and when more than eight studies of different sizes are found, we will draw a funnel plot, plotting trial effects against inverse standard errors of the effects. Funnel plot asymmetry is found through 'eyeballing' the funnel plot. We recognise that the funnel plot is not the most reliable method of investigating reporting biases since asymmetry can also result from other sources of selection bias (delayed publication, location biases, selective outcome reporting) and methodological issues leading to spuriously inflated effects in smaller studies, true heterogeneity, artefactual, and chance ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【105】#### Data synthesis\n\n【106】For each comparison, we will report tables of summary statistics for each of the included studies (RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, CBAs, UBAs, and controlled or non‐controlled ITSs). These tables will include study design, baseline and follow‐up summary statistics, and effect estimates and their statistical significance. If available, we will include information on effect modifiers. We will use forest plots to display the data graphically.\n\n【107】We will base primary analyses upon consideration of the primary outcomes of the review, as specified under ' Primary outcomes '.\n\n【108】We will present the results for all comparisons in a standard format, where possible. We will reanalyse CBA studies as ITS studies if possible. We will report comparisons of RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, and CBAs separately for each study design.\n\n【109】We will pool the results from individual studies using the random‐effects model of meta‐analysis described by DerSimonian and Laird ( DerSimonian 1986 ). We prefer this method because we can not assume a single, underlying (fixed) treatment effect. When the impact of the intervention is assessed in individual studies on more than one outcome measure, we will select the outcome that best reflects the targeted intervention for pooling data. Where there are multiple, appropriate outcomes, we will select the median effect. Where there are only two, we will select the more conservative result. For data syntheses, we will also use the generic inverse‐variance model of analysis if we need to combine continuous and dichotomous data or clustered and non‐clustered data.\n\n【110】We will analyse ITS data using the guidelines of the EPOC group ( EPOC 2011b ; EPOC 2011c ). For each study, we will report data in natural units. Where baseline results are available, we will report pre‐intervention and post‐intervention means or proportions for both study and control groups, and we will calculate the unadjusted and adjusted (for any baseline imbalance) absolute change from baseline with 95% confidence limits. We will use either a regression analysis with time trends before and after the intervention, which adjust for autocorrelation and any periodic changes, or an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to isolate the effect of the intervention from existing time trends ( Cook 1979 ). We will estimate a regression coefficient (with its standard error) that describes the effect of the interventions. We will standardise the direction of effect (for example, positive or negative) so that a negative coefficient will describe an improvement in outcome attributable to the intervention.\n\n【111】It may not be appropriate to combine the results quantitatively when the assessed outcomes, settings, and interventions are diverse. For these results, we will present a descriptive summary of the data:\n\n【112】*   median effect size across included studies,\n    \n*   interquartile ranges of effect sizes across included studies, and\n    \n*   range of effect sizes across included studies.\n    \n\n【113】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【114】We will perform subgroup analyses to check if the intervention effect varies with different population, intervention, or setting characteristics. Each subgroup analysis will depend on having sufficient trials to perform a statistically significant comparison between groups. We will prepare tables and box plots comparing the effect sizes of included studies grouped according to potential effect modifiers.\n\n【115】We propose to conduct the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【116】1.  Timing of the first dose (at birth or at two months),\n    \n2.  Type of dose sequence (IOO, IOOO, IIO, or IIOO),\n    \n3.  Comorbidities (for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or tuberculosis),\n    \n4.  Country or location, and\n    \n5.  Baseline socioeconomic status (where available).\n    \n\n【117】If we decide not to perform a meta‐analysis, we will summarise the results for these subgroups within the text of the review.\n\n【118】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【119】We will perform sensitivity analyses based on the following characteristics:\n\n【120】1.  Risk of bias in the included studies: we will repeat the analysis excluding trials at high risk of bias for allocation concealment in order to test the robustness of the results.\n    \n2.  Methods of meta‐analysis: we will compare random‐effects and fixed‐effect models if there is unexplained heterogeneity between studies, to assess the robustness of the results.\n    \n3.  Unit of analysis: We will compare outcomes from cluster‐randomised and individually‐randomised trials.\n    \n\n【121】We will consider additional sensitivity analyses:\n\n【122】*   based on specific decisions made during the review process, such as how the intracluster coefficients (ICCs) are imputed for cluster trials,\n    \n*   if one or more studies report outcomes using either a continuous scale or a dichotomous scale and, in either scenario, have been transformed into a dichotomous or continuous variable respectively,\n    \n*   based on the effect of including those lost to follow‐up or not, where the available cases are used as the basis for analysis.\n    \n\n【123】##### Summarising and interpreting results\n\n【124】We will use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence related to each of the key outcomes ( Guyatt 2011 ). We will use GRADE profiler ( GRADEpro 2008 ) to import data from Review Manager 5.2 ( Review Manager 2012 ), and create 'Summary of findings' tables for all seven outcomes if available. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that includes pooled data from RCTs only, we will downgrade the evidence (by one level from 'high quality' to 'moderate quality' evidence or by two levels, to 'low quality' evidence) depending on the extent of violation across the following criteria: study limitations (risk of bias); indirectness of evidence; inconsistency; imprecision of effect estimates; or publication bias. Data from observational studies will start at 'low quality', but we may upgrade this to 'moderate quality' or 'high quality' if the pooled estimates reveal a large magnitude of effect, negligible concerns about confounders, or a strong dose‐response gradient.\n\n【125】We will use these assessments, along with the evidence (or lack thereof) for absolute benefit or harm of the interventions, and the sum of available data on all critical and important outcomes from each study included for each comparison, to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of sequential inactivated (IPV) and live oral (OPV) poliovirus vaccines for preventing poliomyelitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Feeding preterm infants with multi‐nutrient fortified human milk could increase nutrient accretion and growth rates and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. Concern exists, however, that multi‐nutrient fortifiers are associated with adverse events such as feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To determine whether multi‐nutrient fortified human milk, compared with unfortified human milk, affects important outcomes (including growth rate and neurodevelopment) of preterm infants without increasing the risk of adverse effects (such as feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis).\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 26 September 2019), Embase (1980 to 26 September 2019), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 26 September 2019). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared feeding preterm infants with multi‐nutrient (protein and energy plus minerals, vitamins, or other nutrients) fortified human breast milk versus unfortified (no added protein or energy) breast milk.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Two review authors separately evaluated trial quality, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using risk ratios (RRs), risk differences, and mean differences (MDs). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence at the outcome level using \"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\" (GRADE) methods.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We identified 18 trials in which a total of 1456 preterm infants participated. These trials were generally small and methodologically weak. Meta‐analyses provided low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence showing that multi‐nutrient fortification of human milk increases in‐hospital rate of weight gain (MD 1.76 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 2.22), body length (MD 0.11 cm/week, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.15), or head circumference (MD 0.06 cm/week, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08) among preterm infants. Few data on growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy are available, and these do not show effects of multi‐nutrient fortification. The data do not suggest other benefits or harms and provide low‐certainty evidence suggesting effects of multi‐nutrient fortification on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants (typical RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.63; 13 studies, 1110 infants).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Feeding preterm infants with multi‐nutrient fortified human breast milk compared with unfortified human breast milk is associated with modest increases in in‐hospital growth rates. Evidence is insufficient to show whether multi‐nutrient fortification has any effect on long‐term growth or neurodevelopment.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (4)\n\n【20】*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Enteral Nutrition\n*   Low Birth Weight Infant\n*   Preterm Infant\n\n【21】###### Intervention (4)\n\n【22】*   Protein Supplements\n*   Energy Supplementation\n*   Breast Milk\n*   Nutrient supplementation\n\n【23】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【24】*   Breast Milk\n*   Nutrient supplementation\n\n【25】###### Outcome (12)\n\n【26】*   Body Mass Index\n*   Body Composition\n*   Psychomotor Development Impaired\n*   Growth\n*   Hearing impairment\n*   Blindness\n*   Necrotizing Enterocolitis\n*   Head Circumference\n*   Cerebral Palsy\n*   Weight Gain\n*   Height and growth measurements\n*   Neurodevelopmental Delay\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Extra nutrients, such as protein and energy (calories) from carbohydrates or fat, can be added to breast milk to make it about 10% to 20% more nutritious. These additional nutrients are called \"fortifiers\". Feeding preterm infants, especially very preterm infants (born before 32 weeks), fortified breast milk may mean that they take in more nutrients, grow faster, and develop better.\n\n【35】**Study characteristics:** We included 18 trials; most were small (involving 1456 infants in total) and had some design weaknesses that might bias their findings. The search is up‐to‐date as of September 2019.\n\n【36】**Key results:** Preterm infants who were fed fortified breast milk put on weight and grew in length and head size a little more quickly while they were in‐hospital. The trials we included did not report a lot of information about the effects fortified breast milk might have on development and growth later in the baby's life. The data we have available do not suggest an effect of feeding fortified breast milk on outcomes when the child is older. The included trials provide no consistent evidence of other potential benefits or harms of fortified breast milk, including any effects on feeding or bowel problems.\n\n【37】**Conclusion:** Trial data show that multi‐nutrient fortification increases growth rates of preterm infants during their first hospital admission but do not provide enough evidence to show any effects on longer‐term growth or development. New trials are needed to discover more about this issue.\n\n【38】**Certainty of evidence:** We assessed this evidence for effects on growth as being of \"low or moderate certainty\" because the included trials were small, had methodological weaknesses, and reported findings that were inconsistent with each other. This means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimates of effect and on our confidence in study findings.\n\n【39】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【40】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【41】### Implications for practice\n\n【42】Multi‐nutrient fortification of human milk is associated with small, short‐term increases in weight gain and in linear and head growth. There is no evidence to suggest that these short‐term gains lead to any long‐term effects on growth or development. Investigators reported no increase in adverse effects among infants who received multi‐nutrient fortifiers, although the total number of infants studied was small and the data that could be abstracted from published studies were limited.\n\n【43】### Implications for research\n\n【44】Given the potential for multi‐nutrient fortification of breast milk to affect important outcomes in preterm infants, this intervention merits further assessment. As this practice is already widely established and accepted as a standard of care in many neonatal units, it is important for researchers to determine whether mothers and clinicians would support a trial of this intervention. All trials should be powered to detect potentially important effects on growth rates, as well as potential adverse consequences, during infancy and beyond. Trials should attempt to ensure that caregivers and assessors are blind to the intervention. Although this goal is more easily achievable for longer‐term assessments, it is also important for ascertainment of adverse events, such as feeding intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis, when the threshold for investigation or diagnosis may be affected by knowledge of the intervention. We have identified one such planned trial ( Mills 2015 ).\n\n【45】##### New research areas\n\n【46】Most commercially available fortifiers contain protein, carbohydrate, calcium, phosphate, other minerals (zinc, manganese, magnesium, and copper), vitamins, and electrolytes. Investigators have not evaluated the benefits of many of these individual components in a controlled manner. Future research could compare different proprietary preparations to evaluate both short‐term and long‐term outcomes and adverse effects, while searching for the \"optimal\" composition of fortifiers. Investigators could examine the effects of targeted or adjustable fortification to determine whether human milk‐based fortifier provides any cost‐effective advantages over cow's milk‐based fortifier.\n\n【47】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【48】Open in table viewer\n\n【49】Summary of findings 1.

By the time they are ready to go home, typically at around 36 to 40 weeks' postmenstrual age, many infants, especially those born very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW), are growth‐restricted relative to their term‐born peers ( Ehrenkranz 1999 ; Steward 2002 ; Clark 2003 ; Dusick 2003 ). Although very preterm or VLBW infants usually attain some \"catch‐up\" growth following hospital discharge, growth deficits can persist through childhood and adolescence and into adulthood ( Dusick 2003 ; Euser 2008 ). Slow postnatal growth is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment and poorer cognitive and educational outcomes ( Brandt 2003 ; Leppanen 2014 ). Preterm infants who have accumulated mineral deficits have higher risks of metabolic bone disease and slow skeletal growth compared with infants born at term, although uncertainty remains about long‐term effects on bone mass and health ( Fewtrell 2011 ). Furthermore, concern exists that growth restriction in utero and during infancy may have consequences for long‐term metabolic and cardiovascular health ( Embleton 2013 ; Lapillonne 2013 ).\n\n【57】### Description of the intervention\n\n【58】#### Multi‐nutrient fortification of breast milk\n\n【59】Human breast milk is the recommended enteral nutrition for infants ( Section on Breastfeeding 2012 ). Breast milk alone, however, might not meet the recommended nutritional needs of growing preterm infants ( Embleton 2007 ; Agostoni 2010 ). International consensus guidelines state that \"standard\" volumes of breast milk (about 150 to 180 mL/kg/d) do not provide the recommended amount of energy (110 to 135 kcal/kg/d) or protein (3.5 to 4.5 g/kg/d) to meet the metabolic needs of preterm infants ( AAP 2004 ; Agostoni 2010 ). The strategy most commonly employed in neonatal care facilities in high‐income countries to address these deficits is to supplement human breast milk with extra nutrients, usually in the form of a powder or liquid \"multi‐nutrient fortifier\" ( Gregory 2012 ; Klingenberg 2012 ; Cormack 2013 ; Tudehope 2013 ; Dutta 2015 ). Most commercially available multi‐nutrient fortifiers are derived from cow's milk, but fortifiers derived from human milk have been developed ( Rochow 2015 ).\n\n【60】Fortifiers are intended to be mixed with expressed breast milk with the aim of achieving about 10% to 20% nutrient enrichment while maintaining optimal protein‐to‐energy ratios to promote lean mass growth ( Embleton 2007 ; Agostoni 2010 ; Moya 2012 ; Section on Breastfeeding 2012 ; Tudehope 2013 ). Multi‐nutrient fortification may be especially important for infants who receive donated (donor) human breast milk, which typically contains lower levels of protein, energy, and minerals than their own mother's expressed breast milk ( Arslanoglu 2013 ). Commercially available fortifiers are expensive, and their use is limited in resource‐poor settings in low‐ or middle‐income countries ( Chawla 2008 ; Kler 2015 ). An alternative strategy employed in resource‐limited settings is to add cow's milk formula powder to human breast milk to nutrient‐enrich by the required amount ( Gross 1993 ).\n\n【61】#### Targeted and adjustable fortification\n\n【62】Nutrient (especially energy and protein) content of expressed breast milk varies between mothers and between different batches of a woman's expressed breast milk ( de Halleux 2013 ). If the nutrient levels in expressed breast milk are measured, the amount of fortifier added can be _targeted_ (also referred to as _individualised_ ) to achieve a desired content ( Rochow 2013 ; Rochow 2015 ). The level of fortification may be _adjusted_ in response to the metabolic demands and responses of individual infants, for example, by titration to the infant's blood urea nitrogen level ( Arslanoglu 2010 ).\n\n【63】### How the intervention might work\n\n【64】Multi‐nutrient fortification, that is, feeding preterm infants with human breast milk fortified with protein and non‐protein energy (carbohydrate or fat), as well as minerals and other nutrients, may be expected to promote nutrient accretion and growth (increase in weight, length, and head circumference). High levels of nutrient intake during this critical period might be especially important for infants who are not able to consume large quantities of milk, who have slow growth, or who have ongoing additional nutritional and metabolic requirements ( Agostoni 2010 ).\n\n【65】A potential disadvantage of multi‐nutrient fortification is that increasing nutrient density and osmolarity of human breast milk might interfere with gastric emptying and intestinal peristalsis, resulting in feed intolerance or increasing the risk of necrotising enterocolitis ( Ewer 1996 ; McClure 1996 ; Gathwala 2008 ; Yigit 2008 ; Morgan 2011 ). Several cases of subacute bowel obstruction due to impaction with \"milk curd\" have been reported in very preterm infants fed multi‐nutrient fortified human breast milk, putatively due to the high calcium content causing fat malabsorption ( Flikweert 2003 ; Wagener 2009 ; Stanger 2014 ).\n\n【66】Furthermore, investigators have been concerned that accelerated weight gain during this critical early phase might be associated with altered fat distribution and related \"programmed\" metabolic consequences that may increase long‐term risks of insulin resistance and hypertension ( Euser 2005 ; Singhal 2007 ; Euser 2008 ).\n\n【67】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【68】Given the potential for multi‐nutrient fortification of human breast milk to affect important outcomes for preterm infants, this review aims to detect, appraise, and synthesise available evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform practice and research.\n\n【69】Objectives\n----------\n\n【70】To determine whether multi‐nutrient fortified human milk, compared with unfortified human milk, affects important outcomes (including growth rate and neurodevelopment) of preterm infants without increasing the risk of adverse effects (such as feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis).\n\n【71】Methods\n-------\n\n【72】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【73】#### Types of studies\n\n【74】Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, including cluster‐randomised controlled trials. We did not include cross‐over trials.\n\n【75】#### Types of participants\n\n【76】Preterm (< 37 weeks' gestational age) and low birth weight (< 2500 g) infants receiving human breast milk.\n\n【77】#### Types of interventions\n\n【78】Multi‐nutrient fortification of human breast milk (expressed maternal or donor or both) with protein _and_ non‐protein energy (carbohydrate or fat). Multi‐nutrient fortifiers additionally could contain minerals, iron, vitamins, or other nutrients. Multi‐nutrient fortifiers could be cow (or another animal) milk‐based or human milk‐based. The control group should not have received protein _or_ non‐protein energy fortification but could have received milk supplemented with minerals, iron, vitamins, or other nutrients.\n\n【79】Eligible trials should have planned to allocate the trial intervention for a sufficient period (at least two weeks) to allow measurable effects on growth. Infants in comparison groups within each trial should have received similar care other than the level of fortification of breast milk. No between‐group differences in target levels of volume of milk intake should have occurred.\n\n【80】We did not include trials of:\n\n【81】*   targeted or adjustable fortification (vs standard fortification);\n    \n*   early versus later introduction of multi‐nutrient fortifier; or\n    \n*   human milk‐based versus cow milk‐based fortifier\n    \n\n【82】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【83】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【84】*   Growth: weight, length, head growth, skinfold thickness, body mass index, and measures of body composition (lean/fat mass) and growth restriction (proportion of infants who remain < 10th percentile for the index population distribution of weight, length, or head circumference)\n    \n*   Neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed after 12 months post term: neurological evaluations, developmental scores, and classifications of disability, including auditory and visual disability. We defined neurodevelopmental impairment as the presence of one or more of the following: non‐ambulant cerebral palsy, developmental quotient more than two standard deviations below the population mean, and blindness (visual acuity < 6/60) or deafness (any hearing impairment requiring or unimproved by amplification)\n    \n\n【85】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【86】*   Duration of hospital admission (weeks)\n    \n*   Feed intolerance that results in cessation of or reduction in enteral feeding\n    \n*   Necrotising enterocolitis (modified Bell stage 2/3; Walsh 1986 )\n    \n*   Measures of bone mineralisation such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, or bone mineral content assessed by dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and clinical or radiological evidence of rickets on long‐term follow‐up (restricted to trials without mineral supplementation of the control group)\n    \n*   Measures of long‐term metabolic or cardiovascular health, including insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension\n    \n\n【87】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【88】We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal.\n\n【89】#### Electronic searches\n\n【90】We updated the searches to identify reports of trials available since the searches in December 2014 and February 2016 ( Appendix 1 ). We searched these databases on 26 September 2019: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, in the Cochrane Library (2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) Complete (EBSCO), and Maternity and Infant Care (Ovid). We imported and de‐duplicated search results against previous search results from December 2014. We did not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【91】We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing or recently completed trials on 30 September 2019 ( ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization’s International Trials Registry Platform ‐ https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ).\n\n【92】#### Searching other resources\n\n【93】We examined the references in studies identified as potentially relevant. We also searched abstracts from annual meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1993 to 2019), the European Society for Paediatric Research (1995 to 2019), the UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (2000 to 2019), and the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand (2000 to 2019). We considered trials reported only as abstracts to be eligible if sufficient information was available from the report, or from contact with study authors, to fulfil the inclusion criteria.\n\n【94】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【95】We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal.\n\n【96】#### Selection of studies\n\n【97】One review author (JVEB) screened titles and abstracts of all records identified by the search and coded records as \"order\" or \"exclude\". A second review author (LL) assessed all records coded as \"order\" and made the final decision about which records were ordered as full‐text articles. JVEB read the full texts and used a checklist to assess each article's eligibility for inclusion on the basis of pre‐specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. WM checked these decisions.\n\n【98】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【99】Two review authors (JVEB and LL) extracted data independently using a data collection form to aid extraction of information on design, methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, and treatment effects from each included study. We discussed disagreements until we reached consensus. If data from the trial reports were insufficient, we contacted trialists for further information.\n\n【100】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【101】Two review authors (JVEB and LL) independently assessed the risk of bias (low, high, or unclear) of all included trials using the Cochrane ‘Risk of bias’ tool ( Higgins 2019 ) for the following domains.\n\n【102】*   Sequence generation (selection bias).\n    \n*   Allocation concealment (selection bias).\n    \n*   Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias).\n    \n*   Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).\n    \n*   Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).\n    \n\n【103】Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third assessor (WM).\n\n【104】See Appendix 2 for a description of risk of bias for each domain.\n\n【105】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【106】We analysed treatment effects in the individual trials using Review Manager 5.3 and reported risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We determined the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for analyses with a statistically significant difference in the RD.\n\n【107】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【108】The unit of analysis was the participating infant in individually randomised trials. For cluster‐randomised trials (had we identified any for inclusion), we planned to undertake analyses at the level of the individual while accounting for clustering in the data using methods recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2019 ).\n\n【109】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【110】We requested additional data from trial investigators when data on important outcomes were missing or were reported unclearly. When data were still missing, we examined the impact of this on effect size estimates in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【111】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【112】We examined treatment effects in individual trials and heterogeneity between trial results by inspecting the forest plots if more than one trial was included in a meta‐analysis. We calculated the I² statistic for each analysis to quantify inconsistency across studies and to describe the percentage of variability in effect estimates that may be due to heterogeneity rather than to sampling error. If we detected moderate (I² > 50%) or high (I² > 75%) heterogeneity, we explored possible causes (e.g. differences in study design, participants, interventions, or completeness of outcome assessments).\n\n【113】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【114】For outcomes with 10 or more trials contributing events in the meta‐analysis, we investigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we performed exploratory analyses to investigate this, including exploration of differences in study design, participants, interventions, or completeness of outcome assessments.\n\n【115】#### Data synthesis\n\n【116】We used fixed‐effect models for meta‐analysis (as per Cochrane Neonatal recommendations). When moderate or high heterogeneity existed, we planned to examine the potential causes in subgroup and sensitivity analyses.\n\n【117】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【118】We planned to undertake these subgroup analyses, when possible.\n\n【119】*   Very preterm (< 32 weeks' gestation) or VLBW (< 1500 g) infants (versus infants 32 to 36 weeks' gestation or birth weight 1500 to 2499 g).\n    \n*   Fortification of donor breast milk (versus maternal expressed breast milk).\n    \n*   Trials using fortifier extracted from human milk (versus cow milk‐based fortifier).\n    \n*   Trials supplementing breast milk with infant formula (versus cow milk‐based fortifier).\n    \n*   Trials conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries versus those in high‐income countries (see http://data.worldbank.org/about/country‐classifications).\n    \n\n【120】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【121】If meta‐analyses were moderately or highly heterogeneous (I² > 50%), we planned sensitivity analyses to determine whether findings were affected (and heterogeneity reduced) by including only studies at low overall risk of bias, defined as adequate randomisation and allocation concealment, masking of intervention and measurement, and < 10% loss to follow‐up for outcome assessment.\n\n【122】##### Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of evidence\n\n【123】We used the \"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\" (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the Grade Handbook ( Schünemann 2013 ), to assess the certainty of evidence for these outcomes: growth, development, and necrotising enterocolitis.\n\n【124】Two review authors (WM and JVEB) independently assessed the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high certainty but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias (see Appendix 3 ). We used the GRADEpro GDT Guideline Development Tool to create a ‘Summary of findings’ table to report the certainty of evidence ( GRADEpro GDT ).\n\n【125】#### Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\n\n【126】We used the \"Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation\" (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the Grade Handbook ( Schünemann 2013 ), to assess the certainty of evidence of these outcomes: growth, development, necrotising enterocolitis.\n\n【127】Two review authors (WM and JVEB) independently assessed the certainty of the evidence for each of the outcomes. We considered evidence from randomised controlled trials as high certainty but downgraded the evidence one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates, and presence of publication bias (see Appendix 3 ). We used the GRADEpro GDT Guideline Development Tool to create nine ‘Summary of findings’ tables to report the certainty of the evidence ( GRADEpro GDT ).\n\n【128】Results\n-------\n\n【129】### Description of studies\n\n【130】See Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【131】#### Results of the search\n\n【132】After searching all of the databases and trial registers, we had retrieved 3620 records. We de‐duplicated these against results from previous searches carried out for this review. This left 1170 unique records. We identified one additional record from a different source and screened 1171 titles and abstracts, of which we excluded 1159 as irrelevant.\n\n【133】We assessed 11 studies as full text; we included four of these and excluded the remaining seven.\n\n【134】See Figure 1 for the study selection process and Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies for further detail on the studies we considered for inclusion in this review.\n\n【135】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【136】Figure 1\n\n【137】* * *\n\n【138】* * *\n\n【139】Study flow diagram.\n\n【140】#### Included studies\n\n【141】We included in this review 18 trials (17 primary publications) in which 1456 infants participated ( Modanlou 1986 ; Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Pettifor 1989 ; Polberger 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Faerk 2000 ; Bhat 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Sample sizes ranged between 14 and 275 participants.\n\n【142】All trials were conducted in specialist paediatric hospitals, typically in neonatal intensive care units. Fourteen were single‐centre trials ( Modanlou 1986 ; Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Pettifor 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Bhat 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ), and each of the remaining four was conducted at two centres ( Polberger 1989 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Faerk 2000 ).\n\n【143】The trials were conducted in Europe ( Polberger 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Lucas 1996 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Faerk 2000 ), Asia ( Bhat 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ), North America ( Modanlou 1986 ; Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Wauben 1998 ), Africa ( Pettifor 1989 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; El Sakka 2016 ), and South America ( El Sakka 2016 ). Publication dates span four decades, ranging from 1986 to 2019.\n\n【144】##### Participants\n\n【145】All trials included preterm or LBW infants and excluded those with major congenital abnormalities. Eleven trials restricted participation to very preterm or VLBW infants ( Modanlou 1986 ; Pettifor 1989 ; Polberger 1989 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Faerk 2000 ; Bhat 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ). Adhisivam 2019 enrolled \"healthy preterm infants\" without specifying a birth weight criterion. Other trials specified the upper birth weight eligibility threshold as:\n\n【146】*   1600 g ( Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) );\n    \n*   1800 g ( Gathwala 2012 ; Wauben 1998 );\n    \n*   1850 g ( Lucas 1996 ); or\n    \n*   2000 g ( Porcelli 1992 ).\n    \n\n【147】##### Interventions\n\n【148】Six trials used only maternal breast milk ( Pettifor 1989 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Wauben 1998 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ) One trial used only donor human breast milk ( Adhisivam 2019 ). Seven trials used a mixture of mother's own milk and donor milk ( Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Polberger 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Faerk 2000 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ). Investigators in the remaining four trials used formula to supplement maternal milk feeds to the required volume ( Modanlou 1986 ; Lucas 1996 ; Bhat 2003 ; Gathwala 2012 ).\n\n【149】Types of multi‐nutrient fortification added to milk for infants in the intervention groups varied. Most trials used a commercially available, cow's milk‐based, powdered preparation containing varying amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals, electrolytes, and trace minerals.\n\n【150】*   Similac Human Milk Fortifier (Ross Laboratories): Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) . Gross 1987 (1) included a third group of infants receiving human milk fortified with formula (see below).\n    \n*   FM85 (Nestlè): Porcelli 1992 ; Einloft 2015 .\n    \n*   Enfamil HMF (Mead Johnson): Lucas 1996 .\n    \n*   Nutriprem (Cow & Gate Nutricia): Nicholl 1999 .\n    \n*   Eoprotin (Milupa): Faerk 2000 .\n    \n*   Lactodex HMF (Raptakos Brett): Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Adhisivam 2019 .\n    \n*   Trial‐specific multi‐nutrient fortifier (Wyeth‐Ayerst): Wauben 1998 .\n    \n\n【151】Four trials used preterm formula powder as the multi‐nutrient fortifier.\n\n【152】*   Similac Special Care (Ross Laboratories): Gross 1987 (1) .\n    \n*   Alprem (Nestlè): Zuckerman 1994 .\n    \n*   Bebelac Premature (Nutricia): El Sakka 2016 .\n    \n*   Simyl LBW (FDC Ltd): Gupta 2018 .\n    \n\n【153】Three trials did not specify the name or manufacturer of the multi‐nutrient fortifier used: Modanlou 1986 ; Polberger 1989 ; Bhat 2003 .\n\n【154】Participants received the intervention when tolerating a specified quantity of milk feeds daily, typically at least 100 mL/kg, or when receiving \"full\" enteral feeds, typically 150 mL/kg/d. The duration of intervention varied between trials, but the intervention was usually provided until a pre‐specified body weight was attained (most commonly, 1800 to 2000 g), or until a pre‐specified postmenstual age (36 weeks), or until discharge home from hospital.\n\n【155】##### Comparators\n\n【156】Most trials added vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients to control infant feeds as part of standard hospital practice. Five trials provided all infants with additional vitamin D ( Pettifor 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Faerk 2000 ; El Sakka 2016 ). Eight trials provided all infants with multi‐vitamins, iron, and minerals (added to feeds for infants in the control group, and included in the fortifier or added separately for infants in the intervention group) ( Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Polberger 1989 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Einloft 2015 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Researchers in five trials gave no supplements at all to control group infants ( Modanlou 1986 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Bhat 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ).\n\n【157】##### Outcomes\n\n【158】Fourteen trials reported in‐hospital growth rate data ( Modanlou 1986 ; Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Pettifor 1989 ; Polberger 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Only Lucas 1996 reported growth and neurodevelopmental data at follow‐up beyond hospital discharge.\n\n【159】#### Excluded studies\n\n【160】See Characteristics of excluded studies for details. We excluded:\n\n【161】*   Carey 1987 ; Greer 1988 ; and Atchley 2019 because they used fortification with protein only (no fortification with fat or carbohydrate);\n    \n*   Arco 2002 ; Tarcan 2004 ; Arslanoglu 2009 ; Reali 2010 ; Hair 2014 ; and Ramaswamy 2019 because they were not randomised controlled trials;\n    \n*   Abrams 2014 because it compared human versus cow's milk‐based protein fortification rather than fortification versus no fortification; and\n    \n*   Chan 2000 ; Miura 2009 ; and Kim 2015 because these trials conducted comparisons of different fortifiers, with no control group receiving unfortified milk.\n    \n\n【162】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【163】See Figure 2 .\n\n【164】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【165】Figure 2\n\n【166】* * *\n\n【167】* * *\n\n【168】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【169】#### Allocation\n\n【170】Risk of selection bias was largely \"unclear\". Seven trials described adequate methods of random sequence generation ( Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Einloft 2015 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Four explicitly described adequate allocation concealment methods ( Lucas 1996 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Zuckerman 1994 was at high risk of selection bias, as investigators performed group allocation in a quasi‐randomised fashion (odd and even hospital numbers).\n\n【171】#### Blinding\n\n【172】Nine trials were known to be at high risk of performance and selection bias as reports stated that personnel and outcome assessors were not masked ( Modanlou 1986 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ; Gupta 2018 ; Adhisivam 2019 ). Risk of performance and selection bias was \"unclear\" in the other trial reports.\n\n【173】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【174】We judged seven trials to be at high risk of attrition bias ( Modanlou 1986 ; Pettifor 1989 ; Polberger 1989 ; Wauben 1998 ; Faerk 2000 ; Einloft 2015 ; El Sakka 2016 ), and the other trials to be at low risk.\n\n【175】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【176】Authors of three trial reports were employees of the manufacturer of the fortifier used ( Modanlou 1986 ; Lucas 1996 ; Wauben 1998 ). The manufacturer of the fortifier funded three trials ( Pettifor 1989 ; Lucas 1996 ; Einloft 2015 ).\n\n【177】### Effects of interventions\n\n【178】See: **Summary of findings 1** Multi‐nutrient fortification of human milk for preterm infants\n\n【179】#### Growth rates (Outcomes 1.1 to 1.6)\n\n【180】_Weight gain_ ( Analysis 1.1 ). Meta‐analysis of data from 14 trials including 951 infants showed a higher rate of weight gain in the intervention (fortifier) group (mean difference (MD) 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 2.22 g/kg/d). Moderate heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I² = 65%) ( Figure 3 ). This was not explained in sensitivity analyses. The funnel plot was not asymmetrical. We assessed the certainty of evidence as \"low\" using GRADE methods, downgraded for risk of bias in included trials and for unexplained heterogeneity in the meta‐analysis ( summary of findings Table 1 ).\n\n【181】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【182】Figure 3\n\n【183】* * *\n\n【184】* * *\n\n【185】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Fortified breast milk versus unfortified breast milk, outcome: 1.1 Weight gain (g/kg/d).\n\n【186】_Length gain_ ( Analysis 1.2 ). Meta‐analysis of data from 10 trials including 741 infants showed a higher rate of length gain in the intervention group (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.15 cm/week). Moderate heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I² = 69%) ( Figure 4 ). This was not explained in sensitivity analyses. The funnel plot was not asymmetrical. We assessed the certainty of evidence as \"low\" using GRADE methods, downgraded for risk of bias in included trials and for unexplained heterogeneity in meta‐analysis ( summary of findings Table 1 ).\n\n【187】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【188】Figure 4\n\n【189】* * *\n\n【190】* * *\n\n【191】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Fortified breast milk versus unfortified breast milk, outcome: 1.2 Length gain (cm/week).\n\n【192】_Head growth_ ( Analysis 1.3 ). Meta‐analysis of data from 11 trials including 821 infants showed a higher rate of head growth in the intervention group (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08 cm/week). We detected low heterogeneity in this analysis (I² = 42%) ( Figure 5 ). The funnel plot was not asymmetrical. We assessed the certainty of evidence as \"moderate\" using GRADE methods, downgraded for risk of bias in included trials ( summary of findings Table 1 ).\n\n【193】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【194】Figure 5\n\n【195】* * *\n\n【196】* * *\n\n【197】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Fortified breast milk versus unfortified breast milk, outcome: 1.3 Head growth (cm/week).\n\n【198】_Weight at 12 to 18 months_ ( Analysis 1.4 ). We obtained data from Lucas 1996 and Wauben 1998 (270 infants). Neither trial nor a meta‐analysis of their data showed an effect (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.25 kg).\n\n【199】_Length at 12 to 18 months_ ( Analysis 1.5 ). We obtained data from Lucas 1996 and Wauben 1998 (270 infants). Neither trial nor a meta‐analysis of their data showed an effect (MD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.98 to 0.60 cm).\n\n【200】_Head circumference at 12 to 18 months_ ( Analysis 1.6 ). We obtained data from Lucas 1996 and Wauben 1998 (270 infants). Neither trial nor a meta‐analysis of their data showed an effect (MD ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.18 cm).\n\n【201】#### Neurodevelopmental outcomes after 12 months of age (Outcomes 1.7 and 1.8)\n\n【202】One trial (245 infants) reported data ( Lucas 1996 ). This trial showed no statistically significant differences in:\n\n【203】*   mental development index at 18 months ( Analysis 1.7 ): MD 2.20 (95% CI ‐3.35 to 7.75); or\n    \n*   psychomotor development index at 18 months ( Analysis 1.8 ): MD 2.40 (95% CI ‐1.90 to 6.70).\n    \n\n【204】We assessed the certainty of evidence as \"moderate\" using GRADE methods, downgraded for imprecision of estimates of effect ( summary of findings Table 1 ).\n\n【205】#### Length of hospital stay in weeks (Outcome 1.9)\n\n【206】Meta‐analysis of data from six trials including 526 infants did not show a difference (MD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.21 weeks; Analysis 1.9 ).\n\n【207】#### Feed intolerance (Outcome 1.10)\n\n【208】Meta‐analysis of data from seven trials including 453 infants did not show an effect (typical RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.67; Analysis 1.10 ).\n\n【209】#### Necrotising enterocolitis (Outcome 1.11)\n\n【210】Meta‐analysis of data from 13 trials including 1110 infants did not show an effect (typical RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.63; Analysis 1.11 ). Low heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I² = 0%). We assessed the certainty of evidence as \"low\" using GRADE methods, downgraded for high risk of bias in most trials and for imprecision of estimates of effect ( summary of findings Table 1 ).\n\n【211】#### Measures of bone mineralisation (Outcomes 1.12 and 1.13)\n\n【212】_Serum alkaline phosphatase_ ( Analysis 1.12 ). Meta‐analysis of data obtained from six trials (restricted to trials without mineral supplementation of the control group) showed that the intervention group had lower serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels ( Modanlou 1986 ; Pettifor 1989 ; Zuckerman 1994 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Einloft 2015 ): weighted mean difference (WMD) ‐142 (95% CI ‐204 to ‐80) IU/L. Moderate heterogeneity was present in this analysis (I² = 60%). Bhat 2003 did not report peak ALP levels but did state that the intervention group included fewer infants who developed high ALP levels (> 450 IU/L) than were included in the control group (without mineral supplementation).\n\n【213】_Bone mineral content_ ( Analysis 1.13 ). Only Pettifor 1989 provided numerical data and reported higher bone mineral content in the intervention group: WMD 12.0 (95% CI 6.3 to 17.7) mg/cm. Modanlou 1986 , Gross 1987 (1) , and Gross 1987 (2) detected no statistically significant differences between control and treatment groups but did not report numerical data for inclusion in meta‐analyses.\n\n【214】#### Measures of metabolic health for long‐term follow‐up\n\n【215】None of the trials reported these measures.\n\n【216】#### Subgroup analyses\n\n【217】##### Very preterm or VLBW infants\n\n【218】Meta‐analyses of data from trials that restricted participation to very preterm or VLBW infants showed no differences in the meta‐analyses of all trial data ( Analysis 1.1 ; Analysis 1.2 ; Analysis 1.3 ; Analysis 1.9 ; Analysis 1.10 ; Analysis 1.11 ; Analysis 1.12 ; Analysis 1.13 ).\n\n【219】##### Fortifcation of donor breast milk\n\n【220】One trial used donor milk exclusively ( Adhisivam 2019 ). Seven trials supplemented mother's own milk with donor milk ( Gross 1987 (1) ; Gross 1987 (2) ; Polberger 1989 ; Porcelli 1992 ; Nicholl 1999 ; Faerk 2000 ; Mukhopadhyay 2007 ). Outcome data for infants fed with donor breast milk exclusively were not available to include in subgroup meta‐analyses with Adhisivam 2019 .\n\n【221】##### Trials using fortifier extracted from human milk (rather than cow's milk‐based fortifiers)\n\n【222】All trials included in this review used cow's milk‐based fortifiers.\n\n【223】##### Trials using infant formula as the multi‐nutrient fortifier\n\n【224】Gross 1987 (2) (for a subset of the intervention group); Zuckerman 1994 ; El Sakka 2016 ; and Gupta 2018 used preterm infant formula powder to fortify breast milk.\n\n【225】_Growth parameters_ ( Analysis 1.1 ; Analysis 1.2 ; Analysis 1.3 ). Meta‐analysis of date from Gross 1987 (2) and Gupta 2018 showed pooled effects consistent with the overall meta‐analyses ( Figure 3 ; Figure 4 ; Figure 5 ).\n\n【226】_Length of hospital stay_ ( Analysis 1.9 ). Meta‐analysis of date from Zuckerman 1994 ; El Sakka 2016 ; and Gupta 2018 showed pooled effects consistent with the overall meta‐analysis.\n\n【227】_Necrotising enterocolitis_ ( Analysis 1.11 ). Meta‐analysis of date from Zuckerman 1994 and Gupta 2018 showed pooled effects consistent with the overall meta‐analysis.\n\n【228】_Serum level of ALP_ ( Analysis 1.12 ). Analysis of data from Zuckerman 1994 showed an effect consistent with the overall meta‐analysis.\n\n【229】##### Trials conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries\n\n【230】Eight trials were conducted in middle‐income countries: Pettifor 1989 and Zuckerman 1994 in South Africa (upper middle‐income country), El Sakka 2016 in Egypt (lower middle‐income country), Einloft 2015 in Brazil (upper middle‐income country), and Mukhopadhyay 2007 ; Gathwala 2012 ; Gupta 2018 ; and Adhisivam 2019 in India (lower middle‐income country). Meta‐analyses showed no significant differences from the meta‐analyses of all trials together ( Analysis 1.1 ; Analysis 1.2 ; Analysis 1.3 ; Analysis 1.9 ; Analysis 1.10 ; Analysis 1.11 ; Analysis 1.12 ; Analysis 1.13 ).\n\n【231】Discussion\n----------\n\n【232】### Summary of main results\n\n【233】Evidence from 18 randomised controlled trials shows that multi‐nutrient fortification results in modest increases in in‐hospital rates of weight gain, length gain, and head growth for preterm infants. Few data are available for growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy, and these show no effects of fortification. None of the trials has reported data related to possible longer‐term \"programmed\" metabolic or physiological consequences of multi‐nutrient supplementation in early infancy.\n\n【234】Meta‐analysis of data from trials that included a control group without bone mineral supplementation showed that multi‐nutrient fortification reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels but provided limited evidence of effects on other measures of bone mineralisation or health. This review found no consistent evidence of other benefits or harms of multi‐nutrient fortification, including no data to suggest that fortification increases the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants.\n\n【235】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【236】We recommend cautious interpretation and application of these findings. Although meta‐analyses indicate that multi‐nutrient fortification increases rates of growth, typical effect sizes are small. Over the course of four weeks, multi‐nutrient fortification for a very preterm infant weighing 1 kg at birth would result in an extra 50 g of weight gain, 4 mm of length gain, and 2 mm of head circumference gain. The clinical importance of these effects on in‐hospital growth rates is unclear, and uncertainty remains about the long‐term impact on growth or development. Similarly, although multi‐nutrient fortification that includes minerals (versus human breast milk without added minerals) reduces the serum ALP level, this is an insensitive measure of bone mineralisation or health ( Tinnion 2012 ). In current clinical practice, mineral supplements (mainly phosphate) are available for infants at high risk of, or with biochemical or other features of, metabolic bone disease.\n\n【237】Meta‐analyses of growth outcomes showed heterogeneity that was not explained by major differences in trial design or conduct. Participants in these trials were similar (mostly stable very low birth weight (VLBW) infants). Although we noted some variation in the types of fortifier used, the overall target level of fortification and the duration of administration were similar. Most trials aimed to provide extra protein and non‐protein energy by adding a powdered, commercially available, multi‐nutrient fortifier to breast milk to attain about 80 kcal/100 mL and about 2.0 to 2.6 g of protein/100 mL (plus proportionate supplements of minerals, vitamins, and trace elements). This approach aims to maintain optimal protein‐to‐energy ratios to ensure that the protein contributed to growth and was not catabolised as a fuel source ( Kashyap 1994 ). These total levels of protein and energy, however, are at the lower bounds of currently recommended intakes needed to match intrauterine accretion (based on receiving about 150 mL/kg/d of milk), and this is a possible explanation for the modest impact of the intervention on growth parameters.\n\n【238】A major limitation of this review is that most included trials were undertaken at healthcare facilities in high‐income countries, and few were conducted in community settings or in middle‐ or low‐income countries. Reported evidence therefore may be of limited use to inform care practice in the resource‐limited settings where most preterm and low birth weight infants are cared for globally ( Imdad 2013 ).\n\n【239】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【240】We assessed the certainty of evidence as low or moderate for most outcomes ( summary of findings Table 1 ). Included trials were generally small and had methodological quality weaknesses, including inadequate measures to conceal random allocation and incomplete follow‐up assessment during the intervention period. Masking of clinicians, parents, and caregivers was not possible given the nature of the intervention, but this is not likely to be a major source of bias in growth assessments. Knowledge of the intervention group may have affected caregivers' or mothers' perceptions and views of feeding, and it may have influenced decisions on whether any formula should be given as a supplement to (or instead of) breast milk. These trials did not examine whether multi‐nutrient fortification affected the mother's commitment to establish breastfeeding, or whether differences were noted in the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at the end of the intervention period.\n\n【241】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【242】Our main concern with the review process is the possibility that findings may be subject to publication and other reporting biases. We attempted to minimise this threat by screening the reference lists of included trials and related reviews and searching the proceedings of major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that are not (or are not yet) published in full form in academic journals. The meta‐analyses that we performed did not contain sufficient trials to explore symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or reporting bias.\n\n【243】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【244】These findings are broadly consistent with those of another Cochrane Review, which showed that preterm infants who received nutrient‐enriched formula (similar energy and protein levels to multi‐nutrient fortified human breast milk) versus standard formula (similar energy and protein levels to unfortified human breast milk) had higher in‐hospital rates of weight gain (mean difference (MD) 2.43 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 3.26), length gain (MD 0.02 cm/week, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11), and head circumference growth (MD 0.1 cm/week, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19) ( Walsh 2019 ).\n\n【245】Figures and Tables -\n\n【246】Figure 1\n\n【247】Study flow diagram.\n\n【248】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To investigate whether there are significant differences in efficacy between nebulisers compared to pMDI or DPI currently used for bronchodilator therapy in exacerbations of COPD.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important respiratory diseases and the third leading cause of death worldwide ( WHO 2014 ). It is often caused by exposure to smoke and pollution, is characterized by lung function decline and associated with decreased quality of life. Patients with COPD can have episodes with worsening of respiratory symptoms which require additional treatment ( Burge 2003 ). COPD exacerbations are the main driver of quality of life in COPD, of survival, and of more than 50% of costs incurred in COPD.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Bronchodilation is important in the medical treatment of COPD, both in stable state and during exacerbations ( GOLD 2015 ). Differences remain in the prescribing habits of individual clinicians in terms of type of bronchodilator, dosing, and devices.The choice of drug, dose, and device all in their own way contribute to the success of inhaled medication.\n\n【9】The inhaled bronchodilators used in COPD are short‐acting beta <sub>2 </sub> ‐agonists (SABA), long‐acting beta <sub>2 </sub> ‐agonists (LABA), and short‐and long‐acting anticholinergics. These are administered through various devices ( GOLD 2015 ).\n\n【10】Nebulizers are frequently used, especially in the acute setting, and many patients seem to benefit from them ( Zheng 2014 ). However evidence from systematic analysis is lacking to support the choice for nebulisers ( Turner 1997 ). Clinicians routinely prescribe bronchodilators by pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI) without systematic analyses to support this practice.\n\n【11】This Cochrane review will asses the evidence about nebulised bronchodilator treatment versus delivery by pMDI with spacer or by DPI, during acute exacerbations in COPD.\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】The benefit of bronchodilation in treating COPD has been clearly established. Several systematic reviews have shown this for SABA, LABA, and anticholinergics ( Appleton 2006 ; Kew 2014 ). However, less is known about the best mode of delivery for these treatments. Important features known to affect the deposition are particle size, choice of the device, respiration pattern and inhalation technique. During exacerbations of COPD, nebulisers, as well as pMDI and DPI, have been shown to be useful in delivering medication into the lungs ( Mazhar 2008 ; Demoly 2014 ,). However there are differences between both device types, which may lead to differences in efficacy. For instance, nebulisers have a higher deposition in the larger airways and pMDI and DPI have a higher deposition in the lower airways.The use of nebulisers is more time consuming compared with pMDI/DPI. Patients require a better inhalation technique to inhale their bronchodilators by DPI and especially pMDI without spacer. Due to the nature of exacerbations, the best choice of a delivery method of bronchodilators may be different from stable state.\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Although there is consensus on the use of bronchodilators, little attention is paid to the mode of delivery. As a consequence, large variation in the mode of delivery exists between countries, within countries and even between doctors within the same hospital. We will asses the available RCTs to help guide practice in a more uniform way.\n\n【16】Objectives\n----------\n\n【17】To investigate whether there are significant differences in efficacy between nebulisers compared to pMDI or DPI currently used for bronchodilator therapy in exacerbations of COPD.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【20】#### Types of studies\n\n【21】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of both parallel and crossover designs reported as full‐text articles. RCTs during COPD exacerbations, whether measured during hospitalization or in an outpatient setting, will be included.\n\n【22】#### Types of participants\n\n【23】We will include trials of patients with an exacerbation of COPD, defined as an acute event characterized by worsening of a patient’s respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day‐to‐day variations and leads to a change in medication. COPD is defined by a post‐bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV <sub>1) </sub> below 80% predicted and FEV <sub>1 </sub> / forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7. Treatment can be at home or in the clinic or hospital.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】We will include trials comparing the same bronchodilator medication by nebuliser with the same bronchodilator medication by either pMDI (with or without spacer) or DPI. Co‐interventions and trials involving inhaled steroids are allowed.\n\n【26】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【27】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【28】1.  Change in FEV1 one hour after dosing.\n    \n2.  Serious adverse events.\n    \n\n【29】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【30】1.  Change to peak FEV <sub>1 </sub> .\n    \n2.  Change in FEV <sub>1 </sub> closest to one hour after dosing (within six hours after dosing).\n    \n3.  Change in FEV <sub>1 </sub> at other time‐points during the first 24 hours after dosing.\n    \n4.  Change in dyspnoea score at one hour and at other time‐points during the first 24 hours after dosing.\n    \n5.  Change in quality of life on the first day of dosing.\n    \n6.  Admission rates.\n    \n7.  Time in hospital emergency department.\n    \n8.  Length of hospital stay.\n    \n9.  Change in oxygen saturation.\n    \n10.  Hospital re‐admission in 30 days.\n    \n11.  Adverse events/side effects.\n    \n\n【31】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【32】#### Electronic searches\n\n【33】We will identify trials from the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR), which is maintained by the Trials Search Co‐ordinator for the Cochrane Airways Group. The CAGR contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see Appendix 1 for further details). We will search all records in the CAGR using the search strategy in Appendix 2 .\n\n【34】We will also search ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We will search all databases from their inception to the present, and we will impose no restriction on language of publication.\n\n【35】#### Searching other resources\n\n【36】We will check reference lists of all primary trials and review articles for additional references. Relevant manufacturers' websites will be searched for trial information.\n\n【37】We will search for errata or retractions from included trials published in full‐text on PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and report the date we performed this in the Cochrane review.\n\n【38】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【39】#### Selection of studies\n\n【40】Two review authors (WG and HK) will independently screen titles and abstracts for inclusion of all the potential trials we identify as a result of the search and code them as 'retrieve' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. Based on consensus reached, we will retrieve the full‐text articles. Two review authors will independently screen the full‐text articles and identify trials for inclusion. We will report the reasons for exclusion of the ineligible trials in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third review author. We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same trial so that each trial rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram.\n\n【41】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【42】We will use a data collection form, which has been piloted on at least one trial included in the review, to record trial characteristics and outcome data. Two review authors will extract all trial characteristics from included trials. We will extract the following trial characteristics:\n\n【43】1.  Methods: trial design, total duration of trial, details of any 'run in' period, number of trial centres and location, trial setting, withdrawals, and date of trial.\n    \n2.  Participants: N, mean age, age range, gender, severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, baseline lung function, smoking history, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.\n    \n3.  Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, and excluded medications.\n    \n4.  Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and time points reported.\n    \n5.  Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors.\n    \n\n【44】Two review authors will extract outcome data from included trials. We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data was not reported in a usable way. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. One review author, WG, will transfer data into RevMan 2014 . We will double‐check that data are entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the trial reports. A second review author will check the papers' trial characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.\n\n【45】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【46】Two review authors will assess risk of bias for each trial using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving a third review author. We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains:\n\n【47】1.  Random sequence generation.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment.\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel.\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment.\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting.\n    \n7.  Other bias.\n    \n\n【48】We will grade each potential source of bias as either 'high', 'low', or 'unclear' and provide a quote from the trial report together with a justification for our judgment in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise the 'Risk of bias' judgements across different trials for each of the domains listed. We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes where necessary (e.g. for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of bias for all‐cause mortality may be very different than for a patient reported pain scale). Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【49】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the trials that contribute to that outcome.\n\n【50】##### Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review\n\n【51】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section.\n\n【52】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【53】We will analyse dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean difference or standardized mean difference (SMD) values. We will enter data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect.\n\n【54】We will undertake meta‐analyses only where this is meaningful i.e. if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense.\n\n【55】We will narratively describe skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges.\n\n【56】Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) are combined in the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【57】We will most often use a SMD. In the circumstance of these trials we expect that it is necessary to standardize the results of the trials to a uniform scale before they can be combined. The SMD expresses the size of the intervention effect in each trial relative to the variability observed in that trial\n\n【58】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【59】If we identify both cluster RCTs and individually RCTs, we plan to synthesize the acquired data. We will combine the results if only a little heterogeneity between the trial designs is detected, and bias based on the choice of randomization unit is considered to be unlikely. Otherwise we will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the _C ochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【60】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【61】If missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such trials in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis **.**\n\n【62】The trials we will examine for the primary outcomes will have only relatively short term outcomes. We expect some missing data for the primary outcome. No imputing of extrapolation of existing data will be performed.\n\n【63】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【64】We will use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will report it and explore possible causes.\n\n【65】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【66】If we are able to pool more than 10 trials, we will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small trial and publication biases.\n\n【67】#### Data synthesis\n\n【68】We will use a random‐effects model and perform a sensitivity analysis with a fixed‐effect model. The standard deviations are used to standardize the mean differences to a single scale as well as in the computation of trial weights.\n\n【69】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【70】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using both the primary and all secondary end points. We will use the five GRADE considerations (trial limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the trials which contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We will use methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) using GRADEpro software. We will detail all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of trials in the 'Summary of findings' table footnotes and make comments to aid readers' understanding of the review where necessary.\n\n【71】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【72】We will analyse data of bronchodilators pooled, pooled by mechanism (anticholinergic or beta‐adrenergic), pooled by short‐acting versus long‐acting, and analyse subgroups separately for SABA, LABA, SAMA, LAMA, and SABA/LAMA combinations. We will also stratify for treatment setting (hospital or outpatient)\n\n【73】We will analyse data of single dose trials in the primary endpoints, and we will analyse a subgroup of multiple treatment (doses) trials for the primary and secondary endpoints. This would help to deal with the confounding effect of titration if present in trials of COPD (more common in asthma).\n\n【74】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【75】We plan to carry out the following sensitivity analysis. In case of missing data which are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such trials in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Music interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms and treatment side effects in cancer patients.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess and compare the effects of music therapy and music medicine interventions for psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Science Citation Index, CancerLit, CAIRSS, Proquest Digital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, the RILM Abstracts of Music Literature, http://www.wfmt.info/Musictherapyworld/ and the National Research Register. We searched all databases, except for the last two, from their inception to January 2016; the other two are no longer functional, so we searched them until their termination date. We handsearched music therapy journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. There was no language restriction.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included all randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials of music interventions for improving psychological and physical outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with cancer. We excluded participants undergoing biopsy and aspiration for diagnostic purposes.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results in meta‐analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences. We used post‐test scores. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We identified 22 new trials for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence of this review rests on 52 trials with a total of 3731 participants. We included music therapy interventions offered by trained music therapists, as well as music medicine interventions, which are defined as listening to pre‐recorded music, offered by medical staff. We categorized 23 trials as music therapy trials and 29 as music medicine trials.\n\n【15】The results suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people with cancer, with a reported average anxiety reduction of 8.54 units (95% confidence interval (CI) −12.04 to −5.05, P < 0.0001) on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory ‐ State Anxiety (STAI‐S) scale (range 20 to 80) and −0.71 standardized units (13 studies, 1028 participants; 95% CI −0.98 to −0.43, P < 0.00001; low quality evidence) on other anxiety scales, a moderate to strong effect. Results also suggested a moderately strong, positive impact on depression (7 studies, 723 participants; standardized mean difference (SMD): −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.06, P = 0.02; very low quality evidence), but because of the very low quality of the evidence for this outcome, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. We found no support for an effect of music interventions on mood or distress.\n\n【16】Music interventions may lead to small reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure but do not appear to impact oxygen saturation level. We found a large pain‐reducing effect (7 studies, 528 participants; SMD: −0.91, 95% CI −1.46 to −0.36, P = 0.001, low quality evidence). In addition, music interventions had a small to moderate treatment effect on fatigue (6 studies, 253 participants; SMD: −0.38, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.04, P = 0.03; low quality evidence), but we did not find strong evidence for improvement in physical functioning.\n\n【17】The results suggest a large effect of music interventions on patients' quality of life (QoL), but the results were highly inconsistent across studies, and the pooled effect size for the music medicine and music therapy studies was accompanied by a large confidence interval (SMD: 0.98, 95% CI −0.36 to 2.33, P = 0.15, low quality evidence). A comparison between music therapy and music medicine interventions suggests a moderate effect of music therapy interventions for patients' quality of life (QoL) (3 studies, 132 participants; SMD: 0.42, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, P = 0.02; very low quality evidence), but we found no evidence of an effect for music medicine interventions. A comparison between music therapy and music medicine studies was also possible for anxiety, depression and mood, but we found no difference between the two types of interventions for these outcomes.\n\n【18】The results of single studies suggest that music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics as well as decrease recovery time and duration of hospitalization, but more research is needed for these outcomes.\n\n【19】We could not draw any conclusions regarding the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or communication outcomes because either we could not pool the results of the studies that included these outcomes or we could only identify one trial. For spiritual well‐being, we found no evidence of an effect in adolescents or young adults, and we could not draw any conclusions in adults.\n\n【20】The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, and therefore the quality of evidence is low.\n\n【21】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【22】This systematic review indicates that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and QoL in people with cancer. Furthermore, music may have a small effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Most trials were at high risk of bias and, therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution.\n\n【23】PICOs\n-----\n\n【24】### PICOs\n\n【25】###### Population (11)\n\n【26】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Cancer\n\n【27】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【28】*   Music Therapy\n\n【29】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【30】*   Psychosocial Intervention Strategy\n*   Placebo\n*   Usual Care\n\n【31】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【32】*   Adjustment Reaction With Physical Symptoms\n*   Psychological Symptom\n\n【33】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial interventions to improve quality of life. Music therapy and music medicine interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms and treatment side effects and address psychosocial needs in people with cancer. In music medicine interventions, the patient simply listens to pre‐recorded music that is offered by a medical professional. Music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.\n\n【40】**The aim of the review**  \nThis review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2011, which included 30 studies and found support for an effect of music interventions on several psychological and physical outcomes. For this review update, we searched for additional trials studying the effect of music interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer. We searched for published and ongoing studies up to January 2016. We considered all studies in which music therapy or music medicine was compared with standard treatment alone or standard care combined with other treatments or placebo.\n\n【41】**What are the main findings?**  \nWe identified 22 new studies, so the evidence in this review update now rests on 52 studies with 3731 participants. The findings suggest that music therapy and music medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety, pain, fatigue, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure in people with cancer. Because of the very low quality of the evidence for depression, it is unclear what impact music interventions may have. Music therapy but not music medicine interventions may improve patients' quality of life. We did not find evidence that music interventions improve mood, distress or physical functioning, but only a few trials studied these outcomes. We could not draw any conclusions about the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or communication outcomes because there were not enough trials looking at these aspects. Therefore, more research is needed.\n\n【42】No adverse effects of music interventions were reported.\n\n【43】**Quality of the evidence**  \nMost trials were at high risk of bias, so these results need to be interpreted with caution. We did not identify any conflicts of interests in the included studies.\n\n【44】**What are the conclusions?**  \nWe conclude that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in people with cancer. Furthermore, music may have a small positive effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Reduction of anxiety, fatigue and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they have an impact on health and overall QoL. Therefore, we recommend considering the inclusion of music therapy and music medicine interventions in psychosocial cancer care.\n\n【45】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【46】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【47】available in\n\n【48】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【49】### Implications for practice\n\n【50】This systematic review indicates that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and QoL in people with cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest that music may reduce heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, though this reduction is rather small and therefore may not be clinically significant. Results from single trials suggest that music listening in cancer patients undergoing surgery may reduce anesthetic and analgesic consumption and reduce the length of hospital stay, but more research is needed before drawing solid conclusions. Results from a single study furthermore suggest that post‐surgery recovery time may be shortened when a music therapist offers live, individualized music before and during surgery. Overall, evidence of the trials included in this review suggest that music interventions may be offered as a complementary treatment to people with cancer.\n\n【51】No evidence of effect was found for distress, mood, physical functioning, spiritual well‐being or oxygen saturation. However, only a small number of trials investigated the effects of music on these outcomes. More research is needed. We cannot draw any conclusions at this time regarding the effects of music interventions on coping, resilience, mean arterial pressure, immunologic functioning or communication behaviours because the results of the studies that included these outcomes could not be pooled or because we could only identify one trial.\n\n【52】### Implications for research\n\n【53】This systematic review provides evidence that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue, QoL, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients with cancer. Comparative analyses between music therapy and music medicine interventions indicate that music therapy is more effective in improving QoL than music medicine interventions. At this time, more RCTs are needed to determine the effectiveness of music medicine versus music therapy for outcomes other than quality of life. This can be achieved by including more music medicine as well as music therapy RCTs in future reviews, when these become available or, alternatively, future trials could directly compare the effects of these two types of interventions. It is important to note that Bradt 2015 undertook such a comparative study based on the recommendation of the original systematic review, concluding that both music therapy and music medicine interventions were similarly effective for symptom management. However, the results of their mixed methods research study clearly indicated that even listening to pre‐recorded music can evoke strong emotions and existential issues in people with cancer and that the participants in this study were grateful for the presence of a music therapist to process these emotions and fears. Participants furthermore emphasized the importance of interactive music making, as it allowed them to access their creativity; this is considered an important resource for the facilitation of resilience in the face of life's challenges.  \n  \nFuture research should explore patient characteristics as moderators of treatment benefits of music therapy interventions versus listening to pre‐recorded music. For example, Bradt 2015 suggested that listening to music may cause distress in patients who have a negative outlook on life. It is possible that these patients are at greater risk for music's powerful capacity to access sad and traumatic memories, and such patients may be better served by listening to music in the presence of a music therapist who can help them process their emotions. On the other hand, Bradt and colleagues emphasize that some patients have a great need for stability and emotional security during this challenging time in their life and may therefore prefer the familiarity of their own music. Self selected music presents predictable musical and emotional content and may therefore provide a much needed holding environment for the patient.\n\n【54】We recommend that future research efforts aim to enhance understanding of how each of music therapy and music medicine interventions can be optimized for symptom management, how music interventions can best serve patients along the cancer treatment trajectory, and what unique aspects of music therapy and music medicine interventions contribute to the care of patients ( Bradt 2015 ).\n\n【55】As stated in other reviews, it is important that investigators consider qualitative and mixed methods research, as these enhance understanding of the qualitative aspects of a patient's experience and identify factors that may contribute to or limit the effectiveness of music therapy or music medicine interventions ( Bradt 2013a ; Bradt 2010 ; Bradt 2014 ).\n\n【56】Future trials that use listening to pre‐recorded music should report more details related to the music selections made available to participants and exercise greater care in selecting music that reflects the patient's true preference (rather than just giving the patient the option to select from four or five general genres). In addition, researchers need to carefully consider the potential negative impact of the use of headphones during procedures because of hampered communication between the patient and medical personnel.\n\n【57】More research is needed that examines the relationship between frequency and duration of music interventions and treatment effects.\n\n【58】Many trials used small sample sizes and did not indicate the use of power calculations. Future trials need to include power calculations in order to use adequate sample sizes.\n\n【59】More studies are needed on the use of music interventions in pediatric patients with cancer. Of the 52 trials in this review, only four studies focused on outcomes in children and adolescents.\n\n【60】Many studies examined the effects of music interventions on anxiety, but more studies are needed for all other outcomes included in this review.\n\n【61】Formal cost‐benefit evaluations of music medicine and music therapy are needed.\n\n【62】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【63】Open in table viewer\n\n【64】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Many symptoms and treatment side effects have an impact on cancer patients' physical well‐being and quality of life (QoL), including appetite disturbance, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea or difficulty breathing, fatigue, insomnia, muscle weakness and numbness ( King 2003 ). In addition, study findings clearly indicate that people with cancer experience elevated levels of psychological distress and depression in response to diagnosis and treatment ( van't Spijker 1997 ; Massie 2004 ; Norton 2004 ; Parle 1996 ; Raison 2003 ; Sellick 1999 ). The actual experience of chemotherapy‐induced side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and their influence on psychological well‐being varies widely in patients receiving the same cytotoxic agents. This suggests that non‐pharmacological factors possibly play an important role in how patients experience or interpret physical symptoms during the treatment phase ( Montgomery 2000 ; Thune‐Boyle 2006 ). It is therefore important that cancer care incorporates services that help meet patients' psychological, social and spiritual needs.\n\n【72】### Description of the intervention\n\n【73】The use of music in cancer care can be situated along a continuum of care, namely from music listening initiated by patients, to pre‐recorded music offered by medical personnel, to music psychotherapy interventions offered by a trained music therapist. Therefore, when examining the efficacy of music interventions with cancer patients, it is important to make a clear distinction between music interventions administered by medical or healthcare professionals (music medicine) and those implemented by trained music therapists (music therapy). A substantive body of evidence suggests that music therapy interventions provided by medical professionals are significantly more effective than music medicine interventions for a wide variety of outcomes ( Dileo 2005 ). This difference might be attributed to the fact that music therapists individualize their interventions to meet patients' specific needs, more actively engage the patients in music making, and employ a systematic therapeutic process including assessment, treatment and evaluation. Dileo 1999 categorizes interventions as music medicine when medical personnel offer pre‐recorded music for passive listening. For example, they may offer people a CD for relaxation or distraction; however, no systematic therapeutic process is present, nor is there a systematic assessment of the elements and suitability of the music stimulus. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.\n\n【74】These music experiences include:\n\n【75】*   listening to live, improvised or pre‐recorded music;\n    \n*   performing music on an instrument;\n    \n*   improvising music spontaneously using voice, instruments or both;\n    \n*   composing music;\n    \n*   combining music with other therapeutic modalities (e.g. movement, imagery, art) ( Dileo 2007 ).\n    \n\n【76】### How the intervention might work\n\n【77】Music interventions have been used in different medical fields to meet patients' psychological, physical, social and spiritual needs. Research on the effects of music and music therapy for medical patients has burgeoned over the past 20 years, examining a variety of outcome measures in a wide range of specialty areas ( Dileo 2005 ). For both adult and pediatric cancer patients, music has been used to decrease anxiety prior to or during surgical procedures ( Burns 1999 ; Haun 2001 ; Pfaff 1989 ), to decrease stress during chemotherapy or radiation therapy ( Clark 2006 ; Weber 1996 ), to lessen treatment side effects ( Bozcuk 2006 ; Ezzone 1998 ; Frank 1985 ), to improve mood ( Bailey 1983 Barrera 2002 ; Burns 2001a ; Cassileth 2003 ), to enhance pain management ( Akombo 2006 ; Beck 1989 ), to improve immune system functioning ( Burns 2001a ; Camprubi 1999), and to improve quality of life (QoL) ( Burns 2001a ; Hilliard 2003 ).\n\n【78】There are inherent elements of music—such as rhythm and tempo, mode, pitch, timbre, melody and harmony—that are known to influence physiological and psycho‐emotional responses in humans. For example, music has been found to arouse memory and association, stimulate imagery, evoke emotions, facilitate social interaction, and promote relaxation and distraction ( Dileo 2006 ). In cancer settings, music therapists conduct ongoing assessments and utilize various individualized interventions in people with cancer and their families, including pertinent elements of music within the context of therapeutic relationships, to address prevailing biopsychosocial and spiritual issues, symptoms and needs ( Magill 2009 ; McClean 2012 ). The following music therapy interventions are common: use of songs (singing, song writing, and lyric analysis); music improvisation (instrumental and vocal), music and imagery, music‐based reminiscence and life review, chanting and toning, music‐based relaxation, and instrumental participation ( O'Callaghan 2015 ). Based on patient preferences and assessment outcomes, music therapists adapt and modify music interventions to address symptoms and areas of difficulty; they utilize music and verbal strategies to provide opportunities for expression and communication, reminiscence, the processing of thoughts and emotions and improvement of symptom management ( Magill 2011 ). Therapist‐supported music therapy environments often provide the space and time through which patients and families may experience social connection, improve self fulfilment and acquire effective coping strategies ( Magill 2015 ).\n\n【79】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【80】Several research studies on the use of music with cancer patients have reported positive results ( Beck 1989 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Harper 2001 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Robb 2008 ). The majority of these studies, however, are compromised by small sample size and lack of statistical power. In addition, differences in factors such as methods of interventions and type and intensity of treatment have led to varying results. A systematic review is needed to more accurately gauge the efficacy of music interventions in cancer patients as well as to identify variables that may moderate its effects.\n\n【81】Objectives\n----------\n\n【82】available in\n\n【83】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【84】To assess and compare the effects of music therapy and music medicine interventions for psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer.\n\n【85】Methods\n-------\n\n【86】available in\n\n【87】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【88】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【89】#### Types of studies\n\n【90】All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with quasi‐randomized methods of treatment allocation (e.g. alternate allocation of treatments) were eligible for inclusion.\n\n【91】#### Types of participants\n\n【92】This review included participants diagnosed with any type of cancer.

This review did not include studies with cancer survivors.\n\n【93】#### Types of interventions\n\n【94】The review included all trials comparing standard treatment plus music therapy or music medicine interventions with:\n\n【95】1.  standard care alone;\n    \n2.  standard care plus alternative intervention (e.g. music therapy versus music medicine);\n    \n3.  standard care plus placebo.\n    \n\n【96】Placebo treatment can involve the use of headphones for the patient without provision of music stimuli or with another type of auditory stimulus (e.g. audiobooks, white noise (hiss), pink noise (sound of ocean waves) or nature sounds).\n\n【97】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【98】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【99】1.  Psychological outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, anger, hopelessness, helplessness)\n    \n2.  Physical symptoms (e.g. fatigue, nausea, pain)\n    \n\n【100】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【101】1.  Physiological outcomes (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels)\n    \n2.  Social and spiritual support (e.g. family support, spirituality, social activity, isolation)\n    \n3.  Communication (e.g. verbalization, facial affect, gestures)\n    \n4.  Quality of life (QoL)\n    \n\n【102】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【103】There were no language restrictions for either searching or trial inclusion.\n\n【104】#### Electronic searches\n\n【105】We searched the following electronic databases and trials registers.\n\n【106】1.  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library, 2016,_ Issue 1) ( Appendix 1 );\n    \n2.

RILM Abstracts of Music Literature (EbscoHost) (1969 to January 2016) ( Appendix 14 ).\n    \n\n【107】#### Searching other resources\n\n【108】We handsearched the following journals from first available date to January 2016\n\n【109】*   _Australian Journal of Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _Australian Music Therapy Association Bulletin_ .\n    \n*   _Canadian Journal of Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _The International Journal of the Arts in Medicine_ .\n    \n*   _Journal of Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _Musik‐,Tanz‐, und Kunsttherapie_ (Journal for Art Therapies in Education, Welfare and Health Care).\n    \n*   _Musiktherapeutische Umschau_ .\n    \n*   _Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _Music Therapy Perspectives_ .\n    \n*   _Nordic Journal of Music Therapy_ ;\n    \n*   _Music Therapy Today_ (online journal of music therapy).\n    \n*   _Voices_ (online international journal of music therapy).\n    \n*   _New Zealand Journal of Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _The Arts in Psychotherapy_ .\n    \n*   _British Journal of Music Therapy_ .\n    \n*   _Music and Medicine._\n    \n*   _Approaches._\n    \n\n【110】In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched the bibliographies of relevant trials and reviews, contacted experts in the field, and searched available proceedings of music therapy conferences. We consulted music therapy association websites to help identify music therapy practitioners and conference information (e.g. the American Music Therapy Association at www.musictherapy.org and the British Association for Music Therapy at http://www.bamt.org ). We also handsearched the website of the Deutsches Zentrum fur Musiktherapieforschung ( www.dzm‐heidelberg.de/forschung/publikationen/ ) and the research pages of the PhD programs that are listed on the website of the European Music Therapy Confederation ( emtc‐eu.com/music‐therapy‐research/ ).\n\n【111】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【112】#### Selection of studies\n\n【113】We divided the responsibility of the searches, as outlined in the search strategy, amongst JB, AT and research assistants. JB, AT and research assistants scanned titles and abstracts of each record retrieved from the search and deleted obviously irrelevant references. When we could not reject a title or abstract with certainty, we consulted the other review authors. We used an inclusion criteria form to assess the trial's eligibility for inclusion ( Appendix 15 ). We kept a record of all excluded trials that initially appeared eligible and the reason for exclusion.\n\n【114】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【115】JB and AT independently extracted data from the selected trials using a standardized coding form. We discussed differences in data extraction until reaching a consensus. We extracted the following data.\n\n【116】##### General information\n\n【117】*   Author\n    \n*   Year of publication\n    \n*   Title\n    \n*   Journal (title, volume, pages)\n    \n*   If unpublished, source\n    \n*   Duplicate publications\n    \n*   Country\n    \n*   Language of publication\n    \n\n【118】##### Intervention information\n\n【119】*   Type of intervention (e.g. singing, song‐writing, music listening, music improvisation)\n    \n*   Music selection (detailed information on music selection in case of music listening)\n    \n*   Music preference (patient‐preferred versus researcher‐selected in case of music listening)\n    \n*   Level of intervention (music therapy versus music medicine, as defined by the authors in the Background )\n    \n*   Length of intervention\n    \n*   Frequency of intervention\n    \n*   Comparison intervention\n    \n\n【120】##### Participant information\n\n【121】*   Total sample size\n    \n*   Number in experimental group\n    \n*   Number in control group\n    \n*   Sex\n    \n*   Age\n    \n*   Ethnicity\n    \n*   Diagnosis\n    \n*   Illness stage\n    \n*   Setting\n    \n*   Inclusion criteria\n    \n\n【122】##### Outcomes\n\n【123】We extracted pre‐test means, post‐test means, standard deviations and sample sizes for the treatment group and the control group for the following outcomes (if applicable). For some trials only change scores, instead of post‐test scores, were available.\n\n【124】1\\. Psychological outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, anger, hopelessness, helplessness)  \n2\\. Physical symptoms (e.g. fatigue, nausea, pain)  \n3\\. Physiological outcomes (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels)  \n4\\. Social and spiritual support (e.g. family support, spirituality, social activity, isolation)  \n5\\. Communication (e.g. verbalization, facial affect, gestures)  \n6\\. Quality of life\n\n【125】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【126】Two review authors (JB and CD) assessed all included trials for risk of bias for the original review. CD and LM conducted the 'Risk of bias' assessment for new studies included in this update. All authors were blinded to each other's assessments. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. The authors used the following criteria for quality assessment.\n\n【127】##### Random sequence generation\n\n【128】*   Low risk\n    \n*   Unclear risk\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n\n【129】We rated trials to be at low risk for random sequence generation if every participant had an equal chance to be selected for either condition and the investigator was unable to predict which treatment the participant would be assigned to. Use of date of birth, date of admission or alternation resulted in a a judgement of high risk of bias.\n\n【130】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【131】*   Low risk methods to conceal allocation include:\n    \n\n【132】*   *   central randomization;\n        \n    *   serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes;\n        \n    *   other descriptions with convincing concealment.\n        \n\n【133】*   Unclear risk ‐ authors did not adequately report on method of concealment\n    \n*   High risk (e.g. trials used alternation methods)\n    \n\n【134】##### Blinding of participants and personnel\n\n【135】*   Low risk\n    \n*   Unclear risk\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n\n【136】Since participants cannot be blinded in a music intervention trial, we did not downgrade studies for not blinding the participants. As for personnel, in music therapy studies music therapists cannot be blinded because they are actively making music with the patients. In contrast, in music medicine studies blinding of personnel is possible by providing control group participants with headphones but no music (e.g. blank CD). Therefore, downgrading for not blinding personnel was only applied in studies that used listening to pre‐recorded music.\n\n【137】##### Blinding of outcome assessors\n\n【138】*   Low risk\n    \n*   Unclear risk\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n\n【139】When the study included no objective outcomes, we noted this in the Characteristics of included studies table, and we rated the trial as being at low risk of bias for outcome assessment of objective outcomes. The majority of the studies used self report measures for subjective outcomes. We rated these studies as being at high risk of bias for subjective outcomes, unless study participants were blinded to the study hypothesis (for comparative studies).\n\n【140】##### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【141】We recorded the proportion of participants whose outcomes were analyzed. We coded loss to follow‐up for each outcome as:\n\n【142】*   low risk: if fewer than 20% of patients were lost to follow‐up and reasons for loss to follow‐up were similar in both treatment arms;\n    \n*   unclear risk: if loss to follow‐up was not reported;\n    \n*   high risk: if more than 20% of patients were lost to follow‐up or reasons for loss to follow‐up differed between treatment arms.\n    \n\n【143】##### Selective reporting\n\n【144】*   Low risk: reports of the study were free from suggestions of selective outcome reporting\n    \n*   Unclear risk\n    \n*   High risk: reports of the study suggest selective outcome reporting\n    \n\n【145】##### Other sources of bias\n\n【146】*   Low risk\n    \n*   Unclear risk\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n\n【147】We considered information on potential financial conflicts of interest to be a possible source of additional bias.\n\n【148】The above criteria were used to give each article an overall quality rating (based on section 8.7 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions;_ Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【149】*   Low risk of bias ‐ all criteria met.\n    \n*   Moderate risk of bias ‐ one or more of the criteria only partly met.\n    \n*   High risk of bias ‐ one or more criteria not met.\n    \n\n【150】Studies were not excluded based on a low quality score. We planned to use the overall quality assessment rating for sensitivity analysis. However, since most trials were at high risk of bias, we could not carry out this analysis.\n\n【151】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【152】We present all outcomes in this review as continuous variables. We calculated standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcome measures using results from different scales. When there were sufficient data available from various studies using the same measurement instrument, we computed a mean difference (MD) with 95% CI.\n\n【153】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【154】In all studies included in this review, participants were individually randomized to the intervention or the standard care control group. Post‐test values or change values on a single measurement for each outcome from each participant were collected and analyzed.\n\n【155】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【156】We did not impute missing outcome data. We analyzed data on an endpoint basis, including only participants for whom final data point measurement was available (available case analysis). We did not assume that participants who dropped out after randomization had a negative outcome.\n\n【157】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【158】We investigated heterogeneity using visual inspection of the forest plots as well as the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic ( Higgins 2002 ).\n\n【159】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【160】We tested for publication bias visually in the form of funnel plots ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【161】#### Data synthesis\n\n【162】We present all outcomes in this review as continuous variables. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) for outcome measures using results from different scales. We used mean differences (MD) for results using the same scales. We anticipated that some individual trials would have used final scores and others change scores and even analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in their statistical analyses of the results. We combined these different types of analyses as MDs. We determined not to pool the results in case of significant clinical heterogeneity. We calculated pooled estimates using the more conservative random‐effects model. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each effect size estimate. We interpreted the magnitude of the SMDs using the interpretation guidelines put forth by Cohen 1988 ). Cohen suggested that an effect size of 0.2 be considered a small effect, an effect size of 0.5 medium, and an effect size of 0.8 large.\n\n【163】We made the following treatment comparisons in meta‐analyses.\n\n【164】1.  Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care alone.\n    \n2.  Music therapy versus music medicine interventions (this was only possible for anxiety).\n    \n3.  Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care plus alternative relaxation interventions\n    \n4.  Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care plus placebo (audiobook control).\n    \n\n【165】Several studies compared music interventions with non‐music relaxation interventions. However, there was an insufficient number of trials to allow for a treatment comparison analysis. These studies are therefore included in the narrative under the third comparison (music intervention versus alternative intervention) but not in the meta‐analysis of this review.\n\n【166】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【167】We conducted the following subgroup analyses within the music interventions plus standard care versus standard care alone comparison for outcomes with a sufficient number of available studies.\n\n【168】1.  Music medicine versus music therapy.\n    \n2.  Type of intervention (e.g. music listening alone versus music‐guided relaxation).\n    \n3.  Music preference (patient‐preferred music versus researcher‐selected music).\n    \n\n【169】We planned the following subgroup analyses a priori, but we could not carry these out because of insufficient numbers of trials per outcome for age subgroup analysis and because no separate data were available according to stage of illness.\n\n【170】1.  Different age groups.\n    \n2.  Stages of illness.\n    \n\n【171】We conducted subgroup analyses as described by Deeks 2001 and recommended in section 9.6 of Higgins 2011 .\n\n【172】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【173】We examined the impact of sequence generation by comparing the results of including and excluding trials that used inadequate or unclear randomization methods.\n\n【174】Results\n-------\n\n【175】### Description of studies\n\n【176】#### Results of the search\n\n【177】For the original review, the database searches and handsearching of conference proceedings, journals and reference lists resulted in 773 unique citations. One review author (JB) and a research assistant examined the titles and abstracts and identified 101 reports as potentially relevant, which we retrieved for further assessment. One review author (JB) and a research assistant then independently screened them. We included 30 trials, reported in 36 records, in the original review. Where necessary, we contacted principal investigators to obtain additional details on trials and data. We identified three ongoing trials ( NCT02261558 ; NCT02583126 ; NCT02583139 ). We moved two ongoing studies from the original review to the 'awaiting assessment' classification ( NCT00086762 ; O'Brien 2010 ). Unfortunately, we could not include them in this update as their results were not yet available for inclusion. We classified four additional studies as awaiting assessment because their results were not yet published, and the authors could not provide the results for inclusion in this review.\n\n【178】The 2016 update of the search resulted in 1187 unique citations. Two review authors (JB and AT) and one research assistant examined the titles and abstracts, retrieving full‐text articles where necessary. This resulted in the addition of 25 references reporting on 22 trials ( Figure 1 ) and three new ongoing trials ( NCT02261558 ; NCT02583126 ; NCT02583139 ).\n\n【179】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【180】Figure 1\n\n【181】* * *\n\n【182】* * *\n\n【183】Study flow diagram.\n\n【184】#### Included studies\n\n【185】We included 52 trials with a total of 3731 participants. Seventeen trials included participants who underwent chemotherapy or radiation therapy ( Bradt 2015 ; Bulfone 2009 ; Burrai 2014 ; Cai 2001 ; Chen 2013 ; Clark 2006 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Gimeno 2008 ; Jin 2011 ; Lin 2011 ; Moradian 2015 ; O'Callaghan 2012 ; Romito 2013 ; Smith 2001 ; Straw 1991 ; Xie 2001 ; Zhao 2008 ), 20 trials examined the effects of music during procedures or surgery ( Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Bufalini 2009 ; Burns 2009; Cassileth 2003 ; Danhauer 2010 ; Fredenburg 2014a ; Fredenburg 2014b ; Kwekkeboom 2003; Li 2004; Li 2012 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Palmer 2015 ; Pinto 2012 ; Ratcliff 2014 ; Robb 2014 ; Rosenow 2014 ; Vachiramon 2013 ; Wang 2015 ; Yates 2015 ; Zhou 2015 ), and 14 trials included general cancer patients ( Beck 1989 ; Burns 2001a ; Burns 2008 ; Chen 2004 ; Cook 2013 ; Duocastella 1999 ; Hanser 2006 ; Harper 2001 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Huang 2006 ; Liao 2013 ; Robb 2008 ; Shaban 2006; Wan 2009 ). Five trials examined music interventions in pediatric patients ( Bufalini 2009 ; Burns 2009 ; Duocastella 1999 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Robb 2014 ).\n\n【186】This review included 2090 females and 1171 males. Five trials did not provide information on the distribution between sexes ( Danhauer 2010 ; Jin 2011 ; Robb 2008 ; Shaban 2006 ; Xie 2001 ). The average age of the participants was 54.67 years for adult trials and 10.93 years for pediatric trials. Seventeen studies did not report on the ethnicity of the participants ( Burns 2001a ; Burns 2008 ; Burrai 2014 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Chen 2013 ; Cook 2013 ; Duocastella 1999 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Lin 2011 ; Moradian 2015 ; O'Callaghan 2012 ; Robb 2008 ; Romito 2013 ; Straw 1991 ; Vachiramon 2013 ; Wang 2015 ; Zhou 2015 ). For trials that did provide information on ethnicity, the distribution was as follows: 50% white, 32% Asian, 7% black, 8% Latino, and 3% other. The trials took place in nine different countries: the United States ( Bradt 2015 ; Beck 1989 ; Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Burns 2001a ; Burns 2008 ; Burns 2009 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Clark 2006 ; Cook 2013 ; Danhauer 2010 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Fredenburg 2014a ; Fredenburg 2014b ; Hanser 2006 ; Harper 2001 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Kwekkeboom 2003 ; Gimeno 2008 ; Palmer 2015 ; Ratcliff 2014 ; Robb 2008 ; Robb 2014 ; Rosenow 2014 ; Smith 2001 ; Straw 1991 ; Vachiramon 2013 ; Yates 2015 ), China ( Cai 2001 ; Chen 2004 ; Jin 2011 ; Li 2004 ; Li 2012 ; Liao 2013 ; Wan 2009 ; Xie 2001 ; Zhao 2008 ), Italy ( Bufalini 2009 ; Bulfone 2009 ), Iran ( Moradian 2015 ; Shaban 2006 ), Spain ( Duocastella 1999 ), Taiwan ( Chen 2013 ; Huang 2006 ; Lin 2011 ; Wang 2015 ; Zhou 2015 ), Brazil ( Pinto 2012 ), Australia ( O'Callaghan 2012 ) and Vietnam ( Nguyen 2010 ). Trial sample size ranged from 8 to 260 participants.\n\n【187】We classified 23 trials as music therapy studies ( Bradt 2015 ; Bufalini 2009 ; Burns 2001a ; Burns 2008 ; Burns 2009 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Clark 2006 ; Cook 2013 ; Duocastella 1999 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Fredenburg 2014a ; Fredenburg 2014b ; Hanser 2006 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Gimeno 2008 ; Palmer 2015 ; Ratcliff 2014 ; Robb 2008 ; Robb 2014 ; Romito 2013 ; Rosenow 2014 ; Stordahl 2009 ; Yates 2015 ). Of these trials, nine used interactive music making with the participants, four used music‐guided imagery, two used music‐guided relaxation, six used live patient‐selected music performed by the music therapist and two used music video making. We classified 29 trials as music medicine studies, as defined by the authors in the background section, and used listening to pre‐recorded music as the intervention.\n\n【188】Frequency and duration of treatment sessions greatly varied among the trials. The total number of sessions ranged from 1 to 40 (e.g. multiple music listening sessions per day for length of hospital stay). Most sessions lasted 30 to 45 minutes. We report details on frequency and duration of sessions for each trial in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【189】Forty‐nine trials used parallel group designs, whereas three trials used a cross‐over design ( Bradt 2015 ; Beck 1989 ; Gimeno 2008 ). Not all trials measured all outcomes identified for this review.\n\n【190】We show details of the trials included in the review in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【191】#### Excluded studies\n\n【192】In the original review, 27 of the 101 reports that we retrieved for further assessment turned out not to be outcome research studies. We identified 38 experimental research studies that appeared eligible for inclusion. However, we excluded these after closer examination or after receiving additional information from the principal investigators. Reasons for exclusions were: not a randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trial (29 studies); insufficient data reporting (2 studies); unacceptable methodological quality (3 studies); not a music intervention (1 study); not exclusively cancer patients (1 study); and article could not be located (2 studies).\n\n【193】For the update, we retrieved 94 reports for further assessment. We excluded 60 studies for the following reasons: not a randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trial (36 studies), insufficient data reporting (2 studies), not music intervention (12 studies), not population of interest (8 studies), use of healthy controls (1 study), and use of non‐standardized measurement tools (1 study).\n\n【194】For studies with insufficient data reporting or those that could not be located, we attempted to contact the authors on multiple occasions.\n\n【195】Details about reasons for exclusion are provided in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.\n\n【196】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【197】We detail the risk of bias for each trial in the 'Risk of bias' tables included in the Characteristics of included studies table and the 'Risk of bias summary' ( Figure 2 ). In addition, readers can consult an overall assessment of risk of bias in Figure 3 .\n\n【198】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【199】Figure 2\n\n【200】* * *\n\n【201】* * *\n\n【202】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【203】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【204】Figure 3\n\n【205】* * *\n\n【206】* * *\n\n【207】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【208】#### Allocation\n\n【209】We included 37 trials that used appropriate methods of randomization (e.g. computer‐generated table of random numbers, drawing of lots, coin flip), 6 trials that used systematic methods of treatment allocation (e.g. alternate group assignment, date of birth), and 9 trials that reported using randomization but failed to state the randomization method.\n\n【210】Twenty‐two trials concealed allocation, whereas 12 trials did not. For the remainder of the trials, authors did not mention allocation concealment.\n\n【211】#### Blinding\n\n【212】Fifteen trials included objective outcomes, but only four of them reported blinding of the outcome assessors. For six trials, the use of blinding was unclear. The other trials did not use blinding. The majority of the trials included subjective outcomes only. It is important to point out that blinding of outcome assessors is not possible in the case of self report measurement tools for subjective outcomes (e.g. STAI; Spielberger 1983 ) unless the participants are blinded to the intervention. Blinding of the participants is often not feasible in music therapy and music medicine studies. This may introduce possible bias.\n\n【213】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【214】The dropout rate was small for most trials, falling between 0% and 17%. Ten trials reported dropout rates of more than 20%. For 14 trials, it was unclear whether there were any participant withdrawals. Most trials reported reasons for dropout. Detailed information on dropout rate and reasons is included in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【215】#### Selective reporting\n\n【216】We did not find any evidence of selective reporting by the authors.\n\n【217】We examined publication bias visually in the form of funnel plots for several of the included outcomes. Visual inspection suggested that there was no publication bias for anxiety ( Figure 4 ), depression ( Figure 5 ), pain ( Figure 6 ), and heart rate ( Figure 7 ). We did detect a possible publication bias for fatigue ( Figure 8 ), but this was based on a small number of trials. For this outcome, it is possible that studies that did not result in statistically significant findings may not have been published.\n\n【218】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【219】Figure 4\n\n【220】* * *\n\n【221】* * *\n\n【222】Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone, outcome: 1.1 Anxiety (STAI).\n\n【223】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【224】Figure 5\n\n【225】* * *\n\n【226】* * *\n\n【227】Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone, outcome: 1.6 Depression.\n\n【228】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【229】Figure 6\n\n【230】* * *\n\n【231】* * *\n\n【232】Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone, outcome: 1.11 Pain.\n\n【233】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【234】Figure 7\n\n【235】* * *\n\n【236】* * *\n\n【237】Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone, outcome: 1.15 Heart rate.\n\n【238】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【239】Figure 8\n\n【240】* * *\n\n【241】* * *\n\n【242】Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone, outcome: 1.13 Fatigue.\n\n【243】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【244】We did not identify any other potential sources of bias in the studies included in this review.\n\n【245】As a result, only one trial was at low risk of bias ( Bradt 2015 ). Two additional trials were at low risk of bias for objective outcomes, as they satisfied all criteria used to assess risk of bias ( Duocastella 1999 ; Nguyen 2010 ). Forty‐six trials were at high risk of bias. Three trials were at moderate risk of bias ( Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Palmer 2015 ). The main reason for receiving a high risk of bias rating was the lack of blinding. As pointed out above, blinding is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless the studies compare the music intervention with another active treatment intervention (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation). This is especially true for music therapy studies that use active music‐making. Therefore, it appears impossible for these types of studies to receive a low or even moderate risk of bias even if they have adequately addressed all other risk factors (e.g. randomization, allocation concealment, etc.).\n\n【246】It is worth noting that the Chinese trials were particularly problematic in terms of providing sufficient information regarding risk of bias. It is unclear, however, if this was due to incomplete translations or lack of detail in the original trial reports.\n\n【247】### Effects of interventions\n\n【248】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Music interventions compared to standard care for psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients\n\n【249】#### Comparison 1: Music intervention plus standard care versus standard care alone\n\n【250】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【251】###### Psychological outcomes\n\n【252】**State anxiety**\n\n【253】Twenty‐three trials examined the effects of music interventions plus standard care compared to standard care alone for anxiety in participants with cancer. Fifteen trials measured anxiety by means of the Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory ‐ State Anxiety form (STAI‐S) ( Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Bufalini 2009 ; Bulfone 2009 ; Chen 2013 ; Danhauer 2010 ; Harper 2001 ; Jin 2011 ; Kwekkeboom 2003 ; Li 2012 ; Lin 2011 ; O'Callaghan 2012 ; Smith 2001 ; Vachiramon 2013 ; Wan 2009 ; Zhou 2015 ); one trial used the STAI‐short form ( Nguyen 2010 ); and eight trials reported mean anxiety measured by other scales, such as a numeric rating scale or a visual analogue scale ( Cai 2001 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Hanser 2006 ; Li 2004 ; Palmer 2015 ; Yates 2015 ; Zhao 2008 ). We could not include the data from Burns 2008 because it did not report post‐test or follow‐up scores. The author did provide follow‐up scores (4 weeks postintervention), but we could not combine these with the post‐test scores of the other trials. Moreover, Burns 2008 reported a large moderating effect of pre‐intervention affect state scores on post‐test scores and follow‐up scores. We also did not include the data from Kwekkeboom 2003 in the meta‐analysis because this study was affected by a serious flaw in the implementation of the intervention. Participants in this trial listened to music while undergoing painful medical procedures. However, they reported that the use of headphones prevented them from hearing the surgeon, increasing their anxiety. Finally, we report the data from Hanser 2006 narratively but do not include them in the meta‐analysis because of the high attrition rate (40%). In addition, the researchers experienced serious issues with intervention implementation within the predetermined implementation timeframe (three sessions were implemented over a 15‐week period), and the authors concluded that the intervention was significantly diluted because of this.\n\n【254】A meta‐analysis of 13 trials that used the full STAI‐S (score range: 20 to 80) to examine state anxiety in 1028 participants indicated a significantly lower state of anxiety in participants who received standard care combined with music interventions than those who received standard care alone ( MD: −8.54, 95% CI −12.04 to −5.05, P < 0.0001; Analysis 1.1 ). Statistical heterogeneity across the trials (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 93%) was due to some trials reporting much larger beneficial effects of music interventions than others ( Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Harper 2001 ; Wan 2009 ). In Kwekkeboom 2003 , participants in the music listening group reported higher levels of anxiety at post‐test (mean: 33.45, standard deviation (SD) 1.77) than those in the standard care group (mean: 30.59, SD 1.93), but this difference was not statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis excluding the trials that used inadequate methods of randomization ( Bulfone 2009 ; Chen 2013 ), or for which the method of randomization was unclear ( Bufalini 2009 ), had minimal impact on the pooled effect size (MD: −8.64, 95% CI −12.50 to −4.79, P < 0.0001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 94%; Analysis 1.1 ).\n\n【255】The standardized mean difference (SMD) of trials that reported post‐test anxiety scores on measures other than the full‐form STAI‐S (N = 449) also suggested a moderate to large anxiety‐reducing effect of music (SMD: −0.71, 95% CI −0.98 to −0.43, P <.00001; Analysis 1.2 ; Cai 2001 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Li 2004 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Zhao 2008 ; Yates 2015 ). The results were consistent across the trials (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 41%). We did not include the data of two trials in the meta‐analysis because change scores and final scores should not be combined for the computation of a SMD ( Cassileth 2003 ; Palmer 2015 ). However, the data by Cassileth 2003 were consistent with the results of the meta‐analysis, reporting a greater effect of music therapy on anxiety (mean change score: −2.6, SD 2.5) than standard care alone (mean change score: −0.9, SD 3.0) on the POMS‐anxiety subscale (score range: 0 to 36). Likewise, the data from Palmer 2015 indicated a beneficial effect of music therapy (mean change score: −30.9, SD 36.3) versus standard care (mean change score: 0, SD 22.7) on the Global Anxiety‐VAS (score range: 0 to 100 mm). A sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of randomization method, excluding the data of Cai 2001 , Ferrer 2005 and Li 2004 , resulted in a larger SMD of −0.80 (95% CI −1.44 to −0.16, P = 0.01; Analysis 1.2 ), but the results were no longer consistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 66%).\n\n【256】Next, we conducted several a priori determined subgroup analyses as outlined in the Methods .\n\n【257】First, we compared the treatment benefits of music therapy versus music medicine studies for anxiety. We only included studies that reported post‐test scores in this analysis to allow for computation of a standardized mean difference across studies. The pooled effect of three music therapy studies (SMD: −0.62, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.24, P = 0.001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; Bufalini 2009 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Yates 2015 ) was smaller than of the music medicine studies (SMD: −1.00, 95% CI −1.45 to −0.55, P < 0.0001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 93%; Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Bulfone 2009 ; Cai 2001 ; Danhauer 2010 ; Jin 2011 ; Li 2004 ; Li 2012 ; Lin 2011 ; Nguyen 2010 ; O'Callaghan 2012 ; Smith 2001 ; Vachiramon 2013 ; Wan 2009 ; Zhao 2008 ; Zhou 2015 ). However, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). It is worth noting that the results of the music therapy studies were consistent across studies, whereas the results of the music medicine studies were highly heterogeneous ( Analysis 1.3 ).\n\n【258】Second, we compared studies that used patient‐preferred music with studies that used researcher‐selected music. For this comparison, we only included studies that used listening to pre‐recorded music as the intervention. Music preference did not appear to impact the treatment benefits for anxiety. The use of patient‐preferred music resulted in a SMD of −0.86 (95% CI −1.38 to −0.34, P = 0.001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 92%) whereas researcher‐selected music resulted in a SMD of −0.89 (95% CI −1.43 to −0.35, P = 0.001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 71%) ( Analysis 1.4 ).\n\n【259】Finally, we compared the music medicine studies by type of intervention (e.g. music‐guided relaxation, music listening alone, etc.). We could not conduct this subgroup analysis for music therapy studies because of an insufficient number of trials. The majority of the music medicine studies used listening to pre‐recorded music. Four studies, however, embedded relaxation or imagery instructions within the pre‐recorded music ( Jin 2011 ; Lin 2011 ; Wan 2009 ; Zhou 2015 ). The pooled effect of these four studies (SMD: −1.61, 95% CI −2.56 to −0.65, P = 0.0009, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 95%) was much larger than that of music listening only studies (SMD: −0.71, 95% CI −1.16 to −0.26, P = 0.002, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 89%) but because of the large heterogeneity, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.10) ( Analysis 1.5 ).\n\n【260】**Depression**\n\n【261】Seven trials examined the effects of music plus standard care compared to standard care alone on depression in 723 participants ( Cai 2001 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Clark 2006 ; Li 2012 ; Wan 2009 ; Yates 2015 ; Zhou 2015 ). Their pooled estimate indicated a moderate treatment effect of music (SMD: −0.40, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.06, P = 0.02; Analysis 1.6 ), but the results were inconsistent across trials (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 77%). A sensitivity analysis examining the impact of randomization method did not have much impact on the pooled effect size (SMD: −0.37, 95% CI −0.79 to 0.05, P = 0.08, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 81%; Analysis 1.6 ).\n\n【262】A subgroup analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between music therapy and music medicine studies for the outcome of depression (P = 0.12) ( Analysis 1.7 ). We also examined the impact of music preference in studies that used listening to pre‐recorded music. Although the difference between studies that used patient‐preferred versus researcher‐selected music was not statistically significant (P = 0.25), allowing patients to select music from a variety of styles offered by the researcher resulted in a large effect size that was statistically significant (SMD: −0.88, 95% CI −1.67 to −0.09, P = 0.003, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 89%; Analysis 1.8 ). In contrast, the use of researcher‐selected music resulted in a small effect size that was not statistically significant (SMD: −0.32, 95% CI −0.84 to 0.19, P = 0.22, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 61%).\n\n【263】**Distress**\n\n【264】Clark 2006 compared standard care plus music‐guided relaxation versus standard care alone and reported a reduction of −2.03 (SD 2.46) on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale in the music therapy intervention group. Participants in the control group reported an average reduction in distress of −2.44 (SD 2.55).\n\n【265】**Mood**\n\n【266】The pooled estimate of five trials (N = 236) resulted in a moderate effect of music interventions for mood in participants with cancer (SMD: 0.47, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.97, P = 0.06; Analysis 1.9 ; Beck 1989 ; Burrai 2014 ; Cassileth 2003 ; Moradian 2015 ; Ratcliff 2014 ).The results were inconsistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 70%), with Burrai 2014 reporting much larger treatment benefits than the other studies. A sensitivity analysis based on randomization method slightly increased the pooled effect (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI −0.03 to 1.18, P = 0.06, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 74%; Analysis 1.9 ). We could not include the data from Burns 2001a in the meta‐analysis because the authors did not use a constant in the computation of their scores, as recommended in the Profile of Mood States (POMS) scoring guide ( McNair 1971 ). The results of the meta‐analysis were robust to Burns 2001a , which reported a mean post‐test score of −48.25 (SD 32.96) for the music therapy group and a mean post‐test score of 20.75 (SD 30.87) for the control group.\n\n【267】A subgroup analysis comparing music therapy (SMD: 0.37, 95% CI −0.13 to 0.87, P = 0.15) with music medicine (SMD: 0.55, 95% CI −0.37 to 1.47, P = 0.24) found no statistically significant differences between the two types of studies (P = 0.73), but the results of the music therapy studies were consistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 37%), whereas the music medicine studies were inconsistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 82%) ( Analysis 1.10 ).\n\n【268】**Resilience**\n\n【269】One music therapy study in 80 adolescents and young adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) included resilience as an outcome and reported a small effect for the music therapy intervention (SMD: 0.21), although this effect was not statistically significant (P = 0.35) ( Robb 2014 ). The authors reported that the study was underpowered to detect medium and small effect sizes.\n\n【270】**Coping**\n\n【271】Robb 2014 also examined the effect of music therapy on coping. They reported a moderate effect size for courageous coping immediately post‐transplant. At the same time, they found no change in the use of defensive coping strategies, suggesting that adolescents and youth in the music therapy treatment arm increased their use of positive coping strategies.\n\n【272】###### Physical symptoms\n\n【273】**Pain**\n\n【274】Eleven trials compared the effects of music versus standard care on pain ( Beck 1989 ; Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Clark 2006 ; Danhauer 2010 ; Fredenburg 2014a ; Huang 2006 ; Kwekkeboom 2003 ; Li 2012 ; Moradian 2015 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Wan 2009 ). We could not include the data from Beck 1989 , Clark 2006 or Moradian 2015 in the meta‐analysis because of the use of change scores. Kwekkeboom 2003 compared the effects of music listening, audiotape and standard care on procedural pain and anxiety, finding that participants did not like wearing the headsets as it prevented them from hearing the surgeon, causing greater anxiety. The literature suggests that increased anxiety leads to increased pain perception ( McCracken 2009 ); therefore, we excluded these data from the meta‐analysis. The pooled effect of the remaining seven studies with 528 participants resulted in a large effect for music on pain perception (SMD: −0.91, 95%CI −1.46 to −0.36, P = 0.001; Analysis 1.11 ; Cohen 1988 ). There was disagreement between the trials on the size of the effect (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 88%), but this was due to Li 2012 reporting much larger treatment benefits than the other trials.\n\n【275】Using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, Clark 2006 found that music therapy resulted in greater pain reduction (mean change score: −0.44, SD 2.55) than standard care (mean change score: 0.45, SD 1.87). Likewise, Beck 1989 reported a greater pain reduction for the music listening group as measured by a 100mm VAS (mean change score: −9.27, SD 18.86) than for the control group (mean change score: −5.69, SD 17.9). In contrast, Moradian 2015 reported similar improvements in pain for the treatment (mean change score: −12.96, SD 24.16) and the control group (mean change score: −13.58, SD 28.51).\n\n【276】For this outcome, we were able to examine the impact of music preference on treatment effect ( Analysis 1.12 ). Although the difference between the use of patient‐preferred music and researcher‐selected music was not statistically significant (P = 0.42), the use of patient‐preferred music led to a much larger and statistically significant pooled effect (SMD: −1.06, 95% CI −1.93 to −0.2, P = 0.02, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 91%) than the use of researcher‐selected music (SMD: −0.59, 95% CI −1.34 to 0.15, P = 0.12, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 75%). The large heterogeneity was due to some studies reporting a much larger beneficial effect than others.\n\n【277】**Fatigue**\n\n【278】Six trials examined the effects of music interventions on fatigue in 253 participants ( Cassileth 2003 ; Clark 2006 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Fredenburg 2014b ; Moradian 2015 ; Rosenow 2014 ). The pooled estimate of their change scores indicated a small to moderate effect for music interventions (SMD: −0.38, 95% CI −0.72 to −0.04, P = 0.03; Analysis 1.13 ), with consistent results across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 38%). Burns 2008 also collected data on fatigue; however, investigators did not report postintervention data. Burns 2008 also provided us with four‐week postintervention follow‐up scores, but could not provide the immediate post‐test scores. This prevented us from pooling their data with data from the other three studies. A sensitivity analysis based on randomization method suggested that use of proper methods of randomization resulted in a smaller pooled effect that was no longer statistically significant (SMD: −0.20, 95% CI −0.48 to 0.08, P = 0.16, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%).\n\n【279】**Physical functioning**\n\n【280】Five trials examined the effects of music on participants' physical functioning ( Hanser 2006 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Liao 2013 ; Moradian 2015 ; Xie 2001 ). We could not include the results of Hanser 2006 in the pooled estimate because of the use of change scores and the high attrition rate. The pooled estimate of the remaining studies indicated no evidence for an effect of music on physical status in 493 participants with cancer (SMD: 0.78, 95% CI −0.74 to 2.31, P = 0.31; Analysis 1.14 ). The results were highly inconsistent (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 98%), with Xie 2001 reporting a much larger beneficial effect. In Hanser 2006 , music therapy led to a greater improvement in physical well‐being (FACT‐G Physical Well‐Being Subscale, score range: 0 to 28)( mean change score: 2.0, SD 4.6) than standard care (mean change score: −0.4, SD 3.7), but this difference was not statistically significant.\n\n【281】Removing Xie 2001 because of improper randomization method resulted in a small effect that was consistent across studies (SMD: 0.08, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.34, P = 0.54, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; Analysis 1.14 )\n\n【282】**Anesthetic and analgesic intake**\n\n【283】Two studies included use of anesthesia and analgesics as an outcome. Palmer 2015 examined the amount of propofol needed to reach a sedation score of 70 on the Bispectral Index (BIS) in women undergoing breast surgery. A BIS reading of 70 represents moderate sedation. The average propofol needed in the live music group (n = 67) was 67.2 mg (SD 53.7), 61.9 mg (SD 34.1) in the recorded music group (n = 65), and 70.5 mg (SD 35.2) in the usual care group (n = 62). However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Wang 2015 examined the impact of music‐guided relaxation compared to standard care on postoperative consumption of the sufentanil, a narcotic medicine, and use of a patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Participants in the music treatment arm consumed a significantly smaller amount of sufentanil (52.68 µg, SD 7.07) than the standard care treatment arm (82.65 µg, SD 6.19). PCA use was also significantly lower in the music treatment arm (19.06, SD 3.49) than in the control group (30.96, SD 4.0).\n\n【284】**Length of hospital stay and recovery time**\n\n【285】Palmer 2015 also examined the effect of music on recovery time following breast surgery. Recovery time was defined as the interval between surgery end time and the time when the patient had met all discharge criteria determined by the recovery nurse. The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in recovery time between the two types of music interventions (live music by a music therapist and listening to pre‐recorded music) and the usual care group, suggesting that the addition of music intervention did not increase patient time commitment. A statistically significant difference was found between the live music group (52.4 minutes, SD 21.6) and the recorded music group (64.8 minutes, SD 35.3), with the live music group getting discharged approximately 12 minutes faster than the recorded music group. However, the authors suggest a careful interpretation of these results as other factors could have contributed to this difference.\n\n【286】Li 2012 tracked the length of women's hospital stay after radical mastectomy. Women in the music listening treatment arm stayed an average of 13.62 days (SD 2.04), whereas women in the usual care control arm stayed an average of 15.53 days (SD 2.75). This difference between the treatment arms was statistically significant (P < 0.001).\n\n【287】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【288】###### Physiological outcomes\n\n【289】**Heart rate**\n\n【290】Eight trials examined the effects of music on heart rate in 589 participants ( Binns‐Turner 2008 ; Burrai 2014 ; Chen 2013 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Harper 2001 ; Jin 2011 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Zhao 2008 ). All of the studies except for Ferrer 2005 were music medicine studies.Their pooled estimate showed a decrease in heart rate, favoring music interventions over standard care (MD: −3.32, 95% CI −6.21 to −0.44, P = 0.02; Analysis 1.15 ). However, the results were inconsistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 73%). A sensitivity analysis excluding Ferrer 2005 and Chen 2013 because of an unknown randomization method and a lack of proper randomization, respectively, resulted in a larger effect with less heterogeneity (MD: −4.63, 95% CI −8.18 to −1.09, P = 0.01, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 56%; Analysis 1.15 ).\n\n【291】A subgroup analysis for music preference indicated that researcher‐selected music led to greater reductions in heart rate (MD: −7.94, 95% CI −15.10 to −0.78, P = 0.03, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%) than patient‐preferred music (MD: −3.13, 95% CI −6.54 to 0.27, P = 0.07, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 82%; Analysis 1.16 ), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.23).\n\n【292】One cross‐over trial compared the effect of music and imagery with imagery alone ( Gimeno 2008 ). Both interventions resulted in statistically significant decreases in heart rate from pre‐test to post‐test: the music and imagery group's mean heart rate dropped from 89.58 beats per minute (bpm) (SD 17.32) at pre‐test to 78.84 bpm (SD 13.46) at post‐test; the imagery only group's mean heart rate dropped from 93.31 bpm (SD 15.76) to 81.05 bpm (SD 13.96), but the difference between the two interventions was not statistically significant.\n\n【293】**Respiratory rate**\n\n【294】The pooled estimate of four trials (N = 437) did not provide evidence of an effect for music interventions on respiratory rate (MD: −1.24, 95% CI −2.54 to 0.06, P = 0.06; Analysis 1.17 ; Chen 2013 ; Jin 2011 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Zhao 2008 ), and the studies did not agree on the size of effect (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 80%). A sensitivity analysis excluding Chen 2013 because of failure to use a proper method of randomization resulted in a larger pooled effect that was statistically significant (MD: −1.83, 95% CI −3.36 to −0.30, P = 0.02, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 52%; Analysis 1.17 )\n\n【295】We could not conduct a subgroup analysis based on music preference for this outcome due to an insufficient number of trials differentiating music type.\n\n【296】**Systolic blood pressure**\n\n【297】We found a pooled estimate of −5.40 mmHg (95% CI −8.32 to −2.49, P = 0.0003; N = 559; Analysis 1.18 ) for systolic blood pressure (SBP), favoring music interventions ( Burrai 2014 ; Chen 2013 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Harper 2001 ; Jin 2011 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Zhao 2008 ). The results were slightly inconsistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 54%). However, excluding Chen 2013 and Ferrer 2005 because of lack of proper randomization resulted in a larger effect that was consistent across studies (MD: −7.63 mmHg, 95% CI −10.75 to −4.52, P < 0.00001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 11%; Analysis 1.18 ). All of the studies except for Ferrer 2005 were music medicine studies.\n\n【298】We conducted a subgroup analysis based on music preference ( Analysis 1.19 ), and in contrast to the findings for heart rate, this analysis suggested that patient‐preferred music led to greater SBP reduction (MD: −6.65, 95% CI −10.07 to −3.23, P = 0.0001, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 64%) than researcher‐selected music (MD: −4.72, 95% CI −10.80 to 1.37, P = 0.13, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%). This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.59).\n\n【299】**Diastolic blood pressure**\n\n【300】We found a pooled estimate of −2.35 mmHg (95% CI −5.88 to 1.18; Analysis 1.20 ) for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in 559 participants ( Burrai 2014 ; Chen 2013 ; Ferrer 2005 ; Harper 2001 ; Jin 2011 ; Nguyen 2010 ; Zhao 2008 ).The results were inconsistent across studies (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 91%). Similar to the SBP analysis, excluding Chen 2013 and Ferrer 2005 in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a larger MD of −4.94 mmHg (95% CI −7.78 to −2.09) that was statistically significant (P = 0.0007), and less heterogeneous (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 60%; Analysis 1.20 ). All of the studies except for Ferrer 2005 were music medicine studies.\n\n【301】Patient‐preferred music resulted in somewhat greater reductions in DBP (MD: −4.10, 95% CI −8.78 to 0.59, P = 0.09, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 95%; Analysis 1.21 ) than researcher‐selected music (MD: −2.01, 95% CI −6.26 to 2.25, P = 0.36, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.52).\n\n【302】**Mean arterial pressure**\n\n【303】Binns‐Turner 2008 reported on the effects of music on mean arterial pressure (MAP) in 30 participants and found a large decrease in MAP for the music group (mean change score: −15.1 mmHg, SD 17.1, 95% CI −23.76 to −6.44). In contrast, participants in the standard care group experienced an increase in MAP (mean change score: 4.5 mmHg, SD 15.3, 95% CI −3.25 to 12.25).\n\n【304】**Oxygen saturation level**\n\n【305】Three trials with 292 participants reported no effects for music listening on oxygen saturation levels (MD: 0.50%, 95% CI −0.18 to 1.18, P = 0.15, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 78%; Analysis 1.22 ; Burrai 2014 ; Chen 2013 ; Nguyen 2010 ).\n\n【306】**Immune system functioning**\n\n【307】Two trials examined the effects of music on immune system functioning. In one trial in 30 children, Duocastella 1999 found that live music making with children led to a greater increase in Immunoglobin A (IgA) levels (mean change score: 7.07 mg/l, SD 34.52) than engaging children in activities that did not involve music (mean change score: 4.13 mg/l, SD 41.02), but this difference was not statistically significant. Another trial compared music listening to standard care in 46 participants and found post‐test differences for the following indicators of immune system functioning: CD3 (music: mean 44, SD 12.62; control: mean 36.73, SD 11.01), CD4/CD8 (music: mean 1.67, SD 0.76; control: mean 1.32, SD 1.01), and natural killer (NK) cell activity (music: mean 25.23, SD 15.20; control: mean 21.36, SD 12.86), indicating a positive effect of music listening on the immune system in women with breast cancer ( Chen 2004 ). CD3 and CD4/CD8 are proteins that play a role in immune system functioning.\n\n【308】###### Social and spiritual support\n\n【309】**Spiritual well‐being**\n\n【310】Two trials under this comparison assessed spiritual well‐being ( Cook 2013 ; Hanser 2006 ). One trial compared music therapy to usual care using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy‐Spiritual Well‐Being subscale (FACIT‐Sp, score range: 0 to 48) ( Hanser 2006 ). Results indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups (music therapy mean change score: 2.5, SD 8.56; control group mean change score: 0.7, SD 6.95). Cook 2013 compared music therapy with standard care and reported a greater improvement in the music therapy treatment arm ( mean change score: 4.4, SD 4.84) than the control arm (mean change score: 2.0, SD 6.08) on the FACIT‐Sp.\n\n【311】**Social support**\n\n【312】Robb 2014 examined the effect of music therapy on perceived social support in adolescents and young adults during stem cell transplant. At 100 days post‐transplant, participants in the music therapy treatment arm reported significantly greater improvements in perceived social support (SMD: 0.54, P = 0.028) and family environment (i.e. family cohesion, family adaptation, family communication, and family strength) (SMD: 0.66, P = 0.008) than participants in the control group. Qualitative analysis of the music videos that accompanied the songs written by the participants revealed that study participants were \"identifying peers (i.e., social integration), family members (i.e., family environment), and faith/spirituality (i.e., spiritual perspective) as important sources of support\" (p 916).\n\n【313】###### Quality of life\n\n【314】Seven trials compared the impact of music interventions to standard care on QoL ( Burns 2001a ; Hanser 2006 ; Hilliard 2003 ; Liao 2013 ; Moradian 2015 ; Ratcliff 2014 ; Xie 2001 ). We did not include Hanser 2006 in the meta‐analysis for reasons discussed above. Meta‐analysis of the remaining six trials (N = 545) resulted in a heterogeneous SMD of 0.98 (95% CI −0.36 to 2.33, P = 0.15, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 98%; Analysis 1.23 ; Burns 2001a ; Hilliard 2003 ; Liao 2013 ; Moradian 2015 ; Ratcliff 2014 ; Xie 2001 ), with Xie 2001 reporting a much larger beneficial effect than the other trials. Removal of this outlier resulted in a small effect size that was homogeneous (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.53, P = 0.02, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%).\n\n【315】We conducted a sensitivity analysis removing all studies that used improper methods of randomization. This resulted in a moderate effect size that was statistically significant (SMD: 0.52, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.02, P = 0.04, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 66%; Analysis 1.23 ).\n\n【316】A subgroup analysis per intervention type resulted in a homogeneous, moderate effect of music therapy on QoL (SMD: 0.42 , 95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, P = 0.02, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 4%; Analysis 1.24 ) that was statistically significant and consistent across studies ( Cohen 1988 ). In Hanser 2006 , music therapy resulted in a greater improvement in QoL (FACT‐G, 0‐108) (mean change score: 3.5, SD 13.75) than standard care (mean change score: 0.9, SD 15.8), but this difference was not statistically significant. The pooled effect of the music medicine studies was large but very heterogeneous and not statistically significant (SMD: 1.33, 95% CI −0.96 to 3.63, P = 0.26, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 99%). The large heterogeneity was due to the outlying values of Xie 2001 ; removing it from the analysis resulted in a small effect for the music medicine studies that was consistent across studies but not statistically significant (SMD: 0.20, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.51, P = 0.21, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%). The difference in treatment effect between the music therapy studies and the music medicine studies was statistically significant when we excluded Xie 2001 from the analysis (P = 0.01). With the Xie study included, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.44).\n\n【317】#### Comparison 2: Music therapy plus standard care versus music medicine plus standard care\n\n【318】Only two studies reported on the direct comparison between music therapy and music medicine interventions.\n\n【319】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【320】###### Psychological outcomes\n\n【321】**Anxiety**\n\n【322】Two trials directly compared the effects of music therapy with music medicine on cancer patients' anxiety using a 100mm visual analogue scale ( Bradt 2015 ; Palmer 2015 ). Both interventions resulted in reduction of anxiety. Whereas music therapy interventions resulted in a greater average anxiety reduction than music medicine intervention, this difference was not statistically significant (MD: −3.67, 95% CI −11.68 to 4.35, P = 0.37, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; Analysis 2.1 ). However, 77.4% of the participants in the cross‐over trial by Bradt 2015 expressed a preference for receiving music therapy sessions for the remainder of their cancer treatment or future treatments. The main reasons cited by participants for this preferences were that they felt cared for by the music therapist, enjoyed the interactive and creative music making, and valued the opportunity for emotional expression and processing.\n\n【323】#### Comparison 3: Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care plus alternative relaxation interventions\n\n【324】Several studies compared music interventions with other relaxation interventions such as progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery and relaxation, and verbal relaxation instructions. At this time, only single studies were identified per outcome. This precluded meta‐analysis is results.\n\n【325】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【326】###### Psychological outcomes\n\n【327】**Anxiety**\n\n【328】Straw 1991 compared music listening to guided imagery and relaxation training and found that both interventions significantly reduced state anxiety as measured by the STAI‐S (score range 20 to 80) (guided imagery post‐test mean: 38.6, SD 10.01; music listening post‐test mean: 34.22, SD 10.12). An ANCOVA analysis with pre‐test anxiety scores as a co‐variate indicated that the difference in effect of the two interventions on state anxiety was not statistically significant.\n\n【329】**Depression**\n\n【330】Stordahl 2009 compared music‐assisted relaxation with verbal relaxation instructions in 20 women with breast cancer and reported a lower level of depression on the Center for Epidimiologic Diseases ‐ Depression Scale (CES‐D, score range 0 to 60) following treatment in the music‐assisted relaxation treatment arm (n = 10; post‐test mean: 6.6, SD 5.02) than in the verbal relaxation treatment arm (n = 10; post‐test mean: 9.20, SD 10.96).\n\n【331】**Mood**\n\n【332】Stordahl 2009 also compared the impact of music‐assisted relaxation with verbal relaxation instructions on mood in women with breast cancer and found that music‐assisted relaxation resulted in lower scores (i.e. better mood) on the POMS‐SF (score range 14 to 70 as reported in this thesis) (post‐test mean: 6.5, SD 5.19) than verbal relaxation instructions (post‐test mean = 8.64, SD 6.42).\n\n【333】###### Physical symptoms\n\n【334】**Pain**\n\n【335】Shaban 2006 compared the effects of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) to music listening and found that PMR was more effective in reducing pain (100mm VAS) (mean post‐test score: 6.22, SD 2.45) than listening to pre‐recorded music (mean post‐test score: 4.96, SD 2.76) in 100 participants.\n\n【336】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【337】###### Quality of life\n\n【338】Straw 1991 compared a guided imagery and relaxation intervention to music listening and found that music listening led to a greater increase in QoL (Functional Living Index, score range 22 to 154) (mean change score: 16.33, SD 20.73) than the guided imagery and relaxation group (mean change score: 4.6, SD 20.49).\n\n【339】#### Comparison 4: Music interventions plus standard care versus standard care plus placebo control\n\n【340】Only a few trials compared music therapy or music medicine to a placebo control, The trials examined a limited number of outcomes, which we describe below.\n\n【341】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【342】###### Psychological symptoms\n\n【343】**Distress**\n\n【344】Two trials examined the effects of music therapy on reduction of distress, comparing a music video intervention with an audiobook control condition in adolescents and young adults during stem cell transplantation ( Burns 2009 ; Robb 2014 ). In the music video, participants wrote songs and created accompanying music videos in collaboration with a music therapist. The pooled effect of the two trials did not provide support for an effect of music therapy (SMD: −0.08, 95% CI −0.42 to 0.25, P = 0.62, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; Analysis 3.1 ). In Burns 2009 , both groups reported an increase in distress post‐intervention scores, which were used in the meta‐analysis. However, follow‐up measures at 100 days after the stem‐cell transplantation indicated a lower mean distress score for the music therapy group (mean: 1.67, SD 0.55) than the audiobook group (mean: 2.00, SD 0.64).\n\n【345】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【346】###### Social and spiritual support\n\n【347】**Spiritual well‐being**\n\n【348】Burns 2009 and Robb 2014 also examined the effect of a music video intervention versus audiobook control condition on spiritual well‐being in adolescents and young adults. Their pooled estimate did not find support for an effect of music therapy on spiritual well‐being (SMD: 0.31, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.73, P = 0.15, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 0%; Analysis 3.2 ).\n\n【349】###### Communication\n\n【350】One trial in children with cancer compared the effects of one session of active music making to music listening and audio storybooks on levels of active engagement and initiation in 55 children ( Robb 2008 ). Active music therapy sessions led to higher active engagement (post‐test mean: 26.03, SD 4.1) than music listening (post‐test mean: 15.65, SD 6.2, P < 0.0001) or audio storybooks (post‐test mean: 15.17, SD 4.9, P < 0.0001). These differences were statistically significant. Active music making (post‐test mean: 14.19, SD 8.3) and music listening (post‐test mean: 15.89, SD 11.2) also increased the child's initiation behaviour compared to the audio storybooks (post‐test mean: 7.43, SD 6.6). These differences were also statistically significant (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002, respectively).\n\n【351】###### Quality of life\n\n【352】Burns 2009 compared music therapy to an audiobook control, finding a small increase in QoL in the music therapy group (Index of Well‐Being, score range 9 ‐ 63) (mean change score: 0.31, SD 1.73, n = 7) and a small decrease in the control group (mean change score: −0.22, SD 1.24, n = 3). However, the sample size was too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\n【353】Discussion\n----------\n\n【354】available in\n\n【355】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【356】### Summary of main results\n\n【357】The results of 19 trials suggest that music therapy and music medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people with cancer, with a reported anxiety reduction of 8.54 units, on average, on the STAI‐S (score range: 20 to 80) scale and −0.71 standardized units on other anxiety scales which is considered a moderate to large effect. Although the magnitude of the effect differed across the studies, the trials agreed on the direction of the point estimates. These anxiety‐reducing results are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music with coronary heart disease patients ( Bradt 2013a ), with mechanically ventilated patients ( Bradt 2014 ), and for pre‐operative anxiety ( Bradt 2013b ). A comparison of music therapy with music medicine trials for anxiety reduction in people with cancer suggest a moderate treatment effect for music therapy studies (SMD: −0.62) that was consistent across studies. Music medicine trials resulted in a larger effect (SMD: −1.0) but results were highly inconsistent across studies. Cohen 1988 suggested that an effect size of 0.20 be considered a small effect, an effect size of 0.50 medium, and an effect size of 0.80 large. A direct comparison of music therapy with music medicine interventions for anxiety reduction in two studies indicated greater anxiety reduction of music therapy interventions. It is noteworthy that a large majority of the patients in one of the comparative studies expressed a preference for the music therapy intervention.\n\n【358】The results of seven studies suggest that music intervention may reduce depression in people with cancer. The results of a single study suggest that music therapy may help adolescents and young adults employ positive coping strategies during stem cell transplant, a high risk and high intensity treatment. We found no evidence of effect for distress or mood.\n\n【359】As for the effect of music on physical symptoms, the results of seven trials suggest that music has a large pain‐reducing effect of −0.91 standardized units. The results of single studies suggest that music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics. Music interventions also had a small to moderate effect on fatigue (−0.38 standardized units). We found no evidence for an effect of music on physical status. Reduction of anxiety, depression, fatigue and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they have an impact on health and overall QoL.\n\n【360】It is important that careful consideration is given to the implementation of music listening interventions. The results of Kwekkeboom 2003 indicate that listening to music through headphones may be contraindicated during painful procedures because it prevents the patient from hearing the surgeon's instructions and comments. This may greatly increase patients' anxiety and, consequently, their perceived pain. In this case, it is better to listen to music without headphones.\n\n【361】Furthermore, results suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on several physiological responses in patients with cancer. Listening to music may reduce heart rate by an average of three to four beats per minute and respiratory rate by an average of two breaths per minute. These results are consistent with the findings of a Cochrane systematic review on the use of music with coronary heart disease patients ( Bradt 2013a ), which reported a heart rate reduction of 3.4 bpm and a respiratory rate reduction of 2.5 breaths per minute. Similar results were reported in a Cochrane review on music interventions for mechanically ventilated patients ( Bradt 2014 ), namely a mean heart rate reduction of 3.95 bpm and a mean respiratory rate reduction of 2.87 breaths per minute. In the case of a resting heart rate within normal range, a reduction of 4 bpm may not be clinically significant. However, it might be in the case of a tachycardiac rate. In a study examining the quantitative relationship between resting heart rate reduction and clinical benefit, Cucherat 2007 found that each 10 bpm reduction in heart rate is estimated to reduce the relative risk of cardiac death by 30%. The results of this review also indicate that listening to music may have a beneficial effect on SBP, although we found no evidence of an effect for DBP. Trials on music listening with cardiac patients and mechanically ventilated patients have also reported reductions in systolic blood pressure ( Bradt 2013a ; Bradt 2014 ). The reduction of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure corresponds with the anxiety‐reducing effects found by subjective outcome measures in this review.\n\n【362】No evidence of support was found for an effect of music interventions on oxygen saturation level. Single trials included in this review found support for a beneficial effect of music on mean arterial pressure and immunologic function.\n\n【363】Music therapy interventions had a moderate effect of 0.42 standardized units on quality of life, whereas we found no support for an effect for music medicine studies. Two studies that compared music therapy with audiobook control in adolescents and young adults did not find support for spiritual well‐being. Two music therapy studies with adults reported conflicting results for this outcome. Finally, a single study with adolescents and young adults during stem cell transplant reported beneficial effects of music therapy on perceived social support and the family environment.\n\n【364】Subgroup analyses of treatment effects between music therapy and music medicine studies was possible for four outcomes, namely anxiety, depression, mood and quality of life. There was a difference for quality of life, with music therapy studies contributing to a larger pooled treatment effect than music medicine studies; we found no difference between music therapy and music medicine studies for the other outcomes. However, it is worth noting that for all outcomes, music therapy interventions resulted in consistent findings across studies whereas the results of music medicine studies were highly heterogeneous for these outcomes.\n\n【365】We could examine the impact of music preference for anxiety, depression, pain, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Music preference did not impact the effect of music on anxiety. For the other outcomes, even though there was no difference between the use of patient‐preferred versus researcher‐selected music, the results show some interesting trends. For pain, the use of patient‐preferred music had a much larger impact on pain reduction. In contrast, no evidence of pain‐reducing effect was found for researcher‐selected music. For heart rate, researcher‐selected music resulted in a larger and more consistent treatment effect than patient‐preferred music. Interestingly, for blood pressure, patient‐preferred music resulted in a larger treatment effect, but the results were highly inconsistent across studies. In contrast, researcher‐selected music resulted in smaller effect.\n\n【366】For all outcomes, the sensitivity analyses were robust to the original conclusions.\n\n【367】The summary of findings Table for the main comparison provides a summary of the main results of this review with associated risks.\n\n【368】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【369】This review included 52 randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials.\n\n【370】Seventeen trials used listening to pre‐recorded music, and 13 trials used music therapy interventions that actively engaged the patients ( Characteristics of included studies ). We were able to compare the treatment effects of music therapy studies with music medicine studies for four outcomes. For the other outcomes this was not possible due to insufficient number of music therapy and music medicine studies per outcome.\n\n【371】This review included both music therapy and music medicine studies, as defined in the Background . Music therapists who work with cancer patients do not limit their interventions to offering music listening for relaxation purposes. Music therapists are specially trained clinically and academically to carefully select music interventions to offer emotional and spiritual support, support communication with loved ones, enhance a sense of control, and improve physical well‐being in patients with cancer. Comparative analyses suggest that music therapy interventions are more effective than music medicine interventions in improving quality of life. We found no differences between music therapy and music medicine interventions for other outcomes, but it is worth noting that the results of music therapy studies were much less heterogeneous than those of music medicine studies. This is likely due to the fact that music therapists are trained to meet the individual needs of patients through music interventions (e.g. meeting the patient's in‐the‐moment needs when offering live music) rather than offering a limited selection of pre‐recorded music, which may not be suitable for all patients. Participants in a cross‐over trial who experienced both music therapy and music medicine interventions overwhelmingly preferred the music therapy sessions because of the personal attention and care, the creativity of the interactive music making, and the opportunity for emotional expression through singing and playing instruments.\n\n【372】In general, the trials that used listening to pre‐recorded music provided little information about the music selections used, except for mentioning general music styles (e.g. new age, classical music, easy listening, etc). Music within each of these styles can vary widely, and more detailed information would help clinicians make well‐informed decisions regarding music selections.\n\n【373】The frequency and duration of the interventions varied widely across the trials. Twelve trials offered a single music session. We would like to suggest that offering multiple music listening sessions allows for the patient to give feedback about the music, select different music if needed, and become more skilled in using music for relaxation purposes. In the case of music therapy interventions, multiple sessions allow for the development of a therapeutic relationship and deepening of the therapeutic process through the music. This may lead to greater health benefits. At this time, however, the relationship between the frequency and duration of treatment and treatment effect remains unclear. Further investigation into the optimal frequency and duration of music interventions for specific outcomes in people with cancer is needed.\n\n【374】Presently, we cannot provide data regarding cost or cost‐effectiveness of music therapy or music medicine applications in the care of cancer patients, as the reviewed trials did not provide these data.\n\n【375】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【376】Because of the large number of trials at high risk of bias, readers should interpret the findings of this review with caution. Often blinding of participants is not possible in music medicine or music therapy studies unless a comparative design is used (e.g. Bradt 2015 ). Many of the trials in this review included subjective outcomes, such as anxiety, pain, mood and quality of life. When participants cannot be blinded to the intervention, there is definitely an opportunity for bias when they are asked to report on these subjective outcomes.\n\n【377】For many trials, the principal investigators needed to be contacted to provide additional methodological and statistical information, which improved the quality of evidence in the review.\n\n【378】For anxiety and pain, there were moderate to large effects across studies. For anxiety, the trials did not agree on the size of effect, with some reporting much larger beneficial effects than others, resulting in a large confidence interval. In summary, the quality of evidence was low for the outcomes (i.e. anxiety, mood, pain, fatigue and quality of life) and very low for depression ( summary of findings Table for the main comparison ).\n\n【379】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【380】The strength of our review is that we searched all available databases and a large number of music therapy journals (English, German, and French language), checked reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant experts for identification of unpublished trials, and included publications without restricting language. We requested additional data where necessary for all trials we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate information on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped us make well‐informed trial selection decisions.\n\n【381】Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that we missed some published and unpublished trials, we are confident that our detailed search strategy combined with extensive handsearching identified all relevant trials. It is possible that we did not identify some grey literature; however, it is doubtful that this would have had a significant impact on our results. Grey literature tends to include trials with relatively small numbers of participants and inconclusive results ( McAuley 2000 ).\n\n【382】One of the included trials ( Bradt 2015 ) was conducted by the lead author of this review. As for all new studies included in this update, the risk of bias was assessed by CD and LM. Data extraction was completed independently by AT.\n\n【383】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【384】The findings of this review are consistent with the results of a review (32 RCTs and controlled clinical trials) assessing the effect of music interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients ( Zhang 2012 ). Zhang and colleagues reported a mean difference of −12.3 for anxiety (STAI‐S, score range 20 to 80), −6.23 for depression (Self‐Rating Depression Scale, score range 20 to 80), −0.52 for pain (0 to 10 numeric rating scale) and 13.32 for quality of life (Quality of Life ‐ Cancer, score range 0‐100). The authors also reported that the effects of music on vital signs, especially blood pressure, were small. In contrast, Nightingale 2013 (a review of four RCT studies) evaluated the effects of music on anxiety in adult cancer patients, reporting no evidence of an effect for music on anxiety. This was likely due to the small number of studies included in this review. In addition, reviewers included Kwekkeboom 2003 in the meta‐analysis, which was a quite problematic trial in terms of the implementation of the music listening interventions, as discussed in the Results section of our review. Study participants reported that the use of headphones while undergoing painful medical procedures was anxiety‐provoking because it prevented them from hearing the surgeon. In addition, Nightingale 2013 included Hanser 2006 in the meta‐analysis, whereas we included this study in the narrative only. Our decision was based on a very high attrition rate (40%) and the inability to implement the music therapy intervention within the a priori set timeframe, thereby highly diluting the intervention, as reported by the authors.\n\n【385】Figures and Tables -\n\n【386】Figure 1\n\n【387】Study flow diagram.\n\n【388】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【389】Figures and Tables

Missing data and marked heterogeneity prevented meta‐analysis. Three studies out of six reported fever, all for sore throat, showed more fever in the delayed antibiotic group. The remaining three showed no difference. There was no symptom differences for patients with cough or the common cold. Pain and malaise severity scores at day three significantly favoured the immediate antibiotic group in children with acute otitis media (Little 2001).\n\n【13】El‐Daher 1991 showed reduced vomiting in children in the immediate antibiotic group with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis but there was no difference in children with sore throat in Little 1997. Little 1997 and Arroll 2002a showed no difference for the outcome of diarrhoea, while Little 2001 reported less diarrhoea in the delayed antibiotic group in children with otitis media.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Delayed antibiotics have been used in an attempt to reduce the use of antibiotic prescriptions. For most outcomes there is no difference between immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. Three of the six studies, indicated that patients in the delayed antibiotic group had significantly more fever. Pain and malaise scores were worse for children with otitis media in the delayed antibiotic group. This price must be weighed up against the benefits of reduced antibiotic prescribing. Future RCTs of delaying antibiotics should fully report symptoms as well as changes of prescription rates.\n\n【16】PICOs\n-----\n\n【17】### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Population (11)\n\n【19】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Respiratory Tract Infection\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【21】*   Delayed Treatment\n*   Antibacterial drug\n\n【22】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【23】###### Outcome (11)\n\n【24】*   Sore Throat\n*   Rash\n*   Vomiting\n*   Follow-up Consultation\n*   Bronchitis\n*   Diarrhoea\n*   Common Cold\n*   Antibiotic Resistance Test\n*   Acute Otitis Media\n*   Antibiotic Therapy\n*   Patient Satisfaction\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

This review looks at the effect of this strategy on the course of the illness in people with upper respiratory tract infections. It found that patients in three out of six studies, all with sore throat, had more fever if they delayed antibiotics. Additionally, children with a middle ear infection had more pain and malaise if they delayed antibiotics.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To review the efficacy and safety of perioperative beta blockade in reducing myocardial infarction and cardiac or all‐cause mortality in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Peripheral arterial disease is an important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. By an overwhelming margin, coronary artery disease is the leading cause of both early and late mortality following peripheral vascular reconstruction ( Hertzer 1984 ). Additionally, people who suffer from this disease have the same relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes as do those with a history of coronary artery disease (even in the absence of known ischemic heart disease) ( CAPRIE ; Newman 1999 ). The severity of peripheral arterial disease is closely associated with risk of myocardial infarction. People with critical limb ischemia have annual mortality of 25% ( Dormandy 1999 ). Given that most people with peripheral arterial disease have asymptomatic coronary artery disease (secondary to limitation of activity), they should be considered for secondary prevention strategies with aggressive risk factor modification ( Hirsch 2006 ). Yet, people with peripheral arterial disease are under treated compared with those suffering from coronary artery disease.\n\n【6】Inevitably, a large portion of people with peripheral arterial disease end up undergoing surgical intervention for worsening symptoms. Vascular surgery is associated with significant postoperative mortality. The 30‐day postoperative mortality for elective vascular surgery ranges from 2.1% after femoropopliteal bypass to 8% after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair ( Blankensteijn 1998 ; Feinglass 2001 ). Major cause of morbidity and mortality postoperatively is due to underlying cardiac disease. The incidence of myocardial infarction ranges from 3% to 17% ( McCann 1989 ; Poldermans 1999 ).\n\n【7】Drugs that block beta‐adrenergic receptors have been established as a therapeutic intervention in prevention of cardiac complications in patients with acute myocardial infarction, silent ischemia, and heart failure. It has been proposed that beta‐blockers reduce the risk of perioperative cardiac complications by slowing the heart rate, decreasing blood pressure, and moderating hemodynamic stress responses. Perioperative beta‐blockade in 200 patients considered at high risk of coronary artery disease and undergoing major surgical procedures reduced the incidence of myocardial ischemia with 48 hours of surgery from 34% to 17% ( Mangano 1996 ). Later, a trial of 112 vascular surgical patients with abnormal stress echocardiography randomized to bisoprolol was stopped early because of major reduction in morbidity and mortality with the study drug ( Poldermans 1999 ). Since the publication of these trials, there have been additional randomized clinical trials as well as meta‐analyses which have questioned the benefits of beta blockade in the average patient undergoing major vascular surgery ( Brady 2005 ; Devereaux 2005 ; Juul 2006 ; Yang 2006 ). In the light of these uncertainties, we plan to review the literature and assess the overall benefit and safety of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.\n\n【8】Objectives\n----------\n\n【9】To review the efficacy and safety of perioperative beta blockade in reducing myocardial infarction and cardiac or all‐cause mortality in patients undergoing vascular surgery.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【12】#### Types of studies\n\n【13】Randomized and controlled prospective clinical trials of perioperative beta‐blockade.\n\n【14】#### Types of participants\n\n【15】All patients over 18 years of age undergoing vascular surgery. Pediatric population will be excluded because peripheral arterial disease afflicts adults.\n\n【16】#### Types of interventions\n\n【17】*   Intervention: Perioperative beta‐blockers of any dose, titration, duration and mode of administration\n    \n*   Control: Placebo or no treatment\n    \n\n【18】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【19】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【20】*   All‐cause mortality\n    \n*   Cardiovascular mortality\n    \n*   30‐day postoperative non‐fatal and fatal myocardial infarction\n    \n\n【21】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【22】*   Arrhythmia (any variation from the normal rhythm of the heart beat) requiring treatment\n    \n*   Intra‐operative bradycardia (slowness of the heart beat)\n    \n*   Intra‐operative hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure) requiring treatment\n    \n*   Heart failure\n    \n*   Vascular patency and graft occlusion\n    \n*   Stroke\n    \n*   Rehospitalization at 30 days\n    \n\n【23】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【24】The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases (PVD) Group will search their Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library._ The PVD Group's Specialized Register is constructed from electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to date), EMBASE (1980 to date), and CINAHL (1982 to date), and through handsearching relevant journals. The full list of journals that have been handsearched, as well as the search strategies used to search the electronic databases, are described in the editorial information about the Cochrane PVD Group in _The Cochrane Library_ http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html .\n\n【25】**Electronic searches**\n\n【26】We will search the following databases:\n\n【27】1.  MEDLINE (1967 onwards).\n    \n2.  EMBASE (1967 onwards).\n    \n3.  Web of Science (1967 onwards).\n    \n\n【28】**Key words**  \nPerioperative care, postoperative complications, adrenergic beta antagonists, adrenergic antagonists, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, mortality, heart disease mortality and vascular, beta‐blockers.\n\n【29】There will be no restriction on language.\n\n【30】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【31】#### Applying inclusion criteria\n\n【32】We will trace references mentioning beta‐blockers and vascular surgery from the articles identified and we will include those that meet the criteria. We will document the reasons for exclusion of any article from selection. Thereafter, studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be assessed. We will independently review articles for inclusion before reconciliation of any discrepant selections.\n\n【33】#### Assessment of the quality of the studies\n\n【34】We will study the characteristics of the trials included to determine their quality. We will assess the quality of the studies using quality scores based on the Schulz criteria ( Schulz 1995 ). We will resolve disagreements by consensus. The parameters to be sought include the method and security of randomization, whether assessors and patients were blinded to treatment allocation, whether analysis was by intention to treat, the rate of completion of follow up and whether the washout period was adequate, if applicable (i.e., cross‐over studies).\n\n【35】#### Data extraction\n\n【36】Articles that meet the inclusion criteria will be processed for data extraction. We will extract data independently and the results will be checked for consistency using a prepared data extraction form. We will extract the following details: number of patients in each arm, patient characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity and cardiovascular risk factors), type of vascular surgery, specific beta‐antagonist used (including dose, duration and treatment endpoints), morbidity and mortality outcomes, adverse effects reported and length of trial follow up.\n\n【37】#### Data analysis\n\n【38】We will base quantitative analysis of outcomes on intention‐to‐treat data where these data are available. Dichotomous data will be expressed as risk difference (Number needed to treat (NNT)) and odds ratio and continuous data will be expressed as standardized weighted mean differences and weighted mean differences. The full random‐effects model will be used to combine results across studies. Differences between the random‐effects model results and those from the theoretically exact fixed‐effect model will describe the potential effects of heterogeneity. We will explore differences in the summary statistics between the fixed‐effect and random‐effects models.\n\n【39】We will summarize each study for treatment and control group, relative risk reduction and NNT for cardiovascular endpoints including perioperative myocardial infarction and death. Additionally, studies will be combined according to type of surgery, duration and intensity of drug therapy.\n\n【40】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【41】We will conduct sensitivity analysis by analyzing the following categories of studies separately:\n\n【42】*   trials with and without adequate randomization and concealment of treatment allocation;\n    \n*   trials with and without intention‐to‐treat analysis;\n    \n*   trials of low risk, moderate risk and high risk vascular surgery;\n    \n*   trials of preoperative exposure of beta‐blockers of less than a week and greater than one week.\n    \n\n【43】For sensitivity analysis we will describe both the main effects within strata and a coefficient (and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) describing the interaction between them.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2a9a0b50-1878-4e02-9117-282607899bbe", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】1\\. To evaluate the effectiveness of glutamine supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.\n\n【3】2\\. To evaluate adverse events associated with glutamine supplementation in Crohn's disease.\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid in catabolic states, is the principal respiratory substrate for enterocytes ( Windmueller 1978 ). It is known to play a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Glutamine supplementation has been shown to reduce intestinal permeability ( Hond 1999 ), prevent mucosal atrophy and maintain gut integrity ( Van der Hurst 1993 ). It spares mobilization of glutamine from skeletal muscle and thereby improves nitrogen balance ( Stehle 1989 ).\n\n【7】Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition of the alimentary tract characterized by gut mucosal inflammation, enhanced proinflammatory cytokine activity, increased gut permeability ( Katz 1989 ) and poor nutrition secondary to decreased intake and to increased catabolic losses. Protein turnover is increased in active Crohn's disease ( Thomas 1992 ) and subjects are in a state of catabolism ( Kangas 1986 ). Low plasma glutamine levels have been described in patients with Crohn's disease ( Thomas 1991 ) probably due to enhanced utilization of glutamine by the diseased intestinal mucosa ( Lacey 1990 ). The body's requirement of glutamine may by far exceed the supply causing a state of glutamine deficiency. This nature of conditional essentialness has been demonstrated in other catabolic states such as burns, trauma and sepsis ( Hall 1996 ).\n\n【8】In experimental animal models of Crohn's disease, glutamine supplementation prevented macroscopic ileitis and increased intestinal glutathione status ( Sido 2006 ), reduced inflammation, prevented weight loss, improved nitrogen balance and reduced disease activity ( Fox 1988 ). Glutamine has been shown to reduce bacterial translocation in an animal model ( Fujita 2005 ) which may have important implications in the setting of gut mucosal inflammation as seen in Crohn's disease.\n\n【9】In vitro, glutamine reduces the production of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines IL‐6 and IL‐8, and enhances the production of the anti‐inflammatory cytokine, IL‐10 in human intestinal mucosa ( Coeffier 2003 ). Down‐regulation of chemokines by glutamine could also contribute to its therapeutic potential in reducing intestinal inflammation during critical illnesses ( Marion 2004 ).\n\n【10】Considering that glutamine may have positive nutritional, metabolic and immunologic benefits with respect to Crohn's disease, it has been trialled in the treatment of subjects with the disease ( Akobeng 2000 ). The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the current evidence on the use of glutamine for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease.\n\n【11】Objectives\n----------\n\n【12】1\\. To evaluate the effectiveness of glutamine supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.\n\n【13】2\\. To evaluate adverse events associated with glutamine supplementation in Crohn's disease.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】Randomized controlled trials.\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】Patients of any age with active Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease should have been diagnosed by conventional clinical, radiographic, endoscopic and histological criteria. Active disease should have been defined using a recognised Crohn's disease activity index.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】1\\. Glutamine supplement administered by any route (e.g. oral, intravenous).  \n2\\. No intervention, placebo or active comparator.\n\n【22】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【23】1\\. The primary outcome will be clinical or endoscopic remission as defined by the primary studies.  \n2\\. Secondary outcomes will include clinical response as defined by authors of the primary studies, improvement in intestinal permeability, quality of life, growth in children, and adverse events.\n\n【24】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【25】See: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group search strategy.\n\n【26】A. Electronic search  \nThe following electronic databases will be searched for relevant studies:  \n1\\. MEDLINE (1966‐to date);  \n2\\. EMBASE (1984‐to date);  \n3\\. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; and  \n4\\. Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial Register.\n\n【27】The search strategy will not be limited by language.\n\n【28】B. Reference searching  \nThe references of all identified studies will be inspected for more trials.\n\n【29】C. Personal contacts  \nLeaders in the field will be contacted to identify other studies.\n\n【30】MEDLINE on PUBMED will be searched using the following search strategy:\n\n【31】1\\. Crohn\\* disease  \n2\\. Crohn disease (MeSH)  \n3\\. Regional enteritis  \n4\\. Ileitis  \n5\\. Ileitis (MeSH)  \n6\\. Inflammatory bowel disease  \n7\\. Inflammatory bowel diseases (MeSH)  \n8\\. 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 OR 6 OR 7  \n9\\. Glutamine  \n10\\. 8 AND 9\n\n【32】The above search strategy will be adapted and used to search the other databases\n\n【33】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【34】Methods of the review\n\n【35】Step 1. Using the above search strategy, papers that appeared to be potentially relevant will be identified by the two authors.\n\n【36】Step 2. The authors, after reading the full texts, will independently assess the eligibility of all trials identified using an ad hoc eligibility based on the inclusion criteria above. Disagreement among authors will be discussed and agreement reached by consensus.\n\n【37】Step 3. The methodological quality of selected trials will be assessed independently by two authors using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2005 ) and the Jadad scale ( Jadad 1996 ). The former is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between allocation concealment and direction of effect. The categories are defined below:\n\n【38】A. adequate allocation concealment;  \nB. allocation concealment unclear; and  \nC. inadequate allocation concealment.\n\n【39】The Jadad scale is a validated five point scale which measures some important factors that impact on the quality of a trial. This is summarised below:\n\n【40】a. was the study described as randomised?  \nb. was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate?  \nc. was the study described as double blind?  \nd. was the double blinding well described and appropriate?  \ne. were withdrawals and dropouts described?\n\n【41】Each item will be given a score of 1 if the answer is 'yes' and 0 if the answer is 'no'. One point will be deducted if the described method of randomisation or blinding is inappropriate.\n\n【42】DATA COLLECTION  \nA data extraction form will be developed and used to extract information on relevant features and results of included studies. Two authors will independently extract and record data on the predefined checklist. Extracted data will include the following items:\n\n【43】a. characteristics of patients: age, sex, disease distribution, disease duration, disease activity index;  \nb. total number of patients originally assigned to each intervention group;  \nc. intervention: Glutamine supplementation (oral or parenteral);  \ne. control: no intervention, placebo or other interventions;  \nf. concurrent medications; and  \ng. outcomes: time of assessment, type of Crohn's disease activity index used, remission rates, quality of life assessment, adverse events.\n\n【44】STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\n【45】The Cochrane Collaboration review manager (RevMan) software (version 5.0.9) will be used for data analysis. Data will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Patients with final missing outcomes will be assumed to be treatment failures. Analyses will be grouped by length of follow up.\n\n【46】Dichotomous variables  \nOdds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated based on the fixed effects model.\n\n【47】Continuous variables  \nWeighted mean difference (WMD) when measured in the same unit, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales are used to evaluate the same outcome will be calculated. Similar studies will be pooled using fixed effects WMD or SMD and 95% CI.\n\n【48】Heterogeneity  \nHeterogeneity among trial results will be assessed by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating the chi square test of heterogeneity (a P value of 0.10 will be regarded as statistically significant). The I <sup>2 </sup> value will be calculated to quantify the effect of heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ). A random effects model will be used in situations of unexplained heterogeneity. When there is significant heterogeneity, we will further examine the included studies for sources of both clinical and methodological heterogeneity.\n\n【49】Publication Bias  \nThe possibility of a publication bias will be investigated through the construction of funnel plots (trial effects versus trial size).\n\n【50】Subgroup analysis  \nSubgroup analysis will be performed based on:  \na. route of glutamine supplementation;  \nb. duration of treatment;  \nc. duration of disease; and  \nd. disease location (pure colonic disease versus small bowel involvement).\n\n【51】Sensitivity analyses  \nSensitivity analyses will be conducted based on the following:  \na. only including patients whose outcome is known (i.e. number of patients who completed the study used as denominator);  \nb. random effects versus fixed effects models; and  \nc. study quality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of de‐escalation techniques for staff and service users in the management of non‐psychosis‐induced aggression in adults.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Aggression is any behaviour directed toward another individual that is carried out with the immediate intent to cause harm ( Anderson 2002 ). This may be communicated verbally or may manifest in a range of behaviours causing physical or psychological harm towards the self or others, or damage to the environment ( NICE 2015a ) _._ There is a substantial body of literature on the origins of aggressive behaviour and theories to account for the causes of aggression. For example, the general aggression model proposes that specific context and person‐centred factors are mediated by variables such as cognition, affect and arousal in the manifestation of aggression ( Anderson 2002 ). There is not scope within this review to fully explore all of the relevant literature on the aetiology of aggressive behaviour and therefore we will focus on the management of these behaviours within the broad context of health services.\n\n【7】Aggression can occur in many settings, including inpatient settings, emergency settings ( NICE 2015a ), and in communities served by emergency services such as police or paramedics ( Hester 2009 ) _._ Aggression that is left untreated may escalate into violence involving risks to the aggressor and those around them such as family and healthcare professionals ( Bourget 2002 ; Maguire 2007 ). Workplace violence affects every country and healthcare setting, with reports estimating that 4% of the global employee population have experienced physical violence, and nurses are at three times greater risk of violence than any other profession ( Di Martino 2003 ). A large international review of 424 studies reported an incidence rate of over 32% for violence in psychiatric hospitals, but a greater risk of violence in acute healthcare settings ( Bowers 2011 ). In the UK, physical assaults against National Health Service (NHS) staff are estimated at 67,864 incidents per annum, with 67% of those occurring in mental health settings, 28% in acute hospitals and the remainder in ambulance and primary care settings ( NHS Protect 2015 ). In England alone 14% of NHS staff reported having experienced physical violence from service users, relatives or the public ( NHS 2014 ). Violence is also prevalent in community settings where around half of care workers experience verbal abuse and over a third experience physical abuse ( NICE 2015b ). Aggressive and violent behaviour may have a significant impact on staff with an estimated 26%, 11% and 6% of incidents respectively relating to mild, moderate or severe injury ( Bowers 2011 ). Verbal aggression toward staff is common and may lead to poor performance and functioning ( Stone 2010 ; Uzun 2003 ); and low morale ( Bowers 2009 ; Sprigg 2007 ). Increased exposure to violence from service users is correlated with increased stress and reduced job satisfaction in social care and social work staff ( Harris 2012 ).\n\n【8】Aggression may be associated with intrinsic factors such as recognised mental health issues ( Fazel 2006 ), including, for the purposes of this review, substance misuse, intellectual disability and other mental health issues (excluding psychosis), and extrinsic factors such as social and environmental conditions. Certain conditions also place individuals at increased risk of an episode of acute aggression such as head injury; Huntingdon’s Disease ( Johnson 2011 ); learning disability ( Taylor 2005 ); and alcohol or substance misuse, or both ( Roizen 1997 ; Snowden 2001 ). The multi‐factorial origins of aggression mean that it can apply to a wide population.\n\n【9】Health care professionals are required to use strategies for managing incidents of aggression and violence that are proportionate to the potential or immediate risk posed to self and others, commensurate with the principles of least restrictive practice ( DoH 2005 ). Interventional measures, such as physical restraint, rapid tranquillisation (for example, intramuscular injections) and seclusion, are used to manage aggression ( NICE 2015a ). The use of specialist nursing care, such as seclusion, is recommended only when the risk to self and others cannot be safely managed in communal or private environments, as containment is often aversive and unpleasant for both service users ( Whittington 2009 ) and staff ( Olofsson 1995 ). Seclusion suites used for physical containment are commonly found in Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) to manage a range of circumstances, including disruptive behaviour ( Oldham 1983 ), acute psychiatric symptoms ( Morrison 1991 ), verbal and physical aggression ( Mason 2001 ; Sullivan 2004 ), damage to property ( Ahmed 2001 ), self harm ( O'Brien 2004 ), and risk of absconding ( Morrison 1997 ). Use of seclusion varies both within ( Crenshaw 1995 ) and between countries ( Bowers 2007 ), though rates are poorly reported in terms of specific context ( Bowers 2000 ). However, as these invasive methods are associated with increased risk of injury to both service users ( Hollins 2010 ) and staff ( Farrell 2005 ), they are employed only when de‐escalation is unsuccessful.\n\n【10】To minimise the potential for harm, an episode of escalating aggression needs to be promptly defused using de‐escalation techniques as the first resort intervention measure ( NICE 2015a ).\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on management of violence in healthcare settings describes de‐escalation as “talking with an angry or agitated service user in such a way that violence is averted and the person regains a sense of calm and self‐control\" ( NICE 2015a , p 30). De‐escalation, sometimes referred to as 'defusing' or 'talk‐down', is a complex range of verbal and nonverbal communication skills used by staff in a range of settings to prevent escalation of aggressive behaviour ( CRAG 1996 ). Recognised de‐escalation techniques include verbal strategies, such as maintaining a calm tone of voice and not shouting or verbally threatening the person; and non‐verbal techniques, including an awareness of self, body stance, eye contact, and personal safety ( Cowin 2003 ; Johnson 2011 ). It has been suggested that verbal and non‐verbal communication skills may help to redirect someone to a “calmer personal space” ( Cowin 2003 ). Although de‐escalation is recommended and widely used for the management of aggression, there is little literature on specific techniques and efficacy ( Richmond 2012 ; Robertson 2012 ). The consensus statement from the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA De‐escalation Workgroup estimates that effective de‐escalation of an aggressive episode, in order to return the agitated person to a calm state, should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes. De‐escalation, therefore, is intended to ameliorate the immediate aggressive episode and is not associated with longer term benefits ( Richmond 2012 ).\n\n【13】De‐escalation is recommended as an early intervention in the management of aggression in order to prevent escalation to the crisis phase ( NICE 2015a ). Potential benefits to service users (such as improved health and well‐being) from approaches that avoid physical intervention are relatively well established ( Paterson 1997 ; Robertson 2012 ).\n\n【14】Staff training in de‐escalation techniques is an important feature of aggression management programmes ( Farrell 2005 ). Benefits for service users and staff are currently unclear, with reported improvements in staff morale and confidence ( Gournay 2001 ; Nau 2009 ), but little impact on the frequency of aggressive incidents ( Bowers 2006 ). In North America there are four widely used staff training programmes for the collective management of aggressive behaviour: The Mandt System ( Mandt 1998 ); Nonviolent Crises Intervention ( CPI 2005 ); Professional Assault Response Training ( Smith 2004 ); and Therapeutic Options ( Partie 2001 ), but these approaches are less commonly used elsewhere.\n\n【15】De‐escalation may be deployed in a range of settings, including accident and emergency (A&E), psychiatric hospitals, learning disability services, and in restraint or containment settings used by the police force where it may be embedded in conflict resolution techniques ( NHSBSA 2013 ). The application of de‐escalation techniques may vary by specific context and population, for example when working with people with a cognitive impairment, such as dementia. In the UK, NICE guidelines for the management of people with dementia recommend that health and care staff receive specific training in the anticipation of challenging behaviour and managing of violence using de‐escalation techniques and restraint methods ( NICE 2015b ).\n\n【16】### How the intervention might work\n\n【17】In clinical settings ‘The Assault Cycle’ is a theoretical model, which describes five phases in aggressive behaviour: the trigger phase, escalation phase, crisis phase, recovery phase, and depression phase ( Kaplan 1983 ; Leadbetter 1995 ). De‐escalation aims to arrest the progress of the assault cycle during the escalation phase. Some of the skills and techniques used to arrest the assault cycle, include the avoidance of confrontation, attitude and use of language, awareness of personal space, and posture. These components are described in the ACT ( **A** ssessment, **C** ommunication and **T** actics) cyclical model by Dix 2008 . There are a number of competing theoretical approaches to de‐escalation but the key recommended components are: recognising the signs of escalating anger; and approaching the person in a calm manner ( NICE 2015a ). These techniques may help de‐escalate potentially aggressive situations by establishing a positive relationship between staff and aggressor in the management of appropriate behavioural expectations ( Levenson 2004 ). De‐escalation techniques are recommended as a frontline response for defusing aggressive or agitated behaviour, but there is no universally accepted model and the core skill set is poorly documented ( Robertson 2012 ).\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】In the UK, the Winterbourne Enquiry into the abuse of patients in learning disability services, including inappropriate use of physical interventions and restraints, resulted in increased pressure on all mental health and learning disability care settings to find safe alternatives to the use of physical intervention ( CQC 2011 ). Evidence of effectiveness of alternative methods of managing aggressive behaviour, other than with physical intervention such as restraint and seclusion, is unclear. Muralidharan 2006 suggests that evidence is inconclusive due to lack of high quality studies and Gaskin 2007 argues for strong evidence in favour of alternative approaches on the basis of all available evidence. Although de‐escalation techniques are recommended by a number of guidelines (for example, those of NICE or The American Psychological Association (APA)) for managing aggressive behaviour, there is no standard approach for the technique and little research has been published comparing the effectiveness of different methods, or the effectiveness of de‐escalation training ( Paterson 1997 ).\n\n【20】Improved staff morale and confidence have been reported as potential benefits of de‐escalation training ( Cowin 2003 ), but evidence of impact on staff outcomes is currently unclear. Alternatives to physical intervention are associated with reduced risk of injury for both staff and patients ( Hill 1987 ; Johnson 2012 ), but the relative effectiveness of different approaches to de‐escalation in terms of both staff and patient outcomes is also unclear. Therefore, there is a need to systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of de‐escalation in managing aggression. A Cochrane review that aims to evaluate de‐escalation techniques for psychosis‐induced aggression is currently in preparation ( Rao 2012 ). We propose a companion and complementary review that will evaluate techniques for people without psychosis.\n\n【21】Objectives\n----------\n\n【22】To evaluate the effectiveness of de‐escalation techniques for staff and service users in the management of non‐psychosis‐induced aggression in adults.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【25】#### Types of studies\n\n【26】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (defined as trials where participants are allocated to study groups using, for example, date of birth or alternate allocation).\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】Adults (≥ 18 years) in any care setting, who use threatening or aggressive behaviour.\n\n【29】##### Excluded\n\n【30】Service users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder ( APA 2013 ). This will exclude people with psychosis‐induced aggression, which is covered by a separate Cochrane Review ( Rao 2012 ).\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】##### Experimental intervention\n\n【33】Any de‐escalation technique, as defined above.\n\n【34】##### Control intervention\n\n【35】Standard practice (including rapid tranquillisation, physical intervention, seclusion) or an alternate de‐escalation technique.\n\n【36】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【37】Effects of de‐escalation may range from a few minutes to several hours. The distinction between successful de‐escalation of the primary aggressive event and subsequent events may be complex, and therefore we will collect outcome data at a range of follow‐up points that will best reflect the available evidence from included studies.\n\n【38】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【39】1.  Frequency of aggression‐related serious untoward incidents (including mortality), leading to physical restraint or seclusion, or both: recorded in staff reports or routinely collected data.\n    \n2.  Frequency of aggression‐related injuries to staff: recorded in staff reports or routinely collected data such as untoward incident forms.\n    \n\n【40】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【41】1.  Length of stay in seclusion: recorded in staff reports or routinely collected data such as untoward incident forms.\n    \n2.  Validated (psychometric publication of scale properties; Streiner 2014 ; Zumbo 2007 ) generic or condition‐specific quality of life scales (for example, Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF‐36; Ware 1992 ) or De‐escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (DABS; Nau 2009b )), or both.\n    \n3.  Staff absenteeism: based on administrative data.\n    \n4.  Costs of care; cost‐benefit, cost‐effectiveness: for example, monetary benefit or quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs).\n    \n\n【42】We will prioritise outcomes based on formally or routinely collected data such as untoward incident or adverse event forms.\n\n【43】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【44】#### Electronic searches\n\n【45】We will search Ovid MEDLINE using the strategy in Appendix 1 , and adapt it for use in other sources. We will not apply any language restrictions or time period limitations to the searches. We will search the following databases.\n\n【46】1.

We will contact authors of identified trials and authorities in the field in order to locate other published and unpublished studies\n\n【49】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【50】#### Selection of studies\n\n【51】Two authors (PJ, SS) will independently assess the titles and abstracts of all retrieved trials. The same authors will then examine the full text of papers identified as relevant to determine inclusion in the review. We will resolve disagreements about eligibility and inclusion by discussion until consensus is reached.\n\n【52】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【53】SS and PJ will independently read and extract data from the included studies using a form based on the predefined outcome measures. We will contact study authors for information on missing data or further information about the trial. We will systematically record information on study design, participants, intervention, outcomes, methods, results, and study withdrawals in the 'Characteristics of included studies' tables. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion until consensus is reached.\n\n【54】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【55】SS and PJ will independently assess the quality of each included study using the risk of bias criteria described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ). Risk of bias will be rated as high, low or unclear across the domains below. We will resolve disagreements by discussion until a consensus is reached. The results will be tabulated in a 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【56】##### Random sequence generation\n\n【57】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate sequence generation using, for example, random number tables, coin toss, drawing lots, dice throw.\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate sequence generation using a non‐random method of allocation (for example, date of birth, hospital admission date or clinic number).\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on sequence generation not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【58】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【59】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate concealment (for example, central allocation method such as telephone or web‐based randomisation, or sealed opaque envelopes).\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate concealment of allocation (for example, open list of numbers, envelopes without concealed contents, or dates of birth).\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on allocation of randomisation not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【60】##### Blinding of participants and personnel\n\n【61】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate where study participants and personnel are blinded to allocated interventions or where authors judge that study outcomes will not be influenced by lack of blinding.\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate where study outcomes are likely to be influenced by lack of blinding or incomplete blinding.\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on blinding not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【62】##### Blinding of outcome assessment\n\n【63】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate where study participants and personnel are blinded to outcome assessment or where authors judge that outcome measures will not be influenced by lack of blinding.\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate where measurement of outcomes is not blinded and may be influenced by lack of blinding.\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on blinding of outcome assessment not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【64】##### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【65】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate (for example, no missing data, missing data unrelated to true outcome (for example, survival data) or balanced across study groups; reasons for missing data similar across groups; appropriate imputation (for example, uncertainty taken into account)).\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate (for example, missing data may be related to true outcome (missing not at random); reasons for missing data or missing proportions differ between groups; inappropriate imputation (for example, high proportion of data imputed using last observation carried forward)).\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on incomplete outcome data not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【66】##### Selective reporting\n\n【67】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate (for example, it is clear that all pre‐specified or expected study outcomes have been reported consistently).\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate (for example, not all pre‐specified outcomes reported, primary outcomes reported that were not pre‐specified, or outcome reported using methods not pre‐specified).\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: information on outcome reporting not given or unclear.\n    \n\n【68】##### Other bias\n\n【69】1.  Low risk of bias: adequate where no other sources of bias are identified.\n    \n2.  High risk of bias: inadequate where other important sources of bias are identified such as an inappropriate study design.\n    \n3.  Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information on which to evaluate risk of other bias.\n    \n\n【70】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【71】##### Continuous data\n\n【72】We will estimate the intervention effect using the mean difference (MD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). If standard deviations (SD) are not reported but other measures of variance around mean differences, such as standard error, CIs, or P value are reported, we will calculate these according to Section 7.3 in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ).\n\n【73】In this review it is likely that different scales may be used to measure the same outcome (for example, level of aggression). In this case, we will use the standardised mean difference (SMD) and its 95% CI, ensuring a consistent direction of effect by reversing scaling where necessary, supported by a statement in the text on direction of interpretation. Where studies use the same outcome measure, we will use the mean difference (MD).\n\n【74】##### Binary data\n\n【75】For dichotomous data, we will use risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs.\n\n【76】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【77】##### Cross‐over trials\n\n【78】We will only use data from the first pre‐cross‐over phase to minimise potential bias from carry‐over effects.\n\n【79】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【80】These will be analysed in accordance with methods described in Section 16.3 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ), using the average cluster size and an estimate of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to adjust sample sizes to the 'effective sample size'. Where an estimate of the ICC is not available from the trial we will use an estimate from a similar trial or a trial with a similar population. We will combine single RCTs with cluster‐RCTs if the designs and interventions are considered sufficiently similar and the effect of the intervention is unlikely to be influenced by the method of randomisation.\n\n【81】##### Multiple arm trials\n\n【82】For trials with more than two arms, we will describe all study groups in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table, but we will only include in the analysis the intervention groups that meet our review criteria. Where the variance of the difference between the intervention and the comparator is not reported, we will calculate this from the variances of all trial arms.\n\n【83】Where a study compares multiple relevant interventions groups to one eligible control group, we will divide the sample size for the shared comparator group evenly, in order to prevent the same participants from being included twice. Where a study compares one eligible intervention group to two or more distinct but eligible control groups, we will combine the groups to create a single pairwise control comparison ( Higgins 2011b ). For dichotomous outcomes, both the sample sizes and the numbers of people with events will be summed across groups; and for continuous or time‐to‐event outcomes, means and SDs will be combined using methods described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ). If this prevents identification of potential heterogeneity, we will compare each group separately as part of subgroup analyses. Decisions made concerning unit of analysis issues will be reported in the review.\n\n【84】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【85】We will contact all authors of included studies to provide any unreported data such as missing outcomes, missing data, means or SDs. We will note differential dropout between study groups and note reasons for withdrawal. Where a particular outcome includes substantial loss to follow‐up (50%), we will report this in the text and mark the data with an asterisk. We will also note differential missing data and reasons for missing data, where reported. We will use available cases for data analysis and we will not impute missing data. Where trials include analyses based on the imputation of missing values, we will include data at low risk of bias and report data separately for those at higher risk of bias in the text of the review. Multiple imputation methods that include sensitivity analyses, pre‐specified in published protocols, are considered at low risk of bias ( Gewandter 2014 ; Little 2012 ).\n\n【86】Where missing data are related to the outcome it is not considered appropriate to impute data using carry‐forward methods such as last observation carried forward or baseline observation carried forward; for example, if a participant dies due to an intervention‐related adverse event shortly after randomisation, it would not be appropriate to carry over the baseline data in order to complete missing data ( Gewandter 2014 ). Where studies report per protocol data (that is, only those who completed the study), we will contact the authors for unreported data on all study participants, including those lost to follow‐up. Missing data will be described in the 'Risk of Bias' table and its influence on study outcomes discussed in the text. If there are sufficient trials, we will use sensitivity analyses to determine the resistance of our results to the effects of missing data (see Sensitivity analysis ).\n\n【87】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【88】In this review, it is likely that there will be considerable variability between studies in terms of the specification of the intervention, the study design and the outcomes. The variability may be a consequence of clinical variation in the population or the intervention, differences in study quality, or random differences. We will assess potential sources of variability between studies in the following ways.\n\n【89】1.  Clinical variability: we will compare the distribution of participants, interventions, and outcomes across the included studies. In particular, we will look at the distribution of trials that only include people with cognitive impairment (such as dementia), as potential sources of variability. We will discuss and agree potential clinical heterogeneity by consensus.\n    \n2.  Methodological variability: we will compare study designs and study quality using risk of bias criteria.\n    \n3.  Statistical heterogeneity (where variability in the effects of interventions is greater than expected by chance alone): we will evaluate the statistical significance of heterogeneity using the Chi² test (P ≤ 0.10 significant). However, this test may be unreliable, lacking power to detect important heterogeneity with few or small studies and the potential to detect clinically insignificant heterogeneity with large numbers of studies. It is also possible for trials to show large consistent effects in the face of significant heterogeneity. Therefore, in addition to assessing the strength of evidence for heterogeneity using the Chi² test as above, we will also quantify the magnitude of heterogeneity using the Ƭ² (random‐effects model only), and I² statistics with the following interpretation thresholds, based on recommendations in Section 9.5 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ):\n    \n    1.  0% to 40%: might not be important;\n        \n    2.  30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;\n        \n    3.  50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; and\n        \n    4.  75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.\n        \n\n【90】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【91】We will compare the results of data from published and unpublished studies as a direct test of publication bias. If there are a sufficient number of studies (approximately 10 or more), we will explore potential bias arising from small study effects using Egger’s method, to test for asymmetry in funnel plots ( Egger 1997 ). If smaller studies show larger intervention effects compared to larger studies, we will evaluate potential causes (for example, poor methodological quality; differences in populations or interventions) and report studies at high risk of bias in the text of the review. If​ small study effects are detected, we will explore if this is a genuine finding due to heterogeneity (small studies give larger effects because they differ from large ones in some aspect that modifies the effect of the intervention) or if this is because of poor quality, publication bias etc. ​\n\n【92】#### Data synthesis\n\n【93】We will undertake separate meta‐analyses for the comparisons of interest in this review (de‐escalation versus physical intervention; de‐escalation method X versus de‐escalation method Y).\n\n【94】Studies will be included in meta‐analyses where the study designs, interventions and outcomes are similar. Where substantial heterogeneity (> 50%; Higgins 2011a ) is identified we will report outcomes in the text, giving direction and size of the effect along with strength of the evidence (risk of bias). It is likely that included studies will vary in their population, design and outcomes, and therefore data synthesis using meta‐analysis with a random‐effects model would be most appropriate. However, where there are few studies or the effects of interventions across studies are not randomly distributed (for example, with publication bias), the random‐effects model estimates may be unreliable or biased. It is likely that this review will only include a small number of low‐powered studies, where meta‐analysis with a fixed‐effect model would give more reliable estimates. To resolve the uncertainty over model choice we will (a) only pool data using meta‐analysis where studies appear sufficiently similar (for example, all dementia populations or all learning disability), and (b) compare pooled data estimates from both a random‐effects model and a fixed‐effect model, reporting both in the text. We will report the mean effect estimate and the CI around the estimate for both models. We will synthesise and report dichotomous and continuous data separately for a given outcome, should the need arise. Where end‐of‐study point estimates and change from baseline scores are reported we will analyse these separately. We will perform the analyses using Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5 ( Review Manager 2014 )\n\n【95】The results of analyses of head‐to‐head comparisons of de‐escalation techniques will be interpreted tentatively in the absence of data from trials comparing de‐escalation techniques versus physical intervention.\n\n【96】##### Summary of Findings\n\n【97】We will report the primary outcomes, and the following secondary outcomes, in a 'Summary of findings' table for each intervention comparison: frequency of aggression‐related serious untoward incidents, frequency of aggression‐related injuries to staff, and validated quality of life scales. The table will also report the quality of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which considers within‐study risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates, and risks of publication bias ( GRADE 2004 ). We will tabulate the summary of findings using GRADEpro software ( GRADEPro GDT 2015 ).\n\n【98】The GRADE Working Group grades of evidence are as follows:\n\n【99】1.  High quality: further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect;\n    \n2.  Moderate quality: further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;\n    \n3.  Low quality: further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; and\n    \n4.  Very low quality: we are very uncertain about the estimate.\n    \n\n【100】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【101】##### Subgroup analyses\n\n【102】Where there are a sufficient number of trials (≥ 10; Section 9.6.5.1, Higgins 2011a ), we will conduct subgroup analyses by:\n\n【103】1.  Staff training (trained versus untrained staff).\n    \n\n【104】##### Investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【105】We will manage potential sources of heterogeneity as follows:\n\n【106】1.  Check data integrity, including measures of effect and units of analysis;\n    \n2.  Explore the impact of subgroups (for example, small versus large studies); and\n    \n3.  Exclude outliers where there is a clear reason for exclusion such as markedly different intervention effect estimates or clear population differences (for example, dementia or learning disability). We will visually inspect forest plots and iteratively remove outlying studies to determine whether homogeneity is restored.\n    \n\n【107】We will fully discuss and report our decisions in the review.\n\n【108】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【109】We will perform sensitivity analyses for missing data, and for risk of bias based on random sequence generation, blinding of participants and incomplete outcome data by including and excluding studies at high risk of bias and comparing the results.\n\n【110】Although little data are available on the measurement of outcomes following de‐escalation of aggressive episodes, it is plausible that outcomes may vary by duration of follow‐up. Therefore, we will explore potential heterogeneity between studies according to length of follow‐up (that is, all studies versus excluding the longest studies).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A random‐effects model was used.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Twelve trials (total of 6814 women) were included. Planned management was generally induction with oxytocin or prostaglandin, with one trial using homoeopathic caulophyllum. Overall, no differences were detected for mode of birth between planned and expectant groups: relative risk (RR) of caesarean section 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.08 (12 trials, 6814 women); RR of operative vaginal birth 0.98, 95% 0.84 to 1.16 (7 trials, 5511 women). Significantly fewer women in the planned compared with expectant management groups had chorioamnionitis (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.97; 9 trials, 6611 women) or endometritis (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.74; 4 trials, 445 women). No difference was seen for neonatal infection (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12; 9 trials, 6406 infants). However, fewer infants under planned management went to neonatal intensive or special care compared with expectant management (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92, number needed to treat 20; 5 trials, 5679 infants). In a single trial, significantly more women with planned management viewed their care more positively than those expectantly managed (RR of \"nothing liked\" 0.45, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.54; 5031 women).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Planned management (with methods such as oxytocin or prostaglandin) reduces the risk of some maternal infectious morbidity without increasing caesarean sections and operative vaginal births. Fewer infants went to neonatal intensive care under planned management although no differences were seen in neonatal infection rates. Since planned and expectant management may not be very different, women need to have appropriate information to make informed choices.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (7)\n\n【20】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Term Pregnancy\n*   Premature Rupture Of Membranes\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【22】*   Cesarean Section\n*   Induction Of Labor\n\n【23】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【24】*   Expectant Management\n\n【25】###### Outcome (7)\n\n【26】*   Cesarean Section\n*   Chorioamnionitis\n*   Stillbirth\n*   Death\n*   Neonatal Death\n*   Endometritis\n*   Sepsis Of The Newborn\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Interventions during the resuscitation phase and treatment within the first hours after the event are critical for a favourable prognosis. Experimental evidence suggests that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial, and several clinical studies on this topic have been published. This review was originally published in 2009; updated versions were published in 2012 and 2016.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To evaluate the benefits and harms of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest in adults compared to standard treatment.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 30 September 2022.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults comparing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest with standard treatment (control). We included studies with adults cooled by any method, applied within six hours of cardiac arrest, to target body temperatures of 32 °C to 34 °C. Good neurological outcome was defined as no or only minor brain damage allowing people to live an independent life.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. neurological recovery. Our secondary outcomes were 2. survival to hospital discharge, 3. quality of life, 4. cost‐effectiveness and 5. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess certainty.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We found 12 studies with 3956 participants reporting the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on neurological outcome or survival. There were some concerns about the quality of all the studies, and two studies had high risk of bias overall. When we compared conventional cooling methods versus any type of standard treatment (including a body temperature of 36 °C), we found that participants in the therapeutic hypothermia group were more likely to reach a favourable neurological outcome (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.76; 11 studies, 3914 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.\n\n【15】When we compared therapeutic hypothermia with fever prevention or no cooling, we found that participants in the therapeutic hypothermia group were more likely to reach a favourable neurological outcome (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 8 studies, 2870 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.\n\n【16】When we compared therapeutic hypothermia methods with temperature management at 36 °C, there was no evidence of a difference between groups (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.53; 3 studies; 1044 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low.\n\n【17】Across all studies, the incidence of pneumonia, hypokalaemia and severe arrhythmia was increased amongst participants receiving therapeutic hypothermia (pneumonia: RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18; 4 trials, 3634 participants; hypokalaemia: RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.84; 2 trials, 975 participants; severe arrhythmia: RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.64; 3 trials, 2163 participants). The certainty of the evidence was low (pneumonia, severe arrhythmia) to very low (hypokalaemia). There were no differences in other reported adverse events between groups.\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】Current evidence suggests that conventional cooling methods to induce therapeutic hypothermia may improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. We obtained available evidence from studies in which the target temperature was 32 °C to 34 °C.\n\n【20】PICOs\n-----\n\n【21】### PICOs\n\n【22】###### Population (6)\n\n【23】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Cardiac Arrest With Successful Resuscitation\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【24】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【25】*   Hypothermia Treatment\n\n【26】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【27】*   Usual Care\n\n【28】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【29】*   Pneumonia\n*   Hypokalemia\n*   Neurological Finding\n*   Survival\n*   Clinical Improvement\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Current evidence suggests that conventional cooling methods to induce hypothermia (low body temperature) may reduce the risk of brain damage and improve neurological outcomes (problems with the nervous system) following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest.\n\n【38】**What is cardiac arrest?**\n\n【39】Around 30% to 50% of people with coronary heart disease (when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed by a build‐up of fatty material within their walls) have sudden cardiac arrest at some stage of their illness. Sudden cardiac arrest means that the heart stops pumping blood and subsequently, circulation of blood throughout the body stops.\n\n【40】**How is cardiac arrest treated?**\n\n【41】Someone with sudden cardiac arrest needs instant resuscitation to save their life. Resuscitation can be done by people who have no medical training or by healthcare professionals. A variety of techniques can be used, but the first ones are usually to administer chest compressions (pushing hard and frequently on the person's breastbone), rescue breathing techniques (mouth‐to‐mouth resuscitation) and use of a defibrillator that applies electric shocks to the heart to restart it. If people with cardiac arrest are not resuscitated, brain cells begin to be irreversibly damaged, and subsequently, the person dies. After successful resuscitation, treatment within the first few hours is critical to avoid or limit brain damage, and preserve the function and structure of nerve cells in the brain (also called 'neuroprotection'). The symptoms of brain damage vary depending on the severity and duration of the cardiac arrest, as well as the health condition of the person. Symptoms include instant death; coma; paralysis; tremors; difficulty with speech and language; difficulties with thinking, remembering and mental tasks; and body co‐ordination or gait problems. One type of therapy that may help to prevent cell damage consists of cooling the body to 32 °C to 34 °C for several hours after successful resuscitation.\n\n【42】**What did we want to find out?**\n\n【43】We wanted to know whether people resuscitated from cardiac arrest recover better when their bodies are cooled to a temperature of 32 °C to 34 °C.\n\n【44】**What did we do?**\n\n【45】We searched medical databases for well‐designed studies that looked at how well people who had their bodies cooled to 32 °C to 34 °C recovered after resuscitation following a cardiac arrest compared to people who were not cooled or not cooled to less than 36 °C.\n\n【46】**What did we find?**\n\n【47】We included 12 studies (3956 people overall) in our analysis examining the effects of cooling the body after successful resuscitation for cardiac arrest. Eleven studies used conventional cooling methods (for example, cooling pads or ice packs). However, one study used haemofiltration as the cooling method (blood was removed from the body via a tube that passed through a filter to remove toxic substances and a cooling machine before returning to the body – similar to dialysis), so their data could not be summarised with the other studies and were treated separately in the review.\n\n【48】**Key results**\n\n【49】Cooling the body after successful resuscitation may reduce the risk of brain damage and improve neurological outcomes. When we compared people whose bodies were cooled to 32 °C to 34 °C after resuscitation versus those whose bodies were not cooled, we found that 532 per 1000 of those receiving cooling would have no, or only minor, brain damage, while only 377 per 1000 not receiving cooling would have no, or only minor, brain damage. Cooling had no effect on survival. Cooling the body was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs) (384 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 352 per 1000 people who had no cooling), increased risk of low concentrations of blood potassium (185 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 134 per 1000 people who had no cooling) and an increased risk for irregular heartbeats (257 per 1000 people who had cooling versus 184 per 1000 people who had no cooling). Only a few studies looked at these treatable complications.\n\n【50】**What are the limitations of the evidence?**\n\n【51】Some studies had quality shortcomings including a lack of information on how these studies were carried out and the use of inadequate methods to balance participants between cooling and no cooling groups. However, when we accounted for differences between studies, it became clear that these shortcomings had only a minor impact on the main results, and they did not change the overall findings.\n\n【52】**Study funding sources**\n\n【53】A dialysis‐related company funded the study that used external cooling. Of the remaining 11 studies included in the main analysis, five received funding from government or non‐profit organisations; two received analysing kits from a company unrelated to cooling and four studies did not provide information on funding.\n\n【54】**How up to date is this evidence?**\n\n【55】Evidence is current to September 2022.\n\n【56】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【57】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of implementation tools developed and disseminated by guideline producers, which accompany or follow the publication of a CPG, to promote uptake.\n\n【3】A secondary objective is to determine which approaches to guideline implementation are most effective.\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are inconsistently used despite their potential to improve the quality of health care and patient outcomes ( Grol 2003 ; Schuster 1998 ; Seddon 2001 ). A variety of tools to improve the uptake of CPGs have been developed, but not always by the guideline producers themselves. This review focuses on the effectiveness of tools developed and disseminated by guideline producers to improve the uptake of CPGs, of which to date little is known. These tools are either embedded within a guideline, for example tailoring a guideline recommendation for a particular user group, or they accompany the CPG, for example interactive learning modules developed to support the use of a CPG.\n\n【7】### Description of the condition\n\n【8】CPGs have the potential to improve health care delivery and outcomes, but the adoption of guidelines by healthcare professionals and health system managers is inconsistent and gaps remain between recommended care and clinical practice. Previous systematic reviews have identified a range of interventions to support the implementation of guidelines ( Grimshaw 2004 ). However, most of these have been developed independently of the producers of guidelines. In response to this some guideline producers have developed tools to improve the uptake of their CPGs. Some of these interventions focus on improving the skills needed to apply evidence to practice and others are aimed at integrating the content of a CPG into a local healthcare system. The value of these tools has been questioned by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as they are an additional investment for the guideline producer, and the evidence of the effectiveness of this approach is uncertain.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Interventions developed and disseminated by guideline producers to improve the consistent use of CPGs by health professionals and health system managers include learning modules, which may be accredited with Continuing Medical Education (CME) points, education outreach visits (for example, academic detailing), communication tools (for example, press releases following the publication of CPGs) or tailored formatting (for example, the wording of recommendations adapted for a target audience or local health system). Learning modules are a popular approach to supporting the use of CPGs, for example NICE has developed a range of online educational tools ( NICE 2012b ) in collaboration with BMJ Learning, the _Nursing Times_ and e‐Learning for Health (for example the eVTE online educational tool to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism). The goal is to enable users of CPGs to be more aware of recent evidence as summarised in the relevant NICE guidance and to apply the newly acquired knowledge in their practice and address any potential barriers. Examples of CPG producers working within health systems to improve the uptake of their CPGs include: NICE working within the National Health Service (NHS) by providing commissioners with benchmarking tools ( NICE 2012 ); the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) which provides problem‐based small group learning modules ( SIGN 2012 ); the American College of Cardiology running the Guidelines in Practice (GAP) project and providing customised, guideline‐specific implementation tools ( ACC 2010 ; Metha 2002 ); the Veterans Health Administration adapting their CPGs for colorectal screening to local health organisations; Kaiser Permanente's healthcare system which has developed and implemented their Proactive Officer Encounter Programme to provide clinical decision support to increase the uptake of their own and other CPGs ( Kanter 2010 ); and the National Prescribing Centre in the UK that set up the 'communities of practice' (the NHS Medicines and prescribing communities of practice). Data from NHS Evidence show that 92% (33/36) of guideline producers submitting their CPGs for accreditation by NHS Evidence publish support tools intended to aid implementation of their guidance ( NHS 2012 ). Many guideline producers are working on transforming their narrative CPGs into electronic format as this may improve uptake through the implementation of CPGs in computer‐based decision‐support systems ( Peleg 2010 ).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Producers of CPGs who develop implementation interventions to support their use have focused on the information needs of different user groups. Interventions are aimed at improving awareness of CPGs, strengthening the skills needed to understand and implement a CPG, and supporting the use of a CPG within the context of a local healthcare system ( Greenhalgh 2005 ). Tailoring the implementation of interventions to facilitate practice change (to promote a CPG) typically involves identification of the determinants of healthcare practice. This can include discussions with healthcare professionals about potential barriers and systems requiring change ( Baker 2010 ), identification of ways to facilitate change and designing, applying and assessing appropriate interventions ( Wensing 2011 ). The Guideline Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) instrument may be used by producers of guidelines to identify barriers to implementation during the design phase of a CPG and enable modifications prior to publication ( Shiffman 2005 ). For example, templates may be developed for users of CPGs to populate with local data in order to assess the applicability and impact of a CPG. The tailoring process is also important in engaging clinicians in the implementation process ( Horbar 2004 ; Titler 2009 ). Findings from a recent survey of more than 300 NHS commissioning staff, who use CPGs to guide decision‐making, confirm the importance of these approaches. Local public health intelligence, expert advice and examples of best practice appear to be the most sought after types of evidence, and in order for knowledge to be used it had to be translated into a practical resource ( Gkeredakis 2011 ). Finally, if a guideline producer has authority and works within the health system, or is perceived to be influential, the uptake of CPGs may be improved ( Rogers 1995 ).\n\n【13】Other determinants of the effective implementation of all CPGs are that they are clearly written, specific to a population and context, easy to use and that there is research evidence of its effectiveness for a particular end‐user's work context ( Titler 2001 ). Guideline development is usually carried out by a multidisciplinary, nationally representative group, who conduct a systematic review to identify and critically appraise the evidence, and who ensure that the guideline recommendations are explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. Producers of guidelines can also use the AGREE tool by which the quality of a guideline may be evaluated, thus allowing end‐users to decide how well a guideline has been developed and whether it will be applicable to the setting they are working in ( AGREE 2010 ).\n\n【14】The format used to communicate the content of a CPG can also influence its adoption ( Greenhalgh 2005 ; Rogers 1995 ). While CPGs are frequently written as text documents ( Peleg 2010 ), studies have shown that clinicians usually do not use written guidelines during the actual care process ( Wang 2002 ). Instead, patient‐specific advice, particularly if delivered during patient encounters, is suggested to be more effective in changing clinician behaviour ( Shea 1996 ). Thus, implementing guidelines in computer‐based decision support systems may improve the acceptance and application of guidelines in daily practice, particularly if the actions and observations of healthcare workers are monitored and advice is generated whenever a guideline is not followed ( Wang 2002 ). One example of guideline producers who have provided healthcare professionals with clinical decision support to increase the uptake of CPGs is the Kaiser Permanente healthcare system with their Proactive Officer Encounter Programme ( Kanter 2010 ).\n\n【15】Gagliardi et al identified eight features of CPGs that are desired by users of CPGs, or are associated with their use: 1) usability: the structure of the CPG has been modified to facilitate access, for example by providing a one page summary of the recommendations; 2) adaptability: the CPG is available in different formats for different users or purposes, for example print and electronic format, versions of the CPG are available for patients and caregivers; 3) validity: using a standardised system to grade the quality of evidence supporting each recommendation, for example GRADE; 4) applicability: the wording of the CPG recommendation has been tailored for different target audiences to support application of the guidance to local circumstances; this may include clinical and contextual information; 5) communicability: information to supplement the CPG, for example educational resources for patients and information to support patient involvement; 6) accommodation: the addition of information on costs and resources, for example the costing templates provided by NICE, and information on competencies and training required to implement the recommendations; 7) implementation: information on potential barriers and strategies for facilitating implementation, for example a clinical assessment using a point of care template; and 8) evaluation: performance measures or quality indicators for audit and monitoring ( Gagliardi 2011 ).\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】CPGs can improve healthcare delivery and outcomes but the adoption of guidelines by clinicians and healthcare managers is inconsistent. Previous Cochrane systematic reviews have described the effectiveness of a range of interventions to support the implementation of guidelines ( Akl 2009 ; Flodgren 2010 ; Forsetlund 2009 ; Giguère 2012 ; Grilli 2002 ; Jamtvedt 2006 ; O'Brien 2007 ; Shojania 2009 ). However, most of these have been developed independently of the producers of guidelines. Responding to continued concern about the inconsistent use of CPGs some national guideline producers have developed and implemented tools to support the uptake of their CPGs. This is an additional investment for the guideline producer and the effectiveness of this approach is not known. The focus of this review is to assess the effectiveness of implementation tools, developed and disseminated by guideline producers, on the uptake of their guidelines. These tools may require changes to the presentation of the CPG (e.g. tailoring of a CPG), be or published alongside CPGs (e.g. online learning modules).\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To evaluate the effectiveness of implementation tools developed and disseminated by guideline producers, which accompany or follow the publication of a CPG, to promote uptake.\n\n【20】A secondary objective is to determine which approaches to guideline implementation are most effective.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) (with at least two intervention and two control sites) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) (with at least three data points before and three after the intervention).\n\n【25】We will not include CBAs and ITSs to test the effectiveness of interventions that accompany the release of a CPG as the comparator would be 'no CPG intervention'; our comparison is CPG alone.\n\n【26】#### Types of participants\n\n【27】We will include all qualified healthcare professionals and health system managers and policy makers.\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】We will include interventions developed by producers of CPGs to improve implementation. Guidelines may be produced for a health system, a group of healthcare professionals, a country, state or province. Interventions to improve the implementation of these CPGs may be distributed to organisations but targeted at individuals within the organisation, or they may be targeted at organisations. We will use the definition of a CPG developed by the US Institute of Medicine: 'clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances' ( Field 1990 ). We will use the EPOC taxonomy ( EPOC 2009 ) to guide the grouping of interventions. The EPOC taxonomy groups interventions by those targeting i) the healthcare professional (e.g. distribution of educational material; reminders in the form of computer‐aided decision support; ii) the patient (e.g. writing a version of the clinical guidance for the public); and iii) the organisation of care (e.g. strengthening the skills needed to understand and implement a CPG, costing templates for organisations to assess the resource implications of implementing guidelines etc.)\n\n【30】##### 1\\. Tools targeting the healthcare professional\n\n【31】###### i) Tailoring\n\n【32】*   Tailoring of CPGs for different users (to improve usability and applicability: examples include using different wording, varying the content, incorporating case studies of patients' experiences in the form of vignettes or narratives which contextualise the recommendations.\n    \n*   Different CPG formats adapted for different users/purposes, e.g. electronic (for use on a PDA), paper, multi‐media versions, summaries, the inclusion of algorithms.\n    \n\n【33】###### ii) Education\n\n【34】*   Learning modules (to include interactive learning modules) which may be accredited with Continuing Medical Education (CME) points, or to support the use of audit by junior doctors.\n    \n*   Instructions/templates, e.g. instructions, tools or templates to tailor guidelines/recommendations for local context (may also be used at the organisational level); point of care templates/forms (clinical assessment, standard orders).\n    \n*   Decision support systems, e.g. electronic guidelines with built‐in decision support systems.\n    \n\n【35】##### 2\\. Tools targeting the patient\n\n【36】*   Producing versions of CPG recommendations for the public to improve provider‐patient communication about guideline recommendations.\n    \n\n【37】##### 3\\. Tools targeting the organisation of care\n\n【38】*   Benchmarking tools, e.g. measures of gaps in performance to be used by those monitoring the implementation of CPGs (may also be used by individual healthcare professionals).\n    \n*   Costing templates as a budgetary aid (may also be used by individual healthcare professionals) to assess the resources required to implement the CPG.\n    \n*   Programme evaluation, audit tools, performance measures and quality indicators to evaluate the implementation of the CPG.\n    \n\n【39】##### 4\\. Mass media interventions\n\n【40】*   Press releases following the publication of a CPG.\n    \n\n【41】The comparisons will be as follows:\n\n【42】1.  Tools developed by a guideline producer versus a tool developed by another organisation or a guideline user (i.e. tools developed independently of the CPG producer).\n    \n2.  Tools developed by a guideline producer versus no intervention (i.e. CPGs alone).\n    \n\n【43】We will exclude the following types of studies/interventions:\n\n【44】1.  Studies describing tools developed by guideline producers to improve guideline uptake without providing objective measurements of the effect of these interventions on professional practice or patient outcomes.\n    \n2.  Surveys of barriers/facilitators to the uptake of guidelines.\n    \n\n【45】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【46】We will include studies reporting the following outcome measures:\n\n【47】##### Main outcomes\n\n【48】Objective measures of healthcare professional performance, healthcare resources or patient outcomes.\n\n【49】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【50】Self reported measures of healthcare professional performance and healthcare manager performance including knowledge or use of CPGs, and costs.\n\n【51】We will exclude studies that only include self reported outcomes.\n\n【52】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【53】#### Electronic searches\n\n【54】A search strategy for MEDLINE has been written by information technologist Nia Roberts (NR) in consultation with the review authors. NR will search the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related systematic reviews and the following databases for primary studies.\n\n【55】*   Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register, Reference Manager\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ ), Wiley \\[Search date\\]\n    \n*   NHS Economic Evaluation Database, HTA Database ( _The Cochrane Library_ ), Wiley \\[Search date\\]\n    \n*   MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process and other non‐indexed citations, OvidSP \\[1946 ‐ present\\]\n    \n*   EMBASE, OvidSP \\[1974 ‐ present\\]\n    \n*   PsycINFO, OVIDSP \\[1967 ‐ present\\]\n    \n*   CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), EbscoHost \\[1982 ‐ present\\]\n    \n*   Dissertations and Theses, ProQuest \\[Search date\\]\n    \n*   Index to Theses \\[Search date\\]\n    \n*   Science Citation Index Expanded, ISI Web of Knowledge \\[1945 ‐ present\\]\n    \n*   Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science, ISI Web of Knowledge \\[1990\\]\n    \n*   Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), NHS Evidence \\[1979 ‐ March 2013\\]\n    \n\n【56】The MEDLINE search strategy ( Appendix 1 ) will be translated for other databases using appropriate syntax and vocabulary for those databases. The strategy includes Medical Subject Headings and synonyms for guidelines and implementation. Results will be limited by two methodological filters: the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (sensitivity‐ and precision‐maximising version, 2008 revision) to identify randomised trials, and an EPOC methodology filter to identify non‐RCT designs. There will be no language restrictions and studies will be included regardless of publication status.\n\n【57】#### Searching other resources\n\n【58】We will search the following additional sources:\n\n【59】##### Grey literature\n\n【60】We will conduct a grey literature search to identify studies not indexed in the databases listed above. Sources will include the sites listed in Appendix 2 . We will document additional sources, if any, in the review.\n\n【61】##### Trial registries\n\n【62】We will search the following registries:\n\n【63】*   International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Word Health Organization (WHO) ( http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/ )\n    \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov, US National Institutes of Health (NIH) ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ )\n    \n\n【64】We will also:\n\n【65】*   review reference lists of all included studies, relevant systematic reviews/primary studies/other publications;\n    \n*   contact authors of relevant studies or reviews to clarify reported published information/seek unpublished results/data;\n    \n*   contact researchers with expertise relevant to the review topic/EPOC interventions, as well as guideline‐producing bodies regarding any further published or unpublished research;\n    \n*   conduct cited reference searches for all included studies in ISI Web of Knowledge.\n    \n\n【66】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【67】#### Selection of studies\n\n【68】We will download all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching to the reference management database Endnote and then remove duplicates. Two review authors (GF, SS) will independently examine the remaining references. We will exclude those studies which clearly do not meet the inclusion criteria and obtain copies of the full text of potentially relevant references. Two review authors (GF, SS) will independently assess the eligibility of retrieved papers. We will resolve disagreements by discussion and, if needed, arbitration by a third person.\n\n【69】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【70】Two review authors (GF, SS) will independently extract data from each study into a modified EPOC data extraction form. We will resolve disagreements by discussion and, if needed, arbitration by a third person. We will extract the following information: setting; location; characteristics of healthcare professionals; type of healthcare organisation; intended population of guideline; type and target of intervention; the components of the intervention; the comparison intervention; any information about the time (and resources) needed to implement or use the tool (or both); costs and outcomes reported.\n\n【71】We will also extract data on any collaborative effort between producers and users of guidelines aiming to improve the development of implementation tools (e.g. engagement of individual healthcare professionals or the organisation of care in the development or both; assessment of barriers/facilitators to CPG adoption at the provider level or at the organisational level, or both, or assessment of the healthcare professionals' or the organisation of care's readiness to change.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【73】Two review authors (GF, SS) will independently assess the risk of bias of each included study using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool ( Higgins 2011 ) on six standard criteria: (i) adequate sequence generation; (ii) adequate concealment of allocation; (iii) blinded or objective assessment of primary outcome(s); (iv) adequately addressed incomplete outcome data; (v) free from selective outcome reporting; and (vi) free from other sources of risk of bias. We will use four additional criteria specified by EPOC ( EPOC 2009 ): (vii) similar baseline characteristics; (viii) similar baseline outcome measures; (ix) reliable primary outcome measures; and (x) adequate protection against contamination. For ITS studies we will use the following 'Risk of bias' criteria: a) was the intervention independent of other changes; b) was the shape of the intervention effect pre‐specified; c) was the intervention unlikely to affect data collection?; d) was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study?; e) were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?; f) was the study free from selective outcome reporting?; g) was the study free from other risks of bias? We will resolve disagreements by discussion and, if needed, arbitration by a third person.\n\n【74】We will assign an overall assessment of the risk of bias (high, moderate or low risk of bias) to each of the included studies using the approach suggested in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). Studies with low risk of bias for all key domains or where it seems unlikely for bias to seriously alter the results will be considered to have a low risk of bias. Studies where risk of bias in at least one domain was unclear or judged to have some bias that could plausibly raise doubts about the conclusions will be considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Studies with a high risk of bias in at least one domain or judged to have serious bias that decreases the certainty of the conclusions will be considered to have a high risk of bias.\n\n【75】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【76】For each study, we will report data in natural units. Where baseline results are available from RCTs, CCTs and CBAs, we will report pre‐intervention and post‐intervention means or proportions for both study and control groups. We will also calculate the unadjusted and adjusted (for any baseline imbalance) absolute change from baseline with 95% confidence limits.\n\n【77】For ITS studies we will report the main outcomes in natural units and two effect sizes: the change in the level of outcome immediately after the introduction of the intervention and the change in the slopes of the regression lines. Both of these estimates are necessary for interpreting the results of each comparison. For example, there could have been no change in the level immediately after the intervention, but there could have been a significant change in slope. We will also present three‐month, six‐month and yearly postintervention data points if available.\n\n【78】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【79】We will attempt to reanalyse studies with potential unit of analysis errors where possible. If a comparison is reanalysed then we will quote the P value and annotate it with 'reanalysed'. If this is not possible, we will report only the point estimate.\n\n【80】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【81】If primary outcome data are missing, or only imputed data are reported, we will contact trial authors to request data on the outcomes among participants who were assessed. If the authors fail to provide missing data for meta‐analysis, or other summary of results, we will report the results of the study narratively.\n\n【82】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【83】If meta‐analysis is possible, we will explore heterogeneity using forest plots and quantify it using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. The generated forest plots will assist us in interpreting the degree of heterogeneity between studies. We will also assess forest plots by visual examination ( Egger 1997 ; Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【84】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【85】If meta‐analysis is feasible we will examine funnel plots corresponding to meta‐analysis of the primary outcome in order to assess the potential for small study effects, such as publication bias.\n\n【86】#### Data synthesis\n\n【87】We will present the results for all comparisons using a standard method of presentation where possible. For comparisons of RCTs, CCTs and CBAs we will report (separately for each study design): median effect size across included studies; interquartile ranges of effect sizes across included studies; range of effect sizes across included studies.\n\n【88】If we are able to identify a sufficient number of studies during the study selection stage and if these studies are sufficiently homogeneous regarding population, interventions and comparisons, we will calculate a pooled risk ratio, with 95% CIs, for each point estimate, for outcomes reporting dichotomous data. If the same measures of outcome have been used across studies we will calculate the mean difference at follow‐up (with 95% CIs) for outcomes reporting continuous data.\n\n【89】If we include studies using the interrupted time series design we will use the difference in slope and the difference in level pre to post‐intervention in a regression analysis, adjusting for time trends at specific time points (one month, six months, 12 months and yearly thereafter), as previously has been done ( Flodgren 2013 ). If the differences are not available in the primary reports, we will attempt reanalysis using data from graphs or tables.\n\n【90】For studies that are sufficiently homogenous in terms of population, interventions, comparisons and outcomes, we will combine data using a fixed‐effect model. Where there is evidence of heterogeneity in populations or interventions (I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 50%), we will instead apply a random‐effects model. We will perform data synthesis using Review Manager 5 ( Review Manager 2012 ). If we do not find enough homogenous studies for a meta‐analysis, we will report the median of medians of effect sizes across studies, as has previously been done by others ( Grimshaw 2004 ; Shojania 2009 ). In order to handle multiple outcomes within individual studies, we will first calculate the median effect size (and interquartile range) across all outcomes reported in each study, which then would contribute the single effect for that study, and then calculate the median of medians across studies (results for RCTs, CBAs and ITS studies will all be reported separately).\n\n【91】We will use the GRADE tool ( Guyatt 2011 ) and the GRADEpro software ( GRADEpro 2008 ) to assess the quality of evidence of the included studies and present the results for the main outcomes in a 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n【92】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【93】If there are sufficient data we will analyse interventions by the following categories: i) interventions targeting the healthcare professional; ii) interventions targeting the patient; iii) interventions targeting the organisation of care and iv) interventions targeting healthcare professionals, patients and care organisations.\n\n【94】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【95】If there are a sufficient number of studies identified we will perform a sensitivity analysis excluding poor‐quality studies, i.e. studies judged to have a high risk of bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】**Primary objective:** To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients.  \n**Secondary objective:** Highlighting the quality and quantity of research evidence to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Delirium, a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, with rapid onset, fluctuating course and underlying causation, has been variously termed acute organic brain syndrome, acute organic mental disorder and toxic confusional state. Until the 19th century delirium was used to describe a disorder of thinking and later descriptions included disturbances of perception, often with overactive behaviour, or impaired consciousness. DSM‐III ( APA 1987 ) in 1987 brought together these ideas, combining disturbance of consciousness with impairment of cognition and the core features of delirium have been clarified in the DSM‐IV ( APA 1994 ) and ICD‐10 ( WHO 1992 ). This recent consensus allows standardisation of research, and greater comparability between studies.\n\n【6】Delirium is common in hospitalized patients. Ten to 30% of admissions to a general hospital develop delirium ( Levkoff 1991 ; Trzepacz 1996 ). Delirium has a prevalence of up to 60% in frail elderly patients ( Francis 1990 ), and 7 to 9.6% in elderly patients presenting to emergency departments ( Elie 2000 ; Hustey 2003 ). Following coronary artery bypass grafting in the elderly incidence has been reported as 33.6% ( Santos 2004 ), and after bilateral knee replacements 41% ( Williams‐Russo 1992 ). Following hip fracture the overall prevalence is 43 to 61% ( Holmes 2000 ).\n\n【7】Patients in intensive care units are at high risk of developing delirium, with incidence rates of 40% reported ( Roberts 2004 ). Cancer also increases the risk of developing delirium. 18% of those admitted to an oncology ward, and 26 to 44% of those admitted to hospital or a hospice with a diagnosis of advanced cancer developed delirium ( Centeno 2004 ; Ljubisavljevic 2003 ). In AIDS patients who are unwell enough to be admitted, incidence of delirium is also high, being reported as 46% ( Uldall 1997 ).\n\n【8】Delirium is serious, with significant short and long term outcomes. Death rates are increased ( McCusker 2002 ), functional abilities reduced ( Moller 1998 ), admission to long‐term care increased ( Inouye 1998a ), and length of stay increased ( McCusker 2003a ; Stevens 1998 ). Impairment of cognitive function can persist for at least one year ( McCusker 2001 ), as can the symptoms of delirium, especially inattention, disorientation and impaired memory ( McCusker 2003b ). Increasingly recognised is the distress an episode of delirium produces in the carers of patients with delirium ( Breitbart 2002 ).\n\n【9】Research in the elderly has identified a multitude of risk factors for the development of delirium. Delirium clearly has a multi‐factorial aetiology, and these risk factors interact ( Inouye 1998b ). The more risk factors that are present, the greater the likelihood of that patient developing delirium. Risk factors that have so far been identified include: increased age, sensory deprivation (visual or hearing impairment), sleep deprivation, social isolation, physical restraint, use of bladder catheter, iatrogenic adverse events, poly‐pharmacy (more than three new medications added), use of psychoactive drugs, co‐morbidities, severe illness (especially: infection, fracture, stroke), prior cognitive impairment, temperature abnormality, (fever or hypothermia), dehydration, malnutrition, and low serum albumin ( Inouye 1998b ; Inouye 1999c ).\n\n【10】Studies in oncology patients have identified different risk factors for the development of delirium, for example bone metastases, the presence of haematological malignancy, advanced age, cognitive impairment, and low albumin level ( Ljubisavljevic 2003 ).\n\n【11】The identification of such a varied list of risk factors for delirium suggests several things. Firstly, we may be able to identify patients at high risk of developing delirium, and by modifying these risk factors could attempt to prevent it; differing groups of patients may require a different set of preventative measures. Secondly, many of these risk factors can be seen as hospital quality of care measures, e.g. malnutrition, dehydration, use of physical restraints, iatrogenic events, and therefore occurrence of delirium can be seen as a proxy measure of quality of in‐patient care ( Inouye 1999b ).\n\n【12】Prevention of delirium is obviously desirable, both from the patients' and carers' points of view, and to reduce health service costs. A recent study found that the health care costs in patients who developed delirium whilst in intensive care units were 31% higher ($41,836 versus $27,106) ( Milbrandt 2004 ). A multi‐component intervention study showed a reduction in delirium incidence with no increase in health care costs, resulting in overall improved cost‐effectiveness ( Rizzo 2001 ).\n\n【13】Possible interventions for preventing the development of delirium in hospitalized patients have been developed. Most of the current studies have taken a multi‐factorial approach, looking at preventing many risk factors by protocols, education or system redesign, rather than looking at preventing one risk factor in isolation ( Cole 2002 ; Inouye 2000 ; Milisen 2001 ) . The interventions include programmes of education of ward nursing staff ( Rockwood 1999 ), non‐pharmacological intervention protocols for specific risk factors, implemented by a trained interdisciplinary team ( Inouye 1999a ), and a specialist nursing intervention to educate nursing staff, but also to assess and change medications, mobilization strategies and environment of the patient ( Wanich 1992 ).\n\n【14】It is currently unclear whether interventions for prevention of delirium are effective, whether they can be successfully delivered in all environments, and whether different interventions are necessary for different groups of patients. A review of prevention studies for delirium ( Cole 1999 ) suggested possible protocols for delirium prevention, but this review was not systematic, and had no clear selection process for studies assessed.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】**Primary objective:** To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients.  \n**Secondary objective:** Highlighting the quality and quantity of research evidence to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】Only randomised controlled trials will be included in the review. Because of difficulties inherent in the blinding of participants and researchers, blinding will not be a prerequisite for inclusion in the review. The length of trial will not influence selection of studies.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Participants included will be patients admitted to acute general hospitals at risk of developing delirium; male and female patients aged 16 years and over will be included. We will exclude studies conducted in nursing home settings. Studies in mixed settings will be excluded unless data can be extracted separately for hospitalised in‐patients; results from this subset only will be included in the review.\n\n【23】#### Types of interventions\n\n【24】We will include studies of any intervention(s) designed to prevent delirium with controls receiving standard care. Trials comparing two types of intervention will also be included. Trials of co‐ordinated multi‐strategy initiatives will be included. Examples of interventions are: regular screening of cognitive function or mental state, protocol driven medical review and investigation, medication review, medication, nursing interventions, education of staff or family.  \nStandard care is defined as the usual care available on that unit.\n\n【25】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【26】The primary outcomes of interest will be:\n\n【27】*   incident delirium (new onset) during admission\n    \n*   death\n    \n\n【28】Delirium should be identified using a validated method for diagnosis, such as operationalised clinical criteria from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10, Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals (DSM)‐III, DSM‐IIIR, DSM‐IV, or using diagnostic tools based on these e.g. the Confusion Assessment Method, Delirium Rating Scale. All types of delirium (hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed) will be considered together. We will include drug‐induced delirium but not delirium tremens.\n\n【29】Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n【30】*   duration of delirium\n    \n*   severity of delirium, as measured by validated instruments including the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale and the Delirium Rating Scale\n    \n*   use of psychotropic medication\n    \n*   behavioural disturbance\n    \n*   length of admission\n    \n*   activities of daily living\n    \n*   institutional care at discharge\n    \n*   cognitive status\n    \n*   physical morbidity\n    \n*   psychological morbidity\n    \n*   quality of life\n    \n*   carers' psychological morbidity\n    \n*   staff psychological morbidity\n    \n*   withdrawal from protocols by patients\n    \n*   cost of intervention\n    \n*   cost to health care services\n    \n\n【31】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【32】We will search the electronic databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL (all years) using a combination of Mesh/Emtree terms and text‐based searches with the following terms:\n\n【33】**Health condition:** Delirium, \"acute confusion\", \"acute brain failure\", \"acute organic psychosyndrome\", \"acute brain syndrome\", \"metabolic encephalopathy\", \"acute psycho‐organic syndrome\", \"clouded state\", \"clouding of consciousness\", \"exogenous psychosis\"  \n\"toxic psychosis\", \"toxic confusion\". Alcohol related delirium will be excluded from the search.  \n  \n**Prevention:** Prevention, avoidance  \n  \n**Methodology:** we will use the highly sensitive search strategy outlined in Appendix 5c of the Cochrane Handbook to reduce the results to double and single blind randomized controlled trials.\n\n【34】We will search the National Research Register, ClincalTrials.gov and Current Controlled trials for records of ongoing trials for the prevention of delirium. We will review bibliographies of books and review articles on delirium, and references from retrieved articles. Experts in this field will also be contacted for further references and to locate unpublished trials. The Internet will be searched using the search engines Google and Copernic to try to find further evidence of unpublished trials using the same terms as stated above\n\n【35】We will not apply any time restrictions or language constraints.\n\n【36】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【37】**Selection of Studies**  \nThe titles, abstracts and descriptors of citations identified by the search will be examined by two reviewers, NS and RS independently; those deemed to be clearly irrelevant will be discarded. The aim will be to be over‐inclusive at this stage to avoid losing potentially relevant studies. Full text copies of the remaining citations will be retrieved and assessed independently by NS, RS and AB for inclusion in the review using the criteria described above. Consensus will be reached by referral of disagreements at any stage of study selection to JH.\n\n【38】**Quality Assessment**  \nThe internal validity of trials is related to how successfully selection, performance, attrition and detection biases are eliminated ( Clarke 1999 ). The quality of included trials will be assessed independently by NS and RS using predetermined criteria adapted from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( Harris 2001 ; Table 1 ). A consensus process will be used to reach agreement. Reviewers will not be blinded to author and source institution. A will be used to indicate a trial which has a high level of quality in which all the criteria are met. B will be used to indicate that one or more criteria were partially met and the rest fully met. C will be used if one or more criteria were not met or if it is not possible to determine whether one or more criteria were met. The rating of quality will be described in the table of included studies.\n\n【39】Open in table viewer\n\n【40】Table 1. Adapted US Preventive Services Task Force\n\n| **Validity Criteria**  | **Met**  | **Unmet**  | **Unknown**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Initial assembly of comparable groups (includes concealment of treatment allocation and potential confounders distributed equally among groups)  |  |  |  |\n| Maintenance of comparable groups (includes attrition, crossovers, adherence, contamination)  |  |  |  |\n| Clear definition of interventions  |  |  |  |\n| All important outcomes considered and predefined  |  |  |  |\n| Outcome measurements equal, reliable, and valid (includes masking of outcome assessment)  |  |  |  |\n| No important differential loss to follow‐up or overall high loss to follow‐up (trials should have losses less than 25%, unless due to death)  |  |  |  |\n| Intention‐to‐treat analysis  |  |  |  |\n\n【42】**Data Extraction**  \nA data extraction form will be designed and piloted. Data will then be independently extracted by two reviewers NS, RS and AB with disagreements resolved by a consensus process.\n\n【43】To allow an intention‐to‐treat analysis, data will be sought for every patient randomised to treatment or control group irrespective of compliance or subsequent exclusion. Where data are only available for participants completing treatment, these will be extracted and reported separately. When individual patient data are not available, data will be extracted from summary statistics for each study. In the case of incomplete and missing data, further details will be requested from authors wherever possible.\n\n【44】For continuous data the mean change from baseline, the standard deviation and the number of participants for each treatment group at each assessment will be obtained. In studies that do not report changes from baseline, the mean, the standard deviation and the number of participants for each treatment group at baseline and endpoint will be extracted if available. For dichotomous data the number in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest will be retrieved. If only treatment effects and their standard errors are reported then these will be extracted.\n\n【45】**Data Analysis**  \nMissing data and drop‐out rates will be assessed for each of the included studies. The number of participants who are included in the final analysis will be reported as a proportion of all participants in the study.\n\n【46】For binary outcomes a standard estimation of the odds ratio and risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated.\n\n【47】Continuous data with a normal distribution (or approximating to a normal distribution) will be analysed using RevMan Analyses software if means and standard deviations are available or are obtainable from the authors of studies. Appropriate non‐parametric tests will be used to analyse data not normally distributed.\n\n【48】If there are sufficient data and it is appropriate to do so, one or more meta‐analyses will be performed. Decisions on whether to combine studies for meta‐analyses will be made depending on the comparability of interventions and comparators used in individual studies. Statistical analyses will be performed using Review Manager Analyses software. Raw data from cluster randomised studies will not be entered if the units of randomisation and analysis differ.\n\n【49】A subgroup analysis of outcomes in patients with and without dementia will be performed.\n\n【50】Table 1.

Standard protocols in use typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T‐cell activation or proliferation cascade which are central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus), anti‐proliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone). It remains unclear whether new regimens are more specific or simply more potent immunosuppressants.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To compare the effects of tacrolimus with cyclosporin as primary therapy for kidney transplant recipients.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Renal Group's specialist register and conference proceedings were searched to identify relevant reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility, quality and extracted data independently.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】All RCTs where tacrolimus was compared with cyclosporin for the initial treatment of kidney transplant recipients\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Data were synthesised (random effects model) and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), values <1 favouring tacrolimus, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis and meta‐regression were used to examine potential effect modification by differences in study design and immunosuppressive co‐interventions.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】123 reports from 30 studies (4102 patients) were included. At six months graft loss was significantly reduced in tacrolimus‐treated recipients (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect was persistent up to three years. Meta‐regression showed that this benefit diminished as higher trough levels of tacrolimus were targeted (P = 0.04), after allowing for differences in cyclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) and cyclosporin target trough level (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus patients suffered less acute rejection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79), and less steroid‐resistant rejection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64), but more insulin‐requiring diabetes mellitus (RR 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09), tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Cyclosporin‐treated recipients experienced significantly more constipation and cosmetic side‐effects. We demonstrated no differences in infection or malignancy.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post‐transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid 12 suffering acute rejection, two losing their graft but cause an extra five to become insulin‐requiring diabetics.\n\n【17】Plain language summary\n----------------------\n\n【18】available in\n\n【19】*   English\n*   Español\n*   Français\n*   Bahasa Malaysia\n\n【20】### Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post‐transplant diabetes and other side effects\n\n【21】Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD). Strategies to increase donor organ availability and to prolong the transplanted kidney's survival have become priorities in kidney transplantation. Standard immunosuppressive therapy consists of initial treatment and maintenance regimes to prevent rejection and short courses of more intensive immunosuppressive therapy to treat episodes of acute rejection. This review compared tacrolimus and cyclosporin used as primary immunosuppression for kidney transplant recipients. Thirty studies (4102 patients) were included. Tacrolimus was shown to be superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post‐transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. There was insufficient information to assess the cost of tacrolimus versus cyclosporin, and there was a general failure to consider global quality of life (QOL) for transplant recipients which may inform our understanding of patient preference and compliance.\n\n【22】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【23】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "dcde82a6-2638-48cb-ad31-01551bc7f1da", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed inoperable brain metastases (BM) from non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in terms of brain response rate, overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS) and treatment related toxic events.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Brain metastases (BM) represent a significant healthcare problem. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy to metastasise to the brain, of which non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type ( Walker 1985 ). It has been reported that the incidence of BM in patients with NSCLC ranges from 20% to 40% ( Bearz 2010 ). The treatment of BM is unsatisfactory, with median survival ranging from three to six months, and patients with BM will die from either intracranial progression or widely disseminated disease ( Noordijk 1994 ).\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for NSCLC ( NCCN 2014 ), for patients with good performance status and an operable solitary site of BM, surgery followed by whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is recommended ( Gaspar 2009 ; Kalkanis 2009 ; Mintz 2007 ). Patients with a single brain metastasis but with poor performance status may be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery with WBRT or stereotactic radiosurgery alone ( Aoyama 2006 ; Hu 2006 ; Linskey 2009 ).\n\n【9】The initial treatment for patients with inoperable multiple brain metastases is usually WBRT, with an overall symptomatic response rate of between 64% and 85% depending on the symptoms reported ( Tsao 2012 ). These patients may also receive chemotherapy, with a cisplatin or carboplatin‐based chemotherapy doublet ( NCCN 2014 ).\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】There was a presumption that chemotherapy may have a limited ability to cross the blood‐brain barrier and that patients with BM were unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy ( Oh 2008 ). Although concentrations of most cytotoxic agents are relatively low in the normal central nervous system, the blood‐brain barrier may be disrupted and permeability of the blood‐brain barrier may increase when there are BM ( Schuette 2004 ). A major protein present in the blood‐brain barrier is the P‐Glycoprotein, which pumps chemotherapy agents out of the central nervous system ( Gerstner 2007 ). P‐glycoprotein has been reported to be prominent in the endothelial cells of blood vessels at the blood‐brain barrier, but whether the barrier remains functional when BM are present is unknown. In patients with NSCLC, expression of the P‐glycoprotein has been reported to be low in the BM vasculature (much lower than in primary brain tumours such as glioma), which suggests that chemotherapy may also be active against BM ( Ortuzar 2012 ).\n\n【12】In recent years, there has been a growing clinical recognition that metastases in the central nervous system may respond to chemotherapy ( Chang 2007 ; Lee 2008 ; Oh 2008 ; Robinet 2001 ), even in the absence of WBRT ( Langer 2005 ). Phase II studies of platinum‐based therapy have shown response rates of around 35% ( Cortes 2003 ; Fujita 2000 ). Pemetrexed treatment has also been shown to be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of BM from nonsquamous NSCLC in a retrospective analysis of two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) ( Hanna 2004 ; Ortuzar 2012 ; Scagliotti 2008 ).\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】The purpose of this review is to summarise RCT evidence, to determine whether or not chemotherapy alone can be recommended as initial treatment for inoperable BM of NSCLC.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed inoperable brain metastases (BM) from non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in terms of brain response rate, overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS) and treatment related toxic events.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】We will only consider RCTs for this review.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】We will include patients of any age, with newly diagnosed, previously untreated inoperable BM from NSCLC.\n\n【23】We will exclude:\n\n【24】1.  patients without evidence of BM;\n    \n2.  patients with potentially resectable BM;\n    \n3.  patients previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, for metastatic NSCLC; and\n    \n4.  patients treated with targeted therapy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated NSCLC.\n    \n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】The intervention of interest is chemotherapy, or initial chemotherapy combined with delayed whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). RCTs that compared the following interventions will be eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【27】1.  Chemotherapy alone versus primary WBRT.\n    \n2.  Chemotherapy alone versus concurrent WBRT and chemotherapy.\n    \n3.  Chemotherapy alone versus supportive care or no treatment.\n    \n4.  Primary chemotherapy and delayed WBRT versus primary WBRT.\n    \n5.  Primary chemotherapy and delayed WBRT versus primary concurrent WBRT and chemotherapy.\n    \n6.  Primary chemotherapy and delayed WBRT versus supportive care or no treatment.\n    \n7.  Primary chemotherapy and delayed WBRT versus chemotherapy alone.\n    \n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】1.  Brain tumour response rate (complete or partial, or both).\n    \n\n【31】We will assess objective tumour response according to either World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria ( WHO 1979 ) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ( Therasse 2000 ). For trials including delayed WBRT, brain response will be evaluated after chemotherapy but before WBRT.\n\n【32】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【33】1.  Overall survival (OS): defined as the interval between the date of randomisation and the date of death from any cause.\n    \n2.  Progression‐free survival (PFS): calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of documented disease progression, or death from any cause.\n    \n3.  Quality of life (QoL): using standard and validated instruments.\n    \n4.  Treatment related adverse events, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ( DHHS 2010 ).\n    \n\n【34】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【35】To limit publication bias, the search will incorporate a number of methods to identify completed or ongoing studies. We will not apply any language restrictions in the searches.\n\n【36】#### Electronic searches\n\n【37】We will identify RCTs by searching the following databases.\n\n【38】1.  The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) _The Cochrane Library_ , latest issue).\n    \n2.  MEDLINE (1966 to present; access via PubMed).\n    \n3.  EMBASE (1980 to present; access via Ovid).\n    \n4.  Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (in Chinese).\n    \n5.  Clinical Trial Registries and ongoing studies databases, for example www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled‐trials.com.\n    \n\n【39】The filter we will use to identify clinical trials for MEDLINE will be the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying RCTs: sensitivity‐maximizing version (2008 revision, PubMed format). The filter we will use for EMBASE will be created using both free‐text terms and index terms, as suggested in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ (6.3.2.2) ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【40】We will adapt the draft search strategies for CENTRAL ( Appendix 1 ) , MEDLINE ( Appendix 2 ) and EMBASE ( Appendix 3 ) in order to search the remaining databases.\n\n【41】#### Searching other resources\n\n【42】We will search the following additional sources for references.\n\n【43】1.  Relevant conference proceedings:\n    \n    *   American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), from 1990 to present;\n        \n    *   European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), from 1990 to present;\n        \n    *   European Cancer Conference Organisation (ECCO), from 1990 to present; and\n        \n    *   International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) World Lung Cancer Conference, from 1990 to present.\n        \n2.  References lists of included studies.\n    \n3.  We will contact authors and the pharmaceutical industry in an attempt to obtain unpublished trial data\n    \n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】Two review authors (GJ, WT) will independently scan the titles and abstracts of references identified by the search strategy. The same review authors will obtain and independently assess the full details of possibly relevant studies for inclusion in the review. If a disagreement occurs, the review authors will attempt to reach a consensus by discussion with a third review author (ZRZ).\n\n【47】We will only include abstracts or unpublished data if sufficient information on the study design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes is available. If it is not clear, we will contact authors for further information, and we will place the study in 'awaiting assessment' until a reply is received (within an appropriate timeframe).\n\n【48】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【49】Two review authors (GJ, WT) will independently perform data extraction, with disagreements resolved by a third review author (ZRZ). We will obtain data from eligible trials as described in Table 7.3.a of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) using a standard extraction form. We will enter the data collected into the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.2 ( RevMan 2012 ) software for further analysis. For studies reported in more than one publication, we will focus on the study instead of the reports. We will collate information from multiple reports and complete the data extraction form following two strategies described in 7.6.4 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【50】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【51】Two review authors (GJ, WT) will independently assess included trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool outlined in Table 8.5.a of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ), with disagreements resolved by a third review author (ZZZ). We will report bias as either high, low or unclear using the following evidence‐based domains.\n\n【52】1\\. Random sequence generation (selection bias).\n\n【53】We will describe the method used to generate the random sequence in sufficient detail for each included study to allow an assessment of whether it could produce comparable groups.\n\n【54】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【55】*   'low risk' of bias (any truly random process e.g. random number table, computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing of lots, minimisation);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (any non‐random process e.g. odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission, hospital or clinic record number); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').\n    \n\n【56】2\\. Allocation concealment (selection bias).\n\n【57】We will describe the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail for each included study to determine whether the intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【58】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【59】*   'low risk' of bias (e.g. telephone or web‐based central allocation, sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (e.g. open random allocation schedule, unsealed or non‐opaque or not sequentially numbered envelopes, alternation or rotation, date of birth, case record number, any other explicitly unconcealed procedure); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').\n    \n\n【60】3\\. Blinding of participants (performance bias).\n\n【61】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【62】*   'low risk' of bias (e.g. no blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (e.g. no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').\n    \n\n【63】4\\. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).\n\n【64】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【65】*   'low risk' of bias (e.g. no blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (e.g. no blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').\n    \n\n【66】5\\. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).\n\n【67】We will describe the completeness of data in sufficient detail for each included study and for each outcome and assess the risk as:\n\n【68】*   'low risk' of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome; missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event risk is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes is not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the observed effect size; missing data will be imputed using appropriate methods);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (e.g. reason for missing outcome data is likely to be related to the true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible effect size (difference in means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes is enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size; 'as‐treated' analysis is done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (e.g. insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk' such as number randomised not stated and no reasons for missing data provided).\n    \n\n【69】6\\. Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias).\n\n【70】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【71】*   'low risk' of bias (e.g. the study protocol is available and all of the study's prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the prespecified way; the study protocol is not available, but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified);\n    \n*   'high risk' of bias (e.g. not all of the study's prespecified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcome(s) are reported using measurements, analysis methods or subset analyses of the data that were not prespecified; one or more reported primary outcome(s) are not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcome(s) of interest in the review are reported incompletely; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study); and\n    \n*   'unclear risk' of bias (insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk').\n    \n\n【72】We will assess the three domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment and selective outcome reporting per study; while we will assess the domains of blinding and incomplete outcome data at the outcome level. We will provide a final summary assessment for risk of bias under each criterion.\n\n【73】In the included trials, blinding is not appropriate due to the nature of the intervention. However, we will include all six domains listed above in our 'Risk of bias' tables. For the outcomes that are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding (overall survival (OS)), we will assess the method as 'low risk' of bias even though no blinding of outcome assessment had been reported.\n\n【74】We will consider for inclusion in the review trials that are still ongoing and continuing to recruit participants but we will not include them in the meta‐analysis because of their high risk of bias.\n\n【75】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【76】We will analyse the primary outcome based on intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis where available. We will choose the effect measures according to the types of data. We will measure continuous outcomes, such as QoL scores by using mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD). We will measure dichotomous outcomes, such as response rates (complete or partial versus stable disease or no response) and adverse events by using risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n【77】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【78】It is unlikely that cross‐over or cluster‐RCTs could be designed to study chemotherapy treatments for BM from NSCLC. Therefore, the unit‐of‐analysis issues related to cluster‐RCTs and cross‐over trials seem unlikely to arise. The included clinical trials will be of simple parallel group design with participants individually randomised to intervention groups, and a single measurement for each outcome from each participant will be collected and analysed. We will try to avoid any potential unit‐of‐analysis error by extracting and analysing the data carefully according to the methods recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【79】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【80】We will contact the study investigators to request missing data whenever possible. We will not include for analysis studies where data for a particular outcome cannot be identified in study reports or obtained from study investigators.\n\n【81】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【82】We will assess the magnitude of heterogeneity by using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, which describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. The statistic I <sup>2 </sup> may range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing no heterogeneity and 100 representing maximum heterogeneity. We will consider values of I <sup>2 </sup> \\=50% as moderate heterogeneity. If moderate or higher heterogeneity is detected, we will carefully interpret the meta‐analysis results and we will carry out a thorough exploration of possible sources of heterogeneity by means of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. If high heterogeneity is detected, (I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 75%), we will not perform a meta‐analysis.\n\n【83】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【84】We will use funnel plots to explore the possibility of publication bias if there are a sufficient number of eligible studies (approximately 10). If asymmetry in funnel plots is present, we will explore other possible causes described in 10.4.2 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ), such as heterogeneity.\n\n【85】If a study does not report an outcome which all the other studies report and which is very obvious to report (that is, to have collected the data for), then it is likely that there is a high risk of reporting bias. If the protocol is available, we will identify the possible reporting bias by comparing the outcomes in the protocol and the published report. If not, then we will compare outcomes listed in the methods section with those whose results are reported, and we will make an assessment on that basis of the likely risk of reporting bias. We will also seek some further information from the trial registries and authors of the reports.\n\n【86】#### Data synthesis\n\n【87】We will summarise individual study data in structured tables and as a narrative description. We will combine data extracted using different methods according to different data types using Review Manager 5.2( RevMan 2012 ) in accordance with guidance provided by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). For time‐to‐event outcomes, we will combine data using the generic inverse variance method. For continuous outcomes, we will use the inverse variance method, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the Mantel‐Haenszel method.\n\n【88】If there is no heterogeneity among studies, we will use a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis model. With moderate to high heterogeneity values (50% to 75%), we will conduct meta‐analysis with the random‐effects model, carefully interpreting the meta‐analysis results, and we will carry out a thorough exploration of sources of heterogeneity. As stated previously, if high heterogeneity is detected (I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 75%), we will not perform a meta‐analysis.\n\n【89】We will calculate all the statistics above using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.2 ( RevMan 2012 ) software.\n\n【90】We will include a 'Summary of findings' table to present findings for the most important outcomes (brain response rate, OS, PFS, QoL and treatment related toxicity) whether data are available or not. We will assess the quality of the body of evidence by following the GRADE framework ( Atkins 2004 ) prepared with an additional piece of software, GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) ( GRADEpro 2008 ).\n\n【91】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【92】Where data are available, we will perform subgroup analyses according to the following characteristics of patients: (1) chemotherapy received (platinum‐based therapy, others); (2) histology of cancer (squamous or non‐squamous); and (3) Eastern Co‐operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.\n\n【93】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【94】We will perform sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the review findings. We will conduct sensitivity analyses on the overall risk of bias of the included studies based on brain tumour response rate. We will base the summary assessment on recommendations in Table 8.7.a of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【95】We will perform a second sensitivity analyses excluding any trials that are clear outliers. We will present the results of these analyses alongside the original analyses for the purpose of comparison.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The word ‘cancer’ frequently invokes vivid images of pain and suffering that threaten to subvert a rational discussion founded in facts. \\[ 1 \\] At the same time, questions of screening are among the most complex to fully comprehend, requiring decision‐makers to have a solid understanding of methodological issues relating to common validity threats to clinical trials (e.g. selection bias, length time bias, lead time bias) as well as an understanding of baseline risks and downstream harms through additional diagnostic testing and subsequent treatments.\n\n【1】It is for these challenging topics that the contributions of The Cochrane Collaboration are most important in helping to shape the public debate by providing unbiased summaries of the underlying evidence upon which decision‐making should be founded. As the Collaboration celebrates its 20th Anniversary, it's an opportunity to recall how the Cochrane Prostatic Diseases and Urologic Cancers (PDUC) Group ( prostate.cochrane.org ) has been and continues to be a loud and clear voice in the debate over the benefits and harms of prostate‐specific antigen (PSA)‐based prostate cancer screening.\n\n【2】In 2004, when PSA screening was widely utilised in many countries, in particular the United States, a team of authors led by Dragan Ilic from Monash University in Australia developed the first Cochrane Protocol on screening for prostate cancer. \\[ 2 \\] The first version of the Cochrane Review found no robust evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the impact of screening on quality of life, harms of screening, or economic value. These screening‐related harms not only include complications directly related to subsequent prostate biopsies, such as pain, haematuria, and infectious complications, but also the anxiety related to a potential cancer diagnosis and the downstream side effects of treatment, which include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, among others. The authors recommended awaiting the results of two large, on‐going RCTs, which were published in 2009. \\[ 3 , 4 \\] Once those RCTs were published, the authors updated their Cochrane Review, finding that “prostate cancer screening did not significantly decrease all‐cause or prostate cancer‐specific mortality in a combined meta‐analysis of five RCTs”. \\[ 5 \\] Based on these findings, the authors recommended that men with a life expectancy of less than 15 years be told that prostate cancer screening is unlikely to be beneficial.\n\n【3】Publication of this updated Cochrane Review in 2010 was timely as it coincided with the work of the US Preventive Services Task Force to update its recommendations on screening for prostate cancer. \\[ 6 \\] The Cochrane Review was subsequently one of the two high‐quality systematic reviews that found consideration in the Task Force's deliberation about the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, \\[ 5 , 7 \\] which ultimately led to a Grade D recommendation against routine population‐based efforts to screen for prostate cancer. It is also cited in the recent American Urological Association guideline document on the early detection of prostate cancer, which takes a much more nuanced approach to prostate cancer screening than the Best Practice Statement that it replaces for this clinical question. \\[ 8 , 9 \\]\n\n【4】In line with the Cochrane principle to update systematic reviews as new evidence becomes available, the review on prostate cancer screening was updated this year to include extended follow‐up information that had become available for the two major trials. \\[ 10 \\] While the main conclusions remained largely unchanged, the updated review placed greater emphasis on the discussion of screening‐related overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These results have been given an additional forum for discussion at the first‐of‐its‐kind conference on preventing overdiagnosis, hosted by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in partnership with BMJ, Consumer Reports, and Bond University.\n\n【5】The 2013 update of the Cochrane Review also accounts for The Cochrane Collaboration's interval endorsement of efforts by the Cochrane Applicability and Recommendations Methods Group ( armg.cochrane.org ) and contributions by the GRADE Working Group by incorporating a summary of findings (SoF) table to provide a concise and transparent summary of the key findings of the review ( Table 1 ). \\[ 11 \\] This includes an outcome‐by‐outcome rating of the confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of evidence) as well as relative and absolute effect size estimates. The updated review is finding consideration in on‐going efforts by Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care and other organisations to update their guidelines on prostate cancer screening.\n\n【6】Open in table viewer\n\n【7】Table 1. Summary of findings from Cochrane Review of prostate cancer screening (dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004720.pub3)\n\n【8】These three Cochrane Reviews are emblematic of the important work that Cochrane authors do on a day‐to‐day basis: providing unbiased summaries, untainted by conflicts of interest, of the totality of evidence for a given clinical question to guide individual patient and provider as well as health policy decision‐making. Cochrane Reviews focus on patient‐important outcomes of both benefit and harm and provide a critical assessment of our confidence in the estimates of the effect, which is the bedrock for informed decision‐making.\n\n【9】Frontiers for the PDUC Group in its third decade of existence as part of The Cochrane Collaboration are to broaden the dissemination and uptake of its reviews among healthcare providers and consumers through close collaboration with other organisations that share the common goal of working together to provide the best evidence for health care. We also hope to work closely with the US Cochrane Center, led by Kay Dickersin, to improve the uptake and impact of Cochrane Reviews in the United States. Given the current challenges of healthcare financing around the globe, there has never been a more important time for Cochrane contributors to take pride in their work and to hold up high the banner for Cochrane Reviews as the standard for high‐quality evidence syntheses.\n\n【10】Information\n-----------\n\n【11】DOI:\n\n【12】https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.ED000067 Copy DOI \n\n【13】Database:\n\n【14】1.

Yet, of adults between the ages of 16 to 74 with these conditions, only 37% were accessing mental health treatment ( McManus 2016 ). A similar pattern is seen worldwide; according to the 2015 Global Burden of Disease study, depression ranks as the third most common cause of years lived with disability worldwide, with anxiety disorders at ninth, and schizophrenia at twelfth ( Vos 2016 ). In 2004, the World Health Organisation estimated that of people with serious mental health disorders, between 36% and 50% in high‐income nations and 76% to 85% in low‐ to middle‐income countries, had not received treatment in the past 12 months ( Demyttenaere 2004 ). Improving early identification of mental health problems and access to treatment is a global health priority.\n\n【11】Mental health problems have a wide‐ranging and deleterious effect on many sectors in society. A negative impact on productivity in the workplace is one major aspect. In the UK, for example, an estimated 15.8 million days were lost to sickness absence due to mental health issues (including stress, depression, anxiety, and more serious conditions, e.g. manic depression and schizophrenia) in 2016 ( Office for National Statistics 2017 ). This was the fourth most common reason for sickness absence, accounting for 11.5% of all days lost. Global estimates suggest that across the 36 largest countries in the world, more than 12 billion days of lost productivity are attributable to depression and anxiety disorders every year, at an estimated cost of USD925 billion ( Chisholm 2016 ).\n\n【12】There is evidence that certain professional groups are at increased risk of mental health problems; for example, teaching professionals experience a higher prevalence of common mental disorders than many other professional occupations ( Stansfeld 2011 ).\n\n【13】The impact of mental health problems in other sectors can also be significant. In the US, psychiatric disorders have been found to be common in individuals attending college and their non‐college‐attending peers ( Blanco 2008 ). A study of US military veterans found that the prevalence of reporting a mental health problem was 19.1% among service members returning from Iraq ( Hoge 2006 ).There is also a significant impact among children and adolescents; Meltzer 2007 found the overall prevalence of childhood mental disorders in the UK was 9.5%. This estimate was reinforced by _The Five Year Forward View for Mental Health_ produced by an independent Mental Health Taskforce to the NHS in England, which indicates one in ten children aged between 5 and 16 years has a diagnosable mental health problem ( Mental Health Taskforce 2016 ).\n\n【14】One of the factors that may exacerbate the impact of mental health problems is a lack of mental health literacy in the general population. The term 'mental health literacy' is defined as 'knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders, which aid their recognition, management, or prevention'. The term originated from surveys of Australian adults, which showed that when given vignettes of characters suffering from depression or schizophrenia, most members of the public could not correctly label the disorder, and their recommendations regarding treatments often deviated from standard professional opinion ( Jorm 1997 ). Since then, multiple studies, in different countries, using similar vignettes, have confirmed that the public are generally poor at recognising common mental health conditions, particularly those other than depression; that their beliefs about helping strategies often diverge significantly from the opinion of medical professionals, particularly regarding medication and psychiatric treatment; and that there is widespread stigmatisation of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia ( Angermeyer 2006 ; Jorm 2000 ; Jorm 2012 ).\n\n【15】Lack of mental health literacy among the population acts as a barrier to seeking help in several ways. On an individual level, a person may be unaware that they are suffering from a mental health problem that it is treatable, or not know where and how to access treatment. In addition, stigma around mental health problems has been shown to be associated with an unwillingness to seek help ( Barney 2006 ; Stuart 2004 ; Thornicroft 2008 ), as well as poorer treatment adherence ( DosReis 2009 ; Sirey 2001 ; Sirey 2001a ). Conversely, it has also been demonstrated that improved mental health literacy is associated with greater intentions to seek help, and more willingness to disclose mental health problems ( Rüsch 2011 ; Suka 2016 )\n\n【16】There is evidence that seeking help for mental health is influenced by an individual’s social network; people appear more likely to seek professional help if someone else suggests it ( Cusack 2004 : Wong 2014 ), and this is influenced by the mental health literacy of the community. Among college students, being prompted to seek help has been found to be related to more positive attitudes towards help‐seeking behaviour ( Vogel 2007 ). There is also evidence that people are likely to seek help from their social network: in a study of people who had attempted suicide, Barnes 2002 found that friends and family were the people from whom help was sought most frequently in the previous month. Young people who seek help for mental health problems are more likely to reach out to friends and family first ( Rickwood 2007 ). Thus, the level of mental health literacy across a community may be important in influencing help‐seeking.\n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is a training programme developed in Australia in 2000; its aim is to teach mental health first aid strategies to members of the public. Mental Health First Aid is defined as the 'help provided to a person who is developing a mental health problem, experiencing a worsening of a mental health problem, or is in a mental health crisis. The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is received or the crisis resolves' ( MHFA Australia 2018a ).\n\n【19】The MHFA model involves the training of instructors who are then approved to teach the MHFA course to others. Once trained by an accredited MHFA instructor, an individual is deemed to have the skills necessary to offer mental health first aid to people within their workplace, organisation, or wider community. The MHFA curriculum is based on best practice guidelines, which were derived from expert consensus via the Delphi method. The course covers the symptoms and risk factors in depressive, anxiety, psychotic and substance use disorders, along with associated mental health crisis situations including suicidality, panic attacks, traumatic experiences, threatening behaviour, and drug overdose. Providing help is centred on a five‐step action plan, and appropriate ways of applying this to each mental health problem are practiced during the course ( Kitchener 2008 ). The acronym for this action plan is 'ALGEE' which stands for 'Approach, assess, and assist with any crisis; Listen and communicate non‐judgementally; Give support and information; Encourage appropriate professional help; Encourage appropriate supports'. This plan is adapted, depending on the actual mental health problem being addressed.\n\n【20】The 'standard' course delivered under the aegis of MHFA Australia lasts for 12 hours, and is delivered face‐to‐face ( MHFA Australia 2018b ). It is aimed at people who are aged 18 and over, who are offering initial support to adults in communities and workplaces. However, there are many different courses now being delivered, including those aimed at adults helping adolescents, those aimed at adults helping an older person, and those aimed at a particular cultural groups, for example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ( Kitchener 2008 ). The course content is adapted to meet the different needs of specific groups. MHFA courses have also been translated into different languages, and adapted to meet the needs of different countries. Courses are now offered in over 20 different countries, including the USA, Pakistan, and Sweden. Prices for MHFA courses vary, depending on the type of course, and many are subsidised by government bodies. The MHFA Australia web site gives the cost of a face‐to‐face course as AUD100 to AUD300 per person ( MHFA Australia 2018c ).\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】The MHFA intervention works in a 'cascade' model; individuals trained to become accredited MHFA instructors deliver training courses designed to equip the trainees with mental health first aid skills. MHFA training programmes are designed to increase knowledge about common mental health problems, and thereby to reduce the stigma often attached to such disorders. The programmes also teach trainees how to provide immediate help to people experiencing mental health difficulties, and how to signpost to professional services. It is theorised that improved knowledge will encourage the trainees to provide support, and encourage people to actively seek help, thereby leading to improvements in mental health.\n\n【23】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【24】For a variety of reasons, concerns about the widespread adoption of MHFA with little formal evaluation have been raised; this review has been designed to summarise the evidence base that could help address these. First, it is important to note that other mental health literacy programmes are available and that MHFA may need to be evaluated in the context of these programmes. Second, the 'cascade' approach taken in MHFA has implications for its evaluation. Whilst there may be positive effects for recipients of the training in terms of their knowledge about and attitudes towards mental health problems, it is important that the actual impact of the intervention is evaluated for the recipients of their intervention (who may have mental health problems) in terms of their own knowledge, attitudes and mental health and well‐being outcomes. Third, there is a cost associated with the implementation of MHFA (for example, the costs of the programme and the training as well as the time committed by the trainees engaging with people who may be in psychological distress), and it is important that evidence about all potential impacts of the intervention are assessed. Fourth, the success of MHFA is partly dependent on access to appropriate professional support, which may not always be available in areas where the intervention is implemented; concerns have also been raised that, in the absence of readily accessible support, being encouraged to seek help and subsequently being turned down could lead to worse outcomes for the individual ( Watts 2017 ). Finally, some commentators have even raised ideological concerns, especially because of controversy about the about the nature and expression of mental health problems, with the potential that the intervention risks medicalising, or 'psychiatrizing' normal psychological distress ( DeFehr 2016 even describes MHFA as a 'technique of neo‐liberal governance, moral surveillance, and social control').\n\n【25】Hadlaczky and colleagues performed a meta‐analysis on all existing randomised and non‐randomised studies ( Hadlaczky 2014 ). The authors found moderate to small effects of MHFA on knowledge, attitudes, and helping behaviours. Since this, there have been several new randomised controlled trials examining MHFA, and much debate has taken place about what evidence is needed in this area to inform decision‐making. This review is being undertaken in the context of a wider research programme of work to explore these issues with a variety of stakeholder groups. While we have been developing this research programme, another review and meta‐analysis has been published that includes both randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials ( Morgan 2018 ). We are also aware that much of the research evidence on the effects of MHFA consists of qualitative studies and studies with no control group ( Crooks 2018 ; El‐Den 2016 ; Gryglewicz 2018 ). Our review, while comprehensive, will be limited to randomised controlled trials, and will focus on the effects of MHFA on the mental health and mental well‐being of all recipients (be they recipients of the training course or recipients of their intervention), including individuals, communities, and organisations. This information is essential for decision‐makers considering the role of MHFA in their organisations.\n\n【26】Objectives\n----------\n\n【27】Our primary objective is to examine mental health and well‐being, mental health service usage, and adverse effects of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training on recipients of the intervention.\n\n【28】We have three secondary objectives:\n\n【29】1\\. To examine the effects of MHFA training on recipients of the trainees' intervention, in terms of their knowledge about mental health and attitudes towards mental health problems.\n\n【30】2\\. To examine the effects of MHFA training on trainees' knowledge about mental health, attitudes towards mental health problems, number of encounters with people with mental health problems, and their own mental health and well‐being.\n\n【31】3\\. To examine the effects on organisations, looking at measures of absenteeism and productivity at work.\n\n【32】Methods\n-------\n\n【33】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【34】#### Types of studies\n\n【35】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs in this review. We are aware of non‐randomised trials of MHFA, but anticipate that there will be considerable data available from RCTs. We will restrict our review to RCTs, as, if conducted properly, RCTs are the most rigorous design for determining the effectiveness of interventions, minimising the risk of bias, and confounding variables.\n\n【36】We will include trials published in any language, provided a suitable translation can be obtained. In the case of ongoing trials, we will contact study authors to see if preliminary data are available. We will also include unpublished trials.\n\n【37】#### Types of participants\n\n【38】##### Participant characteristics\n\n【39】Recipients of MHFA training (trainees) or of MHFA intervention. We will include recipients of any age and any population, including minority and disadvantaged groups, and underserved populations, such as older people.\n\n【40】If studies include data on populations that are not included in the review, we will only consider those where data can be disaggregated for relevant populations.\n\n【41】##### Setting\n\n【42】We will place no restrictions on setting. We will include studies undertaken in any type of organisation, including schools, higher education facilities, other types of workplaces, and other organisations, such as community groups. We will consider the impact of the setting of the intervention in the subgroup analyses, when there are sufficient data to do this, and we will take account of the potential role of the setting (for example, whether large or small, or the likely prevalence of mental health problems) in interpreting our findings.\n\n【43】#### Types of interventions\n\n【44】##### Experimental Intervention\n\n【45】*   Any type of MHFA‐trademarked course, derived from the official MHFA programme designed to train people to deliver MHFA. We will include MHFA training that has been adapted for, or tailored to the needs of specific or underserved populations (including young people, older people, specific professional groups, and minority ethnic populations). We will include traditional face‐to‐face courses, and those delivered via reading materials or digital media. We will include studies where MHFA has been delivered as part of a multifaceted, or more complex mental health and well‐being programme.\n    \n\n【46】##### Comparator intervention\n\n【47】*   No intervention, active or attention control (such as first aid courses), waiting list control, or alternative mental health education interventions distinct from MHFA. We will not include comparisons of different adaptations of MHFA.\n    \n\n【48】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【49】We will include studies regardless of whether they report the outcomes listed below.\n\n【50】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【51】Our primary outcomes relate to recipients of the MHFA intervention, and are as follows:\n\n【52】*   Mental health and well‐being of recipients, measured by a validated measure, for example the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ);\n    \n*   Mental health service usage, measured by objective service records. These may include clinic records, referrals to health care professionals, or the costs of service usage;\n    \n*   Adverse effects of MHFA, for example, documented instances of inappropriate advice, delays in receiving treatment, and inappropriate service usage.\n    \n\n【53】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【54】Our secondary outcomes relate to recipients of the MHFA intervention, recipients of MHFA training (trainees), and communities or organisations in which MHFA training has been delivered (data for each of these groups will be analysed separately). They include:\n\n【55】*   Knowledge about mental health problems. Measures must be based on information about mental health problems, and been validated, for example, by consultation with mental health professionals;\n    \n*   Stigmatising attitudes towards mental health problems, assessed by a validated social distance or stigma scale;\n    \n*   Self‐reported contacts, or help provided to people with a mental health problem, since training;\n    \n*   Mental health and well‐being of trainees and organisations, using a validated measure;\n    \n*   Absenteeism across an organisation, however measured;\n    \n*   Productivity across an organisation, however measured;\n    \n*   Cost‐effectiveness of providing the intervention.\n    \n\n【56】###### Timing of outcome assessment\n\n【57】Trials should evaluate outcomes immediately post‐MHFA course, and at follow‐ups of less than six months, six months to a year, and over one year. If outcomes are measured at multiple time points within each window, the latest recorded observations will be extracted, as this best represents the longevity of the intervention’s effects. Outcomes measured at six months to a year will be treated as the primary time point for the 'Summary of Findings' table, as we believe that this represents the best balance between assessing whether MHFA has produced any lasting changes in trainees, and allowing time for its impact to be felt amongst recipients of the MHFA intervention, against the erosive effect that time will have on the impact of an educational intervention.\n\n【58】###### Hierarchy of outcome measures\n\n【59】Where outcomes have been measured in several ways, we will give priority to the one that is most frequently used among the included trials. If multiple scales are used to measure the same construct, we will combine data using appropriate statistical techniques, as discussed below.\n\n【60】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【61】We will develop a sensitive search strategy to identify randomised controlled trials ( Lefebvre 2011 ). This approach will use bibliographic databases searching, using a search strategy developed for MEDLINE Ovid ( Appendix 1 ), and it will include the use of supplementary search methods, as set out below.\n\n【62】#### Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR)\n\n【63】The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMD) maintains two archived clinical trials registers at its editorial base in York, UK: a references register and a studies‐based register. The CCMDCTR References Register contains over 40,000 reports of RCTs in depression, anxiety, and neurosis. Approximately 50% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCMDCTR Studies Register, and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU‐Psi coding manual, using a controlled vocabulary (please contact the CCMD Information Specialists for further details). Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to 2016), Embase (1974 to 2016) and PsycINFO (1967 to 2016); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and review‐specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trial registers via the World Health Organization's trials portal (the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP )), pharmaceutical companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings, and other (non‐Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta‐analyses. Details of CCMD's core search strategies (used to identify RCTs) can be found on the Group's website, with an example of the core MEDLINE search displayed in Appendix 2 .\n\n【64】The register is not currently maintained since the group's move from Bristol to York in June 2016.\n\n【65】#### Electronic searches\n\n【66】The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Information Specialist will search the following electronic databases:\n\n【67】*   CCMDCTR (Studies and References Register; all available years);\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; current issue);\n    \n*   MEDLINE Ovid databases (1946 to date; Appendix 1 );\n    \n*   Embase Ovid (1974 to date);\n    \n*   PsycINFO Ovid (all years);\n    \n*   PubMed (not MEDLINE; 1945 to date).\n    \n\n【68】We will apply no restrictions on study design, date, language, or publication status to the searches.\n\n【69】#### Searching other resources\n\n【70】##### Trials registers\n\n【71】We will search the following trials registers for ongoing, unpublished or completed trials:\n\n【72】*   The World Health Organization's trials portal ( ICTRP );\n    \n*   Clinical Trials.Gov ( ClinicalTrials.gov ); and\n    \n*   the EU clinical trials register ( clinicaltrialsregister.eu ).\n    \n\n【73】Results will be downloaded to Zotero and imported into Endnote.\n\n【74】##### Conference proceedings\n\n【75】Embase contains conference abstracts from 2009 and we will search the Web of Science (Calvairate Analytics) for conference proceedings.\n\n【76】##### Grey literature\n\n【77】We will search the the grey literature for randomised controlled trials:\n\n【78】*   Open Grey http://www.opengrey.eu/ ;\n    \n*   Dissertations & Theses: UK and Ireland (ProQuest); and\n    \n*   a search of the Internet will be undertaken using search terms from the MEDLINE search strategy. Google advanced search will be used.\n    \n\n【79】##### Reference lists\n\n【80】We will check the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches (for example, unpublished or in‐press citations).\n\n【81】##### Correspondence\n\n【82】We will contact trialists and subject experts for information on unpublished or ongoing studies, or to request additional trial or study data, as applicable.\n\n【83】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【84】#### Selection of studies\n\n【85】Two members of the review team (RR, HD) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of reports obtained through the search strategy, and decide whether studies are potentially relevant or not. They will discard records deemed obviously not eligible, and retrieve full copies of potentially relevant papers. They will resolve disagreements by discussion; if consensus cannot be reached, they will retrieve the full text for further scrutiny. Two review authors (RR, HD) will then independently review the full text of these studies, and decide whether they meet the inclusion criteria. The review authors will resolve any disagreement by discussion with a third member of the team (RC) until a consensus is reached. If a consensus cannot be reached, we will attempt to contact study authors to obtain further information. They will document and summarise reasons for excluding studies at the full‐text stage in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table, and illustrate the process of the literature search and study selection in a PRISMA flow diagram ( Higgins 2011a ).\n\n【86】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【87】Two review authors (RR, HD) will extract data from selected studies, using specifically designed template forms piloted on at least one study in the review, and revised as necessary. One review author (RR) will extract data, and a second (HD) will check them. As well as data regarding outcomes of interest, other information extracted will include study design, population, size, type of MHFA training and duration, type of comparator intervention, length of follow‐up, and statistical methods used. We will also extract source of funding, any reported conflicts of interest, and researcher allegiance. We will make a note of any outcomes that are reported in the studies, but which we do not extract. We will note studies that meet our inclusion criteria but contain no outcome data relevant to the review in the ‘Characteristics of included studies' table. We will resolve any disagreements by discussion with a third author (RC). One reviewer (RR) will transfer the extracted data into Review Manager 5, the Cochrane Review software, for analysis ( Higgins 2011a ; Review Manager 2014 ).\n\n【88】##### Main planned comparisons\n\n【89】*   MHFA training versus no intervention (including waiting list controls).\n    \n*   MHFA training versus alternative mental health literacy education interventions.\n    \n*   MHFA training versus active or attention control.\n    \n\n【90】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【91】We will assess the risk of bias in included studies using Cochrane's revised tool (RoB 2.0; Higgins 2016 ). One reviewer (RR) will independently assess the risk of bias, and a second reviewer (HD) will check the assessments. They will resolve disagreements by discussion. If disagreement remains, they will consult a third reviewer (RC).\n\n【92】We will assess individually randomised studies according to the following domains:\n\n【93】*   Bias arising from the randomisation process\n    \n*   Bias due to deviations from intended interventions\n    \n*   Bias due to missing outcome data\n    \n*   Bias in measurement of the outcome\n    \n*   Bias in selection of the reported result\n    \n*   Overall bias\n    \n\n【94】Cluster randomised studies will be assessed according to the following domains:\n\n【95】*   Bias arising from the randomisation process\n    \n*   Bias arising from the timing of identification and recruitment of individual participants in relation to timing of randomisation\n    \n*   Bias due to deviations from intended interventions\n    \n*   Bias due to missing outcome data\n    \n*   Bias in measurement of the outcome\n    \n*   Bias in selection of the reported result\n    \n*   Overall bias\n    \n\n【96】For each of the domains, we will assess the risk of bias as low risk, some concerns, or high risk.\n\n【97】We will document our decisions in the 'Risk of bias' table, and summarise risk of bias across studies for each domain in a ‘Risk of bias’ graph.\n\n【98】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【99】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【100】We will analyse dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This will be relevant for outcomes relating to mental health, where there is a threshold for clinical caseness, for example, 'depressed or not depressed'. We will convert count data (e.g. number of contacts with health care professionals (HCPs)), to dichotomous data; for example, no contacts with HCPs versus one or more contacts with HCPs ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【101】##### Continuous data\n\n【102】We will analyse continuous data as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs when all the studies use the same outcome measure, or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs if different measurements are used. We anticipate that studies may include a mixture of change‐from‐baseline and final value scores. We will not combine final value and change scores as standardised mean differences, since the difference in standard deviation does not reflect differences in measurement scale, but differences in the reliability of the measurements ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【103】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【104】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【105】We will include cluster RCTs as long as adjustment for the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) has been performed by the authors in a reasonable manner. If authors have adjusted for clustering, and imputed missing data in a reasonable manner in their analyses, we will report their summary statistics and use these in meta‐analyses, as appropriate. If they have not conducted such an adjustment, we will attempt to correct the analysis, using the methods described in Chapter 9 of the _Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews for Interventions_ ( Deeks 2011 ). We will use an estimate of the ICC obtained from similar studies.\n\n【106】##### Studies with multiple treatment groups\n\n【107】If studies have multiple arms, including alternative mental health literacy interventions that are not MHFA, we will undertake multiple pair‐wise analyses comparing MHFA to each relevant comparator arm. If studies include more than one type of MHFA intervention compared to a relevant comparator arm, we will combine the MHFA intervention arms and compare the combined numbers with the control group, to give an estimate of the effect of MHFA training versus control ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【108】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【109】We will attempt to contact the authors to retrieve any data that appear to be missing from study reports, and for which no explanation is given. We will consider imputing values for standard deviations, where these are not available from study reports or authors, in accordance with this guidance offered in Chapter 16 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (_ Higgins 2011b ). We will not impute other missing outcome data and will only analyse the data available in the study reports. We will not include data where the study authors have undertaken a 'per protocol' analysis and not analysed participants in the groups to which they were originally randomised.\n\n【110】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【111】We will use a combination of different techniques to assess heterogeneity, as described in Chaper 9 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (_ Deeks 2011 ). We will visually inspect forest plots to assess the possibility of heterogeneity among studies. We will calculate the heterogeneity of each outcome using the I² statistic, which estimates the percentage of variability due to differences between studies, rather than chance. The importance of the observed value of I <sup>2 </sup> depends on (i) magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the chi‐squared test, or a confidence interval for I <sup>2 </sup> ). We will interpret the I² according to the scale included in Chapter 9 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ , which suggests that: values of 0% to 40% might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【112】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【113】If we include more than 10 studies in the analysis, we will create funnel plots of effect size versus study power, and examine these for signs of asymmetry. We will use appropriate statistical tests, as suggested in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Sterne 2011 ). If present, we will explore possible reasons for this.\n\n【114】#### Data synthesis\n\n【115】We anticipate that there will be considerable heterogeneity among studies, due to the variety of study settings and populations. Therefore, we will perform meta‐analyses using a random‐effects model. However, as part of the sensitivity analyses, we will perform fixed‐effect analyses and compare the results. We will only perform a meta‐analysis if participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes are judged to be sufficiently similar. We will not combine outcome data relating to the different populations which we are examining (recipients of MHFA intervention, recipients of MHFA training (trainees), and communities or organisations in which MHFA training has been delivered). If the heterogeneity of studies prohibits meta‐analysis, or there are insufficient studies, we will synthesise the results in a narrative format instead ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【116】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【117】Where sufficient studies are available, we will perform the following subgroup analyses to explore the data further, and to examine the reasons for any heterogeneity we detect ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【118】*   Setting: MHFA courses are delivered in various settings, for example schools, workplaces and for the general public. We believe that the setting in which the MHFA intervention is delivered may affect outcomes.\n    \n*   Tailored vs non‐tailored: This intervention is often adapted to meet the needs of populations in different settings (for example, military personnel), which may impact on its effectiveness.\n    \n*   Country: MHFA courses have been delivered in many countries worldwide and we believe that the country in which the intervention is delivered is likely to affect outcomes.\n    \n\n【119】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【120】To test the assumptions of the estimated effect size for the intervention, we will also perform sensitivity analyses as follows ( Deeks 2011 ):\n\n【121】*   Excluding studies with inadequate assessor blinding;\n    \n*   Excluding studies at high risk or some concerns of attrition bias;\n    \n*   Excluding studies at high risk or some concerns of researcher allegiance bias;\n    \n*   Using a fixed‐effect model instead of a random‐effects model.\n    \n\n【122】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【123】We will produce a ‘Summary of Findings table’ illustrating the estimated effects for each of the three primary outcomes (mental health and well‐being of recipients of MHFA programme, mental health service usage, and adverse effects of MHFA) for the comparison of MHFA versus no intervention, and the amount of pooled data on which they are based. We will estimate the assumed risks from the 'no intervention' group data. In addition, we will assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome, using the GRADE approach, which takes into account risks of bias, directness of evidence, imprecision, unexplained heterogeneity, and risk of publication bias in the studies pooled for each outcome of interest ( Schünemann 2011 ). A blank Summary of Findings table for the comparison between MHFA and no intervention is included as Appendix 3.\n\n【124】We will use the GRADEpro software to create the 'Summary of findings' table ( GRADEpro GDT ).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Inadequate symptom management has implications for patient outcomes including functioning, psychological well‐being, and quality of life (QoL). Attempts to reduce the incidence and severity of cancer symptoms have involved the development and testing of psycho‐educational interventions to enhance patients' symptom self‐management. With the trend for care to be provided nearer patients' homes, telephone‐delivered psycho‐educational interventions have evolved to provide support for the management of a range of cancer symptoms. Early indications suggest that these can reduce symptom severity and distress through enhanced symptom self‐management.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions for reducing symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. To determine which symptoms are most responsive to telephone interventions. To determine whether certain configurations (e.g. with/without additional support such as face‐to‐face, printed or electronic resources) and duration/frequency of intervention calls mediate observed cancer symptom outcome effects.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to January 2019); Embase via OVID (1980 to January 2019); (CINAHL) via Athens (1982 to January 2019); British Nursing Index (1984 to January 2019); and PsycINFO (1989 to January 2019). We searched conference proceedings to identify published abstracts, as well as SIGLE and trial registers for unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of all included articles for additional relevant studies. Finally, we handsearched the following journals: _Cancer_ , _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ , _Psycho‐oncology_ , _Cancer Practice_ , _Cancer Nursing_ , _Oncology Nursing Forum_ , _Journal of Pain and Symptom Management_ , and _Palliative Medicine_ . We restricted our search to publications published in English.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared one or more telephone interventions with one other, or with other types of interventions (e.g. a face‐to‐face intervention) and/or usual care, with the stated aim of addressing any physical or psychological symptoms of cancer and its treatment, which recruited adults (over 18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of cancer, regardless of tumour type, stage of cancer, type of treatment, and time of recruitment (e.g. before, during, or after treatment).\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We used Cochrane methods for trial selection, data extraction and analysis. When possible, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, emotional distress, pain, uncertainty, sexually‐related and lung cancer symptoms as well as secondary outcomes are reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and we presented a descriptive synthesis of study findings. We reported on findings according to symptoms addressed and intervention types (e.g. telephone only, telephone combined with other elements). As many studies included small samples, and because baseline scores for study outcomes often varied for intervention and control groups, we used change scores and associated standard deviations. The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was interpreted using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Thirty‐two studies were eligible for inclusion; most had moderate risk of bias,often related to blinding. Collectively, researchers recruited 6250 people and studied interventions in people with a variety of cancer types and across the disease trajectory, although many participants had breast cancer or early‐stage cancer and/or were starting treatment. Studies measured symptoms of anxiety, depression, emotional distress, uncertainty, fatigue, and pain, as well as sexually‐related symptoms and general symptom intensity and/or distress.\n\n【15】Interventions were primarily delivered by nurses (n = 24), most of whom (n = 16) had a background in oncology, research, or psychiatry. Ten interventions were delivered solely by telephone; the rest combined telephone with additional elements (i.e. face‐to‐face consultations and digital/online/printed resources). The number of calls delivered ranged from 1 to 18; most interventions provided three or four calls.\n\n【16】Twenty‐one studies provided evidence on effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions and the majority appeared to reduce symptoms of _depression_ compared to control. Nine studies contributed quantitative change scores (CSs) and associated standard deviation results (or these could be calculated). Likewise, many telephone interventions appeared effective when compared to control in reducing _anxiety_ (16 studies; 5 contributed quantitative CS results); _fatigue_ (9 studies; 6 contributed to quantitative CS results); and _emotional distress_ (7 studies; 5 contributed quantitative CS results). Due to significant clinical heterogeneity with regards to interventions introduced, study participants recruited, and outcomes measured, meta‐analysis was not conducted.\n\n【17】For other symptoms ( _uncertainty, pain, sexually‐related symptoms, dyspnoea,_ and _general symptom experience_ ), evidence was limited; similarly meta‐analysis was not possible, and results from individual studies were largely conflicting, making conclusions about their management through telephone‐delivered interventions difficult to draw. Heterogeneity was considerable across all trials for all outcomes.\n\n【18】Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes in the review. Outcomes were all downgraded due to concerns about overall risk of bias profiles being frequently unclear, uncertainty in effect estimates and due to some inconsistencies in results and general heterogeneity.\n\n【19】Unsubstantiated evidence suggests that telephone interventions in some capacity may have a place in symptom management for adults with cancer. However, in the absence of reliable and homogeneous evidence, caution is needed in interpreting the narrative synthesis. Further, there were no clear patterns across studies regarding which forms of interventions (telephone alone versus augmented with other elements) are most effective. It is impossible to conclude with any certainty which forms of telephone intervention are most effective in managing the range of cancer‐related symptoms that people with cancer experience.\n\n【20】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【21】Telephone interventions provide a convenient way of supporting self‐management of cancer‐related symptoms for adults with cancer. These interventions are becoming more important with the shift of care closer to patients' homes, the need for resource/cost containment, and the potential for voluntary sector providers to deliver healthcare interventions. Some evidence supports the use of telephone‐delivered interventions for symptom management for adults with cancer; most evidence relates to four commonly experienced symptoms ‐ depression, anxiety, emotional distress, and fatigue. Some telephone‐delivered interventions were augmented by combining them with face‐to‐face meetings and provision of printed or digital materials. Review authors were unable to determine whether telephone alone or in combination with other elements provides optimal reduction in symptoms; it appears most likely that this will vary by symptom. It is noteworthy that, despite the potential for telephone interventions to deliver cost savings, none of the studies reviewed included any form of health economic evaluation.\n\n【22】Further robust and adequately reported trials are needed across all cancer‐related symptoms, as the certainty of evidence generated in studies within this review was very low, and reporting was of variable quality. Researchers must strive to reduce variability between studies in the future. Studies in this review are characterised by clinical and methodological diversity; the level of this diversity hindered comparison across studies. At the very least, efforts should be made to standardise outcome measures. Finally, studies were compromised by inclusion of small samples, inadequate concealment of group allocation, lack of observer blinding, and short length of follow‐up. Consequently, conclusions related to symptoms most amenable to management by telephone‐delivered interventions are tentative.\n\n【23】PICOs\n-----\n\n【24】### PICOs\n\n【25】###### Population (7)\n\n【26】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Cancer\n\n【27】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【28】*   Telephone delivered intervention\n\n【29】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【30】*   Usual Care\n*   Medical Consultation With Outpatient\n\n【31】###### Outcome (11)\n\n【32】*   Fatigue Impact Scale\n*   Emotional Distress\n*   Pain\n*   Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale\n*   Lung cancer\n*   Symptoms Of Depression\n*   Fatigue\n*   Nausea\n*   Anxiety\n*   Sexuality Related Problem\n*   Profile Of Mood States\n\n【33】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Symptoms can include depression, anxiety, fatigue and pain. These are often managed, day‐to‐day, by patients or their family members. If symptoms are not well managed, this can lead to other problems, such as difficulties in carrying out everyday tasks, poor sleep and poor quality of life.\n\n【40】Cancer professionals have developed psychological and educational treatments to help people to manage cancer symptoms. These treatments (or interventions) can be delivered by telephone (telephone interventions) in the patients’ homes instead of face‐to‐face in hospital.\n\n【41】**What questions does this review aim to answer?**  \nThis Cochrane Review aimed to answer the following questions.\n\n【42】1\\. Are telephone interventions for adults with cancer effective in relieving symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment?\n\n【43】2\\. Which symptoms are most reduced when telephone interventions are used?\n\n【44】3\\. What parts of telephone interventions have the most impact in reducing cancer symptoms?\n\n【45】In this review, telephone interventions were interventions given only, or mainly, by telephone. They were given by health professionals. As well as telephone contact, they could include face‐to‐face contact, or printed, digital or online information, such as, leaflets, computer programs and websites.\n\n【46】**How did we answer these questions?**  \nWe searched medical databases and journals to find all randomised controlled trials that used a telephone intervention to reduce any cancer symptoms. Randomised controlled trials allocate people randomly to one treatment or another; they provide the most reliable evidence. Studies could compare telephone interventions with another telephone intervention, with another type of intervention (e.g. face‐to‐face), or with usual care. Participants in these studies were adults with any kind of cancer at any stage.\n\n【47】**Results**  \nWe included 32 studies with a total of 6250 participants. Most studies (21) were from the USA. Nine studies recruited women with breast cancer, 11 included people with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer. Fourteen studies included people with early‐stage cancer. Nurses provided interventions in 24 studies. Only 10 studies delivered interventions solely by telephone, and 16 studies combined telephone calls with other materials (printed or digital). Studies measured symptoms of depression, anxiety, emotional distress, uncertainty, fatigue, pain, sexual symptoms, and breathlessness. They also measured the effect of all the symptoms together (the general symptom experience).\n\n【48】Most studies compared a telephone intervention with usual care alone or usual care with additional support. Eight studies compared two telephone interventions against each other; some also compared these with usual care.\n\n【49】Because the studies were so different from each other, we could not combine the results into one analysis for each symptom. However, some studies measured changes in symptoms using standardised or similar scales. They recorded participants’ scale scores at the beginning of the intervention, during the intervention, and at the end, resulting in a ‘change score’. We analysed the results from studies that recorded change scores.\n\n【50】**What does evidence from the review tell us?**  \nTwenty‐one studies provided evidence on depression compared to usual care or other interventions, but only nine provided change scores. These found that telephone interventions appeared to reduce symptoms of depression. Likewise, telephone interventions appeared effective compared to usual care or other interventions in reducing anxiety (16 studies; 5 contributed change scores); fatigue (9 studies; 6 contributed change scores); and emotional distress (7 studies; 5 contributed change scores).\n\n【51】Evidence for other symptoms was limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions.\n\n【52】**Certainty of the evidence**  \nTelephone interventions appear to relieve some symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment, however, the studies were small and very different from each other, so our confidence (certainty) in the evidence is very low. It is unclear whether telephone interventions alone, or combined with face‐to‐face meetings, or printed or audio materials, are most effective in reducing the many symptoms that people with cancer experience.\n\n【53】**Conclusions**  \nTelephone interventions are convenient for patients, their families and healthcare workers but the results of our review were not conclusive. Further, rigorous research on this topic would help to answer our review questions.\n\n【54】**Search date**  \nThis review includes evidence published up to January 2019.\n\n【55】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【56】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【57】### Implications for practice\n\n【58】This review found some evidence supporting use of telephone‐delivered interventions for managing cancer‐related symptoms ‐ most evidence is related to managing anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, or fatigue. This would suggest that telephone interventions should be considered as one component for managing these cancer‐related symptoms. Arguably, these interventions would not need to be provided within statutory services; they could be provided by voluntary sector providers, who frequently provide patients support and information via health professional‐delivered telephone help lines. We found limited evidence regarding potential management of some symptoms by telephone‐delivered intervention, notably regarding sexually‐related symptoms and pain.\n\n【59】Interventions evaluated in this review varied considerably in terms of (1) the number of calls provided; (2) the length and timing of calls; (3) the content of calls; and (4) provision or not of additional supportive material. It appears that for some symptoms (i.e. depressive symptoms), telephone‐only interventions may be indicated. However, given the small, mostly biased studies ‐ and lack of meta‐analysis ‐ this conclusion is tentative. For other symptoms, arguably those for which greater behaviour change may be required (e.g. fatigue), it may be the case that additional supportive materials are required to optimise outcomes. It has not been possible however through this review to conclude how many calls, delivered over what period, of particular duration and content, are required to generate effect. It appears that it may be beneficial for those delivering interventions to be trained in motivational interviewing skills.\n\n【60】It is noteworthy that most studies included within the review did not target samples with high baseline symptom burden. Arguably, it would be wise to do so, as there could be greater possibility for symptom reduction in such patient groups and greater associated cost savings.\n\n【61】Healthcare services are facing an unprecedented level of austerity that is likely to persist given ageing communities and finite health expenditure. There is a requirement for care to shift closer to home, and for cost containment to be applied. Telephone‐delivered interventions could make an important contribution to both requirements. Further research is needed to determine clearly which symptoms are most amenable to be managed through telephone‐delivered interventions, which patients should be targeted to achieve clinically important and sustained benefit, and which interventions are most cost‐effective.\n\n【62】There is risk of bias in the studies reported on in this review (most studies were at risk of some bias). When considered alongside other factors including between‐study heterogeneity and imprecise estimates of effect, the overall certainty of evidence is best considered very low, as we are very uncertain about the estimates. A lot of the heterogeneity was due to different cancer sites. Thus, the review findings need to be interpreted with a degree of caution. Consistency between this review and that of Chen 2018 is however encouraging and can lend support to the conclusions drawn.\n\n【63】### Implications for research\n\n【64】Further work is necessary to determine:\n\n【65】*   which cancer‐related symptoms are amenable to management by telephone‐delivered intervention; particular attention needs to be directed towards symptoms that have been subject to little research (e.g. sexually‐related symptoms, dyspnoea);\n    \n*   what augmentation of telephone‐delivered interventions (e.g. with face‐to‐face meetings or additional resources) works, and in what particular circumstances;\n    \n*   cost implications of delivering interventions by telephone to manage cancer‐related symptoms;\n    \n*   consensus on the most appropriate measures to be used to measure outcomes and minimal clinically important differences for each one;\n    \n*   consensus on standardising reporting of the intervention theory underpinning the intervention and its components;\n    \n*   longevity of effects generated by telephone‐delivered interventions for cancer‐related symptoms;\n    \n*   effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions in reducing fear of recurrence (a phenomenon that is increasingly being written about in the literature but is not deemed a symptom and thus was excluded from this review); and\n    \n*   effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions for enhancing quality of life for people with cancer.\n    \n\n【66】Future research is needed to address methodological limitations identified in the included studies. Notably, future randomised controlled trials need to have better methodological conduct and design to minimise risk of bias and to provide more extensive reporting of pertinent outcomes. Further, they need sufficient statistical power and length of follow‐up to generate much needed definitive evidence concerning efficacy of telephone‐delivered interventions for management of cancer symptoms across diverse patient groups.\n\n【67】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【68】Open in table viewer\n\n【69】Summary of findings 1.

As much cancer treatment is delivered on an ambulatory basis, patients and family members are largely responsible for their day‐to‐day management ( Dodd 2000; McPherson 2014 ). Inadequate symptom management can result in early discontinuation of, or delays in, treatment ( Cleeland 2009 ), and it has considerable implications for patient outcomes including functioning, psychological well‐being, and quality of life ( Dodd 2001; Glover 1995; Laugsand 2011 ).\n\n【77】Symptoms often manifest concurrently and appear related to one another. Symptom clusters ‐ where three or more related symptoms manifest concurrently ( Dodd 2001 ) ‐ have become the subject of much contemporary research, with some evidence suggesting that they may have prognostic capabilities or may influence cancer outcomes ( Cheville 2010 ). It is estimated that 40% of oncology patients experience more than one symptom at any one time ( Kim 2009 ), and that as disease progresses, symptom burden rises. One study of 1000 people with cancer admitted to a palliative care unit determined that people experienced differing numbers of symptoms on admission, ranging between 1 and 29. However, the median number of symptoms that people presented with was 11 ( Walsh 2000 ).\n\n【78】Attempts to reduce the incidence and severity of cancer symptoms have involved the development and testing of psycho‐educational interventions to enhance patients' symptom self‐management. These interventions may include therapeutic elements such as information exchange, problem‐solving, coping skills training, and facilitating expression of emotions and concerns ( Barsevick 2002 ). Although traditionally delivered face‐to‐face, interventions are increasingly being delivered by telephone (e.g. Freeman 2015 ), online (e.g. Steel 2016 ), or by mobile phone (e.g. Kearney 2009 ). These alternative modes of delivery are convenient for health professionals and patients alike. Integral to these is the delivery of supportive, interactive care provided by health professionals that provides patients with information about symptom management and support and encouragement in adopting effective self‐care.\n\n【79】### Description of the intervention\n\n【80】This review evaluates the effectiveness of telephone interventions delivered to people with cancer, with the aim of improving symptoms of the disease and/or its treatment. These interventions are typically educational or psychologically based in nature and may entail cognitive‐behavioural, motivational, or supportive elements to facilitate patient management of symptoms. They can be delivered to patients alone or in conjunction with informal carers (family or friends). Further, they can be supplemented with face‐to‐face contact with health professionals and digital/online/printed educational materials.\n\n【81】Such interventions are gaining in popularity as health systems worldwide are challenged fiscally from having to care for increasingly ageing populations with limited available resources and soaring pharmacological and other healthcare costs. Interventions delivered by telephone are feasible and acceptable to patients and offer health services a cheaper alternative to interventions delivered face‐to‐face.\n\n【82】#### How the intervention might work\n\n【83】Telephone interventions for symptom management may vary in terms of the symptom(s) they address, the theoretical frameworks underpinning them, the length of time over which they are delivered, and the training/qualifications of persons providing the telephone contact. However, whatever their make‐up, telephone interventions are united in their potential for providing timely information and support to promote behaviour change and/or adherence with prescribed medications and/or recommended self‐care, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\n【84】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【85】Although historically, information and support in managing symptoms were delivered face‐to‐face, increasingly this is not the case. The trend is for care to be provided nearer patients' homes, meaning that people with cancer are typically seeing hospital‐based staff less often. Thus, there is a greater requirement for information and support in symptom management to be provided by other means, such as by telephone. Telephone interventions have been developed for a range of cancer symptoms ( Scura 2004 ). Early indications suggest that these interventions have benefit, as they:\n\n【86】*   reduce symptom severity;\n    \n*   reduce symptom distress;\n    \n*   enhance self‐management of symptoms; and\n    \n*   facilitate adaptation to symptoms.\n    \n\n【87】However, evidence published to date has not been subject to rigorous systematic review. Four previous literature reviews have explored allied topics. Cox 2003 and Dickinson 2014 appraised and synthesised literature related to cancer follow‐up (by telephone and through use of technology, respectively). Gotay 1998 reviewed outcomes of psychosocial support provided by telephone, and Galway 2012 reviewed psychosocial interventions (but did not focus on their delivery by telephone). Thus, none of these reviews explicitly analysed literature specifically evaluating telephone‐delivered interventions for cancer symptoms. Further, the Gotay 1998 and Cox 2003 reviews are very much out‐of‐date. Thus, there is good justification to undertake a Cochrane systematic review to explore the effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions for cancer symptoms.\n\n【88】Objectives\n----------\n\n【89】To assess the effectiveness of telephone‐delivered interventions for reducing symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. To determine which symptoms are most responsive to telephone interventions. To determine whether certain configurations (e.g. with/without additional support such as face‐to‐face, printed or electronic resources) and duration/frequency of intervention calls mediate observed cancer symptom outcome effects.\n\n【90】Methods\n-------\n\n【91】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【92】#### Types of studies\n\n【93】Randomised control trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that:\n\n【94】*   compared a telephone intervention with other types of interventions (e.g. a face‐to‐face intervention) and/or usual care; or\n    \n*   compared different models of telephone interventions (i.e. with different content) against each other and/or a third arm comprising usual care.\n    \n\n【95】#### Types of participants\n\n【96】We included studies evaluating telephone interventions for adult men and women (over 18 years of age) with a clinical diagnosis of cancer, regardless of tumour type, stage of disease, type of treatment, and time of recruitment (e.g. before, during, or after anticancer treatment).\n\n【97】We excluded studies that did not focus on cancer patients, or in which only a portion of the sample consisted of cancer patients.\n\n【98】#### Types of interventions\n\n【99】We included telephone interventions comprising any number of telephone calls delivered by any health or social care professional to cancer patients, with the stated aim of addressing any physical or psychological symptoms of cancer and its treatment. The interventions were referred to by study author(s) as psychological, psychosocial, psycho‐educational, non‐pharmacological, or supportive.\n\n【100】We excluded interventions that:\n\n【101】*   were not primarily delivered by telephone (e.g. the main form of contact was face‐to‐face and the patient received a single telephone call to monitor progress), although we did include telephone interventions supported with printed/digital/online materials;\n    \n*   aimed to improve patients' general well‐being or adaptation to cancer including managing fear of recurrence (a common concern following cancer) (i.e. interventions that were not aimed primarily at improving cancer symptoms);\n    \n*   evaluated triaging or monitoring care or treatment compliance; or\n    \n*   were not delivered by a health or social care professional, or if details of the background of the person delivering the intervention could not be obtained.\n    \n\n【102】Some interventions within the review incorporated elements other than telephone support. Thus, we categorised them according to whether they comprised solely telephone intervention or included additional supportive elements (e.g. face‐to‐face consultation, printed materials).\n\n【103】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【104】We included data related to symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment, measured by standardised instruments that measured symptoms related to cancer with some evidence of validity and reliability.\n\n【105】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【106】*   Anxiety (measured by validated instruments such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) or the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI))\n    \n*   Depressive symptoms (measured by validated instruments such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); or the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D))\n    \n*   Emotional distress (measured by validated instruments such as the Profile of Mood States (POMS))\n    \n*   Uncertainty from being diagnosed with, and treated for, cancer (as measured by validated instruments such as the Mischel Uncertainty in Illness Scale)\n    \n*   Fatigue (measured by validated instruments such as the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI); the Multi‐dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI); or the Piper Fatigue Scale)\n    \n*   Pain (measured by validated instruments such as the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI))\n    \n*   Nausea/ vomiting (measured by validated instruments such as the Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching (INVR))\n    \n*   Sexually‐related symptoms (measured by validated instruments such as the Index of Sexual Satisfaction; the Female Sexual Function Index; or the International Index of Erectile Function)\n    \n*   Lung cancer symptoms (measured by validated instruments such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ‐ Lung Cancer (FACT‐L) or the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) for dyspnoea items)\n    \n\n【107】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【108】*   Symptom experience\n    \n*   Symptom distress (as measured by validated instruments such as the General Symptom Distress Scale)\n    \n\n【109】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【110】We applied no language restriction for this review, so non‐English publications were to be translated if necessary. This was not needed.\n\n【111】#### Electronic searches\n\n【112】We searched the following databases.\n\n【113】*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1), in the Cochrane Library ( Appendix 1 ).\n    \n*   MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to January 2019) ( Appendix 2 ).\n    \n*   Embase via OVID (1980 to January 2019) ( Appendix 3 ).\n    \n*   Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via Athens (1982 to January 2019).\n    \n*   British Nursing Index (1984 to January 2019).\n    \n*   PsycINFO (1989 to January 2019).\n    \n\n【114】The search strategies are provided in the appendices.\n\n【115】#### Searching other resources\n\n【116】We searched conference proceedings to identify published abstracts, along with SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) and trial registers for unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of all included articles to identify additional relevant studies. Finally, we handsearched the following journals from 2007 to 2019.\n\n【117】*   _Cancer_ .\n    \n*   _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ .\n    \n*   _Psycho‐oncology_ .\n    \n*   _Cancer Practice_ .\n    \n*   _Cancer Nursing_ .\n    \n*   _Oncology Nursing Forum_ .\n    \n*   _Journal of Pain and Symptom Management_ .\n    \n*   _Palliative Medicine_ .\n    \n\n【118】We found no additional studies, We found the studies identified for this review from the databases listed above.\n\n【119】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【120】#### Selection of studies\n\n【121】Two review authors (from the pool of AEH, VHP, AC, KC, and ER) independently assessed the potential relevance of all titles and abstracts identified through the literature searches. We retrieved in full text studies identified by either review author as potentially relevant. Two review authors (of AEH, VHP, AC, and ER) independently assessed each of these studies against the review inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third review author resolved disagreements. Studies that appeared eligible for inclusion but were subsequently judged to not meet the selection criteria were detailed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table, including the specific reason(s) for exclusion (e.g. intervention not delivered by health or social care professionals).\n\n【122】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【123】We used standardised data extraction forms to extract all available data. Two independent review authors extracted data from each included study. We checked the forms against each other, and when we noted discrepancies, we referred to the original papers. We addressed unresolved discrepancies through discussion and consensus, involving the entire review team when necessary. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We extracted and reported on the following data.\n\n【124】*   Geographic location.\n    \n*   Sample demography (age, gender, tumour type, disease stage, treatment).\n    \n*   Number of participants (including those lost to follow‐up).\n    \n*   Details of randomisation and allocation concealment.\n    \n*   Aim of the intervention.\n    \n*   Details of the intervention (number and frequency of telephone calls; duration of calls; health or social care professional(s) delivering intervention; incorporation of additional elements (face‐to‐face contacts, printed/digital/online materials, email contact)).\n    \n*   Details of control/usual care.\n    \n*   Primary and secondary outcome measures.\n    \n*   Time points at which outcomes were collected and reported (frequency, length of follow‐up).\n    \n*   Reported statistics used to assess validity of results.\n    \n*   Quality assurance processes used to ensure uniformity of intervention delivery (e.g. if intervention providers were trained and/or supervised; if a protocol was used; if an integrity check was described).\n    \n\n【125】When possible, all data extracted were those relevant to an intention‐to‐treat analysis in which participants were analysed in the groups to which they were assigned. When study authors reported on the same piece of research in a series of publications, we considered the main study as the one that depicted the study design in detail and reported on primary outcomes of the study.\n\n【126】We managed data using Review Manager 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【127】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【128】All review authors independently assessed and reported potential bias for each trial using the data extraction form. A third review author (ER) resolved any conflicts. We used the following criteria from the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ as a guide for assessment.\n\n【129】*   Random sequence generation.\n    \n*   Allocation concealment.\n    \n*   Blinding of participant, providers, outcome assessors, data analysts.\n    \n*   Completeness of outcome data; adequate if less than 20% of patients were lost to follow‐up and reasons for loss to follow‐up were similar in both treatment arms.\n    \n*   Selective reporting/intention‐to‐treat analysis.\n    \n*   Other potential sources of bias.\n    \n\n【130】We incorporated results of the assessment into the review through systematic narrative description and commentary about each of these domains. Further, we constructed a risk of bias graph ( Figure 1 ) and a risk of bias summary ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【131】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【132】Figure 1\n\n【133】* * *\n\n【134】* * *\n\n【135】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【136】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【137】Figure 2\n\n【138】* * *\n\n【139】* * *\n\n【140】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【141】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【142】We processed data in accordance with guidance provided by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . We analysed all outcomes in the review (anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, fatigue, pain, uncertainty, sexually‐related issues) as continuous variables, reflecting how they were presented by study authors. As some studies had small samples, and because baseline scores for study outcomes tended to vary between intervention and control, we determined to input change scores and their associated standard deviations into the analyses. We extracted these statistics (when reported) and analysed them alongside (1) baseline, endpoint, and follow‐up mean scores and associated standard deviations of outcomes of interest; (2) P values; and (3) numbers of patients who provided data at each assessment point to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) of change scores between treatment arms and its standard error.\n\n【143】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【144】We did not impute missing outcome data for any of the outcomes other than to calculate missing standard deviations of change scores, as few authors reported these. We imputed these values using the approach of Follmann 1992 and Abrams 2005 , as detailed in Section 16.1.3.2 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . This entailed calculating the correlation coefficient from one study in the symptom group that reported study outcomes in detail ‐ including the standard deviation of the change score ‐ and then using the summary statistics to determine standard deviation of change from baseline across other studies. Two study authors provided sufficient detail to enable calculation of standard deviations of change scores for symptoms of anxiety, depression, emotional distress, and fatigue ( Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Ream 2015 ).\n\n【145】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【146】We assessed and found considerable heterogeneity in included studies in terms of (1) interventions introduced; (2) types of participants; and (3) outcomes measured. All interventions were delivered primarily by telephone, but some also incorporated face‐to‐face elements and/or printed, digital, or online materials. Interventions varied in length and frequency and were provided at different times in the cancer journey from treatment to survivorship. There was some standardisation with regards to outcomes measured.\n\n【147】We did not assess methodological and statistical heterogeneity due to considerable clinical heterogeneity across trials. Most studies compared a telephone intervention with usual care, five compared two different interventions with usual care ( Badger 2007 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Thomas 2012 ), and six compared two interventions without a usual care arm ( Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Chambers 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Watson 2017 ).\n\n【148】For future updates, we plan to assess statistical heterogeneity between study outcomes by visually inspecting forest plots and by calculating the I² statistic (estimation of the percentage of heterogeneity between trials that cannot be ascribed to sampling variation ( Higgins 2003 )), and when possible, by conducting subgroup analyses (see later). If we find evidence of substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate and report the possible reasons for this.\n\n【149】#### Data synthesis\n\n【150】We did not perform meta‐analyses due to considerable heterogeneity.\n\n【151】For future updates of the review, we will do the following.\n\n【152】*   We will use random‐effects models with inverse variance weighting for all meta‐analyses ( DerSimonian 1986 ).\n    \n*   We will calculate SMDs in outcomes between telephone and control groups (rather than mean differences, if appropriate) to take account of the different scales used across studies to measure different symptom outcomes.\n    \n*   When we are unable to obtain required data to incorporate studies into meta‐analyses, or when we identify insufficient studies related to management of a particular symptom, we will continue to report study findings in a narrative fashion.\n    \n\n【153】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【154】For future updates, we will present subgroups on forest plots and will aim to determine whether there is a difference in outcomes according to whether telephone interventions are provided on their own or in conjunction with other elements (e.g. printed materials, face‐to‐face meetings).\n\n【155】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【156】We found an insufficient number of studies (and no meta‐analyses were conducted) to allow review authors to undertake sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of including/excluding studies with high risk of bias (e.g. as a result of inadequate concealment of allocation).\n\n【157】Results\n-------\n\n【158】### Description of studies\n\n【159】See Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【160】#### Results of the search\n\n【161】After duplicates and clearly irrelevant articles were eliminated, the electronic and manual search (to January 2019) yielded 78 studies that were potentially eligible for inclusion. After assessing the full text of studies against the inclusion criteria, we excluded 45 studies, leaving 33 studies for inclusion in the review. Gil 2006 was nested in the Mishel 2005 study because it reported on long‐term outcomes of this study. The PRISMA flow chart is presented in Figure 3 .\n\n【162】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【163】Figure 3\n\n【164】* * *\n\n【165】* * *\n\n【166】Study flow diagram.\n\n【167】#### Included studies\n\n【168】##### Study design\n\n【169】We included 31 randomised controlled trials (RCTs); the final study employed a repeated‐measures experimental design but did not use random principles for assignment to intervention and control groups ( Badger 2005 ). Ten studies appeared adequately powered (i.e. study authors had determined the sample size required to show effect and had managed to recruit to this target) ( Allard 2007 ; Chambers 2014 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ). Three further studies calculated sample sizes required, but due to under‐recruitment ( Livingston 2010 ; Watson 2017 ), or higher than predicted attrition ( Thomas 2012 ), these studies were underpowered. Most studies did not specify required sample size to attain adequate power. Five were pilot studies with small sample sizes ( Badger 2005 ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ).\n\n【170】Most studies compared a telephone‐delivered intervention with usual care. However, of the included studies, five compared an intervention delivered via telephone with an attentional, rather than usual care, control ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ). A further study provided a wait‐list control whereby participants in the control group received the intervention on completion of study assessments ( Reese 2014 ). Four studies compared a telephone‐delivered intervention against augmented usual care, which incorporated additional elements including passive referral to a help line; education/support; nutrition information; or extra information about symptoms reported by patients given to the treating oncologist ( Barsevick 2004 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ). Six studies compared two/three interventions but incorporated no control group ( Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Chambers 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Watson 2017 ). One was an equivalence trial ( Watson 2017 ). Eight studies included three study arms that incorporated telephone‐delivered intervention(s) with alternative intervention with/without a control group (usual care or attentional control) ( Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Thomas 2012 ).\n\n【171】##### Contact with study authors\n\n【172】We contacted five study authors to clarify issues around provision of the intervention; we subsequently excluded two articles from the review, as data obtained from the study author made it clear that these studies were ineligible. We included three studies once the nature of the interventions and who delivered them were clarified ( Badger 2013a ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ). Further, we contacted one study author with regards to the Mishel 2002 study, to query numbers of participants in each study arm.\n\n【173】##### Sample size\n\n【174】Sample sizes ranged from 23 in Reese 2014 to 575 in Mishel 2005 , with a total of 6250 cancer patients recruited across the 32 studies.\n\n【175】##### Setting\n\n【176】Twenty‐one studies were conducted in the USA ( Allen 2002 ; Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ). Four were conducted in Australia ( Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Yates 2005 ), two in Canada ( Allard 2007 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ), three in the UK ( Molassiotis 2009 ; Ream 2015 ; Watson 2017 ), and one in China ( Dong 2018 ), and one recruited across two countries ‐ Australia and Canada ( Livingston 2010 ).\n\n【177】##### Participants\n\n【178】Nine studies addressed breast cancer exclusively ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Mishel 2005 ; Reese 2018 ; Yates 2005 ), three solely recruited men with prostate cancer ( Bailey 2004 ; Chambers 2015 ; Mishel 2002 ), three recruited only lung cancer patients ( Badr 2015 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ), and two recruited only people diagnosed with colorectal cancer ( Dong 2018 ; Reese 2014 ).\n\n【179】Eleven studies included heterogeneous samples of cancer patients, most commonly with a combination of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer ( Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ); four studies did not specify the type of cancer diagnosis patients had received ( Barsevick 2004 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ).\n\n【180】In addition to including people with cancer, 11 studies addressed partners or carers of cancer patients; five included partners of women with breast cancer ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Reese 2018 ), one included partners of men with prostate cancer ( Chambers 2015 ), one included partners of patients treated for colorectal cancer ( Reese 2014 ), one included partners of people diagnosed with lung cancer ( Badr 2015 ), two included carers of people diagnosed with lung cancer ( Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ), and one included carers of people with a range of cancers ( Chambers 2014 ). Outcomes for the partners/carers reported in these studies are not included in this review.\n\n【181】Most studies (n = 14) recruited patients with early‐stage cancer. Remaining studies recruited patients with early/locally advanced cancer (n = 2) ( Badger 2005 ; Reese 2018 ), or people with advanced cancer (n = 4) ( Badr 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Sherwood 2005 ), or they did not (n = 11) specify the disease stage for eligible patients ( Badger 2005 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Dong 2018 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Thomas 2012 ; Watson 2017 ). One study specifically targeted cancer survivors who were between five and nine years post treatment ( Mishel 2005 ).\n\n【182】Most studies recruited consecutive patients irrespective of symptom intensity; few (n = 6) recruited people whose symptoms had attained a threshold level ( Chambers 2014 ; Dong 2018 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ).\n\n【183】##### Symptoms\n\n【184】Interventions introduced across studies aimed to reduce a variety of symptoms caused by cancer and its treatment; psychological and emotional symptoms were frequently assessed. Sixteen studies measured effects of telephone‐delivered interventions on anxiety ( Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 : Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ). Depressive symptoms was an outcome measured in 21 studies ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 : Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ). Seven studies focused more broadly on emotional distress ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002; Bailey 2004 ; Chambers 2014 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2005 ). Finally, three interventions aimed to alleviate uncertainty resulting from diagnosis of, and treatment for, cancer ( Bailey 2004 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ).\n\n【185】With regards to symptoms with a physical element, nine studies measured the impact of interventions on fatigue ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2013b ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Ream 2015 ; Yates 2005 ), six on cancer‐related pain ( Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 : Thomas 2012 ), three on sexuallly‐related symptoms ( Chambers 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ), and two on dyspnoea ( Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ).\n\n【186】Ten studies measured general symptom experience and reported overall symptom intensity and/or symptom distress ( Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Traeger 2015 ).\n\n【187】Many symptoms were incorporated as secondary outcomes across studies. For example, a study evaluating a telephone‐delivered intervention for fatigue may also have incorporated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes.\n\n【188】##### Intervention format\n\n【189】A summary of intervention characteristics is provided in the table titled Characteristics of included studies . All interventions were delivered primarily by telephone to participants in their homes. However, only ten were delivered solely by telephone ( Allard 2007 ; Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Bailey 2004 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Livingston 2010 ; Reese 2014 ; Traeger 2015 ).\n\n【190】Sixteen of the remaining study interventions were delivered by telephone in combination with printed materials and/or online/digital materials ( Badger 2013a ; Badr 2015 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Watson 2017 ).\n\n【191】Two studies combined telephone calls with face‐to‐face sessions ( Molassiotis 2009 ; Sherwood 2005 ), and three combined telephone calls with both face‐to‐face sessions and digital/printed materials ( Allen 2002 ; Rawl 2002 ; Yates 2005 ). One final study evaluated an intervention that incorporated automated symptom monitoring and prescribing recommendations (regarding depressive symptoms and fatigue) made to participants by oncologists, in addition to telephone calls ( Kroenke 2010 ).\n\n【192】##### Health professionals delivering interventions\n\n【193】Most interventions (n = 24) were delivered by nurses ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 , Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ), including:\n\n【194】*   oncology nurses ( Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 );\n    \n*   research nurses ( Allen 2002 ; Barsevick 2004 ); and\n    \n*   psychiatric nurses ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ).\n    \n\n【195】Eight studies did not specify the specialty or training of nurses who delivered the interventions ( Allard 2007 ; Bailey 2004 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 ). In nine studies, the nurses had received training in other skills necessary for intervention delivery, including counselling ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Ream 2015 ), communication ( Chambers 2015 ), and education ( Kroenke 2010 ).\n\n【196】In nine studies, interventions were delivered by professionals other than nurses. These included psychologists ( Chambers 2014 ; Dong 2018 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Watson 2017 ), social workers ( Badger 2013a ; Mosher 2016 ), a mental health counsellor ( Badr 2015 ), and master's prepared social workers and para‐professionals/psychologists/counsellors ( Badger 2013b ).\n\n【197】##### Theoretical basis of interventions\n\n【198】Twenty‐one studies used theoretical models to inform the telephone intervention: Self‐Regulation Theory ( Allard 2007 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ), Interpersonal Therapy ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ), the Stress Process Model ( Badger 2013b ), the Common Sense Model of Illness ( Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ), the Transtheoretical Model ( Thomas 2012 ), Self‐Determination Theory ( Badr 2015 ), Cognitive‐Behavioural Theory/Coping Skills Training ( Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Porter 2011 ; Sherwood 2005 ), the PRECEDE Model of Health Behaviour ( Yates 2005 ), Social Cognitive Theory ( Mosher 2016 ), the Theory of Uncertainty in Illness ( Bailey 2004 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ), and the Cognitive‐Behavioural and Sex Therapy Theory ( Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ).\n\n【199】The theoretical basis informing the design of the interventions was unclear ‐ or unreported ‐ in 11 studies ( Allen 2002 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ). Although Allen 2002 did not specify the theoretical basis for the intervention provided, the intervention model for this study was based around problem‐solving and made use of motivational techniques in its delivery. Finally, Sikorskii 2007 employed a multi‐dimensional interactive approach, which drew on various strategies around coping, re‐framing, providing education, and eliciting support for adapting to, or overcoming, cancer‐related symptoms.\n\n【200】##### Number of calls/duration/timing\n\n【201】Most (n = 29) of the interventions provided a standardised number of telephone calls to participants; these ranged from one call in Chambers 2014 to 18 calls delivered weekly over 18 weeks in Molassiotis 2009 . In the remaining three studies, the number of calls provided varied by need ( Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Watson 2017 ), or the numbers of calls and the intervals between them were unclear ( Girgis 2009 ).\n\n【202】Although most (n = 17) intervention calls were delivered weekly, three interventions were delivered every other week ( Allen 2002 ; Rawl 2002 ; Thomas 2012 ). One intervention delivered three calls over three successive cycles of chemotherapy ( Ream 2015 ), one provided four calls over two successive cycles of chemotherapy ( Traeger 2015 ), and seven others provided a series of calls with increasing time intervals between them ( Chambers 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Porter 2011 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ). In one study, calls were made over a three‐month period at participants' convenience ( Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ), and in another, up to eight calls were again scheduled over an approximate 12‐week period ( Watson 2017 ). Finally, Chambers 2014 made five calls but did not specify the timing of these calls.\n\n【203】Most frequently, the intervention comprised three or four calls ( Allen 2002 ; Badger 2013a ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2005 ; Mosher 2016 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ). In three studies, participants received more than 10 calls: Porter 2011 delivered 14; Molassiotis 2009 provided 18; and although Kroenke 2010 planned to deliver four calls, automated symptom reports with high symptom scores triggered extra calls ‐ participants received on average 11 calls.\n\n【204】Twenty‐two studies reported the duration of calls provided ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ); duration ranged on average from 10 minutes in Yates 2005 to 70 minutes in Reese 2018 .\n\n【205】##### Recording and documentation of calls\n\n【206】Only 15 studies recorded telephone calls in some way for quality assurance ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 , Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Traeger 2015 ). Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 assessed fidelity by reviewing the interventionist's notes to determine goals recorded and degree of problem‐solving achieved. Watson 2017 addressed fidelity by observing some of the intervention sessions.\n\n【207】Telephone calls were additionally documented in some way as part of the intervention (not explicitly for quality purposes): two used patient‐completed worksheets completed after calls ( Allen 2002 ; Badger 2007 ); four obtained feedback surveys/documentation completed on a computer or via a touchpad telephone ( Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Sikorskii 2007 ); one reviewed and assigned homework during intervention calls ( Badr 2015 ); another required the nurse delivering the intervention to keep a diary recording participants' engagement with calls ( Ream 2015 ); and two used patient diaries completed between telephone calls to help tailor the intervention ( Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ).\n\n【208】#### Excluded studies\n\n【209】In the Characteristics of excluded studies table, we list the 45 studies excluded after assessment of full text (according to the criteria specified at Types of interventions ) and specify the reasons for exclusion.\n\n【210】We excluded studies primarily because:\n\n【211】*   they did not address management of symptoms (n = 21); or\n    \n*   interventions were not delivered primarily by telephone (n = 12).\n    \n\n【212】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【213】Assessments of risk of bias and methodological certainty are provided in the Characteristics of included studies table and the Risk of bias graph ( Figure 1 ).\n\n【214】Here we summarise risk of bias.\n\n【215】*   Adequate sequence generation: fulfilled in 22 studies ( Allard 2007 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   Allocation concealment: fulfilled in 10 studies ( Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   Blinding: fulfilled in six studies ( Kroenke 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Sherwood 2005 ).\n    \n*   Incomplete outcome data assessed: fulfilled in 17 studies ( Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   Free of selective reporting: fulfilled in 30 studies ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2014 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Thomas 2012 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   Other bias: detected in 12 studies ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Chambers 2014 ; Dong 2018 ; Mishel 2005 ; Porter 2011 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n\n【216】### Effects of interventions\n\n【217】See: **Summary of findings 1** Summary of findings\n\n【218】#### 1\\. Findings by symptom\n\n【219】##### 1.1 Anxiety; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【220】Sixteen studies measured effects of their interventions on anxiety ( Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ). These studies used several different validated scales.\n\n【221】*   Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Ream 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   State version of the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ( Badger 2013b ; Rawl 2002 ).\n    \n*   Trait Anxiety version of the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ( Porter 2011 ).\n    \n*   Anxiety subscale of the Profile of Mood States ‐ Short Form ( Bailey 2004 ).\n    \n*   Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) (Chinese version) ( Dong 2018 ).\n    \n*   Self‐Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) (Chinese version) ( Dong 2018 ).\n    \n*   Investigator‐designed instrument composed of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Short Form‐12 (SF‐12) Scale, and the Index of Clinical Stress (ICS) ( Badger 2007 ).\n    \n*   6‐item Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short form anxiety measure ( Badr 2015 ).\n    \n*   2‐item Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD‐2) Scale ( Traeger 2015 ); 7‐item Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD‐7) Scale ( Mosher 2016 ; Reese 2018 ).\n    \n\n【222】In nine studies, anxiety was a primary outcome ( Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Watson 2017 ). Two of these ( Badger 2007 ; Badr 2015 ), plus three studies in which anxiety was a secondary outcome ( Bailey 2004 ; Dong 2018 ; Ream 2015 ), provided data from 277 participants that reported change scores and associated standard deviations ‐ or these could be calculated. Dong 2018 measured anxiety outcomes with two measures (HAMA and SAS); only those related to SAS are displayed on the forest plot. This decision was based on the allied Self‐Rating Depression Scale, which was used to power the study. Three individual studies appeared to suggest that use of a telephone had a significant impact on symptom management of anxiety in participants with various types of cancer ( Badger 2007 ; Badr 2015 ; Dong 2018 ), but another two trials found no evidence of a difference ( Bailey 2004 ; Ream 2015 ). We did not pool the overall effect estimates due to considerable heterogeneity, but we have depicted results of individual trials in the forest plot in Analysis 1.1 .\n\n【223】It is interesting to note that Dong 2018 , a three‐arm trial incorporating a telephone support arm in addition to telephone‐delivered reminiscence therapy and usual care control, determined that generic telephone support generated similar improvements in anxiety as telephone‐based reminiscence therapy.\n\n【224】Of the trials that did not report a magnitude of effect explicitly nor address baseline imbalance using change scores (or these and their associated standard deviations could not be calculated) ‐ and in which anxiety was a primary outcome ‐ three reported some effect on anxiety. Badger 2013b tested two different forms of telephone‐delivered intervention without usual care control. Although the study determined that interventions were associated with statistically significant decreases in anxiety, without a control group for comparison it is difficult to conclude that these improvements were generated by the intervention rather than by an alternative factor (including passage of time). Watson 2017 also had no control group, but this was an equivalence trial ‐ researchers were seeking to determine equivalence between standard and telephone‐delivered cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) in people with high psychological needs; conventional CBT has established efficacy. Watson 2017 determined that with regards to anxiety, telephone‐delivered and face‐to‐face CBT approaches were equally effective. Finally, Rawl 2002 , in the trial report, noted improvements in anxiety nearing statistical significance (P = 0.09). The other four studies did not detect any significant intervention effect ( Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ).\n\n【225】##### 1.2 Depressive symptoms; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【226】Twenty‐one studies measured effects of interventions on symptoms of depression ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Rawl 2002 ; Ream 2015 ; Reese 2018 ; Traeger 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ).\n\n【227】The following validated measurement scales were used to measure depressive symptoms.\n\n【228】*   Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D) ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Rawl 2002 ).\n    \n*   Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Ream 2015 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ).\n    \n*   Profile of Mood States ‐ Short Form (POMS‐SF) ( Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ).\n    \n*   Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) (Chinese version) ( Dong 2018 ).\n    \n*   Self‐Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (Chinese version) ( Dong 2018 ).\n    \n*   Depression severity subscale of the 36‐item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36) ( Kroenke 2010 ).\n    \n*   Short Form‐12 (SF‐12) ( Barsevick 2010 ).\n    \n*   Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL‐20) ( Kroenke 2010 ).\n    \n*   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) ( Kroenke 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Reese 2018 ).\n    \n*   2‐item Patient Health Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐2) ( Traeger 2015 ).\n    \n*   Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ( Porter 2011 ).\n    \n*   6‐item Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short‐form depression measure ( Badr 2015 ).\n    \n\n【229】In all but six studies ( Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Ream 2015 ; Traeger 2015 ; Yates 2005 ), depressive symptoms was the primary outcome. Nine studies, including 1059 participants, reported quantitative results such as change scores ‐ or data enabling these and their associated standard deviations to be calculated ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2007 ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Dong 2018 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Ream 2015 ) ( Analysis 1.2 ). Dong 2018 measured depressive symptom outcomes with two measures (HAMD and SDS); only those related to SDS were included in the forest plot. This decision was based on use of the SDS to power the study. Three of these studies had measured depression as a secondary outcome ( Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Ream 2015 ). Four individual studies appeared to suggest that use of a telephone had significant impact on symptom management of depression among participants with various types of cancer ( Badger 2007 ; Badr 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Kroenke 2010 ); Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 was of borderline significance. Many trials were small and underpowered and did not report magnitude of effect. We did not pool the overall effect estimates due to considerable heterogeneity, but we have depicted the results of individual trials in the forest plot in Analysis 1.2 .\n\n【230】Of trials that did not report a magnitude of effect explicitly nor address baseline imbalance using change scores (or these and their associated standard deviations could not be calculated) ‐ and that had symptoms of depression as a primary outcome ‐ four reported some improvement in the intervention arm. Rawl 2002 measured the impact of a telephone‐delivered intervention on depressive symptoms in patients with newly diagnosed cancer. Researchers found that patients who received the intervention had significantly fewer depressive symptoms (P = 0.05) midway through the intervention when compared to those in the usual care group, although this was not maintained. One month post intervention, the difference was no longer statistically significant (P = 0.07). Porter 2011 detected reduced symptoms of depression in lung cancer patients following provision of both of their two telephone‐delivered interventions (coping skills training (CST) versus education/support) (B = ‐5.55, standard error = 0.28, P = 0.05). As with the intervention's effects on anxiety, levels of depressive symptoms dropped more for patients with stage I cancer given the education/support intervention, and more for patients with stage II‐III cancer given the CST intervention (B = ‐2.38, standard error = 2.86, P = 0.006). Badger 2013a and Badger 2013b reported statistically significant decreases in depressive symptoms over time associated with delivery of two forms of telephone‐delivered intervention. However, neither study incorporated a usual care control for comparison. Finally, Watson 2017 , an equivalence trial comparing face‐to‐face and telephone‐delivered CBT, determined that the telephone‐delivered version generated a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms equivalent to that seen with CBT delivered in‐person.\n\n【231】Three studies whose primary outcome was reduced depressive symptoms found no significant reductions in these generated by the interventions ( Girgis 2009 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ).\n\n【232】##### 1.3 Fatigue; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【233】Nine studies reported on effects of interventions on fatigue. Six evaluated interventions delivered specifically to reduce fatigue ( Badger 2005 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Ream 2015 ; Yates 2005 ). Another three studies measured fatigue as a secondary outcome arising from the interventions ( Badger 2013b ; Bailey 2004 ; Molassiotis 2009 ).\n\n【234】Fatigue was measured using the following measurement tools.\n\n【235】*   Multi‐Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) ( Badger 2005 ; Badger 2013b ).\n    \n*   Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) ( Ream 2015 ).\n    \n*   Fatigue Distress Scale ( Ream 2015 ).\n    \n*   Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale ( Barsevick 2004 ).\n    \n*   General Fatigue Scale (GFS) ( Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ).\n    \n*   Profile of Mood States (POMS), fatigue subscale ( Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ).\n    \n*   National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI‐CTC) ‐ single item ( Molassiotis 2009 ).\n    \n*   Fatigue Symptom Inventory ( Mosher 2016 ).\n    \n\n【236】Six studies reported quantitative results including change scores ‐ or data enabling these and their associated standard deviations to be calculated ( Badger 2005 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Ream 2015 ; Yates 2005 ). All but Bailey 2004 incorporated fatigue as a primary outcome. Collectively, trial authors had attained data on 895 participants. Three of the individual studies appeared to suggest that use of the telephone had a significant impact on symptom management of fatigue for participants with various types of cancer ( Badger 2005 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Yates 2005 ). Although the intervention evaluated by Ream 2015 in a feasibility trial did not significantly reduce overall (global) fatigue, study authors reported that it did generate significant reductions in distress caused by the symptom (P < 0.05). Other studies found no evidence of any differences between arms ( Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ). We did not pool the overall effect estimates due to considerable heterogeneity, but we have depicted the results of individual trials in the forest plot in Analysis 1.3 .\n\n【237】Molassiotis 2009 reported significant reductions in fatigue generated by a telephone‐delivered home care intervention delivered weekly over 18 weeks to people given a course of oral capecitabine. However, differences in comparison with the usual care control declined over time. Greatest improvement in fatigue was found from cycle 0 to 2 (P = 0.005); by the end of treatment, these benefits were no longer statistically significant (P = 0.93). Badger 2013a , which evaluated two forms of telephone‐delivered health education and counselling (without usual care control), reported statistically significant reductions in fatigue (P < 0.05) through telephone‐delivered interventions. However, the pilot study Mosher 2016 did not detect any statistically significant benefit of a telephone‐delivered intervention aimed at reducing a broad range of symptoms associated with lung cancer (one of which was fatigue).\n\n【238】##### 1.4 Emotional distress; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【239】Seven studies investigated effects of interventions on emotional distress ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Bailey 2004 ; Chambers 2014 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Livingston 2010 ; Mishel 2005 ).\n\n【240】Definitions of emotional distress and tools used to measure it varied across studies. The following measurement tools were used.\n\n【241】*   Profile of Mood States (POMS) ( Allard 2007 ; Bailey 2004 ; Mishel 2005 ).\n    \n*   Brief Symptom Inventory‐18 (BSI‐18) ( Chambers 2014 ).\n    \n*   Medical Outcomes Study 36‐item Short Form (SF‐36), Mental Health Index subscale ( Allen 2002 ).\n    \n*   Derogatis Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale ‐ Self‐Report (PAIS‐SR) ( Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ).\n    \n*   Rosebaum's Self‐Control Schedule (SCS) ( Bailey 2004 ).\n    \n*   Investigator‐developed scale originally developed for breast cancer patients ( Livingston 2010 ).\n    \n\n【242】Five studies including 968 participants reported quantitative results including change scores ‐ or data enabling these and their associated standard deviations to be calculated ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Bailey 2004 ; Downe‐Wamboldt 2007 ; Mishel 2005 ) ( Analysis 1.4 ). None of these studies reached significance. We did not pool the overall effect estimates due to considerable heterogeneity, but we have depicted the results of individual trials in the forest plot in Analysis 1.4 .\n\n【243】Livingston 2010 evaluated effects of two telephone interventions on emotional distress but provided insufficient data to enable calculation of change scores (and standard deviations). Study authors report that although both interventions appeared to reduce cancer‐specific distress, neither generated statistically significant improvements when compared with the control. Chambers 2014 determined that both study arms (single‐session oncology nurse‐delivered telephone intervention and five‐session psychologist‐delivered telephone intervention) were associated with decreased emotional distress. However, once again, lack of a 'no treatment' control group renders it impossible to conclude whether this resulted from the interventions over other factors such as passage of time.\n\n【244】##### 1.5 Uncertainty; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【245】Three papers reported the impact of interventions on feelings of uncertainty in relation to a patient's illness ( Bailey 2004 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ). All three based their interventions on the same theoretical framework ‐ Mishel's Uncertainty Theory ‐ and focused on reducing uncertainty through strategies such as cognitive re‐framing of threatening events and problem‐solving strategies. These papers did not report change scores, or it was impossible to calculate these alongside the standard deviation of the change score, and meta‐analysis was not possible.\n\n【246】Uncertainty was measured using the following instruments.\n\n【247】*   Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Scale ( Mishel 2002 ).\n    \n*   Self‐Control Scale ‐ Problem‐Solving and Cognitive Re‐framing subscales ( Bailey 2004 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ).\n    \n*   Growth Through Uncertainty Scale (GTUS) ( Bailey 2004 ).\n    \n*   Confusion subscale of the Profile of Mood States ‐ Short Form (POMS‐SF) ( Bailey 2004 ).\n    \n\n【248】Bailey 2004 delivered a watchful waiting intervention by telephone to men with prostate cancer. Researchers detected no statistically significant differences between group overall scores for uncertainty management. However, the intervention group displayed a significant improvement on the 'New view of life' subscale compared to the usual care group (P = 0.02). Mishel 2002 also addressed uncertainty in men with prostate cancer; these investigators delivered two telephone‐delivered interventions to men following surgery for their disease. The interventions differed only in that one group had supplementary delivery of it to a close family member. Study authors reported significant improvements in uncertainty management (F\\[16,438\\] = 1.96; P = 0.01), cognitive re‐framing (F\\[4456\\] = 3.81; P = 0.005), and problem‐solving (F\\[4456\\] 2.40; P = 0.049) in both intervention groups when compared with the control group immediately following intervention delivery, but these differences were not maintained over time.\n\n【249】Later, Mishel 2005 evaluated an uncertainty intervention in long‐term breast cancer survivors and found a statistically significant difference for cognitive re‐framing (proxy for uncertainty management) (P = 0.01). Outcomes were more pronounced in African American women (P = 0.03) than in White women. Late outcomes (20 months) of the intervention were reported in the subsequent publication of Mishel 2005 by Gil 2006 ; these results confirmed that benefits generated by the intervention were maintained over time (F\\[1479\\] = 3.94; P < 0.05, d = 0.06, n2 = 0.008). Further, women in the intervention group reported decreased illness uncertainty, whereas there was no change for women in the control group from baseline to 20 months (Wilk's lambda F(1479) = 4.85; P < 0.03, d = 0.09, n2 = 0.010).\n\n【250】##### 1.6 Pain; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【251】Six studies examined interventions to relieve cancer‐related pain ( Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Mosher 2016 Porter 2011 ; Thomas 2012 ). These trials did not report change scores, or it was impossible to calculate these alongside the standard deviation of the change score, and meta‐analysis was not possible. Researchers measured outcomes using the following tools.\n\n【252】*   Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) ( Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ; Thomas 2012 ).\n    \n*   Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI‐CTC) pain item ( Molassiotis 2009 ).\n    \n*   Bodily Pain Scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36‐item Short Form (SF‐36) ( Kroenke 2010 ).\n    \n*   Barriers Questionnaire (BQ) ( Thomas 2012 ).\n    \n\n【253】Three of these studies reported statistically significant reductions in pain. Kroenke 2010 measured pain at four study points following telephone intervention (1, 3, 6, and 12 months). Across all points, the intervention group reported significantly greater improvements than the usual care group for pain severity (P < 0.0001), interference in functioning caused by pain (P < 0.0001), and bodily pain (P = 0.004). Thomas 2012 tested effectiveness of two interventions compared to usual care in decreasing intensity of cancer pain by lowering patients' attitudinal barriers to pain management. Trial authors found no differences between groups at the end of the study in terms of barriers to pain management, average pain intensity scores (F = 2.58; P = 0.08), pain relief (F = 2.63; P = 0.07), or overall body pain (F = 2.817; P = 0.062). However, post hoc contrasts demonstrated that the coaching group had significantly lower mean pain interference scores compared to the education and usual care groups (F = 4.53; P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively) at the end of the study. Molassiotis compared an 18‐week home care intervention for people with breast or colorectal cancer given oral chemotherapy. Measures were taken weekly, and across all, the intervention group reported significantly less pain when compared with the control group (ranging between P < 0.0005 and P < 0.001).\n\n【254】The remaining three studies did not generate statistically significant results ( Barsevick 2010 ; Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ).\n\n【255】##### 1.7 Sexually‐related symptoms; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【256】Three studies focused on the impact of the intervention on sexually‐related symptoms including sexual function and satisfaction ( Chambers 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ). These trials did not report change scores, or it was impossible to calculate these alongside the standard deviation of the change score, and meta‐analysis was not possible.\n\n【257】These researchers measured outcomes using the following.\n\n【258】*   International Index of Erectile Function ( Chambers 2015 ; Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ).\n    \n*   Female Sexual Function Index ( Reese 2014 ; Reese 2018 ).\n    \n*   Female Sexual Distress Scale ( Reese 2018 ).\n    \n*   PROMIS SexFS v2. Global Sexual Satisfaction Scale ( Reese 2018 ).\n    \n*   Sexual needs subscale of the Supportive Care Need Survey ( Chambers 2015 ).\n    \n*   Psychological Impact of Erectile Dysfunction ‐ Sexual Experience ( Chambers 2015 ).\n    \n*   Index of Sexual Satisfaction ( Reese 2014 ).\n    \n\n【259】Reese 2014 evaluated a telephone intervention intended to improve physical intimacy and sexual concerns for couples in whom one was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Study authors reported a large effect size related to sexual functioning associated with the intervention for female (0.85) participants and a moderate effect size for males (0.58). However, they observed no effects of the intervention on sexual distress. They followed this study by evaluating an adapted version of the intervention in breast cancer survivors (adapted to address specific needs of breast cancer survivors and their intimate partners). Similar to their findings from research with people with colorectal cancer ( Reese 2014 ), Reese 2018 reported medium to large positive effects on all sexual outcomes measured.\n\n【260】Conversely, Chambers 2015 found no evidence of differences between intervention and control groups for any of the measures above. However, these researchers did report statistically significant differences at 12 months for use of erectile dysfunction medication. Results demonstrated that participants in the intervention group were 3.14 times more likely to use medical treatment for erectile dysfunction than those in the control group (P = 0.0008).\n\n【261】##### 1.8 Dyspnoea; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【262】Only two studies addressed this symptom ( Mosher 2016 ; Porter 2011 ), even though people with lung cancer were the target population for a number of interventions. Once more, these investigators did not report change scores, or it was impossible to calculate these alongside the standard deviation of the change score, and meta‐analysis was not possible.\n\n【263】These studies measured outcomes using the following.\n\n【264】*   Four items on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) related to breathlessness ( Mosher 2016 ).\n    \n*   Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ‐ Lung Cancer subscale ( Porter 2011 ).\n    \n\n【265】Dyspnoea was solely a primary outcome in Mosher 2016 . However, this trial did not report any statistically significant benefit regarding breathlessness arising from a generic telephone‐delivered symptom management intervention ‐ involving carers ‐ when compared with telephone education/support. Conversely, comparison between a telephone‐delivered carer‐assisted coping skills programme and telephone‐delivered education/support conducted by Porter 2011 did generate statistically significant improvements (B = 0.76, standard error = 0.21, P = 0.0003) in lung cancer‐specific symptoms. This subscale included shortness of breath, coughing, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Neither of these studies included a usual care control, making it impossible to posit firm conclusions.\n\n【266】##### 1.9 General symptom experience; telephone intervention versus control\n\n【267】General symptom intensity and/or symptom distress scores were study outcomes in 10 of the studies incorporated in the review ( Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Barsevick 2010 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Porter 2011 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ; Traeger 2015 ). The following tools were used to measure this.\n\n【268】*   General Symptom Distress Scale ( Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ).\n    \n*   Side Effect Checklist (SCL) ( Barsevick 2010 ).\n    \n*   Symptom Distress Scale ( Mishel 2002 ).\n    \n*   National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI‐CTC) ( Molassiotis 2009 ).\n    \n*   Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ‐ Lung Cancer (FACT‐L) lung cancer‐specific subscale ( Porter 2011 ).\n    \n*   Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ‐ Short Form (MSAS‐SF) ( Traeger 2015 ).\n    \n*   Various investigator‐developed symptom severity scales ( Kroenke 2010 ; Sherwood 2005 ; Sikorskii 2007 ).\n    \n\n【269】Again, these studies did not report change scores, or it was impossible to calculate these alongside the standard deviation of the change score, and meta‐analysis was not possible. Of the 10 studies, only two reported positive effects of telephone interventions on general symptom experience ( Badger 2013b ; Kroenke 2010 ). Kroenke 2010 measured study participants' physical symptom burden and calculated an overall symptom score. Study authors determined that the telephone intervention for pain and depression that was introduced generated statistically significant reductions in general symptom severity by the end of the study when compared with the control (M ‐1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.7 to ‐0.7; P = 0.014). The other study that reported statistically significant improvements in general symptom experience evaluated two different telephone interventions for Latina women with breast cancer ( Badger 2013b ). Badger 2013b determined that both interventions (telephone interpersonal counselling (TIP‐C) and telephone health education (THE)) generated significant improvements in general symptom distress, with participants in the THE group reporting slightly greater improvements (F\\[1.60, 55.83\\] = 17.13; P < 0.001) than TIP‐C participants (F\\[2.66\\] = 7.63; P < 0.01).\n\n【270】None of the eight remaining studies generated statistically significant results. However, although Molassiotis 2009 detected no significant improvement ‐ when introducing telephone‐delivered symptom‐focused interventions for people with colorectal or breast cancer receiving oral chemotherapy ‐ in a composite symptom score derived from nine symptoms (oral mucositis, hand‐foot syndrome, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, pain, fatigue, and insomnia), they did find improvements across most individual symptoms over time. During treatment cycles 1 and 2, the intervention group reported significant improvements across all symptoms (P < 0.0005 to 0.005), except for hand‐foot syndrome (P = 0.08) and vomiting (P = 0.062). These improvements were maintained until the sixth cycle for all symptoms except fatigue.\n\n【271】Discussion\n----------\n\n【272】### Summary of main results\n\n【273】Telephone‐delivered interventions are growing in popularity within cancer care, arguably reflecting the trend for health care to be delivered in day care settings with limited capacity for delivering interventions face‐to‐face. This review incorporated data from 6250 people with cancer across 32 studies. Most of the interventions incorporated had been developed for ‐ or tested ability to reduce ‐ psychological symptoms, notably depressive symptoms (n = 21), anxiety (n = 16), and emotional distress (n = 7). The predominance of telephone‐delivered interventions for psychological symptoms is unsurprising; telephone counselling has been shown to be effective in reducing psychological symptoms including depression and anxiety in patient populations other than those with diagnosed cancer ( Reese 2002 ), in people specifically with breast cancer ( Chen 2018 ), and more recently among carers ( Lins 2014 ). Not all studies had theoretical frameworks underpinning the intervention that was delivered and evaluated; those that did have such a framework used one from a diverse array of 11 differing frameworks.\n\n【274】Twenty‐one of the 32 studies reported a significant effect (P < 0.05) in favour of the intervention condition generated by the telephone‐delivered intervention ( Allard 2007 ; Allen 2002 ; Badger 2007 ; Badger 2013a ; Badger 2013b ; Badr 2015 ; Bailey 2004 ; Barsevick 2004 ; Barsevick 2010 ; Chambers 2015 ; Dong 2018 ; Girgis 2009 ; Kroenke 2010 ; Mishel 2002 ; Mishel 2005 ; Molassiotis 2009 ; Rawl 2002 ; Porter 2011 ; Thomas 2012 ; Watson 2017 ; Yates 2005 ). However, meta‐analyses were not possible for any of the outcomes due to considerable heterogeneity. Findings provided in the review suggest that telephone‐delivered interventions may be effective in addressing some common symptoms associated with cancer, but this would need to be established in future updates of the review, when more evidence is available for each cancer type. At present, no firm conclusions can be drawn. It is encouraging, however, that findings from the review appear to be largely consistent with those from the Lins 2014 and Chen 2018 systematic reviews. The only difference is related to anxiety; neither Chen 2018 nor Lins 2014 reported positive outcomes for anxiety. Reasons for this are unclear, although populations eligible for inclusion in these reviews differed.\n\n【275】Further, this review has demonstrated that telephone‐delivered interventions are being developed for managing a range of physical as well as psychological cancer‐related symptoms. Symptoms including pain, dyspnoea, and sexually‐related symptoms, in addition to fatigue, have been subject to investigation. Sexually‐related symptoms are a relatively recent addition to the range of symptoms being addressed in this area of research. This mirrors research more generally into sexually‐related symptoms in cancer care. They have been orphan symptoms ‐ comparatively neglected ‐ when compared with other cancer‐related symptoms ( White 2011 ). Further, this review identified that, with regards to telephone‐delivered interventions, dyspnoea could also be viewed as an orphan symptom. This may reflect perceived challenges of dealing with a complex and often acute symptom like dyspnoea by telephone. It may be that brief psycho‐educational interventions that are delivered primarily by telephone may be unsuitable for this group of cancer patients. However, further research is needed before such conclusions can be drawn.\n\n【276】For a number of symptoms ‐ uncertainty, pain, dyspnoea, and sexually‐related symptoms ‐ data from the studies incorporated are inconsistent, making conclusions regarding their management through telephone‐delivered interventions difficult to draw; around half failed to generate statistically significant findings.\n\n【277】Most interventions were delivered over a relatively short period, typically ranging from two to eight weeks; most frequently, interventions were provided weekly. However, lack of data prevented comparison of effectiveness by length or frequency of the intervention (dose). Likewise, evidence was insufficient to enable comparison by stage of disease. Some preliminary evidence from Porter 2011 suggests that different forms of interventions may be more/less effective according to stage of disease. This theory needs further investigation. Differential responses to interventions are important to determine. Although likely to be more cost‐effective than interventions delivered face‐to‐face (cost‐effectiveness of these interventions has not been reported on), those delivered by telephone remain relatively costly in terms of health professional time. It is clearly optimal to target interventions towards people who would benefit most, to enable effective resource use.\n\n【278】Telephone‐delivered interventions may provide greater benefit for particular people. Arguably, people with high symptom intensity could benefit the most, as they would also have high possibility for symptom reduction. However, as few studies specifically targeted people with moderate or greater symptoms, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the relative efficacy of interventions according to symptom burden. Further, the telephone can provide a degree of anonymity that may be helpful with certain symptoms (e.g. sexually‐related ones), and no requirement for face‐to‐face contact is likely to be of particular importance to people whose immunity is compromised through disease and/or treatment. However, data are insufficient to enable these hypotheses to be confirmed or refuted. It would appear that telephone‐delivered interventions may also generate practical benefit, for example, being particularly pertinent for people living at a distance from treatment centres, or for those with fatigue for whom the effort required to attend delivery of an intervention in person may be prohibitive.\n\n【279】Many people with cancer report feelings of fatigue and the negative effect this can have on their motivation for symptom self‐management ( Ahlberg 2003 ; Ream 2015 ). Further, health professionals may find it more difficult to motivate patients in their patient group to adopt behaviour change when delivering interventions remotely (e.g. by telephone) rather than in person. This would suggest that techniques such as motivational interviewing (MI) could offer important benefit in telephone‐delivered interventions for symptom self‐management ‐ in particular, when patients may be experiencing fatigue. MI was used to generate behaviour change in two studies within the review ( Thomas 2012 ; Ream 2015 ). Two further trial authors referred to techniques within their interventions aimed at enhancing motivation to change behaviour ( Allen 2002 ; Yates 2005 ). Incorporation of goal‐setting and monitoring used by MI, as well as interventions based around it, provides impetus for behaviour change.\n\n【280】All interventions were delivered by health and social care professionals, most by nurses. Most papers (n = 22) referred to training needed by those delivering interventions ‐ notably in counselling skills, communication, and education. This is not attained without cost. Unfortunately, the papers in this review did not feature any form of cost evaluation; thus it is impossible to determine the cost implications of interventions such as these. This is an important topic that needs consideration in future research.\n\n【281】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【282】This is the first review to appraise and synthesise findings from studies evaluating telephone‐delivered interventions for management of cancer‐related symptoms. This review indicates that such interventions may be effective in ameliorating cancer‐related symptoms ‐ most notably, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and emotional distress. Some symptoms (uncertainty, pain, dyspnoea, sexually‐related symptoms) have been subject to relatively less research; robust conclusions cannot be drawn from available evidence.\n\n【283】This review does have some limitations. First, it is limited by the narrative nature of the synthesis and the relatively small number of studies addressing certain symptoms, such as sexually‐related symptoms and dyspnoea, which rendered study conclusions difficult to determine. Further, it was impossible to determine whether better outcomes were achieved if the telephone was used alongside other elements (e.g. face‐to‐face contact, printed/digital/online materials). Although some studies that were incorporated into the review reported findings that failed to attain statistical significance, the review is likely to have been subject to a degree of publication bias. Finally, studies incorporated into the review were largely conducted in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom ‐ thus their findings may not translate well to other continents and nations. The findings presented need to be viewed in light of these limitations.\n\n【284】Further, symptoms are multi‐dimensional. This review focused on severity of symptoms; it did not address the distress generated by symptoms. Several studies in this review measured and reported on symptom distress, in addition to intensity. A symptom may be of low intensity but still may give rise to considerable distress. This may be important clinically ‐ arguably symptoms should be prioritised according to how distressing they are. The authors of this review are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of telephone interventions with regards to symptom distress.\n\n【285】This review did incorporate psychological symptoms including uncertainty. However, it did not include fear of recurrence, as this is a concern associated with cancer that can give rise to symptoms like anxiety and uncertainty (rather than being a symptom per se). A recent study has evaluated an intervention for fear of recurrence delivered by telephone ( Dieng 2016 ). We did not include this paper in the review.\n\n【286】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【287】We used the GRADE approach to interpret findings based on the certainty of evidence generated across the included studies. Most of the 32 trials that met our inclusion criteria were at moderate risk of bias. All but one were randomised controlled trials, so the evidence generated by them should be interpreted as highest certainty available, despite blinding not being achieved across almost all of these trials; lack of blinding can give rise to performance or detection bias. However, it is acknowledged that in research of this nature, blinding of participants would be possible only if a form of sham intervention was delivered to those in the control group. This in itself introduces difficulties, as some of the effects of a telephone‐delivered intervention are likely to reflect characteristics of the telephone conversation (that would be experienced by those in the sham intervention control). This could render effects of the telephone intervention difficult to detect. Alternatively, an intervention could be tested against an active control for which the control group receives an intervention of known positive effect.\n\n【288】Review authors noted heterogeneity in results generated by the interventions studied (i.e. inconsistency within the body of evidence). This is likely to reflect differences between the interventions themselves. Although all were predominantly delivered by telephone, they varied in length, in content, and in some cases in incorporation of additional elements such as face‐to‐face contact or additional supportive media. Further, the cancer populations studied varied, and this appeared to introduce additional levels of heterogeneity. Therefore, meta‐analyses were not performed.\n\n【289】Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes in the review, as we are very uncertain about the estimates. We downgraded all outcomes due to concerns about overall risk of bias profiles being unclear or high, imprecision, inconsistency in results, and general heterogeneity.\n\n【290】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【291】We performed a comprehensive search, including a thorough search of the grey literature, and two review authors independently sifted all studies and extracted study data. We restricted the review to randomised controlled trials (RCT) and one quasi‐RCT. By searching a wide range of databases and grey literature, we attempted to ensure that we did not overlook any relevant evidence.\n\n【292】A threat to the validity of the review is likely to be publication bias; studies that did not find the treatment to be effective may not have been published. We did not report any meta‐analyses due to considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Meta‐analysis may have led to misleading results that lacked any kind of generalisability.\n\n【293】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【294】The results of this review are largely consistent with those published previously by Chen 2018 . That review evaluated tele‐health interventions for quality of life and psychological outcomes in people with breast cancer. Those review authors similarly reported that compared with usual care, telephone‐delivered interventions led to statistically significantly less depressive symptoms, distress, and perceived stress. Consistency across reviews such as these does provide some confidence in the veracity of findings. However, unlike the present review, Chen 2018 reported that anxiety did not differ between tele‐health and usual care control. As with this review, the findings of Chen 2018 have to be considered with a degree of caution owing to between‐study heterogeneity.\n\n【295】Figures and Tables -\n\n【296】Figure 1\n\n【297】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【298】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【299】Figures and Tables -\n\n【300】Figure 2\n\n【301】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【302】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【303】Figures and Tables -\n\n【304】Figure 3\n\n【305】Study flow diagram.\n\n【306】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【307】Figures and Tables -\n\n【308】Analysis 1.1\n\n【309】Comparison 1: Symptoms, Outcome 1: Anxiety\n\n【310】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【311】Figures and Tables -\n\n【312】Analysis 1.2\n\n【313】Comparison 1: Symptoms, Outcome 2: Depression\n\n【314】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【315】Figures and Tables -\n\n【316】Analysis 1.3\n\n【317】Comparison 1: Symptoms, Outcome 3: Fatigue\n\n【318】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【319】Figures and Tables -\n\n【320】Analysis 1.4\n\n【321】Comparison 1: Symptoms, Outcome 4: Emotional distress\n\n【322】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【323】Summary of findings 1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effects on wound healing of a 'test and treat' strategy for diagnosing and treating high levels of wound protease activity in people with venous leg ulcers.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of complex wound (a wound which heals by secondary intention, i.e. by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure). Problems with the leg veins (such as damage to the valves, or blockages) reduce the efficient return of blood to the heart and increase the pressure in the leg veins ( Ghauri 2010 ), which may result in venous leg ulcers. The precise chain of events that links the high venous pressures (chronic venous hypertension) with skin breakdown and a chronic wound is not fully understood ( Coleridge Smith 1988 ; Valencia 2001 ).\n\n【7】Venous leg ulcers commonly occur on the gaiter region of the lower leg (from just below the ankle up to mid calf). A venous leg ulcer is defined as any break in the skin that has either been present for longer than six weeks or occurs in a person with a history of venous leg ulceration. Differential diagnosis of the type of leg ulcer (i.e. the underlying cause) is made by taking a clinical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and haemodynamic assessment ( RCN 2006 ; SIGN 2010 ). The latter typically includes an assessment of arterial supply to the leg using the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), measured using a hand‐held Doppler ultrasound scanner. Clinically significant arterial disease as a cause of ulceration is usually ruled out by an ABPI of at least 0.8 ( Ashby 2014 ; NICE 2012a ; SIGN 2010 ). True venous ulcers are moist, shallow and irregularly shaped and lie wholly or partly within the gaiter area of the leg. Leg ulcers can be associated with venous disease in combination with vascular disease, which impairs arterial blood supply; in these instances they are said to have a 'mixed aetiology'. Open skin ulceration due solely to limb ischaemia from vascular disease is less common.\n\n【8】Venous disease is a chronic condition which is characterised by periods of ulceration (i.e., an open wound) followed by healing and then recurrence. An early cross‐sectional survey reported that half of current or recent ulcers had been open for up to nine months and that 35% of people with leg ulcers had experienced four or more episodes ( Callam 1987 ). This picture was supported by a subsequent cross‐sectional study ( Nelzen 1994 ).\n\n【9】More recent analysis of almost 1200 patients documented a 24‐week healing rate of 76% and a recurrence at one year of 17% ( Gohel 2005 ). Cohort data from 20,000 people have shown that initial wound area and duration accurately predict healing in venous leg ulcers ( Margolis 2004 ). In this study, ulcers smaller than 10cm² with durations of less than 12 months at first visit had a 29% chance of not healing by the 24th week of care, whilst ulcers larger than 10cm² with duration longer than 12 months had a 78% chance of not healing by 24 weeks ( Margolis 2004 ). A small cohort study has suggested that percentage change in area over the first four weeks of treatment may be an indicator of whether a wound will heal within 24 weeks ( Kantor 2000 ). Older age has been identified as an independent risk factor for delayed healing ( Gohel 2005 ) while slow healing is also a risk factor for recurrence, possibly because it reflects the extent of underlying venous insufficiency ( Gohel 2005 ).\n\n【10】Accurate, current estimates of leg ulcer prevalence are hard to identify because most surveys do not differentiate between causes of leg ulceration, or do so per limb but not per patient ( Moffatt 2004 ; Srinivasaiah 2007 ; Vowden 2009a ). Estimates of the prevalence of open leg ulceration (any cause) range from 0.4 to 4.8 cases per 1000 ( Graham 2003 ; Johnson 1995 ; Walker 2002 ), with the point prevalence of venous leg ulceration in Australian and European studies being between 0.1% and 0.3% ( Nelzen 2008 ). A recent estimate suggests that venous ulceration has a point prevalence of 0.29 cases per 1000 in the United Kingdom (UK), whilst mixed arterial/venous leg ulceration has a point prevalence of 0.11 per 1000 ( Hall 2014 ).\n\n【11】Venous ulcers are painful, can be malodorous and prone to infection, and may severely affect patients' mobility and quality of life. The presence of leg ulceration has been associated with pain, restriction of work and leisure activities, impaired mobility, sleep disturbance, reduced psychological well‐being and social isolation ( Herber 2007 ; Persoon 2004 ). In severe cases, ulceration can lead to limb amputation although this may be more common in patients with comorbid arterial insufficiency ( Dumville 2009 ; Nelzen 1997 ; Valencia 2001 ). Recent research suggests that people with complex wounds, including those with venous leg ulcers, commonly see complete wound healing as the most important outcome to them ( Madden 2014 ).\n\n【12】The financial cost of treating an unhealed leg ulcer in the UK has been estimated at around GBP 1700 per year (price year 2012) ( Ashby 2014 ). Another evaluation estimated the average cost of treating a venous leg ulcer in the UK (based on costs for material for dressing changes) as between EUR 814 and EUR 1994 and, in Sweden as lying between EUR 1332 and EUR 2585 (price year 2002), with higher costs associated with larger and more chronic wounds ( Ragnarson Tennvall 2005 ). Data from a German study, which estimated total costs including those classified as indirect or intangible costs, estimated mean annual costs of leg ulcers as EUR 9060 per patient (price year 2006). This figure is higher than other estimates because it includes non‐health service costs to the patient and to society ( Augustin 2012 ). In Bradford, UK, GBP 1.69 million was spent on dressings and compression bandages, and GBP 3.08 million on nursing time (estimates derived from resource use data for all wound types) during the financial year 2006 to 2007 ( Vowden 2009b ).\n\n【13】The first line treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy in the form of bandages, stockings or mechanical devices ( O'Meara 2012 ).This application of external pressure around the lower leg assists venous return and reduces venous reflux ( Woo 2013 ). Alongside compression, wound dressings are commonly applied to open ulcers. The primary rationale for using a dressing is to protect the surface of the ulcer; however other considerations such as absorption of exudate or antimicrobial properties also play a role in treatment selection ( O'Meara 2014 ). Other treatments for venous leg ulcers include venous surgery (removal of incompetent superficial veins) ( Gohel 2007 ) and drugs such as pentoxifylline ( Jull 2012 ). Other standard therapeutic approaches for complex wounds, such as optimising nutrition, and debridement (removal of dead, damaged or infected tissue), may also be offered. Despite these approaches, as discussed above, many venous leg ulcers remain hard to heal and further specialist treatments may be considered.\n\n【14】### Description of the intervention\n\n【15】A 'test and treat strategy' involves the use of a diagnostic/prognostic test or assessment which precedes the potential use of a therapeutic intervention (a treatment): the use and/or timing of the treatment being dependent on the results of the test. A diagnostic test determines the current state of disease while a prognostic test indicates the likely future course of the disease process ( Rector 2012 ).\n\n【16】Evaluations of test and treat strategies assess the use of combinations of testing and treating, as opposed to evaluating diagnostic test accuracy, or the effects of an treatment, separately. Test and treat approaches are therefore the best method for implementing a test where we need to consider both its diagnostic properties (i.e. sensitivity and specificity) and the healthcare outcomes from an effective test for the relevant indication ( Ferrante di Ruffano 2012 ; Fryback 1991 ; Guyatt 1986 ; Lord 2006 ). As such, test and treat evaluations are pragmatic and give an indication of the real life results of implementing the strategy in terms of its impact on patient outcomes ( Bossuyt 2009 ).\n\n【17】Just as with therapeutic interventions alone, the gold standard for assessing the impact of a test plus a treatment strategy is the randomised controlled trial (RCT) ( Lord 2009 ). Guidance on assessing the impact of tests in health care has been issued by various agencies including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE 2012b ) and the United States (US) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ 2012 ; Rector 2012 ).\n\n【18】In this review we evaluate test and treat interventions for high protease activity in venous leg ulcers. This involves the use of a test for high protease levels in venous leg ulcers as well as subsequent targeted treatment decisions (possible use of treatments designed to reduce protease levels) which follow the test.\n\n【19】#### Protease activity in wounds\n\n【20】Proteases are enzymes which break down proteins into their constituent peptides and amino acids. The action of different proteases tends to be restricted to different proteins. The principal proteases involved in wound healing are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the serine proteases which breakdown extracellular matrix (ECM) and connective tissue proteins such as collagen and elastin ( Ladwig 2002 ; Nwomeh 1999 ).\n\n【21】Proteases are thought to play key roles in the normal wound healing process, being active in three of the phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation and remodelling ( Trengove 1999 ). In the inflammation phase, proteases are used for the removal of damaged ECM, bacteria and foreign material (aiding autolytic debridement); in the proliferation phase proteases have a role in the degradation of capillary basement membrane for angiogenesis (growth of new capillary blood vessels) and in aiding detachment and migration of cells; and in the remodelling phase protease activity contributes to contraction and remodelling of scar ECM. It is thought that there is a burst of protease activity at the start of acute wound healing and, in normally‐healing wounds, an activity peak in the first two to three days followed by a decline to very low levels after one week ( Nwomeh 1998 ). Proteases may be present in an active or inactive state and protease activity is regulated through complex feedback mechanisms within the wound environment; only activated proteases have an impact on the wound healing process ( McCarty 2013 ; Nwomeh 1999 ; Yager 2002 ).\n\n【22】In non‐healing wounds it is thought that a complex inflammatory mechanism may result in proteases reaching higher levels and also persisting for longer than in healing wounds ( Trengove 1999 ). Correlations between elevated levels of MMPs and delayed healing have been documented in pressure ulcers ( Ladwig 2002 ) and foot ulcers in people with diabetes ( Liu 2009 ) as well as in venous leg ulcers ( Mwaura 2006 ; Serra 2013 ). However, there is limited evidence for a causal relationship between protease activity and wound healing.\n\n【23】#### Protease‐modulating treatments\n\n【24】Novel treatments have been designed to modify the chronic wound environment by substantially reducing the activity of key proteases. The principle of such protease‐modulating matrix treatments is both to absorb and bind excess proteases from wound fluids, thereby reducing levels of protease at the wound bed ( Cullen 2002 ). The treatments do not, however, affect the expression of proteases on a cellular level ( Lobmann 2006 ).\n\n【25】Interventions that reduce harmful levels of protease activity may potentially promote healing in wounds with persistently high protease activity. However evidence for this from RCTs has been limited across unselected wounds of different aetiologies, including venous leg ulcers (e.g. Andriessen 2009 ; Chin 2003 ; Kakagia 2007 ; Nisi 2005 ; Veves 2002 ). There is extremely limited evidence from a very small industry‐sponsored study that screened wounds may respond better to protease‐modulating treatment relative to all wounds ( Cullen 2011 ).\n\n【26】Treatments can target specific proteases or can be broader spectrum, designed to inhibit all protease activity. Common protease‐modulating treatments and their properties are described below. Products are listed by their generic names and, when possible, with examples of corresponding trade names and manufacturers. Both dressings and ointments are available; some dressings have silver ions incorporated, which are intended to reduce wound pathogens.\n\n【27】Types of protease‐modulating treatment which are listed in the British National Formulary ( BNF 2014 ) include the following:\n\n【28】*   Starch‐based ointment: Cadesorb® (Smith & Nephew)\n    \n*   Collagen matrix (bovine cartilage): Catrix® (Cranage)\n    \n*   Gel, alginate and propylene glycol with extracellular matrix proteins: Xelma® (Mölnlycke)\n    \n*   Collagen and oxidised regenerated cellulose matrix dressing: Promogran® (Systagenix)\n    \n*   Collagen, silver and oxidised regenerated cellulose matrix dressing: Promogran® Prisma® (Systagenix)\n    \n*   Cellulose acetate matrix, impregnated with polyhydrated ionogens ointment in polyethylene glycol basis dressing: Tegaderm® Matrix (3M)\n    \n*   Adherent polymer matrix dressing containing nano‐oligosaccharide factor (NOSF), with polyurethane foam film backing: UrgoStart® (Urgo)\n    \n*   Non‐adherent wound contact dressing containing NOSF: UrgoStart® Contact (Urgo).\n    \n\n【29】This list is not exhaustive and other wound dressings such as Aquacel® (ConvaTec) are sometimes listed as having protease‐modulating effects ( Wound Care Handbook ). A pragmatic approach will be adopted, and, where such dressings are used in a protease‐modulating capacity we will include them in the review.\n\n【30】### How the intervention might work\n\n【31】Very weak evidence suggests an inverse association between protease levels and healing in an unadjusted analysis of a mixed sample which included venous leg ulcers, foot ulcers in people with diabetes, and pressure ulcers ( Cullen 2011 ; Serena 2011 ). On this basis, a test and treat process has been proposed, which involves the testing of venous leg ulcers for levels of protease activity followed by targeted treatment of those deemed to have high levels of protease activity (and alternative care for the remaining wounds) ( Systagenix 2013 ). This might mean that only wounds where high protease activity is present receive treatment designed to lower it. It is suggested that this strategy may reduce the time taken to heal for the wounds receiving targeted treatment, whilst avoiding unnecessary, expensive and potentially harmful use of the protease‐modulating treatments in wounds where protease activity levels were not increased.\n\n【32】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【33】Venous leg ulcers are a relatively common type of complex wound that have a negative impact on people's lives and incur high costs for health services and society. Leg ulcers are painful, sometimes malodorous, prone to infection, and may severely affect patients' mobility and quality of life, and in severe cases, there is a risk of limb amputation. There are a number of treatments for venous leg ulcers, but many ulcers prove hard to heal.\n\n【34】There is a widespread view among experts in the field that proteases have an important role in wound healing and that a point of care test for elevated activity of commonly identified proteases has value ( International Consensus 2011 ; Barrett 2011 ; Snyder 2011 ; Snyder 2012 ). Identification of wounds in which there is elevated protease activity is not considered possible on the basis of clinical examination alone; delayed wound healing is not proposed to be a universal indicator ( Sibbald 2012 ; Snyder 2012 ). Limited data from an industry‐sponsored study found that only 28% of 162 non‐healing wounds of mixed aetiology were determined to have high protease activity ( Serena 2011 ).\n\n【35】However, although a test for protease activity is now available, the impact of its use, in combination with subsequent targeted treatments with protease‐modulating therapies where indicated, is unclear, and we are not aware of other reviews that address this question. A Cochrane review of the use of protease‐modulating dressings in venous leg ulcers is currently underway ( Westby 2014 ). A review of the diagnostic test accuracy of protease activity tests is also planned ( Dumville 2015 \\[personal communication\\] ).\n\n【36】In the current review we will assess the impact of testing venous leg ulcers for high levels of protease activity and treating those which record a positive test result; we will therefore be assessing the relative effectiveness of one or more tests for protease activity (together with thresholds for treatment) and the subsequent protease‐modulating treatments. Our review will also compare a strategy of test and treat with non‐directed usual care.\n\n【37】Objectives\n----------\n\n【38】To determine the effects on wound healing of a 'test and treat' strategy for diagnosing and treating high levels of wound protease activity in people with venous leg ulcers.\n\n【39】Methods\n-------\n\n【40】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【41】#### Types of studies\n\n【42】We will include published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs, irrespective of the language of report. We will exclude quasi‐randomised studies. We will only include RCTs reported only as abstracts when available data (either from the abstract itself or from the study authors) are sufficient for reasonable data extraction.\n\n【43】#### Types of participants\n\n【44】We will include trials recruiting adults described as having venous leg ulcers, managed in any setting. We will accept study authors' definitions of venous leg ulcers and will note the diagnostic methods and criteria used.\n\n【45】We will include trials which recruited people with venous leg ulcers and those with other types of complex wounds if the results for people with venous leg ulcers are presented separately or are available from the authors.\n\n【46】We will include participants at any stage in their treatment pathway, e.g. participants with or without hard to heal ulcers and with or without clinical infection of ulcers.\n\n【47】#### Types of interventions\n\n【48】We will include any RCT which evaluates a test and treat strategy for elevated protease activity in venous leg ulcers. In these studies the use of a specific test and treat strategy will be the only systematic difference between treatment groups. This will include trials in which all participants in the comparison arm received the same protease‐modulating treatment but where a test and treat strategy was applied in the intervention arm as well as trials comparing test and treatment combinations versus each other, versus other interventions, or versus standard care. This may include comparisons of different test thresholds for the same test.\n\n【49】We will include RCTs whether or not compression therapy is reported as a concurrent treatment as long as the study groups received the same compression protocols. Where possible we will assess the impact of concurrent compression therapy on the treatment effect (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity ).\n\n【50】We will exclude studies in which the test result is part of the inclusion criteria, i.e. participants with a positive test result were randomised to different protease‐modulating treatments or to protease‐modulating versus alternative treatments, as these will be included in a concurrent review evaluating protease‐modulating matrix treatments for venous leg ulcers ( Westby 2014 ).\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】We list primary and secondary outcome measures below. If a trial is otherwise eligible (correct study design, population and intervention/comparator) but does not report a listed outcome, then we will contact the study authors where possible in order to establish whether a relevant outcome was measured but not reported. Trials will be included only where we are able to obtain data on a listed outcome.\n\n【53】We will report outcome measures at the latest time point available for a study (assumed to be length of follow‐up if not specified) and the time point specified in the methods as being of primary interest (if this is different from the latest time point available). Where appropriate, for all outcomes we will class (and categorise) outcomes from:\n\n【54】*   < 1 week to 8 weeks as short term;\n    \n*   \\> 8 weeks to 24 weeks as medium term; and\n    \n*   \\> 24 weeks as long term.\n    \n\n【55】We will use our judgement to decide whether statistical pooling within these time categories is appropriate.\n\n【56】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【57】The primary effectiveness outcome for this review is wound healing. Trialists use a range of different methods of measuring and reporting this outcome. We will regard the following as the most relevant and rigorous measures of wound healing:\n\n【58】*   Time to complete wound healing (correctly analysed using survival, time‐to‐event approaches). Ideally the outcome will be adjusted for appropriate covariates, e.g. baseline ulcer area/duration.\n    \n*   Proportion of wounds completely healed during follow‐up (frequency of complete healing).\n    \n\n【59】We will use authors’ definitions of complete wound healing; these will be reported.\n\n【60】Where both of the outcomes above are reported, we will present all data in a summary outcome table for reference but will focus on reporting time to healing. When time is analysed as a continuous measure, but it is not clear whether all wounds healed, we will document the use of the outcome in the study, but we will not extract, summarise or use the data in any meta‐analysis.\n\n【61】The primary safety outcome is all reported adverse events. Where reported, we will extract data on all serious adverse events and all non‐serious adverse events where a clear methodology for the collection of adverse event data was provided. This methodology should make it clear whether events were reported at the participant level or, where multiple events/person were reported, that an appropriate adjustment has been made for data clustering. We will not extract individual types of adverse events other than pain or infection (see Secondary outcomes ). We will note where events are reported as being treatment‐related.\n\n【62】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【63】We will include the following secondary outcomes:\n\n【64】*   Health‐related quality of life: we will include quality of life where it is reported using a validated scale such as the SF‐36 or EQ‐5D or a validated disease‐specific questionnaire such as the Cardiff Wound Impact Schedule. Ideally reported data will be adjusted for the baseline score. We will not include ad hoc measures of quality of life that are unlikely to be validated and would not be common to multiple trials.\n    \n*   Pain scores: we will include pain (including pain at dressing change) only where mean scores with a standard deviation are reported using a scale validated for the assessment of pain levels, such as a visual analogue scale (VAS).\n    \n*   Change (and rate of change) in wound size, with adjustment for baseline size (we will contact study authors to request adjusted means when not presented). When change or rate of change in wound size is reported without adjustment for baseline size, use of the outcome in the study will be documented, but data will not be extracted, summarised or used in any meta‐analysis.\n    \n*   Change in wound infection status (as defined by the study authors): we will include measures of incident cases of infection and cases of existing infections being resolved. We will not extract data on microbiological assays not clearly linked to a diagnosis of infection. We will use authors' definitions of infection.\n    \n*   Resource use (when presented as a mean with standard deviation) including measures of resource use such as appointments for undergoing tests and receiving test results, number of dressing changes, number of nurse visits, length of hospital stay, need for other interventions.\n    \n*   Costs associated with resource use (including estimates of cost‐effectiveness).\n    \n\n【65】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【66】#### Electronic searches\n\n【67】We will search the following electronic databases:\n\n【68】*   The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register.\n    \n*   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, _The Cochrane Library_ ) (latest issue).\n    \n*   Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present).\n    \n*   Ovid EMBASE (1974 to present).\n    \n*   EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to present).\n    \n\n【69】We will use the following provisional search strategy in CENTRAL:\n\n【70】#1 MeSH descriptor: \\[Leg Ulcer\\] explode all trees  \n#2 (varicose ulcer\\* or venous ulcer\\* or leg ulcer\\* or stasis ulcer\\* or crural ulcer\\* or ulcus cruris or ulcer cruris):ti,ab,kw (Word variations have been searched)  \n#3 {or #1‐#2}  \n#4 MeSH descriptor: \\[Peptide Hydrolases\\] explode all trees  \n#5 (protease\\* or proteinase\\* or metalloproteinase\\* or peptidase\\* or \"peptide hydrolase\" or \"peptide hydrolases\" or \"proteolytic enzymes\" or \"proteolytic enzyme\" or esteroprotease\\*):ti,ab,kw (Word variations have been searched)  \n#6 {or #4‐#5}  \n#7 {and #3, #6} in Trials\n\n【71】We will adapt this strategy to search Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We will combine the Ovid MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐ and precision‐maximising version (2008 revision) ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We will combine the EMBASE search with the Ovid EMBASE filter developed by the UK Cochrane Centre ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We will combine the CINAHL searches with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN 2011 ). There will be no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.\n\n【72】We will also search the following clinical trials registries:\n\n【73】*   ClinicalTrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/).\n    \n*   WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx).\n    \n*   EU Clinical Trials Register (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/).\n    \n\n【74】A shared search strategy will be employed for the current review and the review of effectiveness of protease‐modulating treatments ( Westby 2014 ).\n\n【75】#### Searching other resources\n\n【76】We will try to identify other potentially‐eligible trials or ancillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included trials, as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology assessment reports. We will contact corresponding authors of trials and the manufacturers and distributors of protease‐modulating treatments or of tests for wound protease activity including Systagenix. We will search the websites and briefing documentation of regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medical Association.\n\n【77】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【78】#### Selection of studies\n\n【79】Two review authors will independently assess the titles and abstracts of the citations retrieved by the searches for relevance. After this initial assessment, we will obtain full text copies of all studies considered to be potentially relevant. Two review authors will independently check the full papers for eligibility; disagreements will be resolved by discussion and, where required, the input of a third review author. Where the eligibility of a study is unclear we will attempt to contact study authors. We will record all reasons for exclusion of studies for which we had obtained full copies. We will complete a PRISMA flowchart to summarise this process ( Liberati 2009 ).\n\n【80】Where studies have been reported in multiple publications/reports, we will obtain all associated publications. Whilst the study will be included only once in the review, we will extract data from all reports to ensure that all available relevant data are obtained.\n\n【81】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【82】We will extract and summarise details of the eligible studies. Where possible we will extract data by treatment group for the prespecified interventions and outcomes in this review. Data will be extracted independently by two review authors; discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by consultation with a third author. Where data are missing from reports, we will attempt to contact the study authors to request this information.\n\n【83】Where a study with more than two intervention arms is included, only data from intervention and control groups that meet the eligibility criteria will be extracted. Where the reported baseline data relate to all patients rather than to those in relevant treatment arms, the data for the whole trial will be extracted and this will be noted.\n\n【84】Outcome data will be collected for relevant time points as described in the Types of outcome measures section _,_ and will be extracted on an intention‐to‐'test and treat' basis. However, where possible, we will also extract separate outcome data for those in the intervention arm who have positive results followed by protease‐modulating treatment and those who have negative results followed by a different treatment.\n\n【85】Where possible we will extract the following data:\n\n【86】*   bibliographic data including date of completion/publication\n    \n*   country of origin\n    \n*   unit of randomisation (participant/ulcer)\n    \n*   unit of analysis\n    \n*   trial design, e.g. parallel; cluster\n    \n*   care setting\n    \n*   number of participants randomised to each trial arm and number included in final analysis\n    \n*   eligibility criteria and key baseline participant data including duration of venous insufficiency and current ulcer(s)\n    \n*   details of treatment regimen received by each group including the nature, threshold and timing of test and the nature, timing and duration of subsequent treatment initiation. Details of treatment for participants with negative test results will also be reported\n    \n*   details of any co‐interventions\n    \n*   number (%) of patients with positive and negative test results and the number of patients receiving each treatment\n    \n*   primary and secondary outcome(s) (with definitions and, where applicable, time points)\n    \n*   outcome data for primary and secondary outcomes (by group) including outcomes for participants randomised to the intervention(s) but with negative test results\n    \n*   duration of follow‐up\n    \n*   number of withdrawals (by group), and number of withdrawals (by group) due to adverse events. Where possible separate data will be extracted for participants in the intervention group(s) with positive and negative test results\n    \n*   publication status of trial\n    \n*   source of funding for trial.\n    \n\n【87】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【88】Two review authors will independently assess included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011a ). This tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome reporting and other issues ( Appendix 1 ). In this review we will record issues with unit of analysis, for example where a cluster trial has been undertaken but analysed at the individual level in the study report. For this review we will not assess blinding of patients and personnel as this is unlikely to be possible in a trial of the interventions included (testing and treating according to test results); all other domains will be assessed. We will assess blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of outcome data for each of the review outcomes separately. Because this is a review of a test and treat process, we will also consider differences in completeness of outcome data between patients with positive versus negative test results in the intervention group(s).\n\n【89】We will present our assessment of risk of bias using two 'Risk of bias' summary figures; one which is a summary of bias for each item across all studies, and a second which shows a cross‐tabulation of each trial by all of the 'Risk of bias' items. We will summarise a study’s risk of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias. We anticipate that in many comparisons blinding of participants and personnel may not be possible.Therefore the assessment of the risk of detection bias will focus on whether blinded outcome assessment was reported. (Because wound healing can be a subjective outcome, it can be at high risk of measurement bias when outcome assessment is not blinded). For trials using cluster randomisation, we will also examine the risk of bias considering: recruitment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters, incorrect analysis and comparability with individually randomised trials ( Higgins 2011b ) ( Appendix 2 ).\n\n【90】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【91】Time‐to‐event data (e.g. time to complete wound healing) will be reported as hazard ratios (HRs) when possible, in accordance with the methods described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2011 ). If studies reporting time‐to‐event data (e.g. time to healing) do not report an HR, then, when feasible, we plan to estimate this using other reported outcomes, such as numbers of events, through the application of available statistical methods ( Parmar 1998 ; Tierney 2007 ). For dichotomous outcomes, we will calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcome data, we will use the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs for trials that use the same assessment scale. When trials use different assessment scales, we will use the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs.\n\n【92】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【93】Where studies have been randomised at the participant level and outcomes measured at the wound level, for example for wound healing, we will treat the participant as the unit of analysis when the number of wounds assessed appears to be equal to the number of participants (e.g. one wound per person).\n\n【94】A possible unit of analysis issue that may occur is that randomisation has been carried at the participant level with the allocated treatment used on multiple wounds per participant (or perhaps only on some participants) but data are presented and analysed per wound (clustered data).\n\n【95】In cases where included studies contain some or all clustered data we plan to report this, noting whether data had been (incorrectly) treated as independent. We will record this as part of the risk of bias assessment. We do not plan to undertake further calculation to adjust for clustering as part of this review.\n\n【96】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【97】It is common to have data missing from trial reports. Excluding participants from the analysis post randomisation or ignoring participants who are lost to follow‐up compromises the randomisation and may introduce bias into the trial. If it is thought that study authors might be able to provide some missing data, we will contact them; however, it is likely that data will often be missing because of loss to follow‐up. In individual studies, when data on the proportion of ulcers healed are presented, we plan to assume that randomly assigned participants not included in an analysis had an unhealed wound at the end of the follow‐up period (i.e. they will be considered in the denominator but not in the numerator).\n\n【98】When a trial does not specify participant group numbers before dropout, we will present only complete case data. For time‐to‐healing analysis using survival analysis methods, dropouts should be accounted for as censored data. Hence all participants will be contributing to the analysis. We acknowledge that such analysis assumes that dropouts are missing at random and there is no pattern of missingness. We will present data for all secondary outcomes as a complete case analysis.\n\n【99】For continuous variables, e.g. length of hospital stay, and for all secondary outcomes we will present available data from the study reports/study authors and do not plan to impute missing data. Where measures of variance are missing we will calculate these wherever possible ( Higgins 2011a ). If calculation is not possible we will contact study authors. Where these measures of variation remain unavailable and cannot be calculated, we will exclude the study from any relevant meta‐analyses that we conduct.\n\n【100】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【101】Assessment of heterogeneity can be a complex, multi‐faceted process. Firstly, we will consider clinical and methodological heterogeneity: that is the degree to which the included studies vary in terms of participant, intervention, outcome and characteristics such as length of follow‐up. This assessment of clinical and methodological heterogeneity will be supplemented by information regarding statistical heterogeneity ‐ assessed using the Chi² test (a significance level of P < 0.10 will be considered to indicate statistically significant heterogeneity) in conjunction with I² measure ( Higgins 2003 ). I² examines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance ( Higgins 2003 ). Very broadly, we will consider that I² values of 25%, or less, may mean a low level of heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ), and values of more than 75%, or more, indicate very high heterogeneity ( Deeks 2011 ). We will also examine the variability of the point estimates and the overlap of the confidence intervals, when I² values are less than 50%. Where there is evidence of high heterogeneity we will attempt to explore this further; see Data synthesis .\n\n【102】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【103】Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Publication bias is one of a number of possible causes of 'small study effects', that is, a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller RCTs. Funnel plots allow a visual assessment of whether small study effects may be present in a meta‐analysis. A funnel plot is a simple scatter plot of the intervention effect estimates from individual RCTs against some measure of each trial’s size or precision ( Sterne 2011 ). Funnel plots are only informative when there are a substantial number of studies included in an analysis; we plan to present funnel plots for meta‐analyses which include at least 10 RCTs using RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【104】#### Data synthesis\n\n【105】We will combine details of included studies in narrative review according to the comparison between intervention and comparator, the population and the time point of the outcome measurement. We will also use the timing of the protease activity test and the threshold for a positive result to structure the synthesis. We will consider clinical and methodological heterogeneity and undertake pooling when studies appear appropriately similar in terms of ulcer characteristics, intervention type, duration of treatment and outcome assessment.\n\n【106】In terms of meta‐analytical approach, in the presence of clinical heterogeneity (review author judgement) and/or evidence of statistical heterogeneity we will use the random‐effects model. We will only use a fixed‐effect approach when clinical heterogeneity is thought to be minimal and statistical heterogeneity is estimated as non‐statistically significant for the Chi² value and 0% for the I² assessment ( Kontopantelis 2012 ). We will adopt this approach as it is recognised that statistical assessments can miss potentially important between‐study heterogeneity in small samples, hence the preference for the more conservative random‐effects model ( Kontopantelis 2013 ). Where clinical heterogeneity is thought to be acceptable or of interest we may meta‐analyse even when statistical heterogeneity is high but we will attempt to interpret the causes behind this heterogeneity and will consider using meta‐regression for that purpose, if possible ( Thompson 1999 ; Thompson 2002 ).\n\n【107】We will present data using forest plots where possible. For dichotomous outcomes we will present the summary estimate as an RR with 95% CI. Where continuous outcomes are measured in the same way across studies, we plan to present a pooled MD with 95% CI; we plan to pool SMD estimates where studies measure the same outcome using different methods. For time‐to‐event data, we plan to plot (and, if appropriate, pool) estimates of HRs and 95% CIs as presented in the study reports using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ). Where time to healing is analysed as a continuous measure but it is not clear if all wounds healed, we will document the use of the outcome in the study but will not summarise or use the data in any meta‐analysis.\n\n【108】**'Summary of findings' tables**\n\n【109】We will present the main results of the review in ’Summary of findings’ tables. These tables present key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the interventions examined and the sum of available data for the main outcomes ( Schünemann 2011a ). The ’Summary of findings’ tables also include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. The GRADE approach defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specific interest. The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within‐trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias ( Schünemann 2011b ). We plan to present the following outcomes in the ’Summary of findings’ tables for each comparison:\n\n【110】*   Time to complete ulcer healing when analysed using appropriate survival analysis methods.\n    \n*   Proportion of ulcers completely healed during the trial period.\n    \n*   Study‐defined serious and non‐serious adverse events.\n    \n\n【111】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【112】When possible we will perform subgroup analyses according to whether the intervention was delivered in conjunction with compression therapy or not. RCTs in which it is unclear whether concurrent compression therapy was used will be excluded from these analyses.\n\n【113】When possible we will conduct subgroup analyses based on the type of test for protease activity employed and/or the threshold used to define a positive test result. For example laboratory‐based assays could be compared to point‐of‐care tests.\n\n【114】When possible, we will explore the influence of risk of bias on effect size. We will assess the influence of removing from meta‐analyses studies classed as having high and unclear risk of bias. We will explore subgroups of studies that are assessed as having low risk of bias in all key domains, namely selection bias, detection bias and attrition bias.\n\n【115】Elements of this methods section are based on the standard Cochrane Wounds Group Protocol Template.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the efficacy of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) and pharmacological prophylaxis in preventing venous thromboembolism in high‐risk patients.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Despite the use of contemporary prophylactic measures the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), or both is still great especially in high‐risk patients for example, those undergoing total hip or knee replacement, or colorectal surgery for cancer ( McLeod 2001 ). Experts in this field have indicated that this and similar observations are the result of _failed_ rather than _omitted_ prophylaxis ( Golhaber 2001 ). For this reason, the most recent guidelines recommend combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis in high‐risk groups, in an effort to maximise thromboprophylaxis ( Geerts 2004 ; Nicolaides 2001 ). It is likely that mechanical methods may increase efficacy and reduce death and morbidity rates without increasing bleeding risk.\n\n【6】Objectives\n----------\n\n【7】To assess the efficacy of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) and pharmacological prophylaxis in preventing venous thromboembolism in high‐risk patients.\n\n【8】Methods\n-------\n\n【9】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【10】#### Types of studies\n\n【11】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).\n\n【12】#### Types of participants\n\n【13】Patients at high risk of developing VTE including patients undergoing surgery, and trauma patients.\n\n【14】#### Types of interventions\n\n【15】Combined use of IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis (including unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin), compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone. Studies which used IPC for a short period of time (i.e. intraoperatively) will be excluded.\n\n【16】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【17】Venous thromboembolism (symptomatic or asymptomatic) is the main outcome measure, while data on DVT and PE (symptomatic or asymptomatic) will be extracted as separate endpoints. Outcomes will be assessed by ascending venography, 125 I‐fibrinogen uptake test, ultrasound scanning, pulmonary scintigraphy and computed tomography (CT) angiography.\n\n【18】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【19】All publications describing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression and pharmacological interventions used to prevent venous thromboembolism in high risk patients will be sought through the Specialised Register of the Peripheral Vascular Diseases (PVD) Group, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database. The PVD Group Register contains citations of trials identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (from 1960 to date), and EMBASE (from 1980 to date), and through handsearching journals and conference proceedings. The full list of journals that have been handsearched, as well as the search strategies for the electronic databases, are described in the 'Search strategies for the identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane PVD Group in _The Cochrane Library_ .\n\n【20】We will also search the reference lists of relevant articles to identify additional trials. There will be no restriction on language.\n\n【21】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【22】**Selection of trials**  \nSK and GG will independently search for studies as specified above, to increase retrieval yield. The same two authors will independently select potentially relevant trials.  \n  \n**Quality of trials**  \nSK and GG will independently assess study quality. If used, methods of randomisation will be assessed. Complete concealment of treatment is impossible, but evidence of independent outcome assessment will be sought. The Schultz Scale (quality based on concealment of allocation) will be used ( Schulz 1995 ).\n\n【23】**Data extraction**  \nSK and GG will independently extract the data. A data extraction form will be used to record the type of surgical procedure or trauma, total number of patients in the study (including those randomised and withdrawn), interventions used, number of patients who reached an endpoint (DVT or PE) and the methodology used to establish this, total mortality, and mortality from PE. A third author (JC) will arbitrate any disagreement.  \n  \n**Statistical analysis**  \nOdds ratios will be used for assessment of dichotomous outcomes. Subgroup analysis for DVT and PE will be performed. Chi square test will be used to assess heterogeneity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

This appears to be broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache. Some combinations of ibuprofen and paracetamol are available for use without prescription in some acute pain situations.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of single dose oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol for acute postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on _The Cochrane Library_ (Issue 4 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to May 21st 2013), EMBASE (1974 to May 21st 2013), the Oxford Pain Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of articles.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised, double‐blind clinical trials of single dose, oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol compared with placebo or the same dose of ibuprofen alone for acute postoperative pain in adults.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed quality, and extracted data. We used validated equations to calculate the area under the pain relief versus time curve and derive the proportion of participants with at least 50% of maximum pain relief over six hours. We calculated relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for ibuprofen plus paracetamol, ibuprofen alone, or placebo. We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use. We also collected information on adverse events.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Searches identified three studies involving 1647 participants. Each of them examined several dose combinations. Included studies provided data from 508 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo, 543 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo, and 359 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone.\n\n【15】The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief over 6 hours was 69% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 73% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 7% with placebo, giving NNTs of 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8) and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.7) for the lower and higher doses respectively compared with placebo. For ibuprofen 400 mg alone the proportion was 52%, giving an NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 5.4 (3.5 to 12).\n\n【16】Ibuprofen + paracetamol at the 200/500 mg and 400/1000 mg doses resulted in longer times to remedication than placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication was 7.6 hours for ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 8.3 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 1.7 hours with placebo. Fewer participants needed rescue medication with ibuprofen + paracetamol combination than with placebo or ibuprofen alone. The proportion was 34% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 25% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 79% with placebo, giving NNTs to prevent use of rescue medication of 2.2 (1.8 to 2.9) and 1.8 (1.6 to 2.2) respectively compared with placebo. The proportion of participants using rescue medication with ibuprofen 400 mg was 48%, giving an NNT to prevent use for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 4.3 (3.0 to 7.7).\n\n【17】The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events was 30% with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 29% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 48% with placebo, giving NNT values in favour of the combination treatment of 5.4 (3.6 to 10.5) and 5.1 (3.5 to 9.5) for the lower and higher doses respectively. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy were fewer than 5% and balanced across treatment arms.\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】Ibuprofen plus paracetamol combinations provided better analgesia than either drug alone (at the same dose), with a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours, and with a smaller chance of experiencing an adverse event.\n\n【20】PICOs\n-----\n\n【21】### PICOs\n\n【22】###### Population (6)\n\n【23】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Acute Postoperative Pain\n\n【24】###### Intervention (3)\n\n【25】*   Paracetamol\n*   Ibuprofen\n*   Oral\n\n【26】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【27】*   Ibuprofen\n*   Placebo\n\n【28】###### Outcome (7)\n\n【29】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Withdrawal Due To Adverse Events\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Rescue Medication\n*   Time-to-Event\n*   Pain Relief\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

In many, though not all, circumstances, the pain can be treated with oral analgesics. Many oral analgesics are available, and this review is one of a series examining how effective each one is, at particular doses.\n\n【37】This review examines a combination of fixed doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the USA and some parts of the world). Both are commonly used analgesics, which probably work by different mechanisms. We know that combining different analgesics in the same tablet gives good pain relief to more people than either analgesic alone, at the same dose.\n\n【38】This review found data in three clinical trials, involving 1647 people with moderate or severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed. This is used commonly to test analgesic effectiveness, because results are applicable to other forms of acute pain after trauma.\n\n【39】Ibuprofen 200 mg plus paracetamol 500 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg provided effective pain relief for about 7 in 10 (70%) of participants, compared with just under 1 in 10 (7%) of participants with placebo. The analgesic effects lasted longer and there were fewer adverse events with the combinations than with placebo.\n\n【40】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【41】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【42】### Implications for practice\n\n【43】Combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol are better analgesics than either drug alone. There were sufficient studies and participants, together with consistent large effects for pain, remedication, and adverse event benefits, to consider that this is an important finding, as good analgesia was provided by relatively low doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol. Given that neither is without risk of potential toxicity, which is likely to be dose‐dependent, this is a useful finding. While the results here were obtained from dental pain, considerable evidence has shown results from this pain model to be similar for other acute pain situations.\n\n【44】### Implications for research\n\n【45】It is not clear what are the implications for research. Studies offer no new methodological insights, and while additional data are always welcome, there are potential balancing ethical issues from including participants in studies that do not add to existing knowledge in a meaningful way. However, as these studies were confined to dental extraction in young participants, there is a need for additional studies in other postoperative situations, and especially in older, sicker patients. Further studies in other acute painful conditions, such as headache, are also needed.\n\n【46】Background\n----------\n\n【47】### Description of the condition\n\n【48】Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury and/or nerve injury. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care.\n\n【49】This is one of a series of reviews whose aim is to increase awareness of the range of analgesics that are potentially available, and present evidence for relative analgesic efficacy through indirect comparisons with placebo, in very similar trials performed in a standard manner, with very similar outcomes, and over the same duration. Such relative analgesic efficacy does not in itself determine choice of drug for any situation or patient, but guides policy‐making at the local level. The series covers all analgesics licensed for acute postoperative pain in the UK, and dipyrone, which is commonly used in Spain, Portugal, and Latin‐American countries. The results have been examined in an overview ( Moore 2011a ), and important individual reviews include ibuprofen ( Derry 2009 ), paracetamol ( Toms 2008 ), codeine ( Derry 2010 ), and etoricoxib ( Clarke 2012 ).\n\n【50】### Description of the intervention\n\n【51】#### Acute pain trials\n\n【52】Single dose trials in acute pain are commonly short in duration, rarely lasting longer than 12 hours. The numbers of participants are small, allowing no reliable conclusions to be drawn about safety. To show that the analgesic is working, it is necessary to use placebo ( McQuay 2005 ). There are clear ethical considerations in doing this. These ethical considerations are answered by using acute pain situations where the pain is expected to go away, and by providing additional analgesia, commonly called rescue analgesia, if the pain has not diminished after about an hour. This is reasonable, because not all participants given an analgesic will have significant pain relief. Approximately 18% of participants given placebo will have significant pain relief ( Moore 2006 ), and up to 50% may have inadequate analgesia with active medicines. The use of additional or rescue analgesia is hence important for all participants in the trials.\n\n【53】Clinical trials measuring the efficacy of analgesics in acute pain have been standardised over many years. Trials have to be randomised and double‐blind. Typically, in the first few hours or days after an operation, patients develop pain that is moderate to severe in intensity, and will then be given the test analgesic or placebo. Pain is measured using standard pain intensity scales immediately before the intervention, and then using pain intensity and pain relief scales over the following four to six hours for shorter‐acting drugs, and up to 12 or 24 hours for longer‐acting drugs. Pain relief of half the maximum possible pain relief or better (at least 50% pain relief) is typically regarded as a clinically useful outcome. For patients given rescue medication it is usual for no additional pain measurements to be made, and for all subsequent measures to be recorded as initial pain intensity or baseline (zero) pain relief (baseline observation carried forward). This process ensures that analgesia from the rescue medication is not wrongly ascribed to the test intervention. In some trials the last observation is carried forward, which gives an inflated response for the test intervention compared to placebo, but the effect has been shown to be negligible over four to six hours ( Moore 2005 ). Patients usually remain in the hospital or clinic for at least the first six hours following the intervention, with measurements supervised, although they may then be allowed home to make their own measurements in trials of longer duration.\n\n【54】Knowing the relative efficacy of different analgesic drugs at various doses can be helpful.\n\n【55】#### Ibuprofen\n\n【56】Ibuprofen was developed in the 1960s and is used extensively throughout the world for relief of pain and inflammation in both acute and chronic conditions. It is available over the counter in most countries, usually as 200 mg tablets, with 1200 mg as the recommended maximum daily dose for adults. Under medical supervision, up to 3200 mg daily may be taken, divided into three doses. Soluble salts of ibuprofen have lower (better) NNTs ( Derry 2009 ).\n\n【57】A major concern regarding the use of conventional NSAIDs postoperatively is the possibility of bleeding from both the operative site (because of the inhibition of platelet aggregation) ( Forrest 2002 ) and from the upper gastrointestinal tract (especially in patients stressed by surgery, the elderly, frail, or dehydrated). Other potentially serious adverse events include acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes ( Hernandez‐Diaz 2001 ). However, such complications are more likely to occur with chronic use and NSAIDs generally present fewer risks if used in the short term, as in the treatment of postoperative pain ( Rapoport 1999 ).\n\n【58】#### Paracetamol\n\n【59】Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was first identified as the active metabolite of two older antipyretic drugs, acetanilide and phenacetin, in the late nineteenth century. It became available in the UK on prescription in 1956, and over‐the‐counter in 1963 ( PIC 2008 ). Since then it has become one of the most popular antipyretic and analgesic drugs worldwide, and is often also used in combination with other drugs. The usual adult dose is 500 mg to 1000 mg, with a maximum of 4000 mg in 24 hours.\n\n【60】Paracetamol has a recognised potential for hepatotoxicity and is thought to be responsible for approximately half of all cases of liver failure in the UK ( Hawton 2001 ), and about 40% in the USA ( Norris 2008 ). Acute paracetamol hepatotoxicity at therapeutic doses is extremely unlikely despite reports of so‐called therapeutic misadventure ( Prescott 2000 ). In recent years legislative changes restricting pack sizes and the maximum number of tablets permitted in over‐the‐counter sales were introduced in the UK ( CSM 1997 ) on the basis of evidence that poisoning is less frequent in countries that restrict availability ( Gunnell 1997 ; Hawton 2001 ). The contribution of these changes, which are inconvenient and costly (particularly for chronic pain sufferers), to any observed reduction in incidence of liver failure or death, remains uncertain ( Hawkins 2007 ). In 2011, the FDA announced a restriction to 325 mg paracetamol per tablet in prescription combinations, and increased warning labels in an attempt to reduce the risk of severe liver injury and allergic reactions associated with paracetamol ( FDA 2011 ). Concerns have arisen over the safety of paracetamol in patients with compromised hepatic function (those with severe alcoholism, cirrhosis or hepatitis), but these have not been substantiated ( Dart 2000 ; PIC 2008 ). Other concerns have been raised about potential cardiovascular safety of paracetamol ( Hinz 2012 ).\n\n【61】### How the intervention might work\n\n【62】NSAIDs reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), the enzyme mediating production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 ( FitzGerald 2001 ). Prostaglandins mediate a variety of physiological functions such as maintenance of the gastric mucosal barrier, regulation of renal blood flow, and regulation of endothelial tone. They also play an important role in inflammatory and nociceptive processes. Ibuprofen, like most NSAIDs, causes reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenases, which interferes with thromboxane and prostaglandin synthesis, and increases production of anti‐inflammatory lipoxins.\n\n【63】The lack of significant anti‐inflammatory activity of paracetamol implies a mode of action distinct from that of NSAIDs, yet, despite years of use and research, the mechanisms of action of paracetamol are not fully understood. Paracetamol has been shown to have no significant effects on COX‐1 or COX‐2 ( Schwab 2003 ), but it has come to be considered as a selective COX‐2 inhibitor ( Hinz 2008 ). Significant paracetamol‐induced inhibition of prostaglandin production has been demonstrated in tissues in the brain, spleen, and lung ( Botting 2000 ; Flower 1972 ). A ’COX‐3 hypothesis’, wherein the efficacy of paracetamol is attributed to its specific inhibition of a third cyclooxygenase isoform enzyme, COX‐3 ( Botting 2000 ; Chandrasekharan 2002 ; PIC 2008 ) now has little credibility, and a central mode action of paracetamol is thought to be likely ( Graham 2005 ).\n\n【64】#### Combination analgesics\n\n【65】We now have convincing evidence that combining two analgesics can provide additional levels of analgesia in acute pain and headache ( Moore 2011b ; Moore 2012 ), and that the drug‐specific effects are essentially additive. Results confirm that the assumption that the efficacy of combination analgesics is the sum of the efficacies of the individual analgesic components is broadly true across a range of different drug combinations, in postoperative pain and migraine headache, and when tested in the same and different trials ( Moore 2012 ). There is no convincing evidence for combination analgesics in chronic pain, however ( Chaparro 2012 ).\n\n【66】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【67】Ibuprofen and paracetamol are both widely available and inexpensive, with proven efficacy for relief of acute postoperative pain ( Derry 2009 ; Toms 2008 ). In combination paracetamol has been shown to significantly enhance the efficacy of codeine ( Toms 2009 ) and oxycodone ( Gaskell 2009 ). Ibuprofen and paracetamol are frequently used in combination in clinical practice and are available as a fixed dose combination tablet over‐the‐counter in some countries. It is important to know how this combination compares with other analgesics assessed in the same way ( Moore 2011a ).\n\n【68】Objectives\n----------\n\n【69】To assess the efficacy and adverse effects of single dose oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol for acute postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes.\n\n【70】Methods\n-------\n\n【71】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【72】#### Types of studies\n\n【73】We included studies of double‐blind trials of single dose oral ibuprofen plus paracetamol compared with placebo or the same dose of ibuprofen alone, for the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults, with at least 10 participants randomly allocated to each treatment group. We included multiple dose studies if appropriate data from the first dose were available, and cross‐over studies provided that data from the first arm were presented separately.\n\n【74】We excluded the following:\n\n【75】*   review articles, case reports, and clinical observations;\n    \n*   studies of experimental pain;\n    \n*   studies where pain relief is assessed only by clinicians, nurses, or carers (i.e. not patient‐reported);\n    \n*   studies of less than four hours duration or studies that fail to present data over four to six hours post dose.\n    \n\n【76】For postpartum pain, we included studies if the pain investigated was due to episiotomy or Caesarean section irrespective of the presence of uterine cramps; we excluded studies investigating pain due to uterine cramps alone.\n\n【77】#### Types of participants\n\n【78】We included studies of adult participants (> 15 years) with established postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity following day surgery or in‐patient surgery. For studies using a visual analogue scale (VAS), we considered that pain intensity of greater than 30/100 mm equates to pain of at least moderate intensity ( Collins 1997 ).\n\n【79】#### Types of interventions\n\n【80】Ibuprofen plus paracetamol, administered as a single oral dose, compared with matched placebo or the same dose of ibuprofen alone for postoperative pain. The ibuprofen and paracetamol had to be administered as separate tablets taken together, or in a combined tablet. We included all dose combinations.\n\n【81】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【82】We collected the following data where available:\n\n【83】*   participant characteristics;\n    \n*   patient reported pain at baseline (physician, nurse, or carer reported pain was not included in the analysis);\n    \n*   patient reported pain relief expressed at least hourly over four to six hours using validated pain scales (pain intensity and pain relief in the form of VAS or categorical scales, or both);\n    \n*   patient global assessment of efficacy (PGE), using a standard categorical scale;\n    \n*   time to use of rescue medication;\n    \n*   number of participants using rescue medication;\n    \n*   number of participants with one or more adverse events;\n    \n*   number of participants with serious adverse events;\n    \n*   number of withdrawals (all‐cause, adverse events).\n    \n\n【84】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【85】Participants achieving at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours.\n\n【86】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【87】*   Median (or mean) time to use of rescue medication;\n    \n*   Number of participants using rescue medication;\n    \n*   Number of participants with: any adverse event; any serious adverse event (as reported in the study); withdrawal due to an adverse event;\n    \n*   Other withdrawals: withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy (participants using rescue medication.\n    \n\n【88】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【89】#### Electronic searches\n\n【90】We searched the following databases:\n\n【91】*   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on _The Cochrane Library_ , (Issue 4 of 12, 2013);\n    \n*   MEDLINE (via OVID) (1950 to 21 May 2013);\n    \n*   EMBASE (via OVID) (1974 to 21 May 2013);\n    \n*   Oxford Pain Relief Database ( Jadad 1996a ).\n    \n\n【92】See Appendix 1 for the MEDLINE search strategy, Appendix 2 for the EMBASE search strategy, and Appendix 3 for the CENTRAL search strategy. We did not limit the searches by language.\n\n【93】#### Searching other resources\n\n【94】We searched for additional studies in reference lists of retrieved articles and reviews, and in clinicaltrials.gov . The manufacturers of the combination formulation (Reckitt Benckiser) had already supplied information on published and unpublished studies.\n\n【95】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【96】#### Selection of studies\n\n【97】Two review authors independently assessed and agreed the search results for studies to be included in the review. Disagreements would be resolved by consensus or referral to a third review author.\n\n【98】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【99】Two review authors extracted data and recorded them on a standard data extraction form. One review author entered data suitable for pooling into RevMan 5.1 ( RevMan 2011 ).\n\n【100】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【101】Two review authors independently assessed each study for methodological quality using a three‐item, five‐point scale ( Jadad 1996b ), and agreed a consensus score.\n\n【102】The scale used is as follows.\n\n【103】*   Is the study randomised? If yes ‐ one point.\n    \n*   Is the randomisation procedure reported and is it appropriate? If yes add one point, if no deduct one point.\n    \n*   Is the study double‐blind? If yes add one point.\n    \n*   Is the double‐blind method reported and is it appropriate? If yes add one point, if no deduct one point.\n    \n*   Are the reasons for patient withdrawals and dropouts described? If yes add one point.\n    \n\n【104】We also completed a 'Risk of bias' table, using methods adapted from those described by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) with any disagreements resolved by discussion.  The following were assessed for each study.\n\n【105】*   Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to generate the allocation sequence was assessed as: low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);  high risk of bias (any non‐random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) ‐ these studies would be excluded; unclear risk of bias.\n    \n*   Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias).  The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. The methods were assessed as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth) ‐ theses studies would be excluded; unclear risk of bias.\n    \n*   Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). The methods used to blind study participants and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received were assessed. Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias if they stated that they were blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding (e.g. identical tablets; matched in appearance and smell), or at unknown risk if they stated that they were blinded, but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved. Single blind and open studies would be excluded.\n    \n*   Size (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably due to methodological weaknesses ( Nuesch 2010 ). Studies were considered to be at low risk of bias if they had ≥ 200 participants, at unknown risk of they had 50 to 200 participants, and at high risk if they had < 50 participants.\n    \n\n【106】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【107】We used relative risk (or 'risk ratio', RR) to establish statistical difference. We used numbers needed to treat (NNT) and pooled percentages as absolute measures of benefit or harm.\n\n【108】We used the following terms to describe adverse outcomes in terms of harm or prevention of harm.\n\n【109】*   When significantly fewer adverse outcomes occur with treatment than with control (placebo or active) we use the term the _number needed to treat to prevent one event_ (NNTp).\n    \n*   When significantly more adverse outcomes occur with treatment compared with control (placebo or active) we use the term the _number needed to harm or cause one event_ (NNH).\n    \n\n【110】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【111】We accepted only randomisation to the individual patient.\n\n【112】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【113】The only likely issue with missing data in these studies is from imputation using last observation carried forward when a patient requests rescue medication. We have previously shown that this does not affect results for up to six hours after taking study medication ( Barden 2004 ).\n\n【114】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【115】We examined heterogeneity visually using L'Abbé plots ( L'Abbé 1987 ), a visual method for assessing differences in results of individual studies.\n\n【116】#### Data synthesis\n\n【117】We followed QUOROM guidelines ( Moher 1999 ). For efficacy analyses we used the number of participants in each treatment group who were randomised, received medication, and provided at least one post‐baseline assessment. For safety analyses we used number of participants randomised to each treatment group who took the study medication. We planed to analyse for different doses separately.\n\n【118】For each study we converted the mean TOTPAR, SPID, VAS TOTPAR, or VAS SPID ( Appendix 4 ) values for active and placebo to %maxTOTPAR or %maxSPID by division into the calculated maximum value ( Cooper 1991 ), and calculated the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved at least 50%maxTOTPAR using verified equations ( Moore 1996 ; Moore 1997a ; Moore 1997b ). We then converted these proportions into the number of participants achieving at least 50%maxTOTPAR by multiplying by the total number of participants in the treatment group. We used this information on the number of participants with at least 50%maxTOTPAR for active and placebo to calculate relative benefit or relative risk, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH). Because adverse events with ibuprofen/paracetamol combinations were less frequent than with placebo, this is described as an NNTp, the number needed to treat to _prevent_ an adverse event. NNTp was also used to describe differences in remedication rates, where remedication rates were lower with active treatment than control.\n\n【119】We accepted the following pain measures for the calculation of TOTPAR or SPID:\n\n【120】*   five‐point categorical pain relief (PR) scales with comparable wording to 'none, slight, moderate, good or complete';\n    \n*   four‐point categorical pain intensity (PI) scales with comparable wording to 'none, mild, moderate, severe';\n    \n*   VAS for pain relief;\n    \n*   VAS for pain intensity.\n    \n\n【121】If none of these measures was available, we would use the number of participants reporting 'very good or excellent' on a five‐point categorical global scale with the wording 'poor, fair, good, very good, excellent' for the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief ( Collins 2001 ).\n\n【122】For each treatment group we extracted the number of participants reporting treatment‐emergent adverse effects, and calculated relative benefit and risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model ( Morris 1995 ). We calculated NNT and NNH with 95% CIs using the pooled number of events using the method devised by Cook and Sackett ( Cook 1995 ). We assumed a statistically significant difference from control when the 95% CI of the relative risk or relative benefit did not include the number one.\n\n【123】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【124】We planned subgroup analyses to determine the effect of dose and presenting condition (pain model: dental versus other postoperative pain). A minimum of two studies and 200 participants had to be available in any subgroup or sensitivity analysis ( Moore 1998 ), which was restricted to the primary outcome (50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours) and the dose with the greatest amount of data. We determined significant differences between NNT, NNTp, or NNH for different groups in subgroup and sensitivity analyses using the z test ( Tramèr 1997 ).\n\n【125】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【126】We planned sensitivity analyses for quality score (two versus three or more) and trial size (39 or fewer versus 40 or more per treatment arm).\n\n【127】Results\n-------\n\n【128】### Description of studies\n\n【129】#### Included studies\n\n【130】Searches identified three studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ). All three were published in full peer‐reviewed journals, but additional information from unpublished clinical trial reports was available for two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ). No PRISMA flowchart was required.\n\n【131】All of the included studies recruited participants aged 16 years or older (mean ages ranged from 20 to 21 years). The majority of participants were female (60% to 74%) and all had undergone surgical extraction of at least three impacted third molars, two of which had to be mandibular. Exclusion criteria included history of migraine, gastrointestinal disorder, or other history of significant disease or psychotic illness. A washout period from concomitant medications was stipulated by two of the reviews. In each of the studies, medication was administered when baseline pain reached a moderate or severe intensity. Pain intensity and pain relief were measured on standard 4‐ and 5‐point scales, respectively, at set time intervals after dosing.\n\n【132】The three studies involved 1647 participants and used both placebo and active comparators. Each of the studies looked at a number of different dose combinations and comparators. The following treatments were administered.\n\n【133】*   Ibuprofen 100 mg + paracetamol 250 mg ( Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 71\n    \n*   Ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 349\n    \n*   Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 384\n    \n*   Ibuprofen 400 mg + codeine 25.6 mg ( Daniels 2011 ), n = 169\n    \n*   Ibuprofen 200 mg ( Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 75\n    \n*   Ibuprofen 400 mg ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 143\n    \n*   Paracetamol 1000 mg + codeine 30 mg ( Daniels 2011 ), n = 113\n    \n*   Paracetamol 500 mg ( Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 76\n    \n*   Paracetamol 1000 mg ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 108\n    \n*   Placebo ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ), n = 159\n    \n\n【134】Full details are in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【135】Two further studies were identified that were ongoing but likely to satisfy inclusion criteria ( NCT00921700 ; NCT01559259 ). If appropriate this review will be updated to include these studies once results become available. Full details are in the Characteristics of ongoing studies table.\n\n【136】#### Excluded studies\n\n【137】Four studies were excluded after reading the full paper ( Menhinick 2004 ; Merry 2010 ; Mitchell 2008 ; Naidu 1994 ). Full details are in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.\n\n【138】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【139】Included studies were all randomised and double‐blind and provided information about withdrawals and dropouts. The methodological quality of the trials was determined using the Oxford Quality Scale. All three studies provided adequate description of the methods of randomisation and double‐blinding and information about withdrawals and dropouts, and thus scored 5/5 on the scale. Details for individual studies are provided in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【140】In addition a Risk of bias table was created which considered random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and study size ( Figure 1 ; Figure 2 ).\n\n【141】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【142】Figure 1\n\n【143】* * *\n\n【144】* * *\n\n【145】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【146】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【147】Figure 2\n\n【148】* * *\n\n【149】* * *\n\n【150】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【151】#### Allocation\n\n【152】All studies reported that they were randomised and adequately described the method used to generate the schedule. One study ( Mehlisch 2010a ) described the methods used to conceal the random allocation, but the other two did not.\n\n【153】#### Blinding\n\n【154】All studies were double blind and adequately described how this was achieved.\n\n【155】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【156】Treatment group size was an issue. Small studies are thought to be at increased risk of bias, probably because the conduct of small studies is more likely to be less rigorous, allowing critical criteria such as blinding to be compromised. None of the treatment groups in this review was large enough to be confident that bias would be avoided; one ( Mehlisch 2010a ) had treatment group sizes that put it at high risk of bias.\n\n【157】### Effects of interventions\n\n【158】Details of outcomes in individual studies are in Appendix 5 (efficacy) and Appendix 6 (adverse events and withdrawals).\n\n【159】#### Number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief\n\n【160】All studies reported data from which this outcome could be calculated, and results are tabulated in Summary of results A.\n\n【161】##### Ibuprofen 100 mg + paracetamol 250 mg versus placebo\n\n【162】One study ( Mehlisch 2010b ) compared ibuprofen 100 mg + paracetamol 250 mg with placebo; 46/71 participants experienced at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with the active treatment, and 8/73 with placebo. There were insufficient data for analysis.\n\n【163】##### Ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo\n\n【164】Three studies ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo.\n\n【165】*   The proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 69% (240/349; range 55% to 74%).\n    \n*   The proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with placebo was 7% (10/159; range 0% to 11%).\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 10.3 (5.7 to 19); the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours was 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8) ( Analysis 1.1 ; Figure 3 ).\n    \n\n【166】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【167】Figure 3\n\n【168】* * *\n\n【169】* * *\n\n【170】Forest plot of comparison: ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo, outcome: 1.1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief.\n\n【171】Figure 4 shows the distribution of results for ibuprofen 200 mg plus paracetamol 500 mg compared with placebo.

There were insufficient data for analysis.\n\n【193】##### Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg\n\n【194】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone.\n\n【195】*   The proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg was 71% (153/216; range 67% to 72%).\n    \n*   The proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg was 52% (75/143; range 42% to 62%).\n    \n*   The relative benefit of combination treatment compared with ibuprofen alone was 1.3 (1.1 to 1.6); the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours was 5.4 (3.5 to 12.2) ( Analysis 3.1 ).\n    \n\n| **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  | **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  | **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  | **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  | **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  | **Summary of results A: Number of participants with ≥ 50% pain relief over 6 hours**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dose: ibu/para (mg)**  | **Studies**  | **Participants**  | **Ibu + para (%)**  | **Placebo (%)**  | **NNT (95%CI)**  |\n| 100/250  | 1  | 144  | 65  | 11  | not calculated  |\n| 200/500  | 3  | 508  | 69  | 7  | 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8)  |\n| 400/1000  | 3  | 543  | 73  | 7  | 1.5 (1.4 to 1.7)  |\n|  |  |  |  | **Ibu 200 mg (%)**  |  |\n| 200/500  | 1  | 218  | 74  | 56  | not calculated  |\n|  |  |  |  | **Ibu 400 mg (%)**  |  |\n| 400/1000  | 2  | 359  | 71  | 52  | 5.4 (3.5 to 12)  |\n| ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  | ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  | ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  | ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  | ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  | ibu = ibuprofen; para = paracetamol.  |\n\n【197】###### Subgroup analyses\n\n【198】Subgroup analyses for dose have been carried out as part of the main analysis. All studies included participants who had undergone third molar extraction, so no analysis was possible for presenting condition.\n\n【199】###### Sensitivity analyses\n\n【200】All studies scored 5/5 on the Oxford Quality Scale, so no analysis was possible for methodological quality. Only one comparison had fewer than 40 participants in both treatment arms ( Mehlisch 2010a , ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg, 64 participants). Removing this study from the analysis did not change the result.\n\n【201】#### Rescue medication\n\n【202】##### Median time to use of rescue medication\n\n【203】Only two studies reported the median time to use of rescue medication ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ). The weighted mean of median times to remedication ranged from 7.6 hours with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg (data from 206 participants) to 8.3 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg (data from 235 participants), compared with just 1.7 hours with placebo (data from 86 participants).\n\n【204】##### Number of participants using rescue medication\n\n【205】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) reported this outcome after 8 hours and provided sufficient data for analysis of ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo, as well as ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg alone.\n\n【206】###### Ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo\n\n【207】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo.\n\n【208】*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 34% (60/176; range 28% to 61%).\n    \n*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with placebo was 79% (82/104; range 73% to 94%).\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 0.46 (0.37 to 0.58); the NNTp was 2.2 (1.8 to 2.9) ( Analysis 1.2 ).\n    \n\n【209】###### Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo\n\n【210】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo.\n\n【211】*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg was 25% (53/216; range 21% to 31%).\n    \n*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with placebo was 79% (82/104; range 73% to 94%).\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 0.31 (0.24 to 0.40); the NNTp was 1.8 (1.6 to 2.2) ( Analysis 2.2 ).\n    \n\n【212】###### Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg\n\n【213】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone.\n\n【214】*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg was 25% (53/216; range 21% to 31%).\n    \n*   The proportion of participants using rescue medication within 8 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg was 48% (68/143; range 28% to 68%).\n    \n*   The relative benefit of combination treatment compared with ibuprofen alone was 0.57 (0.42 to 0.77); the NNTp was 4.3 (3.0 to 7.7) ( Analysis 3.2 ).\n    \n\n【215】#### Adverse events\n\n【216】The most commonly reported adverse events were those expected following third molar surgery: swelling of the face, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness. These events are commonly associated with surgery and anaesthesia.\n\n【217】##### Any adverse event\n\n【218】All studies reported the number of participants with one or more adverse events for each treatment arm, although in two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) this was reported after 8 hours, and in one study ( Daniels 2011 ) after 12 hours. In the authors' judgement these time points were comparable and all data were analysed together.\n\n【219】###### Ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo\n\n【220】Three studies ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo.\n\n【221】*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 30% (104/349; range 25% to 67%);\n    \n*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with placebo was 48% (77/159; range 38% to 68%);\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 0.69 (0.55 to 0.85); the NNTp was 5.4 (3.6 to 11) ( Analysis 1.3 ).\n    \n\n【222】###### Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo\n\n【223】Three studies ( Daniels 2011 ; Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo.\n\n【224】*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg was 29% (111/384; range 18% to 69%);\n    \n*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with placebo was 48% (77/159; range 38% to 68%);\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 0.62 (0.50 to 0.77); the NNTp was 5.1 (3.5 to 9.5) ( Analysis 2.3 ).\n    \n\n【225】###### Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg\n\n【226】Two studies ( Mehlisch 2010a ; Mehlisch 2010b ) provided data comparing ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg.\n\n【227】*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg was 37% (80/216; range 23% to 69%);\n    \n*   The proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event with ibuprofen 400 mg was 55% (78/143; range 35% to 75%);\n    \n*   The relative benefit of treatment compared with placebo was 0.81 (0.66 to 0.99); the NNTp was 5.7 (3.6 to 14) ( Analysis 3.3 ).\n    \n\n【228】##### Serious adverse events\n\n【229】There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the included studies.\n\n【230】#### Withdrawals\n\n【231】Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy is considered under use of rescue medication. Withdrawals for other reasons were no more than 5% and balanced across treatment arms. All reported adverse event withdrawals were due to early vomiting. There were too few events for analysis ( Appendix 6 ).\n\n【232】Discussion\n----------\n\n【233】The background to this review is a knowledge that combinations of different analgesics provide additive effects in acute pain and migraine ( Moore 2011b ; Moore 2012 ). The main thrust of this review is to assess the analgesic efficacy of ibuprofen and paracetamol combination analgesics because they are becoming available to the public without prescription, and combinations may be used to some extent in treating acute pain in hospital or in primary care.\n\n【234】### Summary of main results\n\n【235】Three studies were identified for inclusion. These studies provided data from 508 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo, 543 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo, and 359 participants for the comparison of ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone. There were insufficient data for analysis of any other comparisons. In summary, ibuprofen plus paracetamol combinations provided better analgesia than either drug alone (at the same dose), with a smaller chance of needing additional analgesia over about eight hours, and with a smaller chance of experiencing an adverse event.\n\n【236】The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 69%, compared to 73% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 7% with placebo, giving NNTs of 1.6 (1.5 to 1.8) and 1.5 (1.4 to 1.7) for the lower and higher doses respectively. The proportion of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over 6 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg alone was 52%, giving an NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 5.4 (3.5 to 12.2).\n\n【237】In studies reporting median time to use of rescue medication, treatment with ibuprofen + paracetamol combination at both the 200/500 mg and 400/1000 mg doses resulted in longer times to remedication when compared with placebo. The median time to use of rescue medication for ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 7.6 hours, compared to 8.3 hours with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 1.7 hours with placebo. Fewer participants required rescue medication with the ibuprofen + paracetamol combination than with placebo or ibuprofen alone. The proportion of participants using rescue medication with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 34%, compared with 25% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 79% with placebo, giving NNTps of 2.2 (1.8 to 2.9) and 1.8 (1.6 to 2.2) respectively. The proportion of participants using rescue medication with ibuprofen 400 mg was 48%, giving an NNTp for ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg compared with ibuprofen alone of 4.3 (3.0 to 7.7).\n\n【238】The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events with ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg was 30%, compared to 29% with ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg, and 48% with placebo, giving NNTp of 5.4 (3.6 to 10.5) and 5.1 (3.5 to 9.5) for the lower and higher doses respectively (i.e. in favour of the combination treatment). The proportion of participants experiencing one or more adverse events with ibuprofen 400 mg alone was 37%. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Withdrawals for reasons other than lack of efficacy were fewer than 5% and balanced across treatment arms, but there were too few events for analysis.\n\n【239】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【240】The main limitation of the review is the relatively small number of studies and participants for some combinations. However, the general results are in accord with those known for ibuprofen and paracetamol alone ( Derry 2009 ; Toms 2008 ) and for combination drugs in acute pain ( Moore 2011b ; Moore 2012 ). Since all three studies used the dental pain model, applicability to other types of acute pain may be questioned, but other analgesics are known to perform similarly in dental and other types of postoperative pain of comparable severity, and clinical practice demonstrates applicability to other types of acute nociceptive pain.\n\n【241】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【242】All studies were randomised and double‐blind and provided information about withdrawals and dropouts, scoring 5/5 on the Oxford Quality Scale, and indicating that they are likely to be methodologically robust. Studies were valid in that they recruited participants with adequate baseline pain and used clinically useful outcome measures. The studies themselves were of high quality, but sample sizes were somewhat limited.\n\n【243】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【244】We carried out extensive searches to identify relevant studies, but there always remains the possibility of unidentified studies. We calculated that for ibuprofen 400 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg, an additional 2353 participants would have to have been involved in unpublished trials with zero treatment effects for the NNT for at least 50% pain relief to increase above 8, a level we consider to be the limit of clinical utility for this outcome ( Moore 2008 ). It is very unlikely that this amount of unidentified information exists. We know of two ongoing studies ( NCT00921700 ; NCT01559259 ) with an estimated enrolment of 600 participants.\n\n【245】There are no other known potential biases in the review process.\n\n【246】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【247】We are unaware of any previous systematic reviews of ibuprofen plus paracetamol in acute pain in adults.\n\n【248】Figures and Tables -\n\n【249】Figure 1\n\n【250】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【251】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【252】Figures and Tables -\n\n【253】Figure 2\n\n【254】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【255】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【256】Figures and Tables -\n\n【257】Figure 3\n\n【258】Forest plot of comparison: ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo, outcome: 1.1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief.\n\n【259】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【260】Figures and Tables -\n\n【261】Figure 4\n\n【262】Studies comparing ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg with placebo, with the outcome of at least 50% maximum pain relief over 4 to 6 hours.\n\n【263】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【264】Figures and Tables -\n\n【265】Figure 5\n\n【266】Forest plot of comparison: Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo, outcome: 2.1 Participants with ≥ 50% pain relief.\n\n【267】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【268】Figures and Tables -\n\n【269】Figure 6\n\n【270】Studies comparing ibuprofen 400 mg plus paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo, with the outcome of at least 50% maximum pain relief over 4‐6 hours\n\n【271】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【272】Figures and Tables -\n\n【273】Analysis 1.1\n\n【274】Comparison 1 ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo, Outcome 1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief.\n\n【275】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【276】Figures and Tables -\n\n【277】Analysis 1.2\n\n【278】Comparison 1 ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo, Outcome 2 Participants using rescue medication within 8 h.\n\n【279】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【280】Figures and Tables -\n\n【281】Analysis 1.3\n\n【282】Comparison 1 ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo, Outcome 3 Participants with any adverse event.\n\n【283】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【284】Figures and Tables -\n\n【285】Analysis 2.1\n\n【286】Comparison 2 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo, Outcome 1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief.\n\n【287】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【288】Figures and Tables -\n\n【289】Analysis 2.2\n\n【290】Comparison 2 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo, Outcome 2 Participants using rescue medication within 8 h.\n\n【291】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【292】Figures and Tables -\n\n【293】Analysis 2.3\n\n【294】Comparison 2 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus placebo, Outcome 3 Participants with any adverse event.\n\n【295】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【296】Figures and Tables -\n\n【297】Analysis 3.1\n\n【298】Comparison 3 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg, Outcome 1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief.\n\n【299】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【300】Figures and Tables -\n\n【301】Analysis 3.2\n\n【302】Comparison 3 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg, Outcome 2 Participants using rescue medication within 8 h.\n\n【303】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【304】Figures and Tables -\n\n【305】Analysis 3.3\n\n【306】Comparison 3 Ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg versus ibuprofen 400 mg, Outcome 3 Participants with any adverse event.\n\n【307】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【308】Comparison 1. ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo\n\n| Outcome or subgroup title  | No. of studies  | No. of participants  | Statistical method  | Effect size  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 Participants with ≥50% pain relief **Show forest plot**  | 3  | 508  | Risk Ratio (M‐H, Fixed, 95% CI)  | 10.29 \\[5.70, 18.58\\]  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 Participants using rescue medication within 8 h **Show forest plot**  | 2  | 280  | Risk Ratio (M‐H, Fixed, 95% CI)  | 0.46 \\[0.37, 0.58\\]  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| 3 Participants with any adverse event **Show forest plot**  | 3  | 508  | Risk Ratio (M‐H, Fixed, 95% CI)  | 0.69 \\[0.55, 0.85\\]  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【310】Figures and Tables -\n\n【311】Comparison 1. ibuprofen 200 mg + paracetamol 500 mg versus placebo\n\n【312】Navigate to table in Review\n\n【313】Comparison 2.

Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta‐blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To quantify the dose‐related effects of nonselective beta‐adrenergic receptor blockers (beta‐blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel or cross‐over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta‐blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta‐blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross‐over studies. Overall, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta‐blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose‐response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta‐blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was ‐10 mmHg (95% CI ‐11 to ‐8) for systolic BP and ‐7 mmHg (95% CI ‐8 to ‐6) for diastolic BP (low‐quality evidence). Nonselective beta‐blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low‐quality evidence). The dose‐response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (‐2.2 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.7 to ‐0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta‐blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】In people with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of ‐10/‐7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta‐blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non‐selective beta‐blockers was lower (‐8/‐5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta‐blockers did not show a convincing graded dose‐response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta‐blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta‐blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (11)\n\n【20】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Essential Hypertension\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Beta Blocking Agents, Non-selective\n\n【23】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【24】*   Placebo\n\n【25】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【26】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Blood Pressure Alteration\n*   Finding Of Arterial Pulse Pressure\n*   Alteration In Heart Rate\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Nonselective beta‐blockers are a subclass of beta‐blockers including propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), etc. We asked how much this subclass of drugs lower blood pressure.\n\n【35】**Study characteristics**\n\n【36】We developed a comprehensive search strategy of all relevant scientific databases to identify all clinical trials to answer this question. Participants had to have a baseline systolic blood pressure (the top number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 90 mmHg, or both of these. We did not restrict participants by age, gender, baseline risk or any other medical conditions.\n\n【37】**Key results**\n\n【38】We found 25 clinical trials that compared the blood pressure lowering effect of seven nonselective beta‐blockers with placebo in 1264 people with high blood pressure. On average, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered blood pressure by about 10 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic, and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. This estimate is likely greater than the true effect because of biases in the running and reporting of the trials. We did not find convincing evidence that higher doses of nonselective beta‐blockers lowered blood pressure more than lower doses. However, higher doses of nonselective beta‐blockers significantly lowered heart rate compared with lower doses, which could lead to more side effects. Since the blood pressure lowering effect for systolic is similar to the blood pressure lowering effect of diastolic, the effect of this subclass on pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic) was small at about 2 mmHg.\n\n【39】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【40】The quality of the evidence is low due to the presence of extreme outliers and high risk of biases.\n\n【41】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【42】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【43】### Implications for practice\n\n【44】This review provides the most up‐to‐date clinical evidence on the hemodynamic effects of nonselective beta‐blockers in people with hypertension. Propranolol and penbutolol contributed to most of the data. In people with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension, nonselective beta‐blockers lowered peak blood pressure (BP) by a mean of ‐10/‐7 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. Mean estimate from studies published before 1985 were much higher compared to recent studies. Baseline BP, time of measurement and publication bias help to explain the differences in effect size.\n\n【45】Nonselective beta‐blockers showed no convincing dose‐response relationship for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The evidence for an increasing magnitude of effect at higher doses was weak. However, it was evident that nonselective beta‐blockers showed a dose‐response relationship on heart rate. This suggests that nonselective beta‐blockers cause more bradycardia at higher doses compared with lower doses but do not provide additional BP lowering effects. There is very low quality evidence that twice the starting dose of nonselective beta‐blockers leads to a small reduction in pulse pressure (2 mmHg). The estimates in other dose subgroups showed similar effect sizes; however, these were imprecise and compatible with no effect or small differences. This suggests that if nonselective beta‐blockers significantly lower pulse pressure, the effect is likely small.\n\n【46】### Implications for research\n\n【47】1.  Many of the drugs in this beta‐blocker class have no data available for their BP lowering efficacy despite the fact that they are marketed for the treatment of hypertension. It should be mandatory that all clinical trial results be published in detail.\n    \n2.  Manufacturers should provide the justification for recommended dosages. Data should be made available to show additional effects at higher doses if a dose range is recommended.\n    \n3.  The procedure of randomization and blinding must be described in detail in published reports.\n    \n4.  Trial should report the method and time that BP was measured. Peak and trough BP should be reported separately. Future randomized controlled trials should use 24‐hour ambulatory BP measurements, which would include both peak and trough measurements.\n    \n5.  Reporting of withdrawal due to adverse effects should be mandatory for all trials.\n    \n6.  The results of this review should be compared with those of the other three subclasses and the BP lowering effects of different subclasses of beta‐blockers should be examined.\n    \n\n【48】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【49】Open in table viewer\n\n【50】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Antihypertensive drug treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of these adverse events in people aged 60 years and over with moderate‐to‐severe elevations of BP greater than 160/100 mmHg ( Musini 2009 ). There are a number of classes of antihypertensive drugs used to treat elevated BP. Beta‐adrenergic receptor blockers (beta‐blockers) are one of those classes of drugs.\n\n【55】### Description of the intervention\n\n【56】Beta‐blockers were originally marketed and used to treat angina. During their use in people with angina, it was discovered that they also lowered BP ( Prichard 1966 ; Prichard 1969 ). Since then, they have received clinical attention because of their proven effectiveness to prevent recurrence in people who have recently had a MI ( Teo 1993 ), and for people with heart failure ( Brophy 2001 ; Ko 2004 ). Five published systematic reviews are relevant to this proposed review. Wright 2000 assessed the mortality and morbidity associated with different types of beta‐blockers. He found that post MI patients treated with nonselective beta‐blockers had a statistically significant reduction in total mortality compared with placebo, whereas those people treated with beta <sub>1 </sub> ‐selective beta‐blockers or partial agonist beta‐blockers did not. One review assessed the effects of beta‐blockers on morbidity and mortality in adults with hypertension ( Wiysonge 2007 ). The review concluded that beta‐blockers were not the best class of drugs to use as first‐line antihypertensive therapy. However, it is possible that this applies primarily to beta <sub>1 </sub> ‐selective beta‐blockers, as atenolol was the beta‐blocker used in 75% of the trials.\n\n【57】Wright 2009 examined the mortality and morbidity outcomes of different classes of antihypertensive drugs. He found that beta‐blockers significantly reduced stroke and cardiovascular events but not all‐cause mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD). The clinical outcome results of beta‐blockers were inferior compared with low‐dose thiazide, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.\n\n【58】Three further systematic reviews have assessed the effects of beta‐blockers on BP. One Cochrane systematic review of beta‐blockers for hypertension during pregnancy showed that oral beta‐blockers decreased the incidence of severe hypertension and the need for additional antihypertensive therapy ( Magee 2003 ). One systematic review of the dose‐response relationship of BP lowering effects of beta‐blockers and other antihypertensive drugs was limited by the fact that it did not differentiate between the different classes of beta‐blockers ( Law 2005 ). Finally, one Cochrane systematic review of the BP lowering efficacy of beta‐blockers as a second‐line treatment did not have enough trials to be able to differentiate between the different classes of beta‐blockers ( Chen 2010 ).\n\n【59】### How the intervention might work\n\n【60】Beta‐adrenergic receptors are present in many body systems including the heart, blood vessels, kidneys and nervous system. Presently, the mechanism whereby beta‐blockers lower BP is unknown. However, many hypothetical mechanisms have been proposed. Beta‐blockers could lower BP by decreasing cardiac output, reducing renin production, modulating the sympathetic nervous system or other mechanisms. It is likely that a combination of these mechanisms is responsible for the BP lowering effect.\n\n【61】Beta‐blockers were designed to inhibit beta‐receptors competitively and thus modulate sympathetic nervous system activity. Nonselective beta‐blockers were the first group of beta‐blockers to be developed and marketed. Drugs in this class, such as propranolol, competitively inhibit both beta <sub>1 </sub> and beta <sub>2 </sub> receptors with similar affinity and have no intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activity or alpha‐receptor blocking property.\n\n【62】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【63】Since it is possible that beta‐blockers with different mechanisms of action have different effects on morbidity and mortality, it is crucial to determine whether they have different BP lowering abilities. No published review has compared the BP lowering effect of beta‐blockers based on their mechanism of action. If beta‐blockers with different beta‐receptor selectivity lower BP differently, this review could provide useful information toward understanding the mechanisms by which they lower BP in humans.\n\n【64】Furthermore, since BP measurement is used on a daily basis by physicians as a surrogate indicator to manage hypertension, it is important to know accurately the mean BP lowering effect of beta‐blockers, both individually and as a subclass. Nonselective beta‐blockers were the first subclass of beta‐blockers to be used clinically, and, thus, were the first subclass to be profiled. The protocol for this review was published previously ( Wong 2008 ). This review will provide the basic BP lowering data to which the other subclasses can be compared. The information found in this review will also be useful to clinicians, researchers designing future drug trials and authors of other systematic reviews.\n\n【65】Objectives\n----------\n\n【66】### Primary objective\n\n【67】*   To quantify the dose‐related effects of nonselective beta‐adrenergic receptor blockers (beta‐blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.\n    \n\n【68】### Secondary objectives\n\n【69】*   To determine the effects of nonselective beta‐blockers on variability of BP.\n    \n*   To determine the effects of nonselective beta‐blockers on pulse pressure.\n    \n*   To quantify the dose‐related effects of nonselective beta‐blockers on heart rate.\n    \n*   To quantify the effects of nonselective beta‐blockers on withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).\n    \n\n【70】Methods\n-------\n\n【71】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【72】#### Types of studies\n\n【73】We included studies that met the following criteria:\n\n【74】*   placebo‐controlled;\n    \n*   random allocation to nonselective beta‐blocker group and placebo group;\n    \n*   parallel or cross‐over design;\n    \n*   double blinded;\n    \n*   duration of follow‐up of at least three weeks;\n    \n*   BP measurements at baseline (following washout) and at one or more time points between three and 12 weeks after starting treatment.\n    \n\n【75】#### Types of participants\n\n【76】Participants had a baseline SBP of at least 140 mmHg or a DBP of at least 90 mmHg, or both, measured in a standard way. Participants must not have had creatinine levels greater than 1.5 times the normal level. We did not restrict participants by age, gender, baseline risk or any other comorbid conditions.\n\n【77】#### Types of interventions\n\n【78】Monotherapy with any non‐selective beta‐blocker, including amosulalol, arotinolol, befunolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bucumolol, bufetolol, bufuralol, bunitrolol, bupranolol, butofilolol, carazolol, carteolol, celiprolol, cetamolol, cloranolol, epanolol, indenolol, levobunolol, mepindolol, metipranolol, moprolol, nadolol, nadoxolol, nifenalol, penbutolol, practolol, pronethalol, propranolol, sotalol, sulfinalol, talinolol, tertatolol, tilisolol, timolol, toliprolol and xibenolol.\n\n【79】Data from trials in which titration to a higher dose was based on BP response were not eligible.\n\n【80】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【81】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【82】1.  Change in trough (13 to 26 hours after the dose) or peak (1 to 12 hours after the dose) (or both) SBP and DBP compared with placebo. If BP measurements were available at more than one time within the acceptable window, we used the weighted means of BPs taken in the three to 12 week range.\n    \n\n【83】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【84】1.  Change in standard deviation compared with placebo.\n    \n2.  Change in pulse pressure compared with placebo.\n    \n3.  Change in heart rate compared with placebo.\n    \n4.  Number of participants who WDAE compared with placebo.\n    \n\n【85】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【86】We searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs):\n\n【87】*   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9);\n    \n*   MEDLINE (1946 to 11 October 2013);\n    \n*   EMBASE (1974 to 11 October 2013);\n    \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 11 October 2013).\n    \n\n【88】We applied no language restrictions.\n\n【89】We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related reviews. We used previously published meta‐analyses on dose‐response of beta‐blockers to help identify references to trials.\n\n【90】We used a modified, expanded version of the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Hypertension Group with additional terms related to beta‐blockers in general and all the specific drugs listed above to identify relevant articles. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy ( Appendix 1 ) for searches of CENTRAL ( Appendix 2 ), EMBASE ( Appendix 3 ) and ClinicalTrials.gov ( Appendix 4 ).\n\n【91】The initial search of all the databases was performed to identify citations with potential relevance. The initial screen of these abstracts excluded articles whose titles or abstracts, or both, were clearly irrelevant. We retrieved the full text of remaining articles (and translated them into English where required). We searched the bibliographies of pertinent articles, reviews and texts for additional citations. Two independent review authors assessed the eligibility of the trials using a trial selection form. A third review author resolved any discrepancies.\n\n【92】We identified and collected relevant studies for all beta‐blockers. The review authors separated the trials into four different subclasses of beta‐blockers (nonselective beta‐blockers, dual receptor blockers, partial agonists and beta‐1 selective blockers). We published the results of each subclass separately.\n\n【93】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【94】#### Selection of studies\n\n【95】We imported references and abstracts of search results into Reference Manager 11 software. Selection of studies was based on the criteria listed above.\n\n【96】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【97】Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form, and then cross‐checked each entry. A second review author confirmed all numeric calculations and graphic interpolations.\n\n【98】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【99】Standard quality measures were not useful to distinguish between trials meeting the strict entry criteria of this review ( Jadad 1996 ). We assessed risk of bias using the 'Risk of bias' tables for each trial as described in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【100】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【101】The position of the person during BP measurement may affect the BP lowering effect. However, in order to prevent loss of valuable data, if data from only one position were reported, then data from that position were collected. When BP measurement data were available in more than one position, we used sitting BP as the first preference. If both standing and supine were available, we used standing BP.\n\n【102】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【103】In case of missing information in the included studies, we contacted investigators (using email, letter, fax, or a combination of these) to obtain the missing information.\n\n【104】In the case of missing standard deviations of the change in BP, we imputed the standard deviations based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same drug. We used the following hierarchy (listed from high to low preference) to impute standard deviation values:\n\n【105】1.  standard deviation of change in BP taken in a different position to that of the BP data used;\n    \n2.  standard deviation of BP at the end of treatment;\n    \n3.  standard deviation of BP at the end of treatment measured in a different position to that of the BP data used;\n    \n4.  standard deviation of BP at baseline (except if this measure is used for entry criteria);\n    \n5.  mean standard deviation of change in BP from other trials using the same drug.\n    \n\n【106】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【107】We used a standard Chi <sup>2 </sup> test and I <sup>2 </sup> statistic to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between the trials. We applied the fixed‐effect model to obtain summary statistics of pooled trials, unless significant between‐study heterogeneity was present, in which case we used the random‐effects model.\n\n【108】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【109】We assessed reporting biases using the 'Risk of bias' table in Characteristics of included studies table for each study.\n\n【110】#### Data synthesis\n\n【111】We performed data synthesis and analyses using Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2012 ).  \nWe combined data for changes in BP and heart rate using a generic inverse variance method. We analyzed drop‐outs due to side effects using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). When there is a significant difference in risk ration for withdrawal due to adverse effects, we would provide risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH).\n\n【112】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【113】If possible, subgroup analyses included:\n\n【114】1.  different regimens of the same active chemical entity;\n    \n2.  gender, age and race;\n    \n3.  comorbid conditions: ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes;\n    \n4.  baseline severity of hypertension: mild, moderate, severe.\n    \n\n【115】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【116】We tested the robustness of the results using several sensitivity analyses, including:\n\n【117】1.  trials that were industry sponsored versus non‐industry sponsored;\n    \n2.  trials with BP data measured in the sitting position versus other measurement positions;\n    \n3.  trials with reported standard deviations of BP change versus imputed standard deviations.\n    \n\n【118】Results\n-------\n\n【119】### Description of studies\n\n【120】#### Results of the search\n\n【121】All four reviews used the same study inclusion criteria. In order to save time and effort, we developed a comprehensive search strategy so that all four subclasses of beta‐blockers were searched simultaneously ( Appendix 1 ; Appendix 2 ; Appendix 3 ; Appendix 4 ). We then sorted citations according to their respective subclasses afterward. The search was first run in May 2010, and was updated twice in August 2011 and September 2012. In May 2010, the search strategy identified 18,604 citations from MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. In August 2011, we identified an additional 2462 citations. In September 2012, we identified 248 new citations. Thus, we identified 21,314 citations in all three searches since May 2010, of which 8353 were confirmed to be duplicates. The review authors then screened 12,961 titles and abstracts and excluded 12,366 citations. We judged 595 citations to potentially meet the inclusion criteria based on title and abstract. These were retrieved for detailed review. After reading the full‐text articles, 480 did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded. One citation was a separate publication of the same data, and both are included in Lepantalo 1985 . One hundred and fourteen trials met our inclusion criteria but 18 of them were excluded for reasons listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. Ninety‐six trials were included in all four reviews. Twenty‐five studies examining BP lowering efficacy of seven nonselective beta‐blockers in people with primary hypertension were included in this review. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram. We contacted the primary author of Sica 2004 by email to request information on the time of BP measurement, but did not get a response.\n\n【122】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【123】Figure 1\n\n【124】* * *\n\n【125】* * *\n\n【126】PRISMA diagram.\n\n【127】#### Included studies\n\n【128】This review comprised 25 RCTs with 1279 randomized participants (four parallel studies and 21 cross‐over studies). The duration of treatment ranged between three and 12 weeks, with the majority of trials lasting for four weeks. All studies were prospective, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled fixed‐dose trials. Propranolol was the most studied nonselective beta‐blocker with 18 trials in doses ranging from 60 to 640 mg/day. Participants enrolled into these studies were mostly between 52 to 59 year‐old with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension. The mean baseline BP of the included studies was 158/104 mmHg. Included trials are itemized in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【129】#### Excluded studies\n\n【130】We excluded 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria from the nonselective beta‐blocker review. Reasons for exclusion included lack of useful data and titration of dose according to BP response or side effect (see Characteristics of excluded studies table).\n\n【131】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【132】Figure 2 summarizes the overall risk of bias of the included studies. The assessment shows an unclear or high risk of bias in over 50% of the items suggesting that the findings of this review are likely an exaggeration of the real effect.\n\n【133】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【134】Figure 2\n\n【135】* * *\n\n【136】* * *\n\n【137】#### Allocation\n\n【138】All of the studies stated that participants were randomized and allocation of treatment was concealed. There was no obvious difference in baseline parameters between parallel groups suggesting that randomization was achieved in these trials. Therefore, we judged that there was a low risk of selection bias in the parallel trials. However, these baseline data were not provided for the cross‐over studies so we could not be confident that randomization and allocation concealment was achieved in these studies.\n\n【139】#### Blinding\n\n【140】All the studies used a double‐blind design. However, since beta‐blockers significantly lower heart rate and most of the studies measured BP by mercury sphygmomanometer, there was a high likelihood that the investigators could detect the assignment of intervention by the effect on the heart rate. Therefore, the risk of detection and performance bias was high in this review. This would also lead to performance bias. Because the auscultatory method is affected by the bleed rate of the mercury column, a slower heart rate also has the potential to lead to an overestimation of the decrease in SBP and an underestimation of the decrease in DBP.\n\n【141】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【142】We did not include participants who withdrew in the analysis for all the studies who reported drop‐outs. The dropout rate was low (total dropout rate was 7.5%) and, therefore, we judged that there was a low risk of attrition bias in our estimates.\n\n【143】#### Selective reporting\n\n【144】Only two studies reported WDAE in this review. WDAE is an important outcome in all RCTs. Not reporting WDAE could lead to high risk of reporting bias.\n\n【145】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【146】##### Publication bias\n\n【147】Nadolol, indenolol and moprolol studies did not provide any useful SBP and DBP data for our review. Nadolol is indicated for hypertension in both the US and Canada. In order to satisfy regulatory requirement in US and Canada, nadolol must have been tested in RCTs for BP lowering efficacy. The studies published before 1985 showed much greater BP lowering effect compared to studies published after 1985. They used same drug and same design for these trials. However, the patient population was different. In the older studies, the participants had moderate‐to‐severe hypertension according to recent definitions, whereas in the more recent studies, the participants had mild‐to‐moderate hypertension. In addition, the funnel plots showed presence of extreme positive outliers. Excluding these outliers from the analysis considerably lowered the estimate in some subgroups. This suggests that the estimate could be exaggerated due to extreme positive outliers and the high risk of publication bias.\n\n【148】### Effects of interventions\n\n【149】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Nonselective beta‐blockers compared with placebo for primary hypertension\n\n【150】#### Effects of propranolol on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure\n\n【151】The recommended daily dose of propranolol according to the Canadian Pharmacists Association product monograph is 80 to 320 mg for extended release pill once daily for treatment of hypertension ( eCPS ). We included 18 studies examining the BP lowering effect of propranolol at doses ranging from 60 mg/day to 640 mg/day, in durations of four to 12 weeks in 837 people with hypertension. The majority of included studies measured peak BP using a mercury sphygmomanometer. The weighted mean baseline BP of the included studies was 163 mmHg SBP and 107 mmHg DBP. Analysis 1.1 ; Analysis 1.2 ; Analysis 1.3 and Analysis 1.4 summarize the results of propranolol.\n\n【152】Propranolol significantly lowered SBP and DBP compared with placebo at doses equivalent to the recommended starting dose, twice (2x) the starting dose and four times (4x) times the starting dose. There was a significant degree of heterogeneity at 2x and 4x the starting dose in both SBP and DBP. The cause of heterogeneity is explored in the Discussion .\n\n【153】Not all studies included in propranolol analyses reported the change in heart rate. All doses of propranolol significantly lowered heart rate compared with placebo. There was a significant degree of heterogeneity at the starting dose and 2x the starting dose.\n\n【154】Only propranolol at 2x the starting dose significantly lowered pulse pressure. The magnitude of the effect on pulse pressure for the other doses was similar but not statistically significant compared with placebo. When all four doses were pooled, the result was statistically significant (‐2 mmHg).\n\n【155】We were able to use the data from Galloway 1976 ; Shukla 1979 ; and Sica 2004 to assess the additional BP lowering effect of propranolol directly when doses were doubled. Doubling the dose of propranolol did not cause a greater BP lowering effect for SBP or DBP. However, doubling the dose of propranolol significantly reduced heart rate further. The test for subgroup differences by direct comparison in heart rate was significant (P value < 0.00001). Oh 1985 also compared the effect of propranolol directly when dose was doubled. However, the BP lowering effect, a mean of ‐53 mmHg SBP and ‐28 mmHg DBP, seen in this study disagreed with all the other data. We judged this trial to be an extreme outlier, as of questionable validity and, therefore, we did not use it in the direct comparison analyses.\n\n【156】##### Funnel plots\n\n【157】Funnel plots were prepared for SBP and DBP at 2x the starting dose to explore heterogeneity ( Figure 3 ; Figure 4 ). The funnel plots did not show the normal pattern with a number of extreme outliers and with the largest studies off the mean effect size. A possible explanation for this finding is discussed in Summary of main results .\n\n【158】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【159】Figure 3\n\n【160】* * *\n\n【161】* * *\n\n【162】Funnel plot of systolic blood pressure of 2x starting dose propranolol.\n\n【163】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【164】Figure 4\n\n【165】* * *\n\n【166】* * *\n\n【167】Funnel plot of diastolic blood pressure of 2x starting dose propranolol.\n\n【168】#### Effects of timolol on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure\n\n【169】The recommended daily dose of timolol for hypertension is 5 mg twice daily to 20 mg twice daily ( eCPS ; FDA ). One study examining the BP lowering efficacy of 30 mg/day timolol in 20 people with hypertension was included ( Chalmers 1976 ). It was a cross‐over study with an eight‐week treatment period. BP was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer. Timolol 30 mg/day significantly lowered both SBP and DBP compared with placebo. The treatment also significantly lowered heart rate but did not significantly lower pulse pressure. Analysis 2.1 ; Analysis 2.2 ; Analysis 2.3 and Analysis 2.4 summarize the results of timolol.\n\n【170】#### Effects of penbutolol on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure\n\n【171】The recommended dose of penbutolol for hypertension is 20 mg once daily to 80 mg once daily ( FDA ). Two studies with 312 participants treated with penbutolol 20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day or placebo were included. Mean baseline BP was 151.9/100 mmHg. De Plean 1981 was a cross‐over study lasting for four week. Schoenberger 1989 was a parallel study with treatment lasting for six weeks. Both studies measured BP using mercury sphygmomanometer in the standing position. Most of the BP was measured at trough times (13 to 24 hours after last dose). Analysis 3.1 ; Analysis 3.2 ; Analysis 3.3 and Analysis 3.4 summarize the results of penbutolol.\n\n【172】Only penbutolol 80 mg/day significantly reduced both SBP and DBP compared with placebo. Direct comparison of dose effect was possible using data from Schoenberger 1989 . There was no significant difference in BP lowering effect of SBP (P value = 0.68), DBP (P value = 0.96) or heart rate (P value = 0.93) for 10 to 40 mg/day penbutolol.\n\n【173】#### Effects of tertatolol on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure\n\n【174】One study with 20 participants was included for tertatolol. Fasano 1991 was a parallel study examining the BP lowering effect of tertatolol 5 mg/day for four weeks. The authors measured peak BP in the standing position using an automated device. The baseline BP was 154.5/104 mmHg.\n\n【175】Tertatolol 5 mg/day significantly lowered SBP and DBP compared with placebo. It also significantly lowered heart rate but did not lower pulse pressure compared with placebo. Analysis 4.1 ; Analysis 4.2 ; Analysis 4.3 and Analysis 4.4 summarize the results of tertatolol.\n\n【176】#### Effect on heart rate of other nonselective beta‐blockers\n\n【177】Moprolol, indenolol and nadolol studies only provided data on heart rate. Indenolol and nadolol 80 mg/day significantly lowered heart rate compared with placebo but moprolol had no significant effect ( Analysis 5.1 ; Analysis 6.1 ; Analysis 7.1 ).\n\n【178】#### Pooled effects of nonselective beta‐blockers\n\n【179】We pooled the BP, heart rate and pulse pressure data of all available nonselective beta‐blockers based on the recommended starting doses ( Analysis 8.1 ; Analysis 8.2 ; Analysis 8.3 ; Analysis 8.4 ). The analyses showed that 0.5 times the starting dose did not significantly lower SBP, DBP, heart rate or pulse pressure, whereas the recommended starting doses and higher doses significantly lowered SBP, DBP and heart rate. Pulse pressure was not significantly reduced at any dose except for the 2x the starting dose subgroup.\n\n【180】Test for subgroup differences by direct comparison were not significant in the recommended dose range (once (1x), 2x, 4x and eight times (8x) the starting dose) for SBP, DBP and pulse pressure. Test for subgroup differences by direct comparison was significant in the recommend dose range for heart rate demonstrating a relationship between dose and effect for heart rate.\n\n【181】None of the studies included provided pulse pressure data. We calculated the pulse pressure by subtracting DBP from SBP. The pooled analysis confirmed the findings for effect of propranolol on pulse pressure.\n\n【182】##### Withdrawal due to adverse effects\n\n【183】Only two studies, one using propranolol and the other using penbutolol, provided data regarding WDAE ( Analysis 8.5 ). WDAE were not significantly different with either propranolol or penbutolol compared with placebo. Due to the lack of information, no conclusion can be made about the effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on WDAE.\n\n【184】##### Blood pressure variability\n\n【185】We assessed the BP variability between treatment and placebo by comparing the end treatment standard deviation with placebo by unpaired t‐test. Thirteen studies provided end‐treatment standard deviation of beta‐blocker and placebo group for this analysis. The overall mean end‐treatment standard deviation (SBP/DBP) for treatment group was 20.9/13.0 mmHg and 19.8/12.5 mmHg for placebo group. The BP variability for both SBP and DBP was not significantly different between treatment and placebo group. The P value for SBP variability was 0.23 and DBP variability was 0.77. The weighted mean variance ratio for SBP/DBP was 1.12/1.05. The majority of the data that contributed to the mean standard deviation came from propranolol.\n\n【186】#### Subgroup analysis\n\n【187】We were unable to perform subgroup analysis for race or comorbid condition due to lack of data reported separately for these parameters. There was no difference between trials in terms of age and severity and, therefore, we could not perform a subgroup analysis for these two parameters either. There was one study, Ravid 1985 , which reported data for men and women separately. This study examined the BP lowering efficacy of propranolol 160 mg/day in 66 men and 68 women. The weighted mean baseline BP was 168/112 mmHg for men and 166/110 mmHg for women. The mean SBP reduction was ‐28 mmHg (95% CI ‐35 to ‐21) for men and ‐13 mmHg (95% CI ‐21 to ‐5) for women; the mean DBP reduction was ‐15 mmHg (95% CI ‐21 to ‐10) for men and ‐13 mmHg (95% CI ‐19 to ‐7) for women. The reduction of SBP but not DBP was significantly greater in men than women. In addition, propranolol significantly lowered pulse pressure in men but not in women.\n\n【188】Discussion\n----------\n\n【189】### Summary of main results\n\n【190】#### Effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and pulse pressure\n\n【191】##### Propranolol\n\n【192】This review provides the most up‐to‐date estimates of the dose‐related BP lowering efficacy of nonselective beta‐blockers. Most of the data contributing to the estimates came from propranolol trials. Propranolol significantly lowered resting peak SBP and DBP compared with placebo. Similarly, all propranolol doses significantly lowered heart rate compared with placebo.\n\n【193】Direct comparison of doses was possible by pooling three studies that examined the effect of doubling the dose of propranolol. This analysis showed that doubling the dose of propranolol did not significantly lower BP further. However, this dose‐response analysis is limited due to the small sample size.\n\n【194】Significant heterogeneity and the relatively large effect size of propranolol 4x starting dose subgroup were caused by an extreme outlier ( Oh 1985 ). The point estimate of the 4x starting dose would change from ‐21/‐15 mmHg to ‐14/‐12 mmHg if we exclude Oh 1985 . Although this was still a large effect, the wide 95% CI indicated that this estimate was imprecise.\n\n【195】If there is any dose‐response relationship for propranolol, it is less with the starting dose, peaks at 4x the starting dose and then decreases with higher doses. This would be an unusual effect and there are few if any proven dose responses of this pattern. If true, an explanation might be that, at higher doses, the beta‐2 blocking effect leads to antagonism of the BP lowering effect by blocking vasodilation in the arteries to muscles. More carefully conducted trials are needed to elucidate this dose‐response pattern properly. In contrast, this pattern was not seen with any of the other nonselective beta‐blockers.\n\n【196】###### Heterogeneity in propranolol 2x starting dose subgroup\n\n【197】The 2x starting dose subgroup of SBP contained the largest sample size in the analysis and manifested a very unusual pattern in the funnel plots ( Figure 3 ; Figure 4 ). The random‐effects estimates (SBP ‐13 mmHg (95% CI ‐19 to ‐7); DBP ‐10 mmHg (95% CI ‐14 to ‐6) was not significantly different from fixed effect estimates (SBP ‐12 mmHg (95% CI ‐15 to ‐10); DBP ‐9 mmHg (95% ‐10 to ‐7) in the 2x starting dose subgroup. In order to explore the heterogeneity, we arranged the studies according to publication year and then divided them into two groups based on their publication year, one before 1985 and one after 1985. In the older studies, the funnel plot showed that Oh 1985 and Ravid 1985 were two extreme outliers and the main contributors to heterogeneity. In the newer studies, the funnel plot identified McCorvey 1993 as an extreme outlier.\n\n【198】We conducted the same procedure in order to explore the heterogeneity in DBP analysis of 2x starting dose subgroup. In the older studies, the funnel plot identified Oh 1985 ; Ravid 1985 ; and Shukla 1979 as extreme outliers in this subgroup. There was no significant heterogeneity among the newer studies.\n\n【199】The estimates for the two subgroups were significantly different from each other (‐16/‐11 mmHg for the older studies and ‐5/‐4 mmHg for the newer studies). The difference in effect size between these two groups is possibly due to the difference in baseline BP. The weighted mean baseline BP was higher in the older studies (170/113 mmHg) compared to the newer studies (154/101 mmHg). This reflects the fact that the definition of hypertension had changed over time. In the older studies, hypertension was defined as greater than 160/100 mmHg and in the more recent studies as greater than 140/90 mmHg. Higher baseline BP would be expected to be associated with producing greater absolute BP reductions.\n\n【200】Another factor that may have added to the difference is a higher risk of publication bias in the older studies and that older studies were influenced by active marketing of the drug. Studies published at the time were more likely to show greater effect. In contrast, in the newer studies, propranolol was being studied as an active comparator to a newer drug with a possible negative bias against propranolol. The older studies could also have been subject to greater loss of blinding leading to detection bias, which would also tend to exaggerate the effect size. It also could be a combination of these factors that led to the difference in effect size and caused significant heterogeneity.\n\n【201】The baseline BP in the newer studies was similar to the baseline in the RCTs of the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reviews by Heran 2008 (ACEI) and Heran 2008 (ARB) . Thus, when comparing the BP lowering effect between nonselective beta‐blockers and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, it is more appropriate to use the estimates from the newer studies.\n\n【202】##### Penbutolol\n\n【203】The larger study in penbutolol analysis, Schoenberger 1989 , showed no statistically significant BP lowering effect in doses ranging from 10 mg/day to 40 mg/day. The relatively large effect of the smaller RCT, De Plean 1981 , in penbutolol 80 mg/day was out of keeping with the other data. The larger effect in the 80 mg/day subgroup could be because De Plean 1981 measured peak BP while Schoenberger 1989 measured trough BP. Moreover, there are insufficient published evidence supporting the product monograph recommendation of penbutolol 20 mg/day and 40 mg/day in the treatment of hypertension.\n\n【204】##### Other included non‐selective beta‐blockers\n\n【205】There were few data available for other nonselective beta‐blockers. It was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions based on such small data sets. Some of these drugs, such as nadolol and timolol, have been approved for clinical use in US, Europe and Canada since late 1970. Therefore, we are certain that studies were completed in order to fulfill regulatory requirements in these countries and that these studies remain unpublished at this time. Despite our effort to search for unpublished data, we were unable to find any trial data for these drugs. It is important that these trial results be made available for scientific analysis and are available to contribute to systematic reviews.\n\n【206】##### Pooled effects of nonselective beta‐blockers\n\n【207】We pooled the data from all available nonselective beta‐blockers based on the recommended starting dose in order to obtain the overall subclass effect. We recognized that this method presented certain limitations as different manufacturers might have used different methods to determine with the recommended starting doses. However, this method provided the most logical way of data standardization for combining different drugs to be analyzed as a whole class.\n\n【208】Propranolol contributed to 65% of the data. The pooled data also presented similar characteristics of heterogeneity as in the propranolol analyses because propranolol was the main contributor of data in the pool. The 1x and 2x starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta‐blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was ‐10/‐7 mmHg. If we exclude Oh 1985 , the estimate would change from ‐10/‐7 mmHg to ‐9/‐6 mmHg. However, other than it being an extreme outlier, due to the lack of information, we found no flaws in the trial that would justify excluding it from the estimate.\n\n【209】Dose‐response analysis was inconclusive. Nonselective beta‐blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose‐response relationship by direct comparison. There was little evidence to support using a dose higher than 2x starting dose of nonselective beta‐blockers to lower BP further.\n\n【210】###### Heart rate\n\n【211】Nonselective beta‐blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses significantly lowered heart rate. The dose‐response relationship for heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison.\n\n【212】###### Pulse pressure\n\n【213】Nonselective beta‐blockers did not significantly reduce pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for the 2x starting dose. We calculated a minimum sample size of 442 was needed to provide adequate power (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.8) to detect a difference of 2 mmHg in pulse pressure with a SD of 15. Only the 2x starting dose subgroup contained a sufficient number of participants according to the power analysis. The point estimates in the 1x, 4x and 8x starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta‐blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely about 2 mmHg.\n\n【214】This relative lack of effect on pulse pressure may explain why beta‐blockers appear to be less effective at reducing mortality than other drug classes as shown by Musini 2009 ; Wiysonge 2007 ; and Wright 2000 ; . However, we recognize that most of the data in people with hypertension included in the Musini 2009 and Wiysonge 2007 reviews used atenolol. Furthermore, Wright 2000 found that only nonselective beta‐blockers demonstrated a mortality benefit in people post MI. This suggests that the effect of nonselective beta‐blockers on mortality could be different to the beta‐1 selective, atenolol. More studies evaluating the effect on mortality and morbidity of nonselective beta‐blockers are needed to elucidate this question.\n\n【215】###### Blood pressure variability\n\n【216】Nonselective beta‐blockers did not significantly change end treatment BP variability compared with placebo. The SBP variance ratio in our analysis was smaller than the one found in Webb 2011 (1.12 versus 1.34). One analysis on the BP variability of beta‐blockers suggested that nonselective beta‐blockers might significantly increase SBP variability ( Webb 2011 ). There were several important differences between our analysis and that of Webb 2011 that could have caused the differences in findings. First, Webb 2011 included people with hypertension, post MI and CHF in their analysis whereas our analysis only included people with primary hypertension. The effect of beta‐blockers on BP variability could be different in primary hypertension compared to people post MI and with CHF.\n\n【217】Second, Webb 2011 also compared beta‐blockers with other antihypertensive treatments whereas we compared beta‐blockers with placebo alone. Beta‐blockers could tend to increase BP variability compared with placebo, while other antihypertensive drugs could tend to lower BP variability compared with placebo. By comparing beta‐blockers with other antihypertensive drugs directly, the larger difference could have led to a statistically significant result. A systematic review of BP variability of all antihypertensive drugs classes compared with placebo in people with hypertension is needed to determine the truth.\n\n【218】None of the studies included in the analysis was design to examine the difference in BP variability. Future RCT designed to evaluate the BP variability of beta‐blockers are needed in order to clarify this issue.\n\n【219】##### Subgroup analysis\n\n【220】The planned subgroup analyses were not possible due to lack of data. Ravid 1985 provided some data for subgroup analysis in man and women. We summarized the findings in this study in the results section. However, we should not draw any conclusion based on the findings of one single study. In addition, the effect sizes of Ravid 1985 were extreme, raising concern about bias in this study. More large‐scale RCT reporting outcome separately by sex are needed before we can determine whether or not there is a significant difference in effect size between difference sexes.\n\n【221】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【222】This review provided a reasonable amount of information regarding BP lowering efficacy of nonselective beta‐blockers. Most of the studies included in this review had the same primary objectives, which were to examine the BP lowering efficacy of respective beta‐blockers in the studies compared with placebo. Therefore, we are confident that the evidence found in this review is the best evidence available to answer our objectives.\n\n【223】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【224】summary of findings Table for the main comparison summarizes the combined effect size of the combined starting and 2x the starting dose of nonselective beta‐blockers. In addition, it provides a judgment of the quality of evidence in this review. This review included 25 RCTs with 1279 people with hypertension. The sample size should provide adequate power to draw robust conclusions. However, as for all systematic reviews, we were limited by the data available to us.\n\n【225】Most of the identified studies did not use an automated machine to measure BP. An automated machine could mitigate the risk of clinicians or participants detecting the intervention assignment. Therefore, the risk of detection bias remains high in our review.\n\n【226】None of the studies reported pulse pressure as an outcome. We calculated pulse pressure by subtracting DBP from SBP. This meant that the data on pulse pressure did not come from direct measurement in the studies. Indirectness of this outcome is the reason the evidence was further downgraded for pulse pressure.\n\n【227】In addition, the risk of publication bias was high in this review. For these and other reasons outlined in the discussion, the estimates of the BP lowering effect shown in the summary of findings Table for the main comparison are very likely an exaggeration of the true effect. This is reflected in the table by the low to very low judgment of the quality of the evidence.\n\n【228】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【229】The rigid methodology of this review and the comprehensive search strategies minimized potential for bias by the authors in the selection process of included studies. The search strategies were developed and performed by the Trial Search Co‐ordinator of the Cochrane Hypertension Group. The inclusion criteria were designed to minimize any biases that could have been introduced during the selection process.\n\n【230】There were occasions that the review authors had to obtain data from figures instead of numeric tables. This could introduce potential for bias, as the measurements on the figure could be different from person to person. In order to minimize this type of bias, two review authors extracted data independently and then the mean of the two values were used for the analyses.\n\n【231】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【232】Two published reviews, Chen 2010 and Law 2005 , also examined the BP lowering effect of beta‐blockers. Chen 2010 examined the additional effect of beta‐blockers in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. We specifically examined beta‐blockers as monotherapy; therefore, it is not appropriate to compare our review to that of Chen 2010 .\n\n【233】In addition, both Chen 2010 and Law 2005 pooled all the beta‐blockers together by assuming that they had similar effects. Our review is quite unique in the sense that we have not assumed all beta‐blockers behave similarly. We examined them individually and, in the case of this review, found that they were different. We will be able to assess the differences in BP lowering effect of each subclass to one another when all four beta‐blocker reviews in this Cochrane series are published.\n\n【234】Nonselective beta‐blockers lowered peak SBP by a smaller degree (‐10/‐7 mmHg) than the peak measurement of ACE inhibitors (‐11 mmHg) and ARBs (‐12 mmHg) ( Heran 2008 (ACEI) ; Heran 2008 (ARB) ). However, they lowered peak DBP by a similar degree compared to ARBs (‐7 mmHg) and greater degree compared to ACE inhibitors (‐6 mmHg). The effect of nonselective beta‐blockers is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other biases. If we remove the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for nonselective beta‐blockers is lower (‐8/‐5 mmHg). The most striking difference between nonselective beta‐blockers and the other classes is the smaller effect on pulse pressure, which is the result of the relative larger DBP effect size compare to SBP.\n\n【235】Figures and Tables -\n\n【236】Figure 1\n\n【237】PRISMA diagram.\n\n【238】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【239】Figures and Tables -\n\n【240】Figure

Combining them provided estimates that represented the overall subclass effect. Most of the measurements were made at peak hours. Mean baseline blood pressure was 158/104 mmHg. Quality of evidence was downgraded one level due to high risk of detection bias caused by loss of blinding. Quality of evidence was downgraded one level due to high risk of publication bias and the presence of extreme outliers with exaggerated large effect. Quality of evidence was downgraded one level due to indirectness, none of the studies included reported pulse pressure. Pulse pressure was calculated by subtracting DBP from SBP. The effect estimates were likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other biases. If we remove the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for nonselective beta‐blockers was lower (‐8/‐5 mmHg).

{"seq_id": "86600bf4-703e-4211-918c-66dc40e68181", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine whether nucleoplasty improves clinical and functional outcomes compared to surgery or conservative treatment for patients with cervical radicular pain, radiculopathy due to disc herniation or both.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a common diagnosis with various treatment options available. In neurologically stable patients, various forms of conservative treatment are prescribed, such as rest, analgesics and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, a cervical collar, or a combination of these. Conservative treatment leads to a spontaneous reduction of pain and disability in 40% of patients ( Lees 1963 ; Dillin 1986 ). One study evaluated the effects of conservative treatment for cervical radicular syndrome, and concluded that in the early phase of this disease a semi‐hard cervical collar and rest or physiotherapy reduced neck and arm pain, compared to a 'wait and see' policy ( Kuijper 2009 ).\n\n【6】When conservative treatment fails and symptoms persist or increase in severity, surgical treatment is considered ( Nardi 2005 ). The goals of surgery are to alleviate pressure on the affected cervical spinal nerve and the roots of the nerve, and if necessary to restore vertebral alignment and spine stabilization. The affected disc will be removed during the surgical procedure, with or without fusing of the two adjacent vertebral bodies. Bone grafts can be used to stimulate the fusion process ( Jacobs 2012 ).\n\n【7】This surgical technique has been widely accepted as the standard treatment for CR for more than five decades. However, this procedure is associated with a small risk of serious complications such as perforation of the oesophagus, injuries to the carotid or vertebra and severe neurological complications. The results of surgery are not always satisfactory and the overall outcome may be similar to conservative treatment ( Nikolaidis 2010 ; Gebremariam 2012 ; van Middelkoop 2013 ). Currently, there is an evolving trend in all spinal surgery toward less invasive techniques. Nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive technique, and is a treatment which uses radiofrequency technology for percutaneous disc decompression.\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】There is no universally accepted definition of CR ( Thoomes 2012 ). It is defined by Carette and Fehlings as a neurologic condition characterised by dysfunction of a cervical spinal nerve, the roots of the nerve, or both. It usually presents with pain in the neck and one arm, with a combination of sensory loss, loss of motor function, or reflex changes in the affected nerve‐root distribution ( Carette 2005 ). Some authors indicate that cervical radicular pain must be distinguished from CR ( Van Zundert 2010 ) . In CR there is a clear loss of sensory and/or motor function, while radicular pain is characterised by the formation of ectopic pulses. These two disorders can also coexist and may be caused by the same anatomical changes such as intervertebral disk herniation, radiculitis due to arthritis, narrowing of the intervertebral foramen, infection, or inflammatory exudates. Radicular pain can deteriorate into CR due to disease progression ( Van Zundert 2010 ).\n\n【10】The epidemiological data on CR are minimal. In a retrospective population‐based study from Rochester, Minnesota in the United States (1976 to 1990) the annual incidence of CR was 83 per 100,000 people. The annual incidence rate was 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women ( Radhakrishnan 1994 ). A door‐to‐door two‐phase survey in a Sicilian municipality reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1000 person‐years _(_ Salemi 1996 _)_ . Both studies found an association between age and the development of CR, with a peak incidence in the sixth decade of life for people of both genders ( Radhakrishnan 1994 _;_ Salemi 1996 ). In an epidemiological review of a population of American soldiers (2000 to 2009) the incidence of CR was 1.79 per 1000 person‐years. The incidence was calculated from a prospectively‐collected military database, which includes more than 20,000 cases of CR from an ethnically‐ and socio‐economically diverse cohort. The annual incidence rate was 1.76 per 1000 person‐years for men and 1.95 per 1000 person‐years for women. ( Schoenfeld 2012 ). Age is an important risk factor for developing CR ( Radhakrishnan 1994 _;_ Salemi 1996 _;_ Schoenfeld 2012 ) and Schoenfield et al concludes that females have a greater risk of developing CR than males ( Schoenfeld 2012 ).\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】In 2000, the United States of America's Food and Drug Administration approved nucleoplasty as a treatment for contained disc herniations ( Gerges 2010 ). Nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive technique, which uses coagulation and tissue ablation for percutaneous disc decompression. Radiofrequency energy is applied to a conductive medium (a one mm diameter bipolar instrument) and forms a highly focused plasma field around the energised electrodes. This plasma field contains highly ionised particles, which break organic molecular bonds and form small channels within the nucleus pulposus tissue, resulting in decompression of the herniated disc. By‐products such as low‐molecular‐weight inert gases and elementary molecules are removed via the needle ( Chen 2003 ). The removal of disc tissue is a non‐heat‐driven process and is associated with temperatures of between 40˚C to 70˚C. In this way the integrity of the surrounding healthy tissue is preserved. Approximately one mL of disc tissue volume is removed, which corresponds with a reduction of the discal volume by 10% to 20% ( Gerges 2010 ). One study examined the effect of nucleoplasty on the tissue and its authors concluded that volumetric removal of the nucleus pulposus tissue can be performed without disruption or necrosis of non‐targeted nucleus, annulus, endplate, nerve root or spinal cord ( Chen 2003 ). This is supposed to down‐regulate local inflammatory mediators, reduce disc size, and stimulate the healing process. All of these factors may contribute to a reduction in discogenic pain ( Derby 1992 ).\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】The primary goal of nucleoplasty is volumetric reduction of the tissue of the nucleus pulposus, which is vaporised at lower temperatures and causes a decrease in intradiscal pressure of the herniated disc. Several studies have demonstrated that cervical nucleoplasty is a safe and effective technique ( Gerszten 2006 _;_ Birnbaum 2009 ; Sim 2011 ; Halim 2013 ). A recent observational study showed that complete or partial long‐term pain relief can be safely achieved using nucleoplasty in patients with a contained cervical herniated disk ( Halim 2013 ). In the vast majority of these patients, nucleoplasty achieves a long‐term reduction in pain, good clinical outcomes, reduced pain medication use, and higher patient satisfaction ( Halim 2013 ).\n\n【15】Careful selection of patients is important for successful nucleoplasty ( Gerges 2010 _;_ Halim 2013 ). Patients with incomplete annular tears and minimally degenerated discs may benefit the most ( Gerges 2010 ; Halim 2013 ). Compared to surgical treatment, nucleoplasty is a minimally invasive percutaneous technique performed on an outpatient basis with a fast recovery time. There have been no neurological complications reported from the procedure itself,although this claim is subject to publication bias. Until now, very limited evidence has been found on the effects of nucleoplasty in patients with CR.\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】When the severe symptoms of patients with CR do not improve with conservative treatment, surgical treatment is considered. Surgery comes with risks, reoperation rates are significant ( Veeravagu 2014 ) and freedom from pain is not guaranteed. Long‐term pain medication and other forms of conservative treatment carry their own risks and costs. We would consider it an important improvement for the patient, if the same benefits of surgery could be achieved with nucleoplasty, without serious complications and at reduced cost. At present, there is only one systematic review available focusing on nucleoplasty treatment options for people with CR ( Wullems 2014 ), which did not use the GRADE approach to measure the quality of evidence. The Wullems review measures the risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials (RCTs) using the method described by Furlan 2009 and the non‐RCTs using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale (NOS), despite the fact that the NOS is designed for prospective cohort studies. In contrast to Wullems 2014 , we will use the GRADE system ( Guyatt 2011 ) to assess the quality of the body of evidence and we will use the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool ( Higgins 2011 ) and items from the Downs and Black checklist ( Downs 1998 ) to measure the risk of bias. We will also measure psycho‐social outcomes as secondary outcomes.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To determine whether nucleoplasty improves clinical and functional outcomes compared to surgery or conservative treatment for patients with cervical radicular pain, radiculopathy due to disc herniation or both.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】We will include full journal publications of quantitative studies, namely randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised controlled trials (using a method of allocating people to a treatment that is not strictly random, e.g. by date of birth, alternation) and non‐randomised controlled trials (controlled clinical trials: CCTs). We will include CCTs (observational studies, case studies, and case series) because of the limited number of RCTs. We will exclude letters, editorials, commentaries, conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, lectures and addresses, narrative reviews, and qualitative research.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】We will include studies involving male or female patients (18 years of age or older), with cervical radicular pain, radiculopathy, or both, due to single level degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine corresponding to the affected level. We will include degenerative disc diseases such as a narrowing of the intervertebral foramen, intervertebral disk herniations and radiculitis due to the degenerative effect of arthritis. The duration of symptoms must be at least six weeks, with insufficient relief of symptoms with conservative treatment. We will exclude studies involving patients with previous surgery of the cervical spine, inflammatory spinal arthritis and malignancy of the cervical spine region.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】We will include studies with nucleoplasty as the index treatment.\n\n【28】The index treatment will be compared to the following:\n\n【29】*   no treatment or placebo treatment;\n    \n*   conservative treatment (such as oral medication (e.g. non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants), physiotherapy, manual therapy, spinal modulation, bed rest, cervical collar or traction);\n    \n*   surgery (anterior and posterior decompression, either with non‐fusion techniques; fusion techniques by plate, cage, autograft, allograft material, or artificial disc; or a combination).\n    \n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】We will collect all outcome data at short‐term follow‐up (up to and including 3 months), medium‐term follow‐up (more than 3 and less than 12 months) and long‐term follow‐up (1 year or longer).\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】*   Pain intensity of the arm and neck expressed on a visual analogue scale or other measure of pain scale (e.g. visual analogue scale for pain ( Sriwatanakul 1983 ), ordinal scale ( Von Korff 2000 )).\n    \n*   Neck‐related functional status, expressed on a neck‐specific scale (e.g. Neck Disability Index ( Vernon 2008 )).\n    \n*   Recovery measured by global perceived effect (e.g. proportion of patients recovered, subjective improvement of symptoms).\n    \n\n【34】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【35】*   Global health status (e.g. The Short Form (36) Health Survey ( Ware 1992 ), EuroQoL 5D ( Williams 1990 ), Sickness Impact Profile ( de Bruin 1994 )).\n    \n*   Work‐related disability (rate of health‐related absenteeism or unemployment).\n    \n*   Psycho‐social outcomes (e.g. anxiety, depression, pain behaviour).\n    \n*   Adverse effects (totality of possible adverse consequences of an intervention or therapy such as early adverse events and delayed complications).\n    \n\n【36】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【37】#### Electronic searches\n\n【38】The search will be conducted from inception to the present in the following databases:\n\n【39】*   EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database, Elsevier)\n    \n*   MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, OvidSP)\n    \n*   CENTRAL (Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane Library)\n    \n*   Web of Science (Thomson Reuters)\n    \n*   Scopus (Elsevier)\n    \n*   CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EBSCO)\n    \n*   PubMed\n    \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov\n    \n*   Google Scholar\n    \n*   PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database)\n    \n*   World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)\n    \n\n【40】We will apply no language restrictions. We will not use an RCT filter in MEDLINE or EMBASE, as the set of intervention terms will limit the results sufficiently. The searches will be conducted by an experienced librarian at the Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam. We will contact the Trials Search Coordinator of the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG) to search the group's Trials Register through the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) for studies not in CENTRAL. The MEDLINE strategy is given in Appendix 1 .\n\n【41】#### Searching other resources\n\n【42】We will search the System for Information on Grey Literature (SIGLE) database through OpenSigle , subheading biological and medical sciences, to search for trials that might have been missed by other sources. We will also consult personal files, screen references, and communicate with the CBRG and content experts in order to identify additional studies.\n\n【43】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【44】#### Selection of studies\n\n【45】Two authors (JDdR and BSH) will screen the titles and abstracts of all studies retrieved by the searches to identify those meeting the inclusion criteria. The authors will select the studies independently and discuss the results to make the final selection. They will make the final decision after reading the full text of all potentially eligible articles. In case of disagreement, they will consult with a third author (JGG). We will retrieve publications in all languages and seek appropriate translation if necessary. Study flow diagrams, following the template described in the PRISMA statement ( Liberati 2009 ), will be used to illustrate the results of the search and the process of screening and selecting studies for inclusion in the review.\n\n【46】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【47】Two authors (JDdR and BSH) will independently extract the data from each included trial using a standard form. These authors will also pilot test the standardised form on a sample of three articles not included in the review. The authors will examine inter‐rater reliability.\n\n【48】The following data will be extracted from each study: study design, characteristics of the study population (e.g. number of participants, age, gender, nature and duration of the health problem, inclusion and exclusion criteria), study characteristics (e.g. country, recruitment modality, setting and company sponsorship, risk of bias), description of the experimental and control interventions, co‐interventions, duration of follow‐up, outcomes assessed, and results. The two authors will discuss any disagreement and consult a third review author if necessary.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】Two review authors (JDdR and BSH) will independently assess the risks of bias of all included studies. In case of disagreement, they will consult a third author (APV). We will attempt to obtain additional information from authors of the studies regarding any items that remain unclear.\n\n【51】The risk of bias for both RCTs and CCTs will be assessed using the criteria recommended by the CBRG ( Furlan 2009 ; Higgins 2011 ), together with items from the Downs & Black checklist ( Downs 1998 ) ( Appendix 2 ).\n\n【52】We will examine all trials for five types of bias categories: selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, measurement/detection bias and selective reporting.The 'Assessment of risk of bias' form will be piloted and tested for intra‐observer and inter‐observer reliability. The 'Risk of bias' criteria will be scored as high, low or unclear risk, and will be reported in the 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【53】The additional details on quality assessment for each outcome are described in the Data synthesis section.\n\n【54】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【55】Dichotomous outcomes will be analysed by calculating the relative risk (RR). Continuous outcomes (e.g. visual analog scale, numeric rating scale ) will be analysed by calculating the mean difference (MD) when the same instrument is used to measure outcomes, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different instruments are used to measure outcomes. The uncertainty will be expressed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For each treatment comparison, we will calculate an effect size and a 95% CI and display them as forest plots.\n\n【56】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【57】We do not expect to identify unit of analysis issues with regard to cross‐over or cluster randomised trials. However, we do expect to ﬁnd repeated observations on participants in most of the eligible trials. In this case we will follow the suggested strategy of deﬁning the outcomes (already stated above) as well as the time points a priori ( Higgins 2011 ). The time points are short (less than 3 months after randomisation), intermediate (at least 3 months but less than 12 months after randomisation) and long term (12 months or more after randomisation). When there are multiple time points that fall within the same category, the time points that are closest to the end of the treatment,and to 6 months and 12 months will be used. If studies include multiple treatment arms and, therefore, multiple comparisons, we will aim to select the most appropriate comparison. If two groups are considered to be the same (e.g.2 controls: waiting list and no treatment) the ‘shared’ intervention will be split in order to include two (reasonably independent) comparisons.\n\n【58】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【59】We will contact the trial authors to request missing data. When standard deviations (SDs) are not reported and can not be acquired from the trial authors we will use one of the following three options; calculation of the missing SDs from other reported data (e.g. mean differences, P values, number of observations); if graphs with error bars are available we will measure them manually and impute by taking the SD of similar sized studies for that outcome. Finally, if no measure of variation is reported in the text, we will estimate the SD based upon other studies with a similar population and risk of bias.\n\n【60】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【61】We will assess clinical heterogeneity based on information on study population, interventions, control interventions and outcomes. Additionally, we will assess methodological heterogeneity by examining the variability in study design (RCT versus CCT) and risk of bias. We will assess statistical heterogeneity between trials using the values of I² that are greater than 75% showing a very high level of heterogeneity, in which case, we will not pool studies. In all other cases we will pool studies using a random‐effects model.\n\n【62】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【63】We will create and use funnel plots to assess publication bias.\n\n【64】#### Data synthesis\n\n【65】Our approach to evidence synthesis will be adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration methods for randomised trials and from other reviews of non‐randomised studies. For risks, we will capture or calculate the incidence and/or prevalence for the population included in each study. We will group the analyses separately according to the control interventions, the outcomes measured, and the timing of outcome assessment. The outcome measures from the individual trials will be combined through meta‐analysis where possible (clinical comparability of population, intervention and outcomes between trials) using a random‐effects model. If a meta‐analysis is not possible, the results from clinically comparable trials will be described qualitatively in the text.\n\n【66】Regardless of whether there are sufficient data available to use quantitative analyses to summarise the data, we will assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome. To accomplish this, we will use the GRADE approach, as recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook_ ( Higgins 2011 ) and adapted in the updated CBRG method guidelines ( Furlan 2009 ).\n\n【67】Following GRADE guidelines, the final grade for quality of evidence for each sub‐question will be categorised as: high, moderate, low, or very low. The evidence available to answer each sub‐question will be graded on the following domains: study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, magnitude of effect, dose‐response gradient and influence of all plausible residual confounding. These domains are further discussed in Appendix 3 of this protocol. The judgment of these factors will be determined by two review authors (JdR and APV). Single randomised studies will be considered inconsistent, imprecise if N < 300 for dichotomous outcomes and < 400 for continuous outcomes and in that case will provide 'low quality evidence'. This can be further downgraded to 'very low quality evidence' if there are also limitations in design (i.e. high risk of bias), indirectness or other considerations. We will use RevMan software ( RevMan 2014 ) to analyse the data.\n\n【68】##### 'Summary of findings' tables\n\n【69】We will include the essential outcomes and the timing of outcome assessment of pain intensity, neck‐related functional status, recovery, global health status, work disability, psycho‐social outcomes and adverse effects. We will report these outcomes in terms of the three different comparisons listed at Types of interventions .\n\n【70】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【71】We will perform subgroup analyses for RCTs versus CCTs. If data allow, we will perform subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of different control groups, different degenerative disc diseases, location of the health problem (neck versus arm) and the duration of the problem (chronic versus (sub(acute)).\n\n【72】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【73】We will perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of including trials at high risk of bias. We define a trial meeting fewer than five criteria in the 'Risk of bias' analysis as being at high risk of bias. We will also perform a second sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of high levels of attrition (15% or more participants lost to follow up).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】This review aims to assess the necessity of routine usage of neostigmine to prevent residual neuromuscular blockade in paediatric patients following the use of muscle relaxants.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Residual neuromuscular block refers to symptoms and signs such as muscle paralysis, apnoea and hypoxia in the postoperative period that is related to the administration of muscle relaxants during a surgical procedure. The residual block may endanger patients who have undergone anaesthesia, paediatric patients in particular, so it is important for patient safety to assess residual muscle paralysis in the correct manner. The traditional methods to evaluate recovery include head lift, hand grip and respiratory function. Moreover, anaesthesiologists often use train‐of‐four (TOF) monitoring to assess residual muscle paralysis. Residual neuromuscular block has been defined as TOF ratio < 0.7, but recently the value was changed to 0.9 ( Murphy 2010 ). Although patients may have satisfactory recovery of muscle strength with a TOF ratio > 0.9 ( Eriksson 1997 ; Kopman 1997 ), obvious muscle weakness may still exist in some patients. Therefore, residual neuromuscular block assessment requires not only TOF monitoring but also clinical observation ( Murphy 2010 ).\n\n【7】The incidence of residual neuromuscular block in adults varies from 2% to 64% in different clinical trials, due to different muscle relaxants and different definitions ( Murphy 2010 ). According to Bevan's study ( Bevan 1996 ), using mivacurium and defining residual neuromuscular block as TOF ratio < 0.7, there is no residual blockade in all children regardless of whether the blockade was reversed. This study showed that the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade is different between adults and children. This may be associated with metabolic alteration. Therefore, it is unclear how frequently residual blockade occurs and whether a routine reversal is necessary in children.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Neostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and its distribution and elimination half lives are 3.4 and 77 minutes, respectively ( Miller 2009 ). The elimination half life in paediatric patients is shorter than in adults ( Fisher 1983 ). Neostigmine is usually used to reverse the effects of non‐depolarizing muscular relaxants at the end of an operation. It takes a shorter time to reverse the blockade in infants than in children or adolescents ( Kirkegaard‐Nielsen 1995 ). Larger doses of neostigmine reverse the blockade more rapidly and completely than smaller doses. However, it has a maximum effective dosage and administering additional neostigmine will not produce any further reversal. The maximum effective dose is in the range of 0.06 to 0.08 mg/kg and the recommended dose for blockade reversal in paediatric patients is 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg combined with 0.02 mg/kg atropine ( Miller 2009 ).\n\n【10】Drugs such as quinidine and aminoglycoside may interfere with neuromuscular transmission and could decrease the efficacy of neostigmine. The increased acetylcholine resulting from neostigmine administration can stimulate both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. The side‐effects of neostigmine are associated with overstimulation of cholinergic nerves, including bradycardia, salivation, nausea and vomiting. In the worst cases, arrhythmias and bronchospasm can also occur ( Hunter 2006 ).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Acetylcholinesterase contains two sites of action. One is an anionic site, which attracts acetylcholine (ACh). The other is an esteratic site, which combines with ACh and hydrolyzes it rapidly to deactivate it. Neostigmine occupies both sites of acetylcholinesterase and thus prevents it binding to and hydrolyzing ACh ( Caldwell 2009 ). Consequently, the amount of ACh in the synaptic cleft increases. The increased ACh is in competition with the non‐depolarizing agents to reverse the neuromuscular block. However, neostigmine has a ceiling effect. When neostigmine inhibits all the acetylcholinesterase, giving further neostigmine has no clinical effect on reversal. In addition, both the antagonism induced by neostigmine and the natural decrease of the muscle relaxant concentration contribute to the recovery of neuromuscular function when administering neostigmine.\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】Muscle relaxants are commonly used for endotracheal intubation or maintenance of muscle paralysis during surgery in children ( Meretoja 2010 ). Residual neuromuscular block may cause serious respiratory complications, such as hypoxia, during the postoperative period. The residual blockade may have more influence in children because of their limited respiratory reserve capacity. So it is important for anaesthesiologists to ensure that there is no residual paralysis in such children during the postoperative period. For infants or neonates, most of the traditional methods (such as head lift, hand grip and so on) to assess the residual neuromuscular blockade are impractical since there is lack of co‐operation. One study ( Meretoja 1990 ) showed that the average TOF ratio was only 0.5 at the time of extubation if the recovery was assessed by clinical criteria. It seems that we should assess neuromuscular blockade in children by the TOF monitor but, unfortunately, most anaesthesiologists do not use a neuromuscular monitor in their daily work ( Naguib 2010 ). Therefore, it is recommended to use neostigmine with atropine to reverse the neuromuscular blockade in all neonates and small infants, even if they have shown clinical signs of recovery ( Miller 2009 ). However, some disagree because some researchers have indicated that spontaneous and induced recovery from neuromuscular block is faster in children than in adults ( Goudsouzian 1984 ; Meakin 1983 ). Moreover, many paediatric surgeries last for a short time and sometimes anaesthesiologists administer muscle relaxants just for the purpose of endotracheal intubation. Therefore, it is unnecessary to reverse the neuromuscular blockade in every paediatric patient at the end of surgery. Furthermore, large doses of neostigmine may not reverse the blockade but prolong muscle weakness ( Bevan 1992 ), and salivation or bradycardia may be induced after using neostigmine. Whether we should routine use neostigmine in paediatric patients at the end of an operation to reverse neuromuscular blockade is an important question for paediatric anaesthesiologists.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】This review aims to assess the necessity of routine usage of neostigmine to prevent residual neuromuscular blockade in paediatric patients following the use of muscle relaxants.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】We will only include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compare neostigmine to placebo, irrespective of language and publication status.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】We will include American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II paediatric patients (under 12 years old, including newborns) who have received non‐depolarizing muscle relaxant for undergoing any kind of operation.\n\n【23】We will exclude individuals with a known history of neuromuscular disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, hepatic disease, and drug abuse; and those who had recently taken medication affecting neuromuscular transmission. We will also exclude premature babies.\n\n【24】#### Types of interventions\n\n【25】Paediatric patients who were administered neostigmine at the end of surgery to reverse the neuromuscular blockade will constitute the intervention group.\n\n【26】Paediatric patients who were administered placebo at the end of surgery will constitute the control group.\n\n【27】We will compare the intervention group with the control group.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【30】1.

Length of stay in a postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)\n    \n\n【33】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【34】#### Electronic searches\n\n【35】We will search the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library,_ current issue), MEDLINE via PubMed (from 1980 to present) and EMBASE (from 1980 to present).\n\n【36】We will combine the free text terms and the subject headings when searching CENTRAL (for detailed search strategy see Appendix 1 ).\n\n【37】We will use the sensitive strategies described in Section 6.4 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) to search for RCTs in MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE. We will combine the exploded MeSH terms (or EMTREE terms) and associated free text terms with the RCT sensitive search strategy (for detailed search strategy see Appendix 2 ).\n\n【38】We will not apply language restrictions to the search strategy.\n\n【39】In available studies, we will assess any free text terms, MeSH terms or EMTREE terms for neostigmine, residual neuromuscular block or children that have not been used. We will modify our original search strategy by adding any new terms that we find. We will report the final search strategy in our review.\n\n【40】#### Searching other resources\n\n【41】We will screen all of the references of eligible trials and we will contact the authors of included studies to ask for any information about unpublished trials. We will search for ongoing trials in the following databases: ClinicalTrials.gov and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry .\n\n【42】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【43】#### Selection of studies\n\n【44】Two authors (LY and DY) will independently screen all studies for eligibility based on their titles and abstracts (see Appendix 3 for a copy of the Study Selection Form). We will resolve any disagreements by consulting with a third author (QL). We will obtain the full published version of the selected studies. When the trials information about inclusion is insufficient, we will contact the first authors of the papers for the non‐reported information (LY).\n\n【45】We will list all the eligible trials in a paper form (see Appendix 4 for a copy of the Eligible Trials Form).\n\n【46】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【47】Two authors (LY and DY) will independently extract the data onto a paper form (See Appendix 5 for a copy of the Data Extraction Form). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion. DY will enter the data into RevMan file and LY will check the accuracy of the data entry.\n\n【48】When we need additional non‐published information about a paper, LY will contact the first author of the relevant paper.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】Two authors (LY and DY) will independently assess the methodological quality of the included papers. We will resolve any disagreements by discussion with the third author (QL).\n\n【51】We will perform risk of bias assessment using the 'Risk of bias' tool described in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). A copy of the form that we will use to do this is in Appendix 6 . We will assess each trial according to the quality domains of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and any other potential threats to validity.\n\n【52】We will consider a trial as having a low risk of bias if all domains are assessed as low risk. We will consider a trial as having a high risk of bias if one or more domain is assessed as high risk or unclear.\n\n【53】We will report the 'Risk of bias' table as part of the 'Table of characteristics of included studies' and present a 'Risk of bias summary' figure that will detail all of the judgements made for all included studies in the review.\n\n【54】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【55】We will present dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. In the case of outcomes with continuous data in different scales, we will use standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI.\n\n【56】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【57】We will contact the first author to request the missing data. We will include any relevant information obtained in this way in our review.\n\n【58】We will perform both available case analysis and intention‐to‐treat analysis. We will compare these results in a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【59】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【60】We will assess the clinical diversity (for example different types of muscle relaxants, length of surgery and the age of children) and methodological diversity (risk of bias assessment). If they are similar enough, we will pool the data in a meta‐analysis. Then we will assess the statistical heterogeneity using the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test. We will consider this to be statistically significant with a P value < 0.1. We will also calculate the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta‐analysis. We will consider there to be substantial heterogeneity if the value of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic is greater than 50%. If substantial heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 50%) is found in the results, we will explore possible sources of heterogeneity using the sensitivity and subgroup analyses described below.\n\n【61】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【62】We will assess the publication bias by funnel plots if more than 10 studies were included in the meta‐analysis ( Egger 1997 ).\n\n【63】#### Data synthesis\n\n【64】If the heterogeneity is not substantial, we will combine all trials results. We will use RevMan 5.1 to perform the analysis and a random‐effects model.\n\n【65】*   For dichotomous data, we will use Mantel‐Haenszel methods.\n    \n*   For continuous data, we will use MD if all outcomes use the same scale, otherwise we will use SMD.\n    \n\n【66】If the heterogeneity is considerable, we will not combine any results. We will perform a descriptive analysis.\n\n【67】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【68】We will perform the following subgroup analyses for different interventions and participants.\n\n【69】1.  Different definition of residual neuromuscular block.\n    \n2.  The type of muscle relaxants.\n    \n3.  Length of surgery more than one hour.\n    \n4.  Different age groups (neonates under 28 days, less than one year old, one to three years and older than three years).\n    \n5.  Different races.\n    \n\n【70】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【71】We will reanalyse the data using different statistical approaches (random‐effects model or fixed‐effect model). We will approach the missing data using different imputation methods (best case, worst case; last observation carried forward).\n\n【72】##### Summary of findings tables\n\n【73】We will use the principles of the GRADE system ( Guyatt 2008 ) to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes (mortality of children in postoperative period; risk of assisted ventilation after extubation; risk of drug‐related adverse effects (bradycardia, excessive salivation, vomiting)) in our review and construct the 'Summary of findings' (SoF) table using the GRADE software. The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. The quality of a body of evidence considers within study risk of bias (methodologic quality), the directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of ERT for treating infantile‐onset Pompe disease.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pompe disease is the first recognised lysosomal storage disorder and is the only glycogen storage disease associated with a defect in lysosomal metabolism. It is an autosomal‐recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha‐glucosidase (GAA) leading to glycogen accumulation in multiple tissue types, including skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscle and nervous tissue ( Hirschhorn 2001 ). Symptoms of Pompe disease can manifest at any age. Based on the age of onset and whether clinical symptoms develop prior to, or beyond, one year of age, it is typically classified into infantile‐onset and late‐onset forms ( Kishnani 2006a ). Infantile‐onset Pompe disease is further subdivided into typical or non‐typical forms based on the presence or absence of cardiomyopathy as a primary feature ( Slonim 2000 ). Patients with a small amount of natural inactive GAA enzyme are termed cross‐reactive immunological material (CRIM)‐positive. Patients who are unable to produce native enzyme are termed CRIM‐negative. CRIM‐positive and CRIM‐negative status can be determined by western blot analysis ( Klinge 2005 ).\n\n【7】Pompe disease has an estimated frequency of one in 40,000 in the African‐American population, one in 50,000 in the Chinese population, one in 40,000 in the Dutch population and one in 146,000 in the Australian population. The infantile‐onset form has an apparent higher incidence among African‐American and Chinese populations ( Hirschhorn 2001 ). Infantile‐onset symptoms are characterized by progressive cardiac, respiratory and skeletal muscle weakness and early death from cardiorespiratory failure. One natural history study reported that the median age of symptom onset in people with infantile‐onset disease is 1.6 months, with ventilator dependency at 4.7 months and death at 6.0 to 7.7 months ( Kishnani 2006a ; Van 2003 ). People with classic infantile‐onset Pompe disease rarely survive beyond one year of age.\n\n【8】The clinical diagnosis is traditionally confirmed by the virtual absence (infantile‐onset) or markedly reduced (late‐onset) GAA activity in tissues such as cultured fibroblasts from skin biopsy, muscle biopsy, purified lymphocytes, mononuclear cells and lymphoid cell lines, when combined with clinical and laboratory data. In general, GAA enzyme activities of less than 1% of normal controls are seen in the infantile form ( Kishnani 2006a ). Both the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and the Japanese guidelines for the management of Pompe disease recommend a GAA assay performed on skin fibroblasts (preferred tissue) or muscle biopsy as the diagnostic 'gold standard' ( Eto 2010 ; Kishnani 2006a ). Currently, new techniques mean these invasive procedures are not required as enzyme activity can be assessed on leukocytes using fluorometric assay or on dried blood spot using tandem mass spectroscopy ( Zhang 2006 ). Tandem mass spectroscopy has been used for newborn screening for Pompe disease in some countries. Confirmation should be achieved by mutation analysis of the GAA gene (OMIM: 606800), the only gene in which mutations are known to cause Pompe disease ( Kroos 2008 ).\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】There was no disease‐specific treatment for Pompe disease until enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was approved for human use in 2006 ( Chien 2013 ). The aim of the therapy is to reduce the symptoms and prevent long‐term damage. Results from several different trials with the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) enzyme and transgenic enzyme from rabbit milk in earlier trials have shown that patients treated early in the disease, prior to the development of extensive tissue damage, are likely to have gains in overall survival and quality of life ( Amalfitano 2001 ; Kishnani 2006b ; Kishnani 2009 ; Klinge 2005 ). Intravenous enzyme replacement with different forms of recombinant human (rh) GAA have been administered at doses of 10 to 40 mg/kg/week. However, it is still controversial whether the dose of ERT affects outcomes. In one report looking at treatment with rhGAA 20 mg/kg every other week, patients with a CRIM‐negative status had a good outcome on ERT ( Al Khallaf 2013 ). One further study concluded that treatment with rhGAA at a higher dose of 40 mg/kg every week was generally well tolerated and led to improved ventilator‐free survival and motor outcomes in patients with classic infantile‐onset Pompe disease than treatment with 20 mg/kg every other week ( Van Gelder 2013 ). However, Kishnani observed no advantage of rhGAA 40 mg/kg every other week over 20 mg/kg every other week in patients with infantile‐onset Pompe disease ( Kishnani 2007 ).\n\n【11】Another factor that may also affect outcome is CRIM status, this is because of its influence on the production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies towards alglucosidase alfa, which diminishes its effectiveness ( Banugaria 2011 ). One long‐term retrospective study revealed that CRIM‐negative status was associated with poorer clinical outcome and reduced overall survival in infants with Pompe disease treated with rhGAA ( Kishnani 2010 ). Some researchers speculated that people with a CRIM‐negative status are more likely to produce higher levels of anti‐rhGAA antibodies. People with a CRIM‐positive status also developed antibodies that ultimately tended to be self resolving ( Kishnani 2007 ). Other scientists hold the opinion that, irrespective of CRIM status, anti‐rhGAA antibody titer is the important factor in determining effectiveness of treatment.\n\n【12】There are still some limitations to ERT and not all patients are suitable for this very expensive treatment. Further modifications, such as immune modulation, desensitisation and an improved uptake formulation are expected to enhance the efficacy of the therapy ( Baruteau 2014 ; Messinger 2012 ; Sun 2007 ).\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Pompe disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for GAA. Deficiency of this enzyme causes glycogen to accumulate in various tissues. The excessive glycogen in cardiac muscle results in thickening of the ventricular walls and interventricular septum, leading to the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy observed in infantile‐onset disease. Glycogen accumulation is thought to trigger an autophagic process and increase numbers of lysosomes and autophagosomes, resulting in weakness by a mechanical interruption of the contractile apparatus ( Fukuda 2006 ; Reuser 2006 ). The mechanism of ERT is to replace the missing enzyme with a recombinant form that degrades the alpha ‐1,4 and alpha ‐1,6 linkages in glycogen and reduces glycogen storage.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) appealed for all countries to come together to combat rare diseases ( WHO 2012 ). ERT was developed as the most promising therapeutic approach for Pompe disease. However, the evidence is lacking, especially regarding the optimal dose and dose frequency. This Cochrane Review will aim to determine the effectiveness and safety of ERT for the infantile‐onset form of Pompe disease.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of ERT for treating infantile‐onset Pompe disease.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】People with classical infantile Pompe disease and people with the non‐classical variant.\n\n【25】Inclusion criteria include people with\n\n【26】1.  a confirmed diagnosis of infantile‐onset Pompe disease.\n    \n\n【27】Exclusion criteria include people with:\n\n【28】1.  congenital diseases that are unrelated to Pompe disease and likely to decrease survival rate;\n    \n2.  any prior GAA treatment from any source.\n    \n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Intervention: ERT (e.g. alglucosidase alfa) alone or with another medical care (e.g. immune tolerance induction, symptomatic medications).\n\n【31】Control: different doses of ERT, another intervention, no intervention or placebo.\n\n【32】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【33】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【34】1.  Cardiac function (as measured by the left ventricular mass z score (LVM‐Z), fractional shortening and ejection fraction)\n    \n2.  Respiratory function (as assessed by time‐to‐ventilator dependence, ventilator‐free survival, ventilator‐dependent survival such as night‐time only ventilation or the whole day ventilation, etc.)\n    \n3.  Survival\n    \n\n【35】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【36】1.  Motor development (as measured by recognized scoring tools)\n    \n2.  Quality of life (as determined by, for example, the Short Form 36 (SF‐36) Health Survey or the PedsQL measurement model)\n    \n3.  Infusion‐related reactions (IREs) (defined as adverse events occurring during or immediately after the GAA infusion, e.g. flushing, nausea, vomiting)\n    \n4.  Other adverse events (defined as clinical events occurring after initiation of GAA treatment but excluding IREs, including the development of anti‐GAA antibodies)\n    \n\n【37】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【38】We will attempt to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, ongoing).\n\n【39】#### Electronic searches\n\n【40】We will search the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register using the term: Pompe disease.\n\n【41】The Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated with each new issue of _The Cochrane Library_ ), weekly searches of MEDLINE and the prospective handsearching of one journal ‐ _Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease_ . Unpublished work is identified by searching through the abstract books of the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism conference and the SHS Inborn Error Review Series. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant section of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group Module .\n\n【42】We will search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in _The Cochrane Library_ (updated with each new issue of _The Cochrane Library_ ), Embase (Ovid), PubMed and LILACS using the search strategies detailed in Appendix 1 ; we will search the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) and WANFANG for literature published in Chinese using the search strategies in Appendix 2 . We will search all databases from their earliest records to August 2014. In addition, we plan to search the following online registers: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ); ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ); and the Genzyme clinical research database ( www.genzymeclinicalresearch.com ).\n\n【43】We will place no restrictions on language and publication type.\n\n【44】#### Searching other resources\n\n【45】##### Grey literature\n\n【46】We will contact specialists in the ﬁeld and authors of the included trials for any possible unpublished data. We will contact the pharmaceutical company, Genzyme, for information on unpublished or ongoing trials.\n\n【47】##### Reference lists\n\n【48】We will check the reference lists of all trials identified by the above methods.\n\n【49】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【50】#### Selection of studies\n\n【51】Two authors will independently screen the title, abstract and keywords of all trials identified by the search strategy and obtain the full articles for all potentially relevant trials. Two authors will independently assess the full text and extract data using a data extraction form. We will resolve any disagreements by consensus or by consulting with the corresponding author or asking for help from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group.\n\n【52】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【53】Two authors will independently use a pre‐designed data collection form to extract data from each trial. These extracted data will include: characteristics of the trial (author, country, publication year, design, methods of randomisation, funding sources, conflicts of interest); participants; interventions and outcomes (types of outcome measures, follow‐up, adverse events). The authors will resolve any discrepancies by discussion. If trials report data on our primary outcome of 'survival', we will report it as either a binary or a time‐to‐event outcome.\n\n【54】We will measure outcomes at the following time points: one month to up to six months; six months to up to one year; over one year to 18 months and at six‐monthly intervals thereafter.\n\n【55】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【56】Two authors will independently assess the risk of bias using a standard form. We will contact the authors by telephone or email if important information is unclear. We will use the domain‐based evaluation recommended by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ to address six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of bias ( Higgins 2011 ). We will create plots of 'Risk of bias' assessment using Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2014 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion.\n\n【57】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【58】For dichotomous data, we will extract the number of participants experiencing the event and the total number of participants evaluated for that outcome. We will use the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) as the effect measure.\n\n【59】For continuous data, we will extract the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) or any data that could be used to derive the SMD, and the total number of participants evaluated for that outcome. We will use the MD when outcome measurements in all trials are made on the same scale. We will use the SMD when the same outcome is measured using different instruments. We will calculate the corresponding 95% CI.\n\n【60】For time‐to‐event data, which take into account of the number and timing of events, we will summarize and analyse data using hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% CIs ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【61】For other outcomes, where there are insufficient data to be quantitatively analysed, we will present the information narratively.\n\n【62】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【63】Given the nature of the intervention, cross‐over trials are not an appropriate trial design. Given the rarity of the disease and that any eligible trials will have a limited sample size, we also do not anticipate including cluster randomised trials or trials with multiple treatment arms.\n\n【64】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【65】If the information and published data of the included trials presented in the papers or abstracts are not sufficient to be entered into the review, we will contact authors for further details (such as the method of generation, allocation concealment, blinding and withdrawals or if there are any missing outcome data). We will carry out an analysis according to the intention‐to‐treat principle if there are no missing data.\n\n【66】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【67】We will use Chi <sup>2 </sup> test and visual assessment of the forest plots to observe whether statistical heterogeneity exists between the identified trials. We will quantify heterogeneity using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, which illustrates the percentage of the variability in effect estimates resulting from heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We will consider there to be no important heterogeneity if the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic is below 40%, for there to be a moderate degree if the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic is between 30% and 60%, for there to be a substantial degree if the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic is between 50% and 90%, and for there to be a considerable degree if the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic is between 75% and 100% ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【68】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【69】If we include 10 or more trials, we will use funnel plots to assess biases including publication bias and other reporting biases. If there are biases, the funnel plots may be asymmetrical. However, it is notable that there are a number of explanations for the asymmetry of a funnel plot, including true heterogeneity, poor methodological quality (high risk of bias) of smaller studies, publication bias and language bias ( Sterne 2011 ).\n\n【70】#### Data synthesis\n\n【71】We will conduct data analyses using Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2014 ). In the absence of substantial statistical heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> statistic of 50% or less), we will present a fixed‐effect model to combine trials. By contrast, should we identify substantial heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> statistic greater than 50%), we will use a random‐effects model. If we are unable to explain this heterogeneity by use of subgroup analyses, or by clinical or methodological features of the trials, we will present a narrative summary.\n\n【72】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【73】Considering the following factors may affect clinical outcomes, we plan to undertake the subgroup analyses.\n\n【74】1.  People with CRIM‐negative versus CRIM‐positive status.\n    \n2.  People given immunomodulation versus people not given immunomodulation.\n    \n3.  Dosage and frequency of dosing (e.g. 20 mg/kg every other week versus 40 mg/kg every other week).\n    \n4.  Age at commencement of treatment.\n    \n\n【75】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【76】We will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the meta‐analysis. We will implement sensitivity analysis by excluding trials with a high risk of bias in relation to the method of randomization, allocation concealment and the rates of withdrawal for each outcome.\n\n【77】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【78】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes: cardiac function, respiratory function, survival, motor development, quality of life, IREs and other adverse events. We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence (studies that contribute data for the pre‐specified outcomes). Methods and recommendations are described in Chapters 11 and 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will use GRADEpro software ( GradePro 2011 ). We will justify all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of evidence using footnotes and we will make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Chromoscopy may be one way of enhancing the ability for colonoscopy to detect polyps particularly diminutive flat lesions that may be otherwise difficult to detect.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To determine whether the use of chromoscopy enhances detection of polyps and neoplasia during endoscopic examination of the colon and rectum.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases were searched along with a hand search of abstracts from relevant meetings. Search terms included randomised trials containing combinations of the following: 'chromoscopy' 'colonoscopy' 'dye‐spray' 'chromo‐endoscopy' 'indigo‐carmine' 'magnifying endoscopy'.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】All prospective randomised trials comparing chromoscopic with conventional endoscopic examination of the lower gastrointestinal tract were included. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or polyposis syndromes were excluded.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Three reviewers assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials. Outcome measures included the detection of polyps (neoplastic and non‐neoplastic), the detection of diminutive lesions, the number of patients with multiple neoplastic lesions and the extubation time.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Four trials were include that met the inclusion criteria and although there were some methodological drawbacks and differences in study design, combining the results showed a significant difference in favour of chromoscopy for all detection outcomes. In particular, chromoscopy is likely to yield significantly more patients with at least one neoplastic lesion (OR 1.61 (CI 1.24‐2.09)) and significantly more patients with three or more neoplastic lesions (OR 2.55 (CI 1.49‐4.36)). Not surprisingly the withdrawal times were significantly slower for the chromoscopy group.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There appears to be strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of neoplasia in the colon and rectum. Patients with neoplastic polyps, particularly those with multiple polyps, are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Such lesions, which presumably would be missed with conventional colonoscopy, could contribute to the interval cancer numbers on any surveillance programme.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (6)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Endoscopy\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Chromoscopy\n\n【23】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【24】*   Colonoscopy\n*   Endoscopy\n\n【25】###### Outcome (4)\n\n【26】*   Tubular Adenoma\n*   Number of lesions\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Polyp\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

These lesions are precursors to cancer. Although the test is the most sensitive test around for the detection of these growths, some may be missed. If a simple dye spraying technique is used with the colonoscopic test, the detection of these lesions appears to be enhanced. This may make colonoscopy more sensitive.\n\n【34】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【35】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Misoprostol, a new and inexpensive prostaglandin E1 analogue, has been suggested as an alternative for routine management of the third stage of labour.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the effects of prophylactic prostaglandin use in the third stage of labour.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (7 January 2011). We updated this search on 25 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised trials comparing a prostaglandin agent with another uterotonic or no prophylactic uterotonic (nothing or placebo) as part of management of the third stage of labour. The primary outcomes were blood loss 1000 mL or more and the use of additional uterotonics.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and extracted data.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included 72 trials (52,678 women). Oral or sublingual misoprostol compared with placebo is effective in reducing severe PPH (oral: seven trials, 6225 women, not totalled due to significant heterogeneity; sublingual: risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 0.98; one trial, 661 women) and blood transfusion (oral: RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.94; four trials, 3519 women).\n\n【15】Compared with conventional injectable uterotonics, oral misoprostol was associated with higher risk of severe PPH (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.52; 17 trials, 29,797 women) and use of additional uterotonics, but with a trend to fewer blood transfusions (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06; 15 trials; 28,213 women). Additional uterotonic data were not totalled due to heterogeneity. Misoprostol use is associated with significant increases in shivering and a temperature of 38º Celsius compared with both placebo and other uterotonics.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Oral or sublingual misoprostol shows promising results when compared with placebo in reducing blood loss after delivery. The margin of benefit may be affected by whether other components of the management of the third stage of labour are used or not. As side‐effects are dose‐related, research should be directed towards establishing the lowest effective dose for routine use, and the optimal route of administration.\n\n【18】Neither intramuscular prostaglandins nor misoprostol are preferable to conventional injectable uterotonics as part of the management of the third stage of labour especially for low‐risk women; however, evidence has been building for the use of oral misoprostol to be effective and safe in areas with low access to facilities and skilled healthcare providers and future research on misoprostol use in the community should focus on implementation issues.\n\n【19】PICOs\n-----\n\n【20】### PICOs\n\n【21】###### Population (5)\n\n【22】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Postpartum\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【23】###### Intervention (6)\n\n【24】*   Intramuscular\n*   Prostaglandins\n*   Rectal\n*   Oral\n*   Sublingual\n*   Misoprostol\n\n【25】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【26】*   Prostaglandins\n*   Placebo\n*   Other Uterotonics\n\n【27】###### Outcome (1)\n\n【28】*   Postpartum Hemorrhage\n\n【29】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Oral or sublingual misoprostol may be used where no injectable uterotonic is available.\n\n【36】After her baby is born, the woman's womb (uterus) contracts and bleeding decreases. If the womb does not contract, postpartum haemorrhage (heavy bleeding) can occur, which can be life threatening. A prostaglandin, oxytocin and ergometrine are all drugs that cause contractions of the womb (uterotonics). This review of 72 randomised controlled trials, involving 52,678 women, found that oral or sublingual prostaglandin (misoprostol) is effective in reducing severe haemorrhage after giving birth and the need for blood transfusions. Misoprostol is not as effective as oxytocin and has more side‐effects. The main side‐effects are shivering, high temperature and diarrhoea, occurring in a significant proportion of women. Twenty‐six of the trials included centres in low‐ and middle‐income countries only. Misoprostol may be useful in places where injectable uterotonics are not available, perhaps because of poor access to skilled healthcare providers. Injectable prostaglandin may be effective in reducing blood loss but has adverse effects of vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea and costs more.\n\n【37】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【38】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "63c57d5a-53e6-484a-a285-47ebaf34a59c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To establish the risks and benefits of taking any antipsychotic drug during pregnancy, compared with not taking such medication or with receiving alternative therapy (such as electroconvulsive therapy).\n\n【3】To establish the risks and benefits of different classes of antipsychotic drugs (i.e. 'atypical' versus 'typical' types, depot versus oral medication).\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】Around 2% of women aged 16‐44 years ( McCormick 1995 ) suffer from a non‐affective psychotic illness and it has been estimated that more than half of these women give birth ( McGrath 1999 , Howard 2002 ). Currently, however, there is very little evidence regarding the use of antipsychotics for non‐affective psychosis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Weighing the risks and benefits of treating mothers with antipsychotics requires assessment of clinical effectiveness versus the risks of toxicity to mother, foetus and neonate. This must be compared with: i. the risks to mother, foetus, neonate, infant and child of medically untreated psychosis ( Altshuler 1996 ); ii. the risks and benefits of using alternative therapies, for example, cognitive behavioural therapy or electro‐convulsive therapy. It is widely agreed that no treatment option is free of risk ( Pinkofsky 2002 ). Despite this lack of evidence it is likely that most women with schizophrenia‐like illnesses are treated with antipsychotics throughout pregnancy ( Craig 2001 ).  \n  \nThere are multiple potential risks of toxicity from exposure to antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy and the period after delivery. These include obstetric complications, birth defects, neurobehavioural and neonatal adverse effects ( Pinkofsky 2002 ). The decision to withhold medication, however, may result in exacerbation of existing symptoms, relapse, and increased risk of deliberate self‐harm or suicide.There is also some evidence to suggest that untreated psychiatric disorder may potentially affect fetoplacental integrity and foetal central nervous system development ( Cohen 1998 ). Poor clinical outcomes for mothers may in turn result in poorer mother‐infant interaction and deficits in infant / child development.  \n  \nThe gap in the evidence base is partly attributable to ethical and methodological problems. To date ethical issues have restricted the use of randomisation in pregnancy ( Austin 1998 ), and the study of longer‐term neurobehavioural and developmental outcomes is problematic ( Ward 2002 ). This lack of evidence raises questions regarding appropriate management and treatment of an already vulnerable group of women and children.\n\n【7】Objectives\n----------\n\n【8】To establish the risks and benefits of taking any antipsychotic drug during pregnancy, compared with not taking such medication or with receiving alternative therapy (such as electroconvulsive therapy).\n\n【9】To establish the risks and benefits of different classes of antipsychotic drugs (i.e. 'atypical' versus 'typical' types, depot versus oral medication).\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【12】#### Types of studies\n\n【13】All relevant randomised controlled trials. Where a trial was described as 'double‐blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised, these trials were included in a sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes (see types of outcome measures) when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials were utilised and the results of the sensitivity analysis were described in the text. Quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were excluded.\n\n【14】#### Types of participants\n\n【15】Women during pregnancy and / or the postpartum period, with a newly or previously diagnosed (using any criteria) non‐affective psychotic disorder.\n\n【16】A 'non‐affective psychotic disorder' was defined as a specific diagnosis of schizophrenia or as a variants of this such as a 'schizotypal', 'schizoaffective', or 'persistent delusional' disorder, however defined.\n\n【17】Studies using broad diagnostic groupings (such as 'serious / chronic mental illness', 'psychosis / psychotic illness') were included and, where possible, primary authors were contacted to establish what proportion of all participants had non‐affective types of psychosis. Data were included in the review provided that 75% or more of the participants had a non‐affective psychotic disorder. Bipolar disorder / manic depression, depressive illnesses and problems primarily associated with alcohol & substance misuse were excluded.\n\n【18】We defined 'postpartum period' in the standard way, i.e. six‐weeks post delivery, or accepted the definition as given in the primary studies.\n\n【19】#### Types of interventions\n\n【20】Any antipsychotic drug listed in Martindale's Extra Pharmacopoeia ( Martindale 1996 ) was included. The interventions were categorised as follows:\n\n【21】1\\. Any antipsychotic drug: any dose or means of administration.\n\n【22】2\\. Atypical antipsychotic drugs: amisulpiride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, sulpiride, thioridazine, ziprasidone, zotepine\n\n【23】3\\. Typical antipsychotic drugs: benperidol, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, droperidol, flupenthixol, fluphenazine hypdrochloride, haloperidol, loxapine, methotrimeprazine, oxypertine, pericyazine, perphenazine, pimozide, prochlorperazine, promazine hydrochloride, trifluoperazine, zuclopenthixol acetate and dihydrochloride\n\n【24】4\\. Depot antipsychotic drugs: flupenthixol decanoate, fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, pipothiazine palmitate, risperidone (depot), zuclopenthixol decanoate\n\n【25】5\\. Oral antipsychotic drugs.\n\n【26】6\\. Routine / standard psychosocial care delivered by primary care / community mental health teams (i.e. not a discrete named package of care)\n\n【27】7\\. Discrete named package of care such as family intervention or cognitive behavioural therapy\n\n【28】8\\. Electro‐convulsive therapy\n\n【29】All possible combinations from the above list were assessed, including any antipsychotic drug versus any other antipsychotic drug.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】1\\.

For the infant (28 days to 1 years) / Child (>1 year)\n\n【51】4.1 Death  \n4.1.1 incidence of infant death (unnatural versus natural causes)\n\n【52】4.2 Developmental  \n4.2.1 clinically significant deficit in development, in relation to mother‐infant interaction, cognitive development, emotional & social adjustment, attachment security, and infant / child behaviour ( Murray 1997 , Murray 1999 ) (as defined by each primary study)  \n4.2.2 average score / change in development, in relation to mother‐infant interaction, cognitive development, emotional & social adjustment, attachment security, and infant / child behaviour  \n4.2.3 clinically significant deficit in IQ at age 4 years  \n4.2.4 average score in IQ at age 4 years\n\n【53】All infant / child outcomes were classified as: short‐term (up to 12 weeks), medium‐term (13 to 26 weeks) and long‐term (over 26 weeks). For the developmental outcomes only, further classification was made as follows: 26‐52 weeks, 1‐2 years, 2‐4 years.\n\n【54】\\* Primary outcomes\n\n【55】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【56】1\\. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2003) was searched using the phrase:\n\n【57】\\[\\* puerperal\\* or \\*pregna\\* or \\* postpartum\\* or \\*post‐partum\\* or \\*baby‐blues\\* or (\\* baby\\* and \\*blues\\*) or (post AND partum) in title, abstract, index terms of REFERENCE\\] or \\[Puerperal Psychosis or pregnancy \\* in health care conditions of STUDY\\]\n\n【58】2\\. Reference searching  \nThe references of all identified studies were also inspected for more studies.\n\n【59】3\\. Personal contact  \nThe first author of each included study was contacted for information regarding unpublished trials and extra data on the published trials.\n\n【60】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【61】1\\. Selection of studies  \nTwo reviewers (RW, KA) independently inspected all citations of studies identified by the search, with cases of disagreement resolved by discussion. In the event of a failure to reach complete agreement, the full article was acquired for further inspection, with the decision regarding inclusion again based on consent among the three reviewers. If no decision was reached on the basis of published information, primary authors were contacted to seek clarification.\n\n【62】2\\. Quality assessment  \nTwo sets of criteria, the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook ( Clark 2002 ) and the Jadad Scale ( Jadad 1996 ) were used to assess the quality of selected studies. The first set is based on evidence of a strong association between poor concealment of allocation schedule and overestimation of effect sizes ( Schulz 1995 ), and is defined as follows:\n\n【63】a. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment)  \nb. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results)  \nc. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment)\n\n【64】The Jadad Scale measures a wider range of factors that impact on the quality of a trial, and includes the following items:\n\n【65】1\\. Was the study described as 'randomised'?  \n2\\. Was the study described as 'double‐blind'?  \n3\\. Was there a description of loss to follow‐up?\n\n【66】Each item scores one point if the answer is positive, and for the first two items only an additional point is given if the randomisation / blinding procedures are described. Thus scores on items 1 and 2 can be 0, 1 or 2; scores for item 3 can be 0 or 1.\n\n【67】For the purposes of this review, trials were included if they met either criteria A or B as described in the Cochrane Reviewers Handbook. The Jadad scale was not used for inclusion/exclusion purposes, but was instead used in sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity of results according to study quality.\n\n【68】3\\. Data extraction  \nTwo reviewers (RW, KA) independently extracted data from included trials, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. In the event of any disagreement persisting, the authors of the primary study were contacted to seek clarification. Full documentation was made of all decisions regarding study selection, quality assessment or data extraction.\n\n【69】4\\. Data syntheses / analyses\n\n【70】4.1 Attrition rates  \nFor all outcomes other than 'leaving the study early', a loss to follow‐up rate of up to 50% for short/medium term outcomes, and 60% or less for long‐term outcomes, was deemed acceptable. Above these rates data were not included.\n\n【71】4.2 Intention‐to‐treat (ITT)  \nAll review analyses were by performed by ITT unless stated otherwise. Provided that at least 50% of people in short/medium‐term and 40% in long‐term studies completed the trial, all people allocated to intervention were counted, whether or not they completed follow‐up, assuming no change in outcome status for dropouts. Data were excluded from studies where the attrition rate was higher than the accepted level, apart from the outcome of 'leaving the study early'. In the assessment of other outcomes, people leaving early were considered to have had the negative outcome, except for the event of death. The impact of including studies with high attrition rates (25‐50/60%) was analysed in a sensitivity analysis. If inclusion of data from this latter group did result in a substantive change in the estimate of effect their data were not added to trials with less attrition, but presented separately.\n\n【72】4.3 Data types  \nOutcomes were assessed using continuous (e.g. average changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (e.g. categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little', 'moderate', or 'much' change), or dichotomous measures (e.g. 'no important' versus 'important' changes in an individual's behaviour). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data and so these were presented only in the text of the review.\n\n【73】4.3.1 Dichotomous/binary data  \n4.3.1.2 Cut‐offs: where possible attempts were made to dichotomise outcome data, by identifying meaningful cut‐offs on rating scales (e.g. 'clinically improved' versus 'not clinically improved'). Cut‐offs for clinical effectiveness that were pre‐designated by authors of primary studies were used where available.\n\n【74】4.3.1.3 Measure of effect: Relative Risks (RR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were used as the key summary statistic of effect size for binary outcomes (in preference to Odds Ratios ‐ ORs). The RR has been shown to be more intuitive than the OR ( Boissel 1999 ), with the OR frequently interpreted by clinicians as an RR, resulting in overestimation of perceived effect sizes ( Deeks 2000 ). Where possible, the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated using an online calculator (http://www.nntonline.net).\n\n【75】4.3.2 Continuous data  \n4.3.2.1 Rating scales: a wide range of rating scales is used for measuring mental health outcomes, although the quality of a proportion of these is questionable. Therefore as a minimum standard, outcomes were included in the analyses only if both reliability (i.e. is the instrument consistent within and between observers?) and validity (i.e. does the instrument measure what it purports to measure?) have been indicated through publication in a peer‐reviewed journal. The other minimum standards set were: the rating scale was either i. a self report; or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (but not the therapist). If the rater was also the therapist, the study was tagged as being 'prone to bias' and was subjected to sensitivity analyses. Where possible, direct comparisons were made between trials that used the same scale to assess specific outcomes. Where continuous data were presented for different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented and the general direction of effect inspected.  \n  \n4.3.2.2 Distributions: continuous outcome data for trials in the mental health field are commonly non‐normally distributed. To avoid inappropriate application of parametric methods to non‐parametric data, the following standards were applied prior to analysis:  \ni. standard deviations (SDs) and means were reported (or were derivable) from the published data, or were obtainable from the authors; ii. double the SD (2SD) is smaller than the mean (if mean is larger than 2SD, it is unlikely to be a good measure of the centre of the distribution ‐ Altman 1996 ). If a scale starts from a positive value, e.g. PANSS, which has possible values from 30 to 210, the calculation outlined in ii. was adjusted for scale starting point ‐ i.e. a skewed distribution is indicated if 2SD>(S‐Smin), where S is the mean score and Smin is the minimum score. Trial data not meeting standards i. and ii. were not entered into RevMan for analysis, but were reported in the text of the results section.\n\n【76】4.3.2.3 Intention‐to‐treat analysis: for continuous outcomes this optimal analytical approach is not generally possible, and therefore analyses will be restricted only to those people who completed the study (i.e. completer‐only analyses).\n\n【77】4.3.2.4 Endpoint versus change data: where possible endpoint data were presented and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes then only the former were reported in this review.\n\n【78】4.3.2.5 Summary statistic: for all continuous outcomes, a weighted mean difference (WMD) between treatment groups was calculated as the key summary statistic.\n\n【79】4.4 Statistical modelling technique  \nRandom effects models, which take account of differences between studies, were fitted regardless of the result of the chi 2 test for heterogeneity (although analyses using fixed effects models were also undertaken for comparative purposes).\n\n【80】4.5 Studies deploying cluster randomisation  \nStudies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems: Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error ( Divine 1992 ) ‐ whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated ‐ causing type I errors ( Bland 2000 , Gulliford 1999 ). Where data were presented corrected by a design effect (see below) data were pooled with non‐cluster studies.\n\n【81】Where data are reported as if from a non‐cluster randomised study, and the analyses were based on the numbers of individuals, with no account taken of the clustering effect, the reviewers sought statistical advice from the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK. Dr Julian Higgins advised that the binary data as presented in the report should be divided by a 'design effect' and that this should be calculated using the mean number of families in the groups (m) and the intraclass correlation co‐efficient (ICC) \\[Design effect = 1+(m‐1)\\*ICC\\]. If authors of the study did not or were unable to supply ICC we assumed this to be 0.1 ( Ukoumunne 1999 ).\n\n【82】Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented continuous data in a table, with an (\\*) symbol ‐ to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. Subsequent versions of this review will seek to contact first authors of studies to seek intra‐class correlation co‐efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods ( Gulliford 1999 ).\n\n【83】4.6 Sensitivity analyses  \nThese were used to address the following issues: attrition rates (i.e. intention‐to‐treat versus completer‐only analysis for dichotomous outcomes), rater and therapist are same person, probable unit‐of‐analysis error, and overall study quality. For example, where a trial was described as 'double‐blind' but it was implied that the study was randomised, these trials were subject to sensitivity analysis. If there was no substantive difference within primary outcomes when these 'implied randomisation' studies were added, then they were included in the final analysis. If there was a substantive difference, only clearly randomised trials were utilised and the results of the sensitivity analysis described in the text.\n\n【84】4.7 Heterogeneity  \nThis was assessed informally by visual inspection of tables and graphical presentations and by formal statistical testing by chi 2 tests for heterogeneity (using p<0.1 as a cut‐off for a positive result). Having carried out this assessment, the individual trials that accounted for the heterogeneity were identified. Possible reasons for the heterogeneity are explored in detail in the 'Discussion' section.\n\n【85】4.8 Investigating possible publication bias  \nData from all identified and selected trials were entered into a funnel graph (i.e. trial effect size versus trial sample size) in an attempt to assess the likelihood of overt publication bias. A formal test of funnel plot asymmetry (indicating potential publication bias) was undertaken (using p<0.1 as a cut‐off for a positive result). In the event of only a small number of studies being selected, or there being little variation in sample size, formal statistical testing was not undertaken.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The WHO state this will improve nutritional status, haemoglobin, and cognition and thus will improve health, intellect, and school attendance. Consequently, it is claimed that school performance will improve, child mortality will decline, and economic productivity will increase. Given the important health and societal benefits attributed to this intervention, we sought to determine whether they are based on reliable evidence.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To summarize the effects of giving deworming drugs to children to treat soil‐transmitted intestinal worms (nematode geohelminths) on weight, haemoglobin, and cognition; and the evidence of impact on physical well being, school attendance, school performance, and mortality.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】In February 2012, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, _m_ RCT, and reference lists, and registers of ongoing and completed trials.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing deworming drugs for geohelminth worms with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, haemoglobin, and formal test of intellectual development. In cluster‐RCTs treating communities or schools, we also sought data on school attendance, school performance, and mortality. We included trials that included health education with deworming.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】At least two authors independently assessed the trials, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. Continuous data were analysed using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We used GRADE to assess evidence quality, and this is reflected in the wording we used: high quality (\"deworming improves....\"); moderate quality (\"deworming probably improves...\"); low quality (\"deworming may improve....\"); and very low quality (\"we don't know if deworming improves....\").\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We identified 42 trials, including eight cluster trials, that met the inclusion criteria. Excluding one trial where data are awaited, the 41 trials include 65,168 participants.\n\n【15】For programmes that treat only children detected as infected (by screening), a single dose of deworming drugs probably increased weight (0.58 kg, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76, three trials, 139 participants; moderate quality evidence) and may have increased haemoglobin (0.37 g/dL, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.64, two trials, 108 participants; low quality evidence), but we do not know if there is an effect on cognitive functioning (two trials, very low quality evidence).\n\n【16】For a single dose of deworming drugs given to all children in endemic areas, there were mixed effects on weight, with no effects evident in seven trials, but large effects in two. Overall our analysis indicated that we are uncertain whether there was an effect on weight (nine trials, 3058 participants; very low quality evidence). For haemoglobin, deworming made little or no difference (0.02 g/dL, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.09, four trials, 1992 participants; low quality evidence), and we don't know if it improves cognition (one trial, very low quality evidence).\n\n【17】For multiple doses of deworming drugs with follow up for up to one year given to all children in endemic areas, we are uncertain if there is an effect on weight (0.06 kg, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.30; seven trials, 2460 participants; very low quality evidence); cognition (three trials, very low quality evidence); or school attendance (4% higher attendance; 95% CI ‐6 to 14; two trials, 75 clusters and 143 individually randomized participants, very low quality evidence). For haemoglobin, the intervention may have little or no effect (mean 0.01 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.14 lower to 0.13 higher; four trials, 807 participants; low quality evidence).\n\n【18】For multiple doses of deworming drugs with follow up beyond one year given to all children in endemic areas there were five trials with weight measures. One cluster‐RCT of 3712 children in a low prevalence area showed a large effect (average gain of 0.98kg), whilst the other four trials did not show an effect, including a cluster‐RCT of 27,995 children in a moderate prevalence area. Overall, we are uncertain if there is an effect for weight (five trials, 302 clusters and 1045 individually randomized participants; very low quality evidence). For other outcomes, we are uncertain whether deworming affects height (‐0.26 cm; 95%CI ‐0.84 to 0.31, three trials, 1219 participants); haemoglobin (0.02 g/dL, 95%CI 0.3 to 0.27, two trials, 1365 participants); cognition (two trials), or school attendance (mean attendance 5% higher, 95% CI ‐0.5 to 10.5, one trial, 50 clusters).\n\n【19】Stratified analysis to seek subgroup effects into low, medium and high helminth endemicity areas did not demonstrate any pattern of effect. We did not detect any significant effects for any primary outcomes in a sensitivity analysis only including trials with adequate allocation concealment.\n\n【20】One million children were randomized in a deworming trial from India with mortality as the primary outcome. This was completed in 2005 but the authors have not published the results.\n\n【21】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【22】Screening children for intestinal helminths and then treating infected children appears promising, but the evidence base is small. Routine deworming drugs given to school children has been more extensively investigated, and has not shown benefit on weight in most studies, except for substantial weight changes in three trials conducted 15 years ago or more. Two of these trials were carried out in the same high prevalence setting. For haemoglobin, community deworming seems to have little or no effect, and the evidence in relation to cognition, school attendance, and school performance is generally poor, with no obvious or consistent effect. Our interpretation of this data is that it is probably misleading to justify contemporary deworming programmes based on evidence of consistent benefit on nutrition, haemoglobin, school attendance or school performance as there is simply insufficient reliable information to know whether this is so.\n\n【23】PICOs\n-----\n\n【24】### PICOs\n\n【25】###### Population (5)\n\n【26】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【27】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【28】*   Deworming\n\n【29】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【30】*   Placebo\n\n【31】###### Outcome (8)\n\n【32】*   Cognitive function\n*   General well-being\n*   Assessment Of Performance At School\n*   Body weight\n*   Death\n*   Height and growth measurements\n*   School Attendance\n*   Hemoglobin concentration\n\n【33】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Infections are common in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in children from low income areas where there is inadequate sanitation, overcrowding, low levels of education, and lack of access to health care. These infections sometimes cause malnutrition, poor growth, and anaemia in children, and some experts believe they cause poor performance at school. While improved sanitation and hygiene are likely to be helpful, drugs can also be used. In one approach, individuals found to be infected on screening are treated. Evidence from these trials suggests this probably improves weight and may improve haemoglobin values, but the evidence base is small. In another approach, currently recommended by the WHO, and much more extensively investigated, all school children are treated. In trials that follow up children after a single dose of deworming, and after multiple doses with follow up for over a year, we do not know if these programmes have an effect on nutritional indicators such as weight and height; on cognitive functioning, school attendance, or school performance; they may not have an effect on haemoglobin. One trial of a million children examined death and was completed in 2005 but the authors have not yet published the results.\n\n【40】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【41】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The intervention was individual face‐to‐face patient education while control individuals received usual care, routine treatment or group education. Only studies that assessed outcome measures at least six months from baseline were included.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Information was extracted by two reviewers who summarized both study characteristics and outcome statistics. A meta‐analysis using a fixed‐effect model was performed if there were adequate studies with a specified outcome of sufficient homogeneity. For outcomes where there were too few studies or the assessment measurements were not standardized or variable, the results were summarised qualitatively.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Nine studies involving 1359 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six studies compared individual education to usual care and three compared individual education to group education (361 participants). There were no long‐term studies and overall the quality of the studies was not high. In the six studies comparing individual face‐to‐face education to usual care, individual education did not significantly improve glycaemic control (weighted mean difference (WMD) in HbA1c ‐0.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.3 to 0.1, P = 0.33) over a 12 to 18 month period. However, there did appear to be a significant benefit of individual education on glycaemic control in a subgroup analysis of three studies involving participants with a higher mean baseline HbA1c greater than 8% (WMD ‐0.3% (95% CI ‐0.5 to ‐0.1, P = 0.007). In the two studies comparing individual to group education, there was no significant difference in glycaemic control between individual or group education at 12 to 18 months with a WMD in HbA1c of 0.03% (95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.1, P = 0.22). There was no significant difference in the impact of individual versus usual care or group education on body mass index systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There were too few studies to perform a meta‐analysis on the effect of individual education on dietary self management, diabetes knowledge, psychosocial outcomes and smoking habits. No data were available on the other main outcome measures of diabetes complications or health service utilization and cost analysis in these studies.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】This systematic review suggests a benefit of individual education on glycaemic control when compared with usual care in a subgroup of those with a baseline HbA1c greater than 8%. However, overall there did not appear to be a significant difference between individual education and usual care. In the small number of studies comparing group and individual education, there was an equal impact on HbA1c at 12 to 18 months. Additional studies are needed to delineate these findings further.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (6)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Patient Education\n\n【23】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【24】*   Usual Care\n\n【25】###### Outcome (3)\n\n【26】*   HbA1c level\n*   Diabetic Complication\n*   Health Care Utilization\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There were no long‐term studies and overall the quality of the studies was not high. Individual face‐to‐face patient education for type 2 diabetes over a six to twelve month period did not significantly improve glycaemic control, body mass index (BMI ‐ measure of overweight; body weight in kilogram divided through squared height in meters, kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), blood pressure or total cholesterol in the short or medium term compared with usual care. However, there did appear to be a significant benefit of individual education on glycaemic control in a subgroup analysis of studies involving participants with a higher baseline HbA1c greater than 8% (that is, too high blood sugar levels over a couple of months or inadequate 'metabolic control').

All trials compared oral betamimetics to placebo. Betamimetics reduced the incidence of preterm labour (one trial, 50 twin pregnancies, relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.86). However, betamimetics did not reduce preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation (four trials, 276 twin pregnancies, RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10) or less than 34 weeks' gestation (one trial, 144 twin pregnancies, RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.50). Mean neonatal birthweight in the betamimetic group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (three trials, 478 neonates, weighted mean difference 111.2 grams; 95% CI 22.2 to 200.2). Nevertheless, there was no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reduction of low birthweight (two trials, 366 neonates, RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.85) or small‐for‐gestational age neonates (two trials, 178 neonates, RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.65). Two trials (388 neonates) showed that betamimetics significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome but the difference was not significant when the analysis was adjusted for correlation of babies from twins. Three trials (452 neonates) showed no evidence of an effect of betamimetics in reducing neonatal mortality (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.82).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of prophylactic oral betamimetics for preventing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy.\n\n【17】\\[Note: the two citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.\\]\n\n【18】PICOs\n-----\n\n【19】### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Population (5)\n\n【21】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Twin Pregnancy\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【22】###### Intervention (3)\n\n【23】*   Prophylaxis\n*   Oral\n*   Beta-adrenoceptor agonist\n\n【24】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【25】*   Placebo\n*   Usual Care\n\n【26】###### Outcome (3)\n\n【27】*   Premature Delivery\n*   Preterm Spontaneous Labor With Preterm Delivery\n*   Premature Rupture Of Membranes\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Risk of bias was assessed and disagreements between review authors were discussed and another review author involved where necessary.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Seventeen trials were eligible for inclusion into the review. Psychosocial interventions improved long‐term pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.50 to ‐0.18) and depression (SMD ‐0.35, 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.16). However, the risk of bias was high for almost all studies. A subgroup analysis revealed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) either alone or in combination with biofeedback improved long‐term pain intensity, activity interference and depression. However the studies pooled had high risk of bias and were few in number. The pooled trials were all related to temporomandibular disorder (TMD).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There is weak evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions for chronic orofacial pain. Although significant effects were observed for outcome measures where pooling was possible, the studies were few in number and had high risk of bias. However, given the non‐invasive nature of such interventions they should be used in preference to other invasive and irreversible treatments which also have limited or no efficacy. Further high quality trials are needed to explore the effects of psychosocial interventions on chronic orofacial pain.\n\n【17】Plain language summary\n----------------------\n\n【18】available in\n\n【19】*   English\n*   Français\n\n【20】### Psychosocial interventions for the management of chronic orofacial pain\n\n【21】Studies indicate that psychological factors are associated with chronic pain in the face, mouth or jaws. However, current management, particularly in dentistry, does not target these factors. This review therefore explored whether behavioural interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), biofeedback and posture regulation compared with usual care could improve outcomes for patients with chronic orofacial pain. We found that such interventions improved long‐term pain intensity, pain interference with daily life activities and depression. However, the quality of the studies was poor and there were few studies from which we could combine results. We therefore recommend further high quality trials are needed to support the use of such interventions for chronic orofacial pain.\n\n【22】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【23】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We handsearched palliative care journals indexed by ISI Web of Science for online first references.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of home‐based end‐of‐life care with inpatient hospital or hospice care for people aged 18 years and older.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. When appropriate, we combined published data for dichotomous outcomes using a fixed‐effect Mantel‐Haenszel meta‐analysis to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When combining outcome data was not possible, we reported the results from individual studies.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included four randomised trials and found no new studies from the search in March 2020. Home‐based end‐of‐life care increased the likelihood of dying at home compared with usual care (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.52; 2 trials, 539 participants; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 25%; high‐certainty evidence). Admission to hospital varied among the trials (range of RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79, to RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.50 to 4.55). The effect on patient outcomes and control of symptoms was uncertain. Home‐based end‐of‐life care may slightly improve patient satisfaction at one‐month follow‐up, with little or no difference at six‐month follow‐up (2 trials; low‐certainty evidence). The effect on caregivers (2 trials; very low‐certainty evidence), staff (1 trial; very low‐certainty evidence) and health service costs was uncertain (2 trials, very low‐certainty evidence).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】The evidence included in this review supports the use of home‐based end‐of‐life care programmes for increasing the number of people who will die at home. Research that assesses the impact of home‐based end‐of‐life care on caregivers and admissions to hospital would be a useful addition to the evidence base, and might inform the delivery of these services.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (8)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Terminal Illness\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Terminal Illness - Late Stage\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (3)\n\n【22】*   Hospice Care\n*   End Of Life Care Planning\n*   Home\n\n【23】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【24】###### Outcome (4)\n\n【25】*   Costs and Cost Analysis\n*   Hospital admission\n*   Caregiver Burden Scale\n*   Place Of Death\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

This is the fifth update of the original review.\n\n【34】**Key messages**\n\n【35】People who receive end‐of‐life care at home are more likely to die at home.

We found that people receiving end‐of‐life care at home were more likely to die at home. Admission to hospital while receiving home‐based end‐of‐life care varied between trials. People who received end‐of‐life care at home may have been slightly more satisfied after one month. The impact of home‐based end‐of‐life care on caregivers, healthcare staff and health service costs was uncertain.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of heat acclimation interventions aimed at protecting health and performance from exertional heat stress.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】High ambient temperatures and relative humidities increase metabolic heat gain accompanying exercise and are associated with increased physiological strain and reduced physical work capacity ( Wendt 2007 ). Indeed, wherever excessive imbalances occur between the thermal energy stored and that dissipated to the environment, heat‐related illness can occur. Often referred to as heat injury, heat‐related illnesses describe a range of conditions that include heat rash (miliaria rubra), fluid retention, muscle cramp, fainting, heat exhaustion and heat stroke ( Bouchama 2002 ). In extreme cases, excessive rises in core temperature above 40˚C result in central nervous system dysfunction, cellular death and multiple organ failure ( Coris 2004 ; Glazer 2005 ; Sharma 2003 ). The young and elderly may be vulnerable to extreme heat events ( Kovats 2008 ), though heat illnesses associated with physical exertion are also experienced by athletes, manual labourers and military personnel, particularly when not acclimatised ( Bouchama 2002 ).\n\n【7】The health and financial effects of heat‐related illness on everyday life as well as occupational and sports settings are rising, as the increased intensity, duration and frequency of heat wave conditions associated with global climate change take effect ( Huang 2011 ; Luber 2008 ). Chinese data highlight a 4.5% increase in hospital admission rates with every 1˚C increase in mean daily temperature above 29˚C ( Chan 2013 ), with similar trends reported in Australia ( Bi 2011 ) and the United States of America (USA) ( Green 2010 ). Compounding this elevated burden on the healthcare sector, modelling by Dunne 2013 indicates heat stress to have impaired global labour capacity by up to 10% in recent decades, with this likely to double in peak summer by 2020. The economic consequences of this reduced work are marked, with estimated net costs of USD 2.4 trillion by 2030 attributed to heat‐related reductions in work productivity alone ( DARA 2012 ).\n\n【8】Although the risk of exertional heat illness may be reduced by using air conditioning, scheduling physical activity in the coolest time of the day and maintaining adequate hydration ( Gupta 2012 ; Michelozzi 2014 ), accustomed exposure to hot weather is not always possible. For example, variability in extreme weather patterns (i.e. El Niño and La Niña) ( McGeehin 2001 ), inter‐seasonal travel ( Hanna 2011 ), geographic location ( Grundstein 2015 ), and the need for protective equipment in occupational, military, and sporting contexts ( Cheung 2000 ; Holmér 2006 ; Montain 1994 ) each unavoidably increase thermal strain.\n\n【9】Heat acclimation is regarded as the most effective means of protecting health against thermal strain. It involves a series of (natural or artificial) exposures to hot conditions in order to invoke physiological adaptations that optimise heat loss mechanisms ( Taylor 2006 ). Importantly, enhanced thermoregulatory efficiency achieved through acclimation may maintain work rate in hot conditions ( Chalmers 2014 ; Lorenzo 2010 ) and is included in health and safety recommendations for various sports, occupational and military populations ( CA DoOSH 2015 ; Racinais 2015 ; US Army 2003 ).\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Heat acclimation involves a series of adaptations that reduce physiological strain in hot conditions by optimising avenues for heat loss. The treatment requires repeated exposures to an elevated body temperature that can be achieved using passive (i.e. non‐active heat absorption from the surrounding environment), active (i.e. heat production caused by greater energy metabolism during exercise), or combinations of both methods. Passive heat acclimation methods include using climate chambers, saunas, water baths and vapour barrier suits (e.g. Fox 1963 ; Scoon 2007 ; Stanley 2015 ; Zurawlew 2015 ). Exercise‐induced heat acclimation may be achieved using constant work‐rate (fixed duration or controlled hyperthermia) or self‐paced exercise protocols that are usually undertaken in environmental conditions that are hot or humid or both (e.g. Armstrong 1986 ; Garrett 2009 ; Gibson 2015 ; Houmard 1990 ).Typically, these exposures are administered for 30 to 120 minutes and are repeated across multiple days. Accepted definitions of heat acclimation processes are: up to seven exposures (short‐term heat acclimation), eight to 14 exposures (medium‐term heat acclimation), and 15 or more exposures (long‐term heat acclimation) ( Chalmers 2014 ; Garrett 2011 ). Adaptations to heat exposure is never permanent. According to Givoni 1973 , heat adaptation is lost every day spent without heat exposure at a rate that is twice as fast as the rate with which the heat adaptation was initially gained.\n\n【12】Recommendations for athletes to follow heat acclimation protocols have become increasingly common as a means to protect both health and physical performance during major competitions in hot environments ( Chalmers 2014 ; Guy 2015 ; Racinais 2015 ). Occupational safety and health concerns regarding heat‐related illness in industry (e.g. military, agriculture, construction, landscaping, oil and gas extraction, and transport) have also led to state‐legislated standards that emphasise acclimation (or acclimatization) awareness in the USA ( CA DoOSH 2015 ; Washington State Legislature 2012 ). However, even in the South African mining industry, where evidence for the use of heat acclimation interventions is long standing ( Wyndham 1969 ), consensus on evidence‐based best practice remains elusive. Regardless, to optimise the heat acclimation response, all variables (e.g. environmental temperature and humidity, exercise mode, exercise intensity, exposure duration and number of exposures) should be considered within the logistical and economic constraints of the setting.\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】Humans regulate core temperature through changes in autonomic (e.g. sweating and shivering) and behavioural (e.g. work rate) thermo‐effector responses ( Cabanac 1977 ; Hartley 2012 ; Schlader 2009 ). During physical exertion in hot conditions, heat is gained through both endogenous (i.e. increased metabolism required to complete work) and exogenous sources (i.e. transferred from the surrounding environment) ( Wendt 2007 ). The maintenance of core temperature within a homeostatic range at rest (˜36.8 ± 0.5 ˚C) ( Hanna 2015 ) is mostly achieved via convection of heat to the skin surface and radiation of heat to the surrounding environment ( Sawka 1996 ). However, once core temperature meets or exceeds that of the external environment, sweating provides the main heat loss mechanism through evaporation ( Sawka 1996 ). Relative humidity, air flow and skin exposure to the external environment all influence evaporative heat loss and when compromised (e.g. when wearing personal protective equipment), exacerbates heat strain and leads to people working slower or for shorted periods of time to avoid excessive thermal injury ( Marino 2004 ; Tatterson 2000 ; Tucker 2006 ).\n\n【15】Notably, repeated exposures to an increased core temperature achieved via exercise, environmental means, or both, induce physiological adaptations associated with greater thermal tolerance ( Armstrong 1991 ; Garrett 2011 ; Taylor 2006 ). Acclimation to a hot environment evokes a complex multi‐system response that results in improved rates of heat loss that are associated with cardiovascular, endocrine and nervous system changes ( Francesconi 1996 ). The classic signs of heat acclimation include a lowered heart rate, cooler body temperature (core and skin), and earlier and larger sweat responses to exercise in hot conditions ( Sawka 1996 ). These adaptations may be associated with plasma volume expansion stimulated by repeated heat exposures ( Nielsen 1993 ; Patterson 2004 ; Senay 1976 ), which are attained via altered kidney function that maintains body water and electrolyte concentrations ( Francesconi 1996 ). This allows for the maintenance of skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise ( Chalmers 2014 ) and evaporative cooling by sweating ( Libert 1983 ; Nadel 1974 ), while reducing the risk of dehydration.\n\n【16】The physiological adaptations experienced during heat acclimation markedly enhance thermal comfort ( Daanen 2011 ; Petersen 2010 ; Sunderland 2008 ) and lower ratings of perceived exertion in hot conditions ( Armstrong 1991 ; Castle 2011 ; Pandolf 1977 ). This is key as the combination of both lowered physiological and perceptual demands allow for longer tolerance times and more work to be completed in the heat ( Chalmers 2014 ; Lorenzo 2010 ). However, physiological adaptations are variable depending on acclimation mode, duration and frequency, and individual responses will impact subsequent thermal tolerance and physical performance ( Lambert 2008 ; Racinais 2012 ; Racinais 2014 ). Moreover, it should be noted that the protective and performance benefits of heat acclimation are limited ( Hanna 2015 ), and in extreme weather, high task motivation or confidence in heat tolerance or both should not come at the expense of appropriate work‐rest schedules ( Lucas 2014 ). To guide the scope of the review, we developed a logic model ( Figure 1 ) in accordance with Anderson 2011 that outlines: 1) potential benefits and 2) adverse effects of heat acclimation interventions in alleviating exertional heat stress.\n\n【17】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【18】Figure 1\n\n【19】* * *\n\n【20】* * *\n\n【21】Logic model describing the potential benefits and adverse effects of heat acclimation\n\n【22】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【23】Exertional heat illness is a major concern amongst applied practitioners ( Casa 2015 ) and its rising incidence rate in physically active populations is likely to be exacerbated as global warming continues ( Brocherie 2015 ; Lucas 2014 ; Mueller 2012 ). Considering the health concerns and the associated costs to industry and government, it is important that there are evidence‐based guidelines to best inform heat acclimation procedures ( Taylor 2006 ). The effects of heat stress on active paediatric and adolescent populations have been given a lot of attention ( Bergeron 2011 ; Casa 2009 ; Marshall 2010 ). However, there are no practical recommendations available that are based on empirical evidence ( Armstrong 2007 ; Bergeron 2005 ). A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of eight small studies (including six observational and two randomised controlled trials) reported short‐term heat acclimation (≤ 7 exposures) to increase aerobic performance outcomes ( Chalmers 2014 ). While Chalmers 2014 has practical implications for athletes and coaches involved in team sports, outcome measures were restricted to athletic performance only. Applications of the heat stress Standard ISO 7243 indicate greater work tolerance of a high wet bulb globe temperature (i.e. a heat stress index that incorporates temperature, humidity and radiation) following acclimation ( Parsons 2006 ), without detailing how this is achieved. Accordingly, questions remain as to the optimal dosage effects of heat acclimation, underlying mechanisms, and the potential for adverse outcomes on health and performance across all populations and contexts (e.g. occupational, military, and sports).\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effects of heat acclimation interventions aimed at protecting health and performance from exertional heat stress.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Quasi‐RCTs will be included to incorporate field‐based studies whereby true randomisation is practically difficult (e.g. when the intervention is administered to a group of workers). We will include studies reported as full‐text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data.\n\n【30】#### Types of participants\n\n【31】We will include studies conducted with adult participants (aged 18 or above), with no restrictions on gender, type or level of exercise or physical activity. We will include relevant field‐ and laboratory‐based trials in which the participants are apparently healthy. We anticipate that people who have a recent history of injury or any contraindication to heat acclimation will be excluded from the original trials.\n\n【32】#### Types of interventions\n\n【33】We will include trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of heat acclimation, defined as the process of deliberately administering repeated heat exposures to improve thermal tolerance in hot conditions. We will include all forms of heat acclimation (i.e. active and passive) in the review. No restrictions will be placed on frequency, dose, or duration of the intervention.\n\n【34】We will include studies comparing heat acclimation interventions and a control (no intervention), as well as those comparing different acute heat acclimation interventions (varying in frequency, dose and duration). We will also include studies comparing heat acclimation interventions and any other intervention aimed to prevent exercise‐ and environment‐induced heat stress, including:\n\n【35】*   Aerobic fitness training;\n    \n*   Hydration strategies (hyper‐ or hypohydration);\n    \n*   Pre‐cooling (body cooling before exercise);\n    \n*   Nutritional and pharmacological supplements;\n    \n*   Body composition alterations; and\n    \n*   Sleep hygiene.\n    \n\n【36】We will exclude trials in which the same heat acclimation protocol is used in both arms as a co‐intervention. We will also exclude interventions involving multiple strategies to optimise health and performance in hot conditions where the effects of heat acclimation cannot be differentiated from the effects of the other strategies.\n\n【37】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【38】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【39】1.  Core temperature (e.g. rectal, aural and oesophageal)\n    \n2.  Physical performance (e.g. VO <sub>2max </sub> , time trial, tolerance time, muscle strength or power)\n    \n3.  Complications or adverse health effects as reported by the individual trials (e.g. heat‐related illness or injury)\n    \n\n【40】We will exclude trials that do not report any of the primary outcomes.\n\n【41】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【42】1.  Heart rate\n    \n2.  Skin temperature\n    \n3.  Plasma volume\n    \n4.  Sweat rate\n    \n5.  Perceived exertion\n    \n6.  Thermal sensation or comfort\n    \n\n【43】###### Timing of outcome measures\n\n【44】We plan to examine the effectiveness of outcome measures on the basis of changes detected in post‐intervention measures with a control or another intervention. Where experimental designs allow, we also plan to extract data post‐intervention to examine the time course of acclimation decay. We expect that few studies will report multiple post‐intervention measures. However, of those that do, a four week follow‐up time is the typical maximal duration of studies examining acclimation decay ( Armstrong 1991 ; Weller 2007 ).\n\n【45】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【46】We will not restrict our search by language, date or publication status.\n\n【47】#### Electronic searches\n\n【48】The Cochrane Injuries Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator will search the following:\n\n【49】1.  Cochrane Injuries Group specialised register (present version);\n    \n2.  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, _The Cochrane Library_ ) (latest issue);\n    \n3.  Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R) (1946 to present);\n    \n4.  EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP) (1947 to present);\n    \n5.  PubMed (limited to non‐MEDLINE indexed publications);\n    \n6.  ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) (1970 to present);\n    \n7.  ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) (1990 to present);\n    \n8.  CINAHL Plus (EBSCO) (1937 to present);\n    \n9.  PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) http://www.pedro.org.au/ (1929 to present).\n    \n10.  Clinicaltrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov );\n    \n11.  International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ).\n    \n12.  SPORTDiscus\n    \n13.  Science Direct\n    \n\n【50】We will adapt the MEDLINE search strategy ( Appendix 1 ) as necessary for each of the other databases. The added study filter is a modified version of the Ovid MEDLINE Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials ( Lefebvre 2011 ). For EMBASE we will add the study design terms as used by the UK Cochrane Centre ( Lefebvre 2011 ).\n\n【51】#### Searching other resources\n\n【52】We will screen the reference lists of all relevant articles. We will contact the lead authors of retrieved articles (experts in the field) to identify unpublished data.\n\n【53】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【54】#### Selection of studies\n\n【55】We will conduct the selection of eligible studies in two stages. First, two review authors (GMM, JTC) will independently screen titles and abstracts of the search output, and code each study as 'include' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'exclude'. We will exclude all references that clearly do not fulfil our inclusion criteria. At the second stage, we will retrieve the full‐text study reports and two review authors (GMM, JTC) will independently screen the full‐text and identify studies which meet the inclusion criteria. We will also identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies so that we can report these in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person (MS, FB, IBS, DB or AJEB). We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA study flow diagram ( Liberati 2009 ).\n\n【56】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【57】We will use a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data, which has been piloted on at least one included study. Two review authors (GMM, JTC) will extract the following characteristics from the included studies.\n\n【58】1.  Methods: study design, duration of study, study location, study setting, withdrawals, and date of study.\n    \n2.  Participants: N, mean age or age range, gender, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.\n    \n3.  Interventions: description of intervention, comparison, duration, intensity, content of both intervention and control condition, and co‐interventions.\n    \n4.  Outcomes: description of primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and at which time points reported.\n    \n5.  Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors.\n    \n\n【59】Two review authors (GMM, JTC) will independently extract outcome data from included studies. We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving a third person (MS, FB, IBS, DB or AJEB). One review author (GMM) will transfer data into the Review Manager ( RevMan 2014 ) file. We will double‐check that data were entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the study reports. A second review author (JTC) will spot‐check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.\n\n【60】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【61】Two review authors (DNB, AJEB) will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another author (GMM). We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains.\n\n【62】1.  Random sequence generation.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment.\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel.\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment.\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting.\n    \n7.  Other bias.\n    \n\n【63】We will grade each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear risk, and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgment in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise the 'Risk of bias' judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes where necessary. Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【64】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome.\n\n【65】##### Assesment of bias in conducting the systematic review\n\n【66】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.\n\n【67】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【68】We will enter the outcome data for each study into the data tables in RevMan ( RevMan 2014 ) to calculate the treatment effects. We will use mean differences or standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes, or other types of data as reported by the study authors. If only effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals or standard errors are reported in studies, we will enter these data into RevMan using the generic inverse variance method. We will ensure that higher scores for continuous outcomes have the same meaning for the particular outcome, explain the direction to the reader and report where the directions were reversed if this was necessary. When the results cannot be entered in either way, we will describe them in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table, or enter the data into Additional tables.\n\n【69】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【70】For studies that employ a cluster‐randomised design and that report sufficient data to be included in the meta‐analysis but do not make an allowance for the design effect, we will calculate the design effect based on a fairly large assumed intra‐cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.10. We base this assumption of 0.10 being a realistic estimate by analogy on studies about implementation research ( Campbell 2001 ). We will follow the methods stated in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) for the calculations.\n\n【71】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【72】We will contact investigators or study sponsors in order to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is identified as abstract only). Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【73】If numerical outcome data are missing, such as standard deviations or correlation coefficients, and they cannot be obtained from the authors, we will calculate them from other available statistics such as P values according to the methods described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【74】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【75】We will assess the clinical homogeneity of the results of included studies based on similarity of population, intervention, outcome and follow‐up. We will consider populations as similar when they are the same professional (e.g. military and mining) or athletic group (e.g. team sports) only, or the entire population of a workplace. We will consider interventions as similar when they fall into the same category as mentioned in Types of interventions above. We will consider the measurement of rectal, aural and oesophageal temperatures as similar and term these as core temperature. We will categorise intervention durations as short‐term, medium‐term and long‐term heat acclimation as described in the Description of the intervention above. We will categorise follow‐up times directly post‐intervention (within 48 hours after the final intervention session), and acclimation decay intervals every six to seven days for up to four weeks post‐intervention as different.\n\n【76】We will use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identify substantial heterogeneity we will report it and explore possible causes by prespecified subgroup analysis. Values of I² will be interpreted as follows: 0% to 40% might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity.\n\n【77】#### Data synthesis\n\n【78】We will pool data from studies judged to be clinically homogeneous using Review Manager 5.3 software ( RevMan 2014 ). If more than one study provides usable data in any single comparison, we will perform a meta‐analysis. We will use a random‐effects model when I² is above 40%; otherwise we will use a fixed‐effect model. When I² is higher than 75% we will not pool results of studies in meta‐analysis.\n\n【79】We will narratively describe skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges.\n\n【80】Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons are combined in the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【81】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【82】Where data allow, we intend to perform the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【83】*   Gender (male versus female)\n    \n*   Physical capacity (e.g. trained versus untrained)\n    \n*   Exposure dose (e.g. short versus medium versus long exposure durations; active versus passive heat exposure)\n    \n*   Exercise type (e.g. low intensity versus high intensity exercise; isothermic versus fixed‐intensity)\n    \n\n【84】We will use the Chi² test to test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【85】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【86】If there is high risk of bias associated with some of the included trials, we will perform sensitivity analysis to determine whether the risk of bias significantly influences the effect size. We will consider trials to be at high risk of bias in sensitivity analysis if allocation concealment is rated as unclear or high risk, or if attrition is greater than 20%. We will also carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of fixed‐effect or random‐effects analyses for outcomes with statistical heterogeneity and the effects of any assumptions made, such as the value of the ICC used for cluster‐randomised trials. If any study at high risk of bias significantly influences the effect size, these studies will be excluded from the meta‐analysis but will be reported in narrative form.\n\n【87】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【88】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using all outcomes listed under Types of outcome measures . We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We will use methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) using GRADEpro software ( GRADEproGDT 2015 ). We will justify all decisions to down‐ or up‐grade the quality of studies using footnotes.\n\n【89】We will also compile an additional GRADE table showing all of our decisions about the quality of evidence and their justifications.\n\n【90】Figures and Tables -\n\n【91】Figure 1\n\n【92】Logic model describing the potential benefits and adverse effects of heat acclimation\n\n【93】Navigate to figure in Protocol Print figure Open in new tab", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "ad4e1f7f-12f9-468d-84e6-be80aa15983f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) intravesical therapy compared to mitomycin C (MMC) intravesical therapy for treating Ta and T1 bladder cancer in adults.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Urinary bladder cancer affects men and women worldwide, though it is more common in the Western world. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in men in the United States of America (USA) and in Europe, and is placed at seventh and eighth position in cancer‐related mortality, respectively in the USA ( Siegel 2013 ) and Europe ( Ferlay 2013 ). The tumour appears three to four times more frequently in men than in women ( Fajkovic 2011 ). One in 26 men will develop bladder cancer in their lifetime ( Siegel 2013 ). Overall five‐year survival rates in Europe are around 68% ( De Angelis 2014 ), but it has been noted that women present with more advanced disease and have a poorer prognosis ( Shariat 2010 ). Age, tobacco smoking, and exposure to cancerous substances have been reported as potential risk factors ( Burger 2013 ).\n\n【7】Approximately 75% of newly diagnosed cases are non‐muscle invasive bladder cancers, where the tumour affects only the mucous membrane or submucosal layer (also called superficial bladder cancers) ( Babjuk 2013 ). About 25% of people diagnosed with bladder cancer have muscle invasive disease and will have poorer prognosis even after receiving treatment. The prevalence of bladder cancer is high, as the tumour recurs frequently even after initial treatment and requires long‐term clinical monitoring. Therefore, this type of cancer is very bothersome to those affected, causes substantial morbidity and affects quality of life ( Griffiths 2013 ).\n\n【8】In economic terms, bladder cancer has the highest lifetime treatment cost per patient. Compared to all other cancers, the per‐patient expenditures range from USD 89,287 to USD 202,203 per patient from diagnosis to death ( Sievert 2009 ), because of high medical expenditures on diagnosis, treatment, and continued surveillance using invasive techniques ( Svatek 2014 ). The disease is not only very costly for the healthcare system, but also for society, because of work loss and loss of productivity.\n\n【9】Compared to other cancer sites, bladder cancer is an under‐recognised public health problem. Although bladder cancer is one of the most common diseases in both men and women, only relatively few studies have been conducted on urothelial carcinomas of the bladder ( Kunath 2013 ), and less research funds are available when compared to other cancer malignancies ( Kaplan 2014 ). National bladder cancer advocatory groups have only recently become active ( Apolo 2015 ; Lotan 2009 ).\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Although transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) can eradicate Ta and T1 bladder tumours, intravesical therapy is recommended in most people with non‐muscle invasive bladder tumours (Ta, T1 and CIS) due to the high chance of tumour recurrence or progression to muscle invasive disease ( Babjuk 2013 ). Therapy includes either immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) or chemotherapy with cytotoxics, the most commonly used being mitomycin C (MMC). Other intravesical cytotoxics include gemcitabine, epirubicin, and doxorubicin. Intravesical therapies are used to prevent cancer recurrence after primary treatment, and have shown efficacy during recent years of regular utilisation ( Abern 2013 ; Perlis 2013 ; Sylvester 2004 ). After the instillation of intravesical agents into the bladder, the solution should be retained for 1.5 to 2 hours. The patient is encouraged to move positions every 30 to 45 minutes to allow the intravesical solution to contact all parts of the bladder wall. After this time, the patient voids to remove the solution.\n\n【12】BCG is provided as a freeze‐dried powder and is diluted with saline before it is instilled into the bladder. Different strains of BCG are available. The original BCG strain was developed at the Pasteur Institute from an attenuated strain of _Mycobacterium bovis_ . Subcultures were made and sent to other parts of the world: Tice and TheraCys sub‐strains are available in the USA, while Tokyo 172 and the Danish sub‐strains are available outside the USA. There is some evidence that different strains might differ in their clinical efficacy, but this evidence is still limited ( Rentsch 2014 ; Sengiku 2013 ). Contraindications to BCG therapy are gross haematuria, traumatic catheterisation, recent bladder tumour resection (two weeks after TURB), urinary incontinence, symptomatic urinary tract infection and immunosuppression. A BCG sepsis might occur, which presents as an acute tuberculosis‐like illness. Signs and symptoms of a life‐threatening septicaemia are high‐grade fevers, hepatotoxicity, respiratory distress, chills, haemodynamic instability, and mental status changes. Local side effects might include symptoms of cystitis, haematuria, symptomatic granulomatous prostatitis, and epididymo‐orchitis.\n\n【13】MMC powder is diluted with sodium chloride and is administered through a catheter directly into the bladder. The recommended dosage depends on patient and tumour characteristics, such as age and prior cytostatic therapy. Although bladder cancer occurs mostly in older people, there are only limited data available about the use of MMC in people aged over 65 years. MMC was isolated from _Streptomyces caespitosus_ or _Streptomyces lavendulae_ in the 1950s. Trade names are Amétycine, Mitem, Urocin and Mito‐medac, as well as other diverse generic products. Contraindications to MMC use are: reduced bone marrow function; bleeding predisposition; damage to either liver, lung or kidney; general bad health; and hypersensitivity against MMC; as well as haematuria, perforation of bladder, and urinary tract infection. It is systemically absorbed to a very limited degree when administered intravesically, and systemic side effects are rare. Common side effects might include cystitis, dysuria, nocturia, pollakisuria, haematuria, local bladder wall reactions, and allergic reactions to the skin. The administration of MMC with local microwave‐induced hyperthermia or electromotive procedure to enhance the effectiveness of therapy are still experimental, with limited evidence but promising results ( Lammers 2011 ; Slater 2014 ).\n\n【14】The type of intravesical therapy depends on the patient's risk group ( Babjuk 2013 ). While for low‐risk tumours an immediate single instillation of chemotherapy is sufficient, intermediate‐risk tumours will need additional instillations of either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. BCG may be more effective in preventing tumour recurrence than TURB alone or TURB and chemotherapy, but people suffer significantly more side effects ( Malmström 2009 ; Shang 2011 ). There are still contradictory results concerning the beneficial effect of BCG over MMC on tumour progression ( Böhle 2004 ; Malmström 2009 ; Shelley 2010 ; Sylvester 2004 ).\n\n【15】### How the intervention might work\n\n【16】The mechanism of action of BCG therapy is yet not clearly understood. The therapeutic effect might be the result of an immune response against BCG surface antigens that cross‐react with bladder tumour antigens. The BCG organisms enter macrophages, where they induce the same type of histologic and immunologic reaction as found in people with tuberculosis. BCG therapy also has been shown to have a predilection for entering bladder cancer cells, where the proteins are broken down and fragments are combined with histocompatibility antigens and displayed on the cell surface. This induces a cytokine and direct cell‐to‐cell cytotoxicity response, which targets these cells for destruction. The overall response to BCG is limited if the patient is immunosuppressed. BCG induction therapy is usually given in six‐week schedules. Many different maintenance schedules are used, ranging from a total of 10 instillations given at 18‐week intervals to 27 instillations given over a 3‐year period ( Lamm 2000 ).\n\n【17】MMC is a mutagenic substance and is used as a chemotherapeutic agent. The mechanism of effect is based preliminarily on alkylation of DNA with corresponding inhibition of DNA synthesis. The degree of damage correlates with the clinical effect and is less in resistant cells than in sensitive cells. The biological half‐life time is short, about 40 to 50 minutes. A single and immediate instillation of chemotherapy is effective and reduces the recurrence rate by 12% to 13% compared to TURB alone ( Abern 2013 ; Perlis 2013 ; Sylvester 2004 ). The agent acts by destroying circulating tumour cells resulting from prior TURB, by an ablative effect on residual tumour cells at the resection site and on small remaining cancerous tissue ( Soloway 1980 ). Immediate instillation is necessary, as remaining free circulating tumour cells in the bladder are implanted and covered by extracellular matrix within a few hours ( Pode 1986 ). The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines therefore recommend the instillation of post‐operative chemotherapy within 24 hours after TURB to increase efficacy, if no contraindication is present ( Babjuk 2013 ). The prognosis factors of the patient indicate the further need for adjuvant intravesical instillations (chemotherapy or immunotherapy). There is still controversy about which patient groups might benefit the most from an immediate chemotherapy instillation ( Abern 2013 ).\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Although several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses ( Böhle 2003 ; Shelley 2010 ) have been conducted on this topic, the debate still continues as to whether MMC or BCG is more effective with less toxicity. It furthermore remains unclear what the optimal treatment dose and schedule might be, as well as the question of which people benefit most from one or the other agent.\n\n【20】A systematic review by Shelley et al. ( Shelley 2010 ) identified over 80 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 11 meta‐analyses that studied the effectiveness of different intravesical therapies in non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer. Although in their general conclusion intravesical administration of BCG was judged to be superior to chemotherapy in terms of complete response and disease‐free survival, there was no conclusive evidence to show the superiority of one agent over the other in terms of overall survival.\n\n【21】In the direct comparison of BCG versus MMC, BCG seemed to be superior to MMC in terms of preventing tumour recurrence in people with high‐risk bladder cancer and reducing the risk of tumour progression in intermediate and high‐risk tumours, but it appeared to be more toxic ( Shang 2011 ; Shelley 2010 ). There was no significant difference in disease progression and overall survival in this patient population. In intermediate‐risk groups, MMC and BCG might be equally effective in preventing cancer recurrence ( Shelley 2010 ).\n\n【22】The differences in findings among primary studies are the result of the clinical complexity of the disease: dosage, frequency and duration might vary considerably, also the time between TURB and intravesical therapy might differ, as well as patient characteristics, length of follow up, and study power. All these factors complicate and limit the value of the conclusions that can be drawn. The optimal schedule for BCG immunotherapy, in terms of number of inductions, and frequency and duration of maintenance, remains unknown.\n\n【23】The first Cochrane review dealing with this topic was published in 2003 ( Shelley 2003 ). This Cochrane review will serve to update the previous review, will include the new findings from the results of recent RCTs and will address new subgroup analyses that incorporate new developments and clinical practice in this field. The methodology will be adapted to the new standards of reporting and conducting Cochrane reviews. Therefore, this systematic review will provide the best available evidence that exists to date and will include independent 'Risk of bias' assessment and quality rating according to the GRADE methodology.\n\n【24】Objectives\n----------\n\n【25】To assess the effects of bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) intravesical therapy compared to mitomycin C (MMC) intravesical therapy for treating Ta and T1 bladder cancer in adults.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【28】#### Types of studies\n\n【29】All randomised clinical trials (RCTs), parallel‐grouped or quasi‐randomised that compare intravesical BCG with intravesical MMC therapy for non‐muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer will be included. We will not exclude studies on the basis of publication status or language of publication. Studies that include other intravesical agents but have treatment groups allowing a comparison of BCG and MMC will also be considered for inclusion, if the results are reported separately. If we identify cross‐over trials, we will consider only the first phase of RCTs with a cross‐over design (until cross‐over occurs). We will not calculate indirect effect estimates. Thus, studies that compare BCG to placebo/no intervention or MMC versus placebo/no intervention will be excluded.\n\n【30】#### Types of participants\n\n【31】This review will consider studies reporting on adults (≥ 18 years) with histologically confirmed non‐muscle invasive (Ta and T1) urothelial bladder cancer ( Sobin 2009 ). We will also consider studies including participants with carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder. If studies included also participants with muscle invasive bladder cancer, we will include data of the subset of participants with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer only. If these studies do not present data stratified for Ta/T1, the study will be excluded from this review.\n\n【32】Eligible people are those that are at intermediate or high risk of tumour recurrence and/or progression. If studies also included participants with low risk for tumour recurrence and/or progression, we will assess data of the subset of participants with intermediate and/or high risk and will report results of both subsets. We will not exclude studies that included only participants with low‐risk bladder tumours, but will report the results descriptively.\n\n【33】The risk for recurrence and progression is defined using the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines ( Babjuk 2013 ), which refer to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables ( Sylvester 2006 ):\n\n【34】*   High risk refers to any of the following four requirements: T1 tumours; high grade (HG)/G3 tumours; carcinoma in situ (CIS); multiple and recurrent and large (> 3 cm) Ta G1G2 tumours (all these conditions must be presented),\n    \n*   Intermediate‐risk tumours are defined as: all tumours between the categories of low and high risk,\n    \n*   Low risk is defined as: primary, solitary, Ta, low grade (LG)/G1, < 3 cm, no CIS.\n    \n\n【35】Following the latest clinical guideline ( Babjuk 2013 ), we will also include people at highest risk for recurrence/ progression that is defined as T1G3 tumours associated with concurrent bladder CIS and/or recurrent T1G3, T1G3 with CIS in prostatic urethra, atypical histology of urothelial carcinoma, or lymphovascular invasion.\n\n【36】#### Types of interventions\n\n【37】Single agent intravesical therapy with BCG or MMC for the prevention or treatment of Ta and T1 urothelial bladder cancer after TURB will be eligible for inclusion. BCG of any schedule or strain will be considered appropriate for inclusion, as well as any dose or schedule of MMC.\n\n【38】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【39】We will not use the measurement of the outcomes assessed in this review as an eligibility criterion.\n\n【40】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【41】The primary outcomes will be:\n\n【42】1.  Overall survival (defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death)\n    \n2.  Serious adverse events (adverse events will be considered as serious when they required hospitalisation, were life‐threatening or fatal, or were reported as serious by the authors of the original publication)\n    \n\n【43】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【44】Secondary outcomes will be:\n\n【45】1.  Recurrence‐free survival (defined as the date from randomisation to the date of diagnosis of recurrence)\n    \n2.  Progression‐free survival (defined as the date from randomisation to the date of diagnosis of progression)\n    \n3.  Adverse events (such as dysuria, alguria, haematuria, cystitis, nocturia, pollakisuria, or allergic reactions)\n    \n4.  Quality of life, as reported by the patient\n    \n\n【46】###### Main outcomes for 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【47】The 'Summary of findings' table will include the following outcomes:\n\n【48】*   overall survival\n    \n*   serious adverse events\n    \n*   recurrence‐free survival\n    \n*   progression‐free survival\n    \n*   quality of life\n    \n\n【49】Findings and quality of the available evidence will be reported according to the GRADE methodology ( Schünemann 2011 ).\n\n【50】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【51】We will conduct a combination of electronic and manual searches.\n\n【52】#### Electronic searches\n\n【53】No date or language restrictions will be applied.\n\n【54】We will search the following databases: MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process via Ovid from 1946 to present ( Appendix 1 ), EMBASE via Ovid from 1974 to present ( Appendix 2 ), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; included in _The Cochrane Library_ ) latest issue ( Appendix 3 ), Scopus from 1966 to present ( Appendix 4 ), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge) from 1900 to present ( Appendix 5 ), and LILACS from 1982 to present ( Appendix 6 ).\n\n【55】The electronic search will be complemented by a search of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (WHO ICTRP Search Portal; www.who.int/ictrp/en/ , no restricted time period) ( Appendix 7 ) and ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov/ , no restricted time period) ( Appendix 8 ) to identify further completed or ongoing trials.\n\n【56】#### Searching other resources\n\n【57】The reference lists of included articles will be screened manually to identify potentially‐relevant citations. In addition, we will contact leading experts in the field to request information on unpublished studies.\n\n【58】We will update the searches for all relevant databases shortly before publication of the review (within three months) and will screen the results for further potentially‐eligible studies. We will document and report the search process in detail.\n\n【59】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【60】In this review we will follow the methodological recommendations given by The Cochrane Collaboration ( Higgins 2011a ).\n\n【61】#### Selection of studies\n\n【62】Two review authors (SS and RD) will independently review titles and abstracts of identified references according to the pre‐defined inclusion criteria. The full‐texts of all potentially‐relevant studies will be assessed for eligibility independently by two review authors (SS and RD). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or, if necessary, with the help of a third review author (JJM or FK). The reasons for study exclusion will be recorded. Duplicate publication of studies will be identified by checking potentially‐relevant references for author names, locations and settings, details of interventions, numbers of participants, baseline data, study date, and duration of the study. We will use the EndNote software ( http://endnote.com/ ) to manage the references.\n\n【63】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【64】Two review authors (SS, DD or LMK) will independently extract relevant data on study characteristics, patient population and study setting, follow‐up time, tumour characteristics and relevant comorbidities, intervention characteristics on agent and administration, study methodology, study results, and author conclusion, using a data extraction form. This form will be based on the recommendations of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ) and will be pilot tested before routine use. The review authors will resolve any potential disagreement by consensus or through discussion with a third review author (JJM or FK). In addition, when necessary, we will contact the original investigators. We will collect and use the most detailed numerical data that might facilitate similar analyses of included studies. We will include all characteristics of the included studies in a ‘Characteristics of included studies’ table.\n\n【65】For the data extraction and management, we will use the Covidence software ( https://www.covidence.org/ ).\n\n【66】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【67】For the 'Risk of bias' assessment we will use the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for RCTs ( Higgins 2011b ). The following domains are therein considered: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Studies will be classified as: low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias or high risk of bias. Results of this assessment will be presented graphically. Two review authors (SS and DD or LMK) will assess independently all included studies for potential risk of bias. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by contacting a third review author (JJM or FK).\n\n【68】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【69】Hazard ratios (HRs) will be extracted with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time‐to‐event outcomes (recurrence‐free survival, progression‐free survival and overall survival). An indirect estimation method will be used to calculate HRs if they are not reported ( Parmar 1998 ; Tierney 2007 ; Williamson 2002 ). If it is not possible to extract these data from the study reports, we will use the proportions of participants with the respective outcomes measured at the final follow‐up time to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Results of dichotomous outcomes (e.g. serious adverse events, adverse events) will be expressed as RRs with 95% CIs. If count data in combination with participant‐years of follow‐up are given by the primary studies, adverse events will be evaluated as rate ratios with respective 95% CIs.\n\n【70】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【71】The analyses will be confined to participants with none or one or more adverse events, rather than reporting the number of events that occurred (as the latter are not independent when a participant suffers multiple events), unless participant‐years of follow‐up are given by the primary studies.\n\n【72】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【73】We will contact the corresponding author of the original publication to ask for any missing data. We will not impute missing data and will consider only the available data in the analyses. We will not conduct best‐case and worst‐case scenarios.\n\n【74】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【75】We will examine statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. The thresholds for interpretation of I² will be in accordance with the definitions presented in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2011 ):\n\n【76】*   0% to 40% might not be important,\n    \n*   30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity,\n    \n*   60% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity,\n    \n*   75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity.\n    \n\n【77】Subgroup analyses will be done if possible for the examination of clinical heterogeneity. For details, see ' Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity '.\n\n【78】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【79】To account for possible publication bias, a combination of electronic and manual searches of multiple databases will be conducted without language restrictions. If possible, we will create funnel plots to assess the likelihood of publication bias. In case the funnel plot suggests the possibility of publication bias, indicated by visual inspection and a test for asymmetry (if 10 or more studies are available), the results of this review will be discussed cautiously.\n\n【80】#### Data synthesis\n\n【81】We will perform data synthesis using Review Manager 5 software provided by The Cochrane Collaboration ( Review Manager 2014 ). Statistical methods not available in Review Manager (e.g. incorporating double‐zero trials in case of dichotomous outcomes) will be done using the statistical software R ( R 2015 ) with the R meta package ( R meta package 2015 ).\n\n【82】In the meta‐analyses, we will use the random‐effects model that assumes that the treatment effect among studies varies and therefore incorporates the heterogeneity among studies in the synthesis of primary study results. The estimated log HRs will be combined using the generic inverse‐variance method, the result of which is presented as pooled HR with 95% CI on a logarithmic scale. Summary statistics with respect to the RR and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Mantel‐Haenszel method ( Lane 2013 ). If applicable, rate ratios will be pooled using the generic inverse‐variance method.\n\n【83】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【84】If required data are available (i.e. results of subgroups reported in studies), we will explore the following potential sources of clinical heterogeneity using the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【85】*   High risk versus intermediate risk of tumour recurrence according to the EORTC risk tables ( Sylvester 2006 ). If data are available, we will additionally perform subgroup analyses for the highest‐risk tumours in comparison to high and intermediate risk of tumour recurrence. If necessary, we will additionally perform subgroup analyses for low risk versus intermediate/high risk\n    \n*   Different doses of BCG installations versus different doses of MMC\n    \n*   Different schedules of BCG installations versus different schedules of MMC (< 1 year versus > 1 year)\n    \n*   Electromotive administration of MMC versus BCG\n    \n*   Different strains of BCG versus MMC\n    \n\n【86】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【87】We will test the robustness of results using sensitivity analysis.\n\n【88】1.  We will use the fixed‐effect model to explore if results of the meta‐analysis vary substantially when using a model that does assume homogeneity among studies and gives greater weight to larger studies.

This review assesses the role of anticholinergic drugs as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic medication in the pharmacological treatment of this problem.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To determine the clinical effects of anticholinergic drugs for neuroleptic‐induced acute akathisia.\n\n【5】### Search strategy\n\n【6】The reviewers undertook electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1982‐1999), CINAHL (1982‐1999), Cochrane Library (Issue 4 1999), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 1999), EMBASE (1980‐1999), LILACS (1982‐1999) , MEDLINE (1966‐1999) and PsycLIT (1974‐1999).

It is characterised by restlessness and mental unease, which can be intense. It is associated with patterns of restless movement, including rocking, walking on the spot when standing, shuffling and tramping, or swinging one leg on the other when sitting. People may constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. Several strategies have been used to decrease akathisia, and this review is one in a series addressing the effects of drug treatments. We found no trial‐based evidence for the use of anticholinergic drugs for akathisia, thus making firm treatment recommendations impossible.\n\n【31】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【32】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We manually searched the British Orthoptic Journal, proceedings of the European Strabismological Association (ESA), International Strabismological Association (ISA) and American Academy of Paediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus meeting (AAPOS). We contacted researchers who are active in the field for information about further published or unpublished studies. There were no language restrictions in the manual or electronic searches.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】We planned to include randomised controlled trials of any surgical or non‐surgical treatment for intermittent distance exotropia.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Each reviewer independently assessed study abstracts identified from database and manual searches. Reviewer analysis was then compared and full papers for appropriate studies were obtained.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】No studies were found that met our selection criteria and therefore none were included for analysis.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】The available literature consists mainly of retrospective case reviews. These are difficult to compare and analyse due to a large variation in the definition of intermittent distance exotropia, intervention criteria and outcome measures. However there seems to be general agreement that non‐surgical treatment is most appropriate in small angle deviations or as a supplement to surgery. Studies were found supporting both early and late surgical intervention so the optimal timing of surgical intervention cannot be concluded. Recent work indicates that bilateral surgery may be the most effective surgical procedure in these cases. There is clearly a need for carefully planned clinical trials to be undertaken to improve the evidence base for the management of this condition.\n\n【15】PICOs\n-----\n\n【16】### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Population (7)\n\n【18】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Intermittent Exotropia\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Intervention (10)\n\n【20】*   Injection Of Botulinum Toxin\n*   Medial Rectus Recession\n*   Bilateral Lateral Rectus Recession\n*   Tinted Spectacle Lens, Prescription, Custom-made\n*   Ophthalmic Prism\n*   Orthoptic Treatment Penalization - Atropine And Minus Lenses\n*   Eye Patch\n*   Lateral Rectus Recession\n*   Binocular Convergence Exercises\n*   Medial Rectus Recession And Lateral Rectus Resection\n\n【21】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【22】###### Outcome (3)\n\n【23】*   Quality of Life\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Stereotests\n\n【24】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

When the child focuses on something close, the eye moves back to the centre. Exercises can strengthen the muscles and correct small problems, special glasses can be tried (although not necessarily needed to improve vision), and surgery can be done on the muscles around the eye.

However, the supine position may be a non‐invasive way of increasing oxygenation in participants with acute respiratory distress. Because of substantial differences in respiratory mechanics between adults and children and the risk of SIDS in young infants, a specific review of positioning for infants and young children with acute respiratory distress is warranted.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To compare the effects of different body positions in hospitalised infants and children with acute respiratory distress.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2008, issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August Week 1, 2008); EMBASE (January 2004 to Week 33, 2008) and CINAHL (January 2004 to August Week 3, 2008).\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or pseudo‐RCTs comparing two or more positions in the management of infants and children hospitalised with acute respiratory distress.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted data from each study. We resolved differences by consensus or referral to a third review author. We analysed bivariate outcomes using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). We analysed continuous outcomes using a mean difference and 95% CI. We used a fixed‐effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, in which case we used a random‐effects model.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We extracted data from 52 studies. We excluded 29 and included 23. Three studies used a parallel group randomised design which compared prone and supine positions only. The remaining 20 studies used a randomised cross‐over design. These studies compared prone, supine, lateral, elevated and flat positions.\n\n【15】Prone positioning was significantly more beneficial than supine positioning in terms of oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen, oxygenation index and thoraco‐abdominal synchrony. There were no statistically significant differences between any other positions.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】The prone position was significantly superior to the supine position in terms of oxygenation. However, as most participants were ventilated preterm infants, the benefits of prone positioning may be most relevant to these infants. In addition, although placing infants and children in the prone position may improve respiratory function, the association of SIDS with prone positioning means that infants should only be placed in this position while under continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring.\n\n【18】PICOs\n-----\n\n【19】### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Population (19)\n\n【21】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Chronic Lung Disease\n*   Disorder Of Pleura\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Upper Respiratory Infection\n*   Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Bronchiolitis\n*   Pertussis\n*   Legionella Infection\n*   Acute Respiratory Failure\n*   Acute Respiratory Distress\n*   Pneumococcal Pneumonia\n*   Congenital Anomaly Of Diaphragm\n*   Congenital Anomaly Of Lung\n*   Bronchitis\n*   Congenital Anomaly Of Bronchus\n*   Acute Lung Injury\n\n【22】###### Intervention (5)\n\n【23】*   Lateral recumbent positioning\n*   Prone positioning\n*   Kinetic positioning\n*   Sitting positioning\n*   Supine positioning\n\n【24】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【25】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【26】*   Oxygenation Index\n*   Apnea\n*   PaO2 FiO2 Ratio\n*   Arterial Oxygen Saturation\n*   Death\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

However, different positions may also be associated with negative outcomes. For example, lying on the front is linked with sudden infant death syndrome. When children with severe respiratory distress are put in hospital, treatment may include additional oxygen or assisted ventilation which may damage the lungs. Positioning may improve breathing and reduce the possibility of lung damage. Therefore the review authors searched the medical literature for controlled clinical trials comparing two or more body positions in the management of infants and children hospitalised with acute respiratory distress.\n\n【34】Lying on the front (the prone position) was better than on the back (the supine position) for oxygenating the blood but the difference was small. The increase in oxygen saturation on average increased by 2%. We based this finding on the comparison of eight studies (183 children, 153 preterm and 95 ventilated) measuring this outcome. The rapid rate of breathing with respiratory distress was slightly lower in the prone position (on average four breaths/min lower) based on five studies (100 infants aged up to one month, 59 ventilated). There were no obvious differences with other positions. We assessed a total of 23 studies. However, as most of the 560 children in these studies were preterm babies and mostly (70%) ventilated by machine, the benefits of prone positioning may be most relevant to these infants.\n\n【35】**\\*\\*\\*It is important to remember that these children were hospitalised. Therefore, given the association of the prone position with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the prone position should not be used for children unless they are in hospital and their breathing is constantly monitored.**\n\n【36】Infants and children were measured for only short time periods, varying from five minutes after a 15‐minute settling in period to a median of two days. The small changes in oxygenation are not as meaningful as measures of death, illness and patterns of recovery. Only five studies looked at children older than one year and results for positions such as 'head elevated' compared with 'lying flat' are limited by the small numbers.\n\n【37】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【38】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Among patients with hamstring injuries, are therapeutic interventions more effective than rest?\n\n【5】2\\. Is one specific targeted intervention (compared with another specific targeted intervention) more effective?\n\n【6】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】Hamstring injuries are amongst the most common encountered in the field of sports medicine. A study by Orchard 2002 found them to be responsible for 15% of injuries to athletes over the course of a season, with a high rate of recurrence in 34% of cases. They are commonplace amongst soft tissue injuries in many mainstream sports and can prove particularly disruptive to an athletes training and preparation, often resulting in a lengthy absence from competition due to their slow rate of healing ( Kroll 1997 ). Despite the frequency of their occurrence there is very little consensus as to how they are most effectively managed through the stages of soft tissue healing and rehabilitation ( Worrell 1994 ) .\n\n【9】Hamstring injuries are defined by the muscles that are affected; injury must be present in one or more of the component muscles, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus. Hamstring injuries are also defined by the anatomical site within the muscle that is affected; this may be in the muscle belly, the musculo‐tendinous junction (the transition area of muscle into tendinous tissue), the tendon, or the teno‐osseous junction (the insertion of the tendon into the bone). Finally, consideration needs to be given to the extent of the injury; this is commonly classified for soft tissue injuries as grades one, two and three. Grade one (first degree) being mild pain at the time of injury or within 24 hours of injury, especially when stress is applied to the injury. Local tenderness may or may not be present. Grade two (second degree) strains are present when the patient notices pain during activity and usually has to stop; pain and local tenderness are moderate to severe when the injury is stressed. In a grade 3 (third degree) injury there is complete, or near complete, rupture or avulsion of at least a portion of a ligament or tendon with severe pain or loss of function; a palpable defect may be present ( Kellett 1986 ).\n\n【10】The relevance to the practitioner, of site and grade of lesion, lies in the length of time it takes to rehabilitate these injuries. Injuries to the tendinous or myotendinous junction will take longer to rehabilitate than those in the muscle tissue. Higher grades of injury will take longer to rehabilitate due to the extent of damage to the tissues awaiting repair. It has been found that in more severe cases, that the convalescence interval prior to return to full activity can be longer than six weeks ( Pomeranz 1993 ).\n\n【11】Rehabilitation is the act of restoration of functional capability of a person, towards normality, by appropriate intervention. As is the case of any soft tissue injury, this will optimally involve treatment from the moment of injury until the subject has regained complete, unimpeded return to as close to normal function as is possible.\n\n【12】Many interventions are widely employed by therapists treating hamstring injuries to achieve complete rehabilitation. These include rest, PRICE (protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation)( ACPSM 1998 ), exercise therapy including stretching ( Croisier 2002 ), electrotherapy ( van der Windt 1999 ), massage and mobilisation directed towards soft tissues ( Hunter 1998 ; Brosseau 2003 ), articular structures ( Cibulka 1986 ) and neural tissue ( Turl 1998 ) and finally functional rehabilitation. However, evidence of their efficacy is not well established.\n\n【13】We are not aware of any systematic reviews summarising the evidence for the use of these interventions for rehabilitating hamstring injuries.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To review the comparative effectiveness of all reported rehabilitation approaches for all types of hamstring injuries.\n\n【16】The main questions we wish to address are:\n\n【17】1\\. Among patients with hamstring injuries, are therapeutic interventions more effective than rest?\n\n【18】2\\. Is one specific targeted intervention (compared with another specific targeted intervention) more effective?\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomised clinical trials in which any rehabilitation approach is compared with another or a control group.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Trials involving patients of any age group, in any degree of physical condition (i.e. sportsmen/non‐sportsmen) and either sex will be considered for inclusion.\n\n【25】Trials involving the non‐surgical management of the skeletally immature (including traction enthesiopathies and ischial tuberosity avulsion) will also be included.\n\n【26】All hamstring injuries which have been confirmed by assessment and physical examination, will be considered for inclusion regardless of grade, site and chronicity.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】Any therapeutic intervention or rehabilitation programme (alone or in comparison) for hamstring injuries will be included in the review.\n\n【29】These will be categorised as:  \n1\\. PRICE;  \n2\\. Stretching or mobilising exercises;  \n3\\. Strengthening exercises;  \n4\\. Exercise to correct movement dysfunction;  \n5\\. Electro‐therapeutic interventions;  \n6\\. Application of ice heat;  \n7\\. Manual therapies (articular, neural and soft tissue mobilisation and massage);  \n8\\. Rest.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】The primary outcome will be return to normal function (work/pre‐injury level of activity/pre injury level of sports activities) within three months. We have chosen a scale of three months as it has been established that more severe injuries, will take longer than six weeks to resolve and we wish to include these types of injury in our review.\n\n【32】Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n【33】*   Return to normal function within later time scales;\n    \n*   Pain at latest assessment within three months post injury, and at later times;\n    \n*   Soft tissue length at latest assessment within three months post injury, and at later times;\n    \n*   Joint range of motion at latest assessment within three months post injury, and at later times;\n    \n*   Muscle atrophy or objective muscle weakness at latest assessment within three months post injury, and at later times;\n    \n*   Isokinetic evaluation;\n    \n*   Number of treatments before discharge;\n    \n*   Timing of intervention;\n    \n*   Rates of exacerbation or re‐injury at latest assessment within twelve months post injury;\n    \n*   Patient satisfaction at discharge.\n    \n\n【34】Due to the diversity of outcomes employed to evaluate trials, consideration will be given to all differing outcome measures used to evaluate the same intervention.\n\n【35】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【36】We will search the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trial register (to present), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library current issue), MEDLINE (1966 to present), EMBASE (from 1980 to present), PEDro ‐ The Physiotherapy Evidence Database at http://www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au/, CINAHL (from 1982 to present), AMED (from 1985 to present), SportsDiscus (from 1830 to present), and reference lists of articles. To identify theses and unpublished studies we will also contact experts in the field and institutions. No language restrictions will be applied.\n\n【37】In MEDLINE (OVID ONLINE) the following subject specific search will be combined with the optimum trial search strategy ( Robinson 2002 ), and modified for use in other databases.\n\n【38】1\\.

They will retrieve full text for any that may describe eligible studies. All reviewers will reach consensus on whether trials satisfy the eligibility criteria, and those rejected at this stage will be described in the Characteristics of Excluded Studies table.\n\n【42】QUALITY ASSESSMENT\n\n【43】All reviewers will independently assess included studies using the Musculoskeletal Injuries Group quality assessment tool and resolve any differences by discussion.\n\n【44】Musculoskeletal Injuries Group quality assessment tool:\n\n【45】A.

Were the treatment providers blind to assignment status?  \n2 = effective action taken to blind treatment providers.  \n1 = small or moderate chance of unblinding of treatment providers.  \n0 = not possible, or not mentioned (unless double‐blind), or possible but not done.\n\n【51】G.

Corresponding authors will be contacted to provide missing information for trial results and quality criteria.\n\n【59】DATA ANALYSIS\n\n【60】Our primary analysis will pool all therapeutic studies of active intervention versus rest/no treatment. We will also analyse subgroups of studies categorised according to therapeutic approach, as outlined under \"Types of interventions\". This will include a comparison of each approach versus rest/no treatment, as well as direct comparisons of different approaches.\n\n【61】Results for binary outcomes will be combined using the Peto‐modified OR, and translated to risk differences across the observed range of control group rates for reporting purposes. Where possible, results for continuous outcomes will be combined using weighted mean difference by a fixed effects model. However, it is anticipated that studies will use different scales to measure the same underlying constructs. If this is the case, the standardised mean difference will be used and results translated back into one of the original scales for reporting purposes. Patient satisfaction and other ordinal scales will be treated as continuous outcomes unless and until accepted meta analytic techniques for ordinal outcome data become available. Means and standard deviations will be abstracted, calculated or requested. Statistical heterogeneity will be noted and discussed.\n\n【62】Sensitivity analyses will be carried out on the primary outcome.

Depression is associated with a marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Sertraline, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is a potent and specific inhibitor of serotonin uptake into the presynaptic terminal, with a modest activity as inhibitor of dopamine uptake. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute‐phase treatment of major depression. Fifty‐nine randomised controlled trials (about 10,000 participants) were included in the review. The review showed evidence of differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability between sertraline and other antidepressants, with meta‐analyses highlighting a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressants, both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, in a homogeneous sample of clinical trials, using conservative statistical methods. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre‐specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients and their carers' attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies. Nevertheless, based on currently available evidence, results from this review suggest that sertraline might be a strong candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant in people with acute major depression.\n\n【22】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【23】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects of acetophenazine compared with chlorpromazine for the treatment of people with schizophrenia.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Schizophrenia is a common disabling and enduring mental disorder ( Dickenson 2013 ; Tardy 2011 ) with a global lifetime prevalence of about 1%. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimations, there are 24 million people suffering from schizophrenia around the world with little gender differences ( WHO 2001 ). Schizophrenia appears to rank among the seven most frequent causes of disability and loss of years of lives due to disability ( Dold 2012 ).\n\n【7】Schizophrenia is associated with positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms reflect changes in thought or behaviour and include fixed, false beliefs (delusions), perceptions without cause (hallucinations), and catatonic symptoms such as mannerisms and bizarre posturing ( Carpenter 1994 , Crow 1980 ). Negative symptoms represent apathy or lack of motivation (avolition), lack of pleasure (anhedonia), disorganisation of behaviour and thought ( Carpenter 1994 , Crow 1980 ). People suffering from negative symptoms usually need personal care and assistance with activities of daily living ( Dickenson 2013 ), approximately 50% of people with severe mental disorder such as schizophrenia are treatment‐resistant and about 80% to 90% are not employed ( Marwaha 2004 ). It is therefore, recommended to consider the biological, social and psychological aspects of schizophrenia once deciding to start treatment.\n\n【8】Psychiatrists have been prescribing generic antipsychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia since 1950s, when chlorpromazine was first discovered by Delay and Deniker’s team ( Delay 1952 ) and was considered the benchmark treatment of schizophrenia.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Chlorpromazine, is a traditional antipsychotic, and ranks among the essential drugs listed by WHO ( WHO 2011 ). The impact of this drug has been so great that it has been considered as the second revolution in psychiatry (the first being psychoanalysis) ( Grozier 1973 ). It is one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today ( Adams 2005 ; Norquist 1999 ). It is frequently used for treatment in different parts of the world ( Chong 2004 ; Odejide 1982 ), but it also has unpleasant side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness ( Adams 2014 ).\n\n【11】Acetophenazine is another antipsychotic used in the treatment of disorganised and psychotic thinking. Acetophenazine has been suggested to be as effective as chlorpromazine with moderate extra pyramidal effects. It does not have as sedative an effect as chlorpromazine and also does not produce hypotension as much as chlorpromazine ( DrugBank 2005 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】Chlorpromazine as one of the widely‐used typical antipsychotic drugs is an aliphatic phenothiazine. It is reliable for its efficacy and one of the most ever examined antipsychotic drugs. It has been used as ‘benchmark treatment’ to check the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine acts as a blocking agent on different postsynaptic receptors in the way that it substantially blocks alpha 1, 5HT2A, D2 and D1 receptors in the brain ( Saha 2013 ). Chlorpromazine is classified as a low‐potency typical antipsychotic. Previously it was used for treating people suffering with both acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder as well as amphetamine‐induced psychoses. Chlorpromazine has indicated not only several anxiolytic, anti‐depressive and anti‐aggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapyramidal side effects, but may also cause metabolic syndromes, and movement disorders ( Saha 2013 ).\n\n【14】Acetophenazine, as a moderate‐potency antipsychotic drug, is used in the treatment of false perceptions, disorganised and psychotic thinking. It primarily blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. Similar to chlorpromazine, it substantially targets postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; affects the release of hypophyseal and hypothalamic hormones. Acetophenazine is considered to depress the reticular activating system, and therefore affecting body temperature and basal metabolism.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Newer antipsychotic drugs are often considered more effective than older‐established first‐generation drugs. However, older antipsychotic drugs are still the mainstay of treatment in most countries and previous narrative, unsystematic reviews have indicated no differences in efficacy of typical versus atypical medications ( Dold 2012 ). To help close the empirical gap concerning these debates, we will compare the efficacy of chlorpromazine, as the standard first‐generation antipsychotic drug with the newer antipsychotic acetophenazine.\n\n【17】The aim of this review is to compare acetophenazine with chlorpromazine, in order to develop a series of Cochrane reviews on chlorpromazine's efficacy ( Table 1 ).\n\n【18】Open in table viewer\n\n【19】Table 1.

If a trial is described as 'double blind' but implies randomisation, we will include such trials in a sensitivity analysis (see Sensitivity analysis ). If their inclusion does not result in a substantive difference, they will remain in the analyses. If their inclusion does result in important clinically significant, but not necessarily statistically significant differences, we will not add the data from these lower quality studies to the results of the better trials, but will present such data within a subcategory. We will exclude quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by alternate days of the week. Where people are given additional treatments within acetophenazine versus chlorpromazine, we will only include data if the adjunct treatment is evenly distributed between groups and it is only the acetophenazine versus chlorpromazine that is randomised.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】Adults, however defined, with schizophrenia or related disorders, including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis. If we find a trial with a range of diagnoses, we will only include trials where the majority of participants have schizophrenia.\n\n【30】We are interested in making sure that information is as relevant to the current care of people with schizophrenia as possible so propose to clearly highlight the current clinical state (acute, early post‐acute, partial remission, remission) as well as the stage (prodromal, first episode, early illness, persistent) and as to whether the studies primarily focused on people with particular problems (for example, negative symptoms, treatment‐resistant illnesses).\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】##### 1\\. Acetophenazine\n\n【33】Any dose, any means of administration.\n\n【34】##### 2\\. Chlorpromazine\n\n【35】Any dose, any means of administration.\n\n【36】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【37】All outcomes will be divided into short term (less than six months), medium term (seven to 12 months) and long term (over one year).\n\n【38】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【39】###### 1\\.

'Summary of findings' table\n\n【69】We will use the GRADE approach to interpret findings ( Schünemann 2008 ) and will use GRADE profiler ( GRADEPRO ) to import data from RevMan 5 ( Review Manager ) to create 'Summary of findings' tables. These tables provide outcome‐specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all outcomes we rated as important to patient‐care and decision making. We aim to select the following main outcomes for inclusion in the 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n【70】*   Global state: relapse, as defined in each study (medium term).\n    \n*   Mental state: no improvement, as defined by each study (medium term).\n    \n*   Mental state: specific symptoms, first‐rank symptoms (medium term).\n    \n*   Any clinically significant extrapyramidal side effects, as defined by each study.\n    \n*   Extrapyramidal adverse effects: Parkinsonism rigidity (medium term).\n    \n*   Quality of life: no significant change in quality of life/satisfaction (medium term).\n    \n\n【71】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【72】#### Electronic searches\n\n【73】##### 1\\. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register\n\n【74】The Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) will search the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study‐Based Register of Trials using the following search strategy.\n\n【75】(Acetophenazine AND Chlorpromazine) in Intervention Field of STUDY\n\n【76】The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Register of Trials is compiled by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials) and their monthly updates, handsearches, grey literature, and conference proceedings (see Group Module ). There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records into the register.\n\n【77】#### Searching other resources\n\n【78】##### 1\\. Reference searching\n\n【79】We will inspect references of all included studies for further relevant studies.\n\n【80】##### 2\\. Personal contact\n\n【81】We will contact the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials. We will note the outcome of this contact in the included or awaiting assessment studies tables.\n\n【82】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【83】#### Selection of studies\n\n【84】Review authors MO, AB, and MZ will independently inspect citations from the searches and identify relevant abstracts. A random 20% sample will be independently re‐inspected by MSM to ensure reliability. Where disputes arise, the full report will be acquired for more detailed scrutiny. Full reports of the abstracts meeting the review criteria will be obtained and inspected by MO, AB, MSM, and MZ. Again, MO and MSM will re‐inspect a random 20% of reports in order to ensure reliable selection. Where it is not possible to resolve disagreement by discussion, we will attempt to contact the authors of the study for clarification and if we can not resolve the disagreement, we will not include the trial but place it in awaiting assessment until a resolution is made.\n\n【85】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【86】##### 1\\. Extraction\n\n【87】Review authors MO, AB, MSM, and MZ will extract data from all included studies. In addition, to ensure reliability, MSM will independently extract data from a random sample of these studies, comprising 10% of the total. Again, any disagreement will be discussed, decisions documented and, if necessary, we will contact authors of studies for clarification. With any remaining problems, MO and MSM will help clarify issues and these final decisions will be documented. Data presented only in graphs and figures will be extracted whenever possible, but included only if two review authors independently have the same result. We will attempt to contact authors through an open‐ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary. If studies are multi‐centre, where possible, we will extract data relevant to each component centre separately.\n\n【88】##### 2\\. Management\n\n【89】###### 2.1 Forms\n\n【90】We will extract data onto standard, simple forms.\n\n【91】###### 2.2 Scale‐derived data\n\n【92】We will include continuous data from rating scales only if:  \n  \na) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have been described in a peer‐reviewed journal ( Marshall 2000 ); and  \nb) the measuring instrument has not been written or modified by one of the trialists for that particular trial.  \n  \nIdeally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self‐report or ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist). We realise that this is not often reported clearly, therefore, we will note if this is the case or not in 'Description of studies' .\n\n【93】###### 2.3 Endpoint versus change data\n\n【94】There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change data can remove a component of between‐person variability from the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two assessments (baseline and endpoint), which can be difficult in unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia. We have decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change data if the former are not available. Endpoint and change data will be combined in the analysis as we will use mean differences (MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【95】###### 2.4 Skewed data\n\n【96】Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non‐parametric data, we aim to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion.\n\n【97】We will enter data from studies of at least 200 participants, for example, in the analysis irrespective of the following rules, because skewed data pose less of a problem in large studies. We will also enter change data into the analyses as when continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. We will present and enter change data into statistical analyses\n\n【98】For endpoint data:\n\n【99】(a) when a scale starts from the ﬁnite number zero, we will subtract the lowest possible value from the mean, and divided this by the standard deviation. If this value is lower than 1, it strongly suggests a skew and the study will be excluded. If this ratio is higher than one but below 2, there is suggestion of skew. We will enter the study and test whether its inclusion or exclusion would change the results substantially. Finally, if the ratio is larger than 2 the study will be included, because skew is less likely ( Altman 1996 ; Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【100】b) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), ( Kay 1986 )), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD > (S‐S min), where S is the mean score and 'S min' is the minimum score.\n\n【101】###### 2.5 Common measure\n\n【102】To facilitate comparison between trials, we intend to convert variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common metric (e.g. mean days per month).\n\n【103】###### 2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary\n\n【104】Where possible, efforts will be made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This can be done by identifying cut‐off points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that if there is a 50% reduction in a scale‐derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall 1962 ) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986 ), this could be considered as a clinically significant response ( Leucht 2005 ; Leucht 2005a ). If data based on these thresholds are not available, we will use the primary cut‐off presented by the original authors.\n\n【105】###### 2.7 Direction of graphs\n\n【106】Where possible, we will enter data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for acetophenazine versus chlorpromazine. Where keeping to this makes it impossible to avoid outcome titles with clumsy double‐negatives (e.g. 'Not un‐improved') we will report data where the left of the line indicates an unfavourable outcome. This will be noted in the relevant graphs.\n\n【107】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【108】Again, review authors MO, AB, MSM, and MZ will work independently to assess risk of bias by using criteria described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) to assess trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.\n\n【109】If the raters disagree, the final rating will be made by consensus, with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials are provided, we will contact authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. Non‐concurrence in quality assessment will be reported, but if disputes arise as to which category a trial is to be allocated, again, we will resolve these by discussion.\n\n【110】The level of risk of bias will be noted in both the text of the review and in the 'Summary of findings' table.\n\n【111】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【112】##### 1\\. Binary data\n\n【113】For binary outcomes, we will calculate a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive ( Boissel 1999 ) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians ( Deeks 2000 ). The Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/H) statistic with its confidence intervals is intuitively attractive to clinicians but is problematic both in its accurate calculation in meta‐analyses and interpretation ( Hutton 2009 ). For binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' table/s, where possible, we will calculate illustrative comparative risks.\n\n【114】##### 2\\. Continuous data\n\n【115】For continuous outcomes will estimate mean difference (MD) between groups. We prefer not to calculate effect size measures (standardised mean difference SMD). However, if scales of very considerable similarity are used, we will presume there is a small difference in measurement, and we will calculate effect size and transform the effect back to the units of one or more of the specific instruments.\n\n【116】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【117】##### 1\\. Cluster trials\n\n【118】Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra‐class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error ( Divine 1992 ) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors ( Bland 1997 ; Gulliford 1999 ).\n\n【119】Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table, with a (\\*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intra‐class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods ( Gulliford 1999 ). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will present these data as if from a non‐cluster randomised study, but adjust for the clustering effect.\n\n【120】We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the ICC \\[Design effect = 1+(m‐1)\\*ICC\\] ( Donner 2002 ). If the ICC is not reported, it will be assumed to be 0.1 ( Ukoumunne 1999 ).\n\n【121】If cluster studies have been appropriately analysed taking into account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies will be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.\n\n【122】##### 2\\. Cross‐over trials\n\n【123】A major concern of cross‐over trials is the carry‐over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash‐out phase. For the same reason cross‐over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable ( Elbourne 2002 ). As both effects are very likely in severe mental illness, we will only use data of the first phase of cross‐over studies.\n\n【124】##### 3\\. Studies with multiple treatment groups\n\n【125】Where a study involves more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms will be presented in the comparisons. If data are binary, we will be simply add and combine them within the two‐by‐two table. If data are continuous, we will combine data following the formula in section 7.7.3.8  (Combining groups) of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). Where the additional treatment arms are not relevant, we will not use these data.\n\n【126】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【127】##### 1\\. Overall loss of credibility\n\n【128】At some degree of loss of follow‐up, data must lose credibility ( Xia 2009 ). We choose that, for any particular outcome, should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for, we will not reproduce these data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of those in one arm of a study are lost, but the total loss is less than 50%, we will address this within the 'Summary of findings' table/s by down‐rating quality. Finally, we will also downgrade quality within the 'Summary of findings' table/s should loss be 25% to 50% in total.\n\n【129】##### 2\\. Binary\n\n【130】In the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0% and 50% and where these data are not clearly described, we will present data on a 'once‐randomised‐always‐analyse' basis (an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis). Those leaving the study early are all assumed to have the same rates of negative outcome as those who completed, with the exception of the outcome of death and adverse effects. For these outcomes, we will use the rate of those who stay in the study ‐ in that particular arm of the trial ‐ for those who did not. We will undertake a sensitivity analysis to test how prone the primary outcomes are to change when data only from people who complete the study to that point are compared to the ITT analysis using the above assumptions.\n\n【131】##### 3\\. Continuous\n\n【132】###### 3.1 Attrition\n\n【133】In the case where attrition for a continuous outcome is between 0% and 50%, and data only from people who complete the study to that point are reported, we will reproduce these.\n\n【134】###### 3.2 Standard deviations\n\n【135】If standard deviations (SDs) are not reported, we will first try to obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where there are missing measures of variance for continuous data, but an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for group means, and either a 'P' value or 't' value available for differences in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ): When only the SE is reported, SDs are calculated by the formula SD = SE \\* square root (n). Chapters 7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) present detailed formulae for estimating SDs from P values, t or F values, confidence intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply, we will calculate the SDs according to a validated imputation method, which is based on the SDs of the other included studies ( Furukawa 2006 ). Although some of these imputation strategies can introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study’s outcome and thus to lose information. We nevertheless will examine the validity of the imputations in a sensitivity analysis excluding imputed values.\n\n【136】###### 3.3 Assumptions about participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow‐up\n\n【137】Various methods are available to account for participants who left the trials early or were lost to follow‐up. Some trials just present the results of study completers, others use the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF), while more recently methods such as multiple imputation or mixed‐effects models for repeated measurements (MMRM) have become more of a standard. While the latter methods seem to somewhat better than LOCF ( Leon 2006 ), we feel that the high percentage of participants leaving the studies early and differences in the reasons for leaving the studies early between groups is often the core problem in randomised schizophrenia trials. We will therefore not exclude studies based on the statistical approach used. However, we will preferably use the more sophisticated approaches, e.g., MMRM or multiple‐imputation will be preferred to LOCF and completer analyses will only be presented if some kind of ITT data are not available at all. Moreover, we will address this issue in the item \"incomplete outcome data\" of the 'Risk of bias' tool.\n\n【138】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【139】##### 1\\. Clinical heterogeneity\n\n【140】We will consider all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge clinical heterogeneity. We will simply inspect all studies for clearly outlying people or situations which we had not predicted would arise. When such situations or participant groups arise, these will be fully discussed.\n\n【141】##### 2\\. Methodological heterogeneity\n\n【142】We will consider all included studies initially, without seeing comparison data, to judge methodological heterogeneity. We will simply inspect all studies for clearly outlying methods which we had not predicted would arise. When such methodological outliers arise these will be fully discussed.\n\n【143】##### 3\\. Statistical heterogeneity\n\n【144】###### 3.1 Visual inspection\n\n【145】We will visually inspect graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity.\n\n【146】###### 3.2 Employing the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic\n\n【147】Heterogeneity between studies will be investigated by considering the I <sup>2 </sup> method alongside the Chi <sup>2 </sup> 'P' value. The I <sup>2 </sup> provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance ( Higgins 2003 ). The importance of the observed value of I <sup>2 </sup> depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. 'P' value from Chi <sup>2 </sup> test, or a confidence interval for I <sup>2 </sup> ). An I <sup>2 </sup> estimate greater than or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant Chi <sup>2 </sup> statistic, will be interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 ‐ Higgins 2011 ). When substantial levels of heterogeneity are found in the primary outcome, we will explore reasons for heterogeneity ( Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity ).\n\n【148】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【149】##### 1\\. Protocol versus full study\n\n【150】Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. These are described in section 10.1 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will try to locate protocols of included randomised trials. If the protocol is available, we will compare outcomes in the protocol and in the published report. If the protocol is not available, we will compare outcomes listed in the methods section of the trial report with actually reported results.\n\n【151】##### 2\\. Funnel plot\n\n【152】Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results ( Egger 1997 ). These are again described in Section 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systemic reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small‐study effects. We will not use funnel plots for outcomes where there are 10 or fewer studies, or where all studies are of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots are possible, we will seek statistical advice in their interpretation.\n\n【153】#### Data synthesis\n\n【154】We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed‐effect or random‐effects models. The random‐effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This often seems to be true to us and the random‐effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the random‐effects model. It puts added weight onto small studies which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction of effect, these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We choose random‐model for all analyses. The reader is, however, able to choose to inspect the data using fixed‐effect model.\n\n【155】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【156】##### 1\\. Subgroup analyses\n\n【157】###### 1.1 Primary outcomes\n\n【158】###### 1.2 Clinical state, stage or problem\n\n【159】We propose to undertake this review and provide an overview of the effects of acetophenazine versus chlorpromazine for people with schizophrenia in general. In addition, however, we will try to report data on subgroups of people in the same clinical state, stage and with similar problems.\n\n【160】##### 2\\. Investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【161】If inconsistency is high, this will be reported. First, we will investigate whether data have been entered correctly. Second, if data are correct, we will visually inspect the graph and outlying studies will be successively removed to see if homogeneity is restored. For this review, we decided that should this occur with data contributing to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total weighting, data will be presented. If not, data will not be pooled and issues will be discussed. We know of no supporting research for this 10% cut‐off but are investigating use of prediction intervals as an alternative to this unsatisfactory state.\n\n【162】When unanticipated clinical or methodological heterogeneity are obvious, we will simply state hypotheses regarding these for future reviews or versions of this review. We do not anticipate undertaking analyses relating to these.\n\n【163】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【164】##### 1\\. Implication of randomisation\n\n【165】We aim to include trials in a sensitivity analysis if they are described in some way as to imply randomisation. For the primary outcomes, we will include these studies and if there is no substantive difference when the implied randomised studies are added to those with better description of randomisation, then we will use all data from these studies.\n\n【166】##### 2\\. Assumptions for lost binary data\n\n【167】Where assumptions have to be made regarding people lost to follow‐up (see Dealing with missing data ), we will compare the findings of the primary outcomes when we use our assumption/s and when we use data only from people who complete the study to that point. If there is a substantial difference, we will report results and discuss them but will continue to employ our assumption.\n\n【168】Where assumptions have to be made regarding missing SDs data (see Dealing with missing data ), we will compare the findings of the primary outcomes when we use our assumption/s and when we use data only from people who complete the study to that point. We will undertake a sensitivity analysis to test how prone results are to change when completer‐only data only are compared to the imputed data using the above assumption. If there is a substantial difference, we will report results and discuss them, but will continue to employ our assumption.\n\n【169】##### 3\\. Risk of bias\n\n【170】We will analyse the effects of excluding trials that are judged to be at high risk of bias across one or more of the domains of randomisation (implied as randomised with no further details available) allocation concealment, blinding and outcome reporting for the meta‐analysis of the primary outcome. If the exclusion of trials at high risk of bias does not substantially alter the direction of effect or the precision of the effect estimates, then we will included data from these trials in the analysis.\n\n【171】##### 4\\. Imputed values\n\n【172】We will also undertake a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of including data from trials where we used imputed values for ICC in calculating the design effect in cluster randomised trials.\n\n【173】If substantial differences are noted in the direction or precision of effect estimates in any of the sensitivity analyses listed above, we will not pool data from the excluded trials with the other trials contributing to the outcome, but will present them separately.\n\n【174】##### 5\\. Fixed and random effects\n\n【175】All data will be synthesised using a random‐effects model, however, we will also synthesise data for the primary outcome using a fixed model to evaluate whether this alters the significance of the results\n\n【176】Table 1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effectiveness of dressings that modulate the activity of proteases (protease modulating dressings) on healing of diabetic foot ulcers.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Approximately 15% of individuals with diabetes will experience a foot ulcer ( Frykberg 1999 , Gordois 2003 , Reiber 1999 ). Foot ulceration is among the most common of all diabetes‐related complications ( Boulton 2000 , Koproski 1997 , Ragnarson Tennvall 2000 ), and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality ( Valk 2001 , Van Gils 1999 ). Diabetes related foot ulcers impact significantly on functional status and quality of life, and are a precursor to approximately 85% of lower‐limb amputations in this patient group ( Armstrong 1998 , Oyibo 2001 , Van Acker 2002 ).\n\n【6】The five‐year re‐ulceration rate in individuals with diabetes is approximately 70% ( Valk 2001 , Van Gils 1999 ). One reason for this is the irreversible nature of contributing factors such as peripheral neuropathy. Prevalence rates for peripheral neuropathy range from 20% to over 50% depending on the populations studied, and affects one or more of the sensory, motor or autonomic nerve pathways ( Adler 1997 , Kastenbauer 2004 , Gregg 2004 , Duby 2004 ). The incidence of peripheral neuropathy is known to increase with age and diabetes duration, and other reported risk factors for development include, elevated HbA1c, sex, uric acid levels and height ( Adler 1997 , Tapp 2003 ). Nerve dysfunction contributing to peripheral neuropathy is irreversible, and when combined with any trauma to the foot, is the most frequent precursor to ulceration ( Reiber 1999 ). Less frequently ulcers can occur as a symptom of deeper infection such as abscess, osteomyelitis or cellulitis as opposed to being the primary event. Another less frequent precursor to ulceration is peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Whilst not necessarily a significant risk factor for ulceration, PVD makes a considerable contribution to reduced healing rates, and is a major precursor to amputation once ulceration occurs ( Boulton 2000 , Gregg 2004 ).\n\n【7】Health expenditure for diabetes related complications is variable according to local prevalence rates and available treatment technologies. As a result, identifying cost estimates for specific diabetes related complications is difficult. Estimates for 2001 costs for medical care in the United States for peripheral neuropathy and associated complications such as ulceration, are approximately $US 10 billion ( Gordois 2003 ). Most cost estimates, including the above costing for the US do not include indirect costs associated with rehabilitation, carers, lost employment and leisure time and an increased reliance on social welfare ( DiabCost 2002 ). In total the World Health Organisation estimates 2.5‐15% of local health budgets is consumed by diabetes and associated complications ( WHO 2005 ).\n\n【8】Rapid healing of diabetes related foot ulcers is essential if acute complications such as infection and amputation are to be avoided. Current guidelines recommend the use of pressure relieving devices, appropriate wound dressings, debridement and revascularisation, provided as required, by a multidisciplinary team to maximise healing potential ( Apelqvist 2000 , Frykberg 2000 , Boulton 2000 ). Other important factors in achieving wound closure are glycaemic control, patient education and even amputation ( Eaglestein 2001 ). Whilst amputation is often seen as a failure of conservative management it should not be overlooked as a treatment option as it often produces the most positive long‐term outcome. In addition to currently available guidelines, wound‐grading systems can also be used to guide treatment plans, describe wound aetiology and characteristics and to assign a level of risk for complications and / or amputation. The Texas Foot Classification System and the Wagner ulcer grading system are among the most commonly used ( Armstrong 1998 ).\n\n【9】Although current guidelines and ulcer grading systems have provided a basis for more successful wound management, other factors can contribute to delayed or non‐healing of diabetic foot wounds, even in the presence of appropriate care. Factors such as social isolation, poor patient compliance, inadequate nutrition, smoking and drug therapy have all been implicated in poor wound resolution ( Hunt 2000 , Muncaster 2001 ). Of particular interest in the diabetic patient is the altered cellular response to injury seen in this patient group and current theories surrounding the impact various levels of wound surface bacteria have on healing ( Edwards 2004 , Lobmann 2005 , Schultz 2003 ).\n\n【10】The body's response to injury consists of several mutually dependent phases that overlap to produce complete healing. The four phases of tissue repair (coagulation, inflammation, migration and remodeling) require the involvement of many components including fibrin, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, proteases, epithelial and endothelial cells and collagen, all of which appear at different times and in the appropriate amount required for healing ( Hunt 2000 , Lobmann 2005 ). In the individual with diabetes, parts of this process can be absent or impaired, which in turn can result in delayed or non‐healing of an ulcer ( Cullen 2002 , Greenhalgh 2003 , Lobmann 2005 ). Research has provided several means of addressing these cellular failures including the introduction of topically applied growth factors and human dermal replacement, however there is a paucity of data regarding the affects of these interventions.\n\n【11】The concentration of bacteria on the wound surface was once described in terms of contaminated, colonised or infected, with infection diagnosed once the level of bacteria reached a certain mark, usually 10 <sup>5 </sup> or 100,000 per gram of tissue ( Edwards 2004 ). However, it has been suggested that concentrations of bacteria below that previously used as an indicator of infection, can cause delayed healing ( Edwards 2004 ). This \"critical colonisation\" is proposed to delay healing without any signs and symptoms of clinical infection being present, however, direct research evidence for this phenomenon is lacking. Obvious infection should be treated using intravenous and / or oral antibiotics either alone or in combination with topical antimicrobials such as antibiotic creams ( Frykberg 2000 , Boulton 2000 ). Modern wound dressings such as those containing silver are purported to address the effects of critical colonisation, thus improving healing rates, but again there is currently a lack of supporting evidence for their use in diabetic foot ulcers ( Dowsett 2003 ).\n\n【12】Recent research has also explored the role of proteases in wound healing. Proteases include such cells as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), plasmin and elastase, and their release and inhibition occurs during all phases of tissue repair ( Armstrong 2002 , Lobmann 2002 , Lobmann 2005 ). Results from studies examining wound fluid from both acute and chronic wounds suggest amount and activity of MMPs in particular, is elevated in chronic wounds, including those related to diabetes ( Trengove 1999 , Yager 1996 ). Not only do the levels of MMP appear elevated in diabetic and other chronic wounds, levels of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), which regulate or control MMP amount and activity, seem to be depleted ( Armstrong 2002 , Mast 1996 ). As a result of the imbalance and unabated activity of MMPs, granulation tissue, growth factors and cytokines are destroyed, effectively disrupting the pathway to healing ( Lobmann 2002 , Mast 1996 , Trengove 1999 ). Early studies have evaluated the effect different agents have on levels and activity of MMPs. A 2003 study by Chin et al examined the affect of doxycycline (a member of the tetracycline family of antibiotics) on MMPs in vitro, and found significant reductions in MMP activity ( Chin 2003 ). A concurrent trial of topical doxycycline 1%, found that all 4 participants with diabetes related foot ulcers healed over a 20‐week period, with no adverse events reported ( Chin 2003 ). A new wound dressing, DerMax (Dermagenics Europe), comprised of metal ions and citric acid, has also been reported to reduce MMP production in vitro ( van den Berg 2003 ). Products such as Promogran (Johnson & Johnson), a protease modulating matrix, also report a positive impact on protease activity and subsequent improvements in wound healing.\n\n【13】This review seeks to examine the current evidence for use of wound dressings that modulate protease amount and activity, or treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and report on the affects on healing.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To determine the effectiveness of dressings that modulate the activity of proteases (protease modulating dressings) on healing of diabetic foot ulcers.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published and unpublished will be included if they evaluate the effects of protease modulating dressings (used singly or in combination with other dressings / agents), on the healing of diabetic foot ulcers.\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Trials recruiting participants with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and related foot ulcers will be considered for review. Trials may concern ulcers that are neuropathic, ischaemic or neuroischaemic. Studies that recruit participants both with and without diabetes will only be included if the findings for people with diabetes are reported separately or can be provided for the purposes of this review. Similarly studies that recruit participants with ulcers related to other chronic conditions apart from diabetes, will be included if the findings for people with diabetes are reported separately or can be provided for the purposes of this review. Where information is given about these and other variables this will be recorded.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】The primary intervention will be protease modulating wound dressings used singly or in combination. Eligible comparison interventions will be no dressing, sham dressing and any dressing not classed as protease modulating. These may be used in combination with other therapies such as pressure relieving devices or secondary dressings.\n\n【24】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】Only studies reporting primary outcomes will be included. Secondary outcomes will only be reported if they appear in studies reporting on a primary outcome.\n\n【27】*   Proportion of ulcers completely healed at a specified time point\n    \n*   Change in total ulcer area (either absolute or percentage change)\n    \n*   Time to complete healing or reduced size\n    \n\n【28】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【29】*   Adverse effects of treatment\n    \n*   Quality of life\n    \n*   Costs\n    \n*   Hospital admissions\n    \n*   Amputation\n    \n*   Death\n    \n\n【30】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【31】#### Electronic searches\n\n【32】An initial search will be done using the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register. Trials on the register are identified by hand searching of relevant journals, conference proceedings and searching electronic databases. An additional search of electronic databases including MEDLINE (1966‐ most recent), EMBASE (1980‐ most recent), CINAHL (1982‐ most recent) will be conducted for years 2002‐2004. There will be no restriction on the basis of language, date or publication status.  \n  \nThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (latest issue) will be searched using the following strategy:  \n1\\.

Full copies of all papers that potentially meet the inclusion criteria will be retrieved. Where a study is reported twice all versions will be retrieved to ensure collection of maximum data.The same 2 reviewers will independently assess the full papers against the selection criteria. Where there is disagreement between the two independent reviewers regarding inclusion or exclusion of a study, this will be resolved through discussion and by reference to a third reviewer who will independently assess the study in dispute. The third reviewer will also assess rejected studies.\n\n【38】#### Selection of studies\n\n【39】Two reviewers using the information in the paper title and the abstract when available will independently assess studies identified from the search as potentially meeting the selection criteria.

Statistical significance will be set at p<0.05 for all outcomes. The Review Manager Software version 4.2 will be used for analysis. In the presence of heterogeneity a random effects method will be used.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effectiveness of mobile‐based technologies to support communication of healthcare information and management of care, on clients' health and well‐being, as well as unintended consequences and resources use, compared to standard practice.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】The provision of healthcare at a distance, through telemedicine applications, can facilitate universal health coverage, decreasing health and social inequalities ( Wootton 2008 ). The widespread use of information and communication technologies can potentially expand the use of telemedicine approaches to overcome health systems challenges associated with accessing care and coverage of services.\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Access to healthcare is essential for the promotion of health and the management of diseases and chronic conditions. Extensive healthcare coverage traditionally leads to improved access to required healthcare and improved population health, especially for those from more deprived socio‐economic backgrounds ( Moreno‐Serra 2012 ) and rural and remote areas ( Jamison 2013 ). Mobile access to healthcare and health‐related information becomes vital in contexts where access to healthcare is scarce, as those needing clinical information might be particularly vulnerable to ineffective treatment ( Royston 2015 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Telemedicine is defined as the use of information and communication technologies for medical diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes, when participants are separated by distance, time, or both, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of individuals and communities ( Hersh 2006 ). Although telemedicine and telehealth have been conceptualised separately, with the latter being a broader term that also encapsulates non‐clinical activities such as professional education, they are often used synonymously ( Hersh 2006 ; WHO 2016 ). Mobile health (mHealth) has been more recently defined and refers to the use of mobile telecommunication technologies for delivering healthcare ( Steinhubi 2013 ).\n\n【10】The exchange of information can occur synchronously (when interactions happen in real time) or asynchronously (when there is a lag between the clinical information being transmitted and the response) ( WHO 2016 ), and through different channels, including videoconferencing, mobile applications, and secure messaging ( Kruse 2017 ). The most common examples of telemedicine services are store and forward services, where medical data are transmitted to a healthcare provider for offline assessment; remote monitoring services, where a person is monitored at a distance by a healthcare provider through the use of technologies; and interactive services, where there is real‐time interaction between a person and their healthcare provider ( WHO 2012 ; WHO (in press) ).\n\n【11】A global survey on eHealth was recently conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO 2016 ), in which the terms telehealth and telemedicine were used interchangeably. Results showed that 57% of 122 surveyed countries had telehealth as part of the national eHealth policy or strategy (70 countries), and 22% (27 countries) had a dedicated national telehealth policy or strategy ( WHO 2016 ). According to the surveyed countries, the most common areas where telehealth was used were teleradiology, telepathology, remote patient monitoring and teledermatology, all of which were in use in more than half of the surveyed countries ( WHO 2016 ). Of those, teleradiology programmes were most established, whereas the other programme types were mainly informal or at the pilot stage.\n\n【12】In a bid to maximise the coverage of healthcare services, decrease the costs associated with providing healthcare, and optimise the shortage of healthcare professionals, governments and healthcare agencies all over the world have been funding telehealth programmes, in high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries. Some examples include: the technology enabled care services programme in England ( NHS Commissioning Assembly 2015 ); the Scottish Centre for Telehealth and Telecare ( SCTT 2017 ); telehealth pilot programmes in Australia ( Australian Government Department of Health 2017 ); telehealth services provided within the Medicare programme in the USA ( MedPAC 2016 ); the Asia eHealth information network ( AeHIN 20017 ); and the KwaZulu‐Natal experience in South Africa ( Mars 2012 ).\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】By enabling exchange of clinical information that otherwise might not be possible, telemedicine promotes access to healthcare services, overcoming barriers such as the existence of services and timeliness of access. The main benefits associated with telemedicine are improved access to healthcare, increased speed at which it can be accessed, and cost reduction ( Wootton 2008 ). This is particularly relevant for settings with limited healthcare resources, for instance low‐ and middle‐income countries and remote areas. By bringing together healthcare providers and clients who otherwise might not be able to exchange clinical information, telemedicine increases the uniformity of clinical practice, promotes universal health coverage, and decreases health and social inequalities. Techonological advances and better telecommunication systems enable broader and less expensive access to healthcare delivered remotely, making the intervention more accessible.\n\n【15】Notwithstanding the possibilities, telemedicine applications have been inconsistently implemented and with varying degrees of success, which can be explained by technological challenges, legal considerations, human and cultural factors, and uncertainty about its economic benefits and cost‐effectiveness ( WHO 2011 ). A global eHealth survey conducted recently reported that lack of funding, infrastructure, prioritisation, and legislation or regulations were the most commonly cited barriers to implementing telehealth programmes ( WHO 2016 ). These barriers can only be overcome by the implementation of comprehensive regulatory guidelines, driven both by governmental and professional medical organisations; legislation on confidentiality, privacy and liability; and the involvement of all stakeholders in designing, implementing and evaluating telemedicine applications, focusing on the safety and the effectiveness of applications ( Agboola 2016 ; WHO 2011 ).\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】The rapid progress in information and communication technologies means that the field of telemedicine is also hastily evolving. Despite its potential and the exponential growth of telemedicine applications in recent decades, there are still unanswered questions about its effectiveness ( Agboola 2016 ; WHO 2016 ). The rationale for conducting this review is to assess the effectiveness of mobile‐based technologies to support communication of healthcare information. Although these technologies are now ubiquitous, their rapid expansion has not been accompanied by a close assessment of their impact, which led the WHO to commission guidelines that aim to inform investments of digital health applications for strengthening health systems. This is one of a suite of six Cochrane Reviews that will contribute to those guidelines. We aim to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine not only on relevant clinical outcomes, but also acceptability, satisfaction, resources use and unintended consequences. Research into unintended consequences has been particularly neglected, but can provide crucial information for the implementation of successful telemedicine programmes.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To assess the effectiveness of mobile‐based technologies to support communication of healthcare information and management of care, on clients' health and well‐being, as well as unintended consequences and resources use, compared to standard practice.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】We will include randomised trials and cluster randomised trials. We will include full‐text studies, conference abstracts, and unpublished data. We will include studies irrespective of their publication status and language of publication.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】*   Clients receiving healthcare accessible via mobile devices.\n    \n*   All types of healthcare providers (i.e. professionals, paraprofessionals and lay health workers), communicating and providing client care through mobile‐based technologies.\n    \n\n【26】We will include participants regardless of their location, setting, diagnoses, conditions or demographic factors such as age.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】We will include trials comparing communication and management of care through a mobile device with standard practice. By mobile‐based communication from client to healthcare provider, we mean the exchange of communication and provision of healthcare information and services at a distance ( WHO 2012 ), in which communication is conducted between remote clients engaging with health services and healthcare providers. We will focus exclusively on the provision of healthcare information where the person’s inquiry receives a response in real‐time or response is as immediate as appropriate clinically. Standard practice is defined as the usual care provided in the setting where the study was conducted, which could include providing care or engaging with the client through face‐to‐face communication or other non‐digital channels or referring the client to another provider.\n\n【29】We will focus exclusively on clinical information that can be exchanged over wireless and mobile technologies, as well as mobile phones of any kind (but not analogue landline telephones), laptops, tablets, personal digital assistants, and smartphones. Communication channels via mobile device can include text messaging, video messaging, social media, voice calls, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), and videoconferencing, through software such as Skype, WhatsApp, or Google Hangouts.\n\n【30】We will include:\n\n【31】*   studies in which the clients employ mobile‐based technologies to engage with provider(s); this could also include partners, family members or other informal support providers engaging with providers on behalf of others;\n    \n*   studies in which the provider(s) offering care is at a different location from the client;\n    \n*   studies in which the client transmits clinical information via a mobile device; and\n    \n*   studies in which the provider(s) offering guidance responds in real‐time, defined as sufficiently immediate or as clinically appropriate.\n    \n\n【32】We will include studies where mobile‐based technologies were used for monitoring, consultation or delivering treatment, as long as there was clinical information exchanged between client and provider, and feedback given by the provider. We will include studies where the type of communication device that was used to transmit the clinical information is unknown, since the specificity of the type of communication device is not often reported.\n\n【33】We will include all health issues and will not restrict the content of clinical health information exchanged. We will include studies where the digital component of the intervention was delivered as part of a wider package if we have judged it to be the major component of the intervention.\n\n【34】We will exclude:\n\n【35】*   Pilot and feasibility studies (pilot study defined as “a version of the main study that is run in miniature to test whether the components of the main study can all work together” ( Arain 2010 ) and feasibility study defined as “pieces of research done before a main study” ( Arain 2010 )).\n    \n*   Studies that compared different technical specifications of telecommunication technologies, e.g. different communication channels, software, etc.\n    \n*   Studies in which the client used fully automated services to self‐care or access clinical information without having any contact with a healthcare provider (e.g. webMD).\n    \n*   Studies in which the use of telecommunications technology was not linked to direct client care.\n    \n*   Studies in which the intervention consisted of client monitoring systems in which the client received only an automated voice response.\n    \n*   Studies in which the intervention consisted of routine communication to the healthcare provider as part of usual follow‐up care.\n    \n*   Studies in which clients used an automated service to relay clinical information, without having any other interaction with the healthcare provider (e.g. client is fitted with a system that will send a message if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) drops below a certain range and there is no feedback from the healthcare provider), where the client has already had in‐person contact with a healthcare provider.\n    \n*   Studies in which there was no transfer/communication of clinical information between client and provider. For example, a portable medical device is excluded if it does not transmit clinical information to a provider. The key functionality is that there is an exchange of clinical information between client and healthcare providers; the device/health equipment used for obtaining the clinical information to be exchanged is not as relevant.\n    \n*   Studies in which providers engage with clients through predefined scheduled calls, where there is no mention of the client being able to contact the healthcare provider in between.\n    \n*   Studies that explicitly used non‐mobile devices to transfer clinical information, such as computers, videoconferencing, landlines, etc. We will not exclude studies based on the type of device or health equipment that was used to obtain the clinical information.\n    \n\n【36】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【37】##### Main outcomes\n\n【38】1.  Time between presentation and appropriate response (includes diagnosis, referral or treatment) by provider, including change in time for clients to receive/access health services and information.\n    \n2.  Clients health status and well‐being, using validated measures, such as the Notthingham Health Profile or the SF‐36 ( McDowell 2006 ).\n    \n\n【39】##### Other outcomes\n\n【40】1.  Clients utilisation of healthcare services (e.g. reduced emergency room visits).\n    \n2.  Clients acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention; this will include both objective measures, such as the number of dropouts not explained by other reasons, and self‐reported acceptability and satisfaction, measured with a validated scale, such as the Patient Satisfaction Scale ( La Monica 1986 ).\n    \n3.  Healthcare provider acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention; this will include both objective measures, such as the number of dropouts not explained by other reasons, and self‐reported acceptability and satisfaction, measured with a validated scale, such as the Physician Worklife Survey ( Konrad 1999 ).\n    \n4.  Resource use, including cost to the client and cost to the service (e.g. human resources/time, supplies and equipment). This measure will need to be pre‐specified and available directly from the results section.\n    \n5.  Unintended consequences. These could include: misreading or misinterpretation of data; transmission of inaccurate data; loss of verbal and non‐verbal communication cues, including between provider and client; issues of privacy and disclosure; affecting interpersonal relationships; negative impacts on equity; failure or delay in the message delivery.\n    \n\n【41】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【42】#### Electronic searches\n\n【43】An information specialist developed the search strategies in consultation with the review authors and WHO content experts. We will use a cut‐off search date of 2000, based on the increased availability and penetration of mobile devices used for telemedicine from that date ( ITU 2017 ). Appendix 1 lists the search strategy for MEDLINE. We will search the following databases:\n\n【44】*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; latest issue), in the Cochrane Library;\n    \n*   MEDLINE Ovid;\n    \n*   Embase Ovid;\n    \n*   POPLINE; and\n    \n*   WHO Global Health Library.\n    \n\n【45】#### Searching other resources\n\n【46】##### Trial registries\n\n【47】We will search clinicaltrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( who.int/ictrp ) trial registries.\n\n【48】##### Grey literature\n\n【49】We will conduct a grey literature search to identify studies not indexed in the databases listed above. We will search for relevant systematic reviews and primary studies on similar topics using Epistemonikos ( epistemonikos.org ), which is a database of health evidence and a large source of health‐related systematic reviews. We will search all the contributed content in mHealthEvidence ( mhealthevidence.org ), a database of global literature on mHealth. We will contact authors of relevant studies and reviews to clarify reported published information and to seek unpublished results or data. We will contact researchers with expertise relevant to the review topic. Additionally, the WHO will issue a call for papers through popular digital health communities of practice such as the Global Digital Health Network and Implementing Best Practices, to identify additional primary studies as well as grey literature.\n\n【50】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【51】#### Selection of studies\n\n【52】We will download all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching to a reference management database and remove duplicates. For title and abstract screening, we will use a machine learning classifier that is able to assign a probability score that a given record describes, or does not describe, a randomised trial ( Wallace 2017 ). Titles and abstracts of studies with a 10% probability or greater of being a randomised trial will be screened by two review authors (of BB, NH, NM), and those with less than 10% probability of being a randomised trial will be screened by one review author. We will retrieve the full‐text study reports/publications and two review authors (of BB, NH, NM) will independently screen the full‐text and identify studies for inclusion and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third review author (DGB or SS).\n\n【53】We will list studies that initially appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but that we later excluded in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We will collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review. We will also provide any information we can obtain about ongoing studies. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram ( Liberati 2009 ).\n\n【54】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【55】We will use the EPOC standard data collection form and adapt it for study characteristics and outcome data ( EPOC 2017a ); we will pilot the form on at least one study in the review. Two review authors (of BB, NH, NM) will independently extract the following study characteristics from the included studies.\n\n【56】1.  Methods: study design, unit of allocation, location and study setting, withdrawals.\n    \n2.  Participants: number, mean age, age range, gender, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, other relevant characteristics.\n    \n3.  Interventions: function of the intervention (monitoring, consultation, therapy), intervention components (including type of technology and mode of delivery, frequency of data transmission),comparison, fidelity assessment. For this review, we will define monitoring as to keep track or record the progress of symptoms or a condition over a period of time; consultation as an exchange between the healthcare provider and the client, where the latter's health status is discussed and guidance, support, or information are provided; and therapy as the ongoing management and care of a client, to counteract a disease or disorder.\n    \n4.  Outcomes: main outcomes specified and collected, time points reported.\n    \n5.  Notes: funding for trial, ethical approval.\n    \n\n【57】Two review authors (of BB, NH, NM) will independently extract outcome data from included studies. We will contact authors of included studies to seek missing data. We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data were reported in an unusable way. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by liaising with a third review author (DGB or SS). We will group the studies by health condition being targeted. We will create a miscellaneous category for studies focusing on rare conditions and single studies of a condition, for which we will extract basic study information and descriptive data, but not outcome data.\n\n【58】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【59】Two review authors (of BB, NH, NM) will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ Section ( Higgins 2017 ), and guidance from the EPOC group ( EPOC 2017b ). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by liaising with a third review author (DGB or SS). We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains:\n\n【60】1.  Random sequence generation.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment.\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel.\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment.\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting.\n    \n7.  Baseline outcomes measurement.\n    \n8.  Baseline characteristics.\n    \n9.  Other bias.\n    \n\n【61】We will judge each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgment in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise the 'Risk of bias' judgments across different studies for each of the domains listed. We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes where necessary (e.g. for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of bias for all‐cause mortality may be very different than for a self‐reported pain scale). We will assess incomplete outcome data separately for different outcomes. Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will not exclude studies on the grounds of their risk of bias, but will clearly report the risk of bias when presenting the results of the studies.\n\n【62】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome.\n\n【63】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations form it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.\n\n【64】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【65】We will estimate the effect of the intervention using risk ratio for dichotomous data, together with the appropriate associated 95% confidence interval and standardised mean difference for continuous data, together with the 95% appropriate associated confidence interval ( Higgins 2011 ). We will ensure that an increase in scores for continuous outcomes can be interpreted in the same way for each outcome, explain the direction to the reader, and report where the directions were reversed if this was necessary.\n\n【66】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【67】We will control for unit of analyses errors by re‐analysing results while adjusting for clustering. If there is not enough information to re‐analyse the results we will try to contact the study authors to obtain the necessary data. If we are not able to access all the data we will not report confidence intervals or P values ( EPOC 2017c ).\n\n【68】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【69】We will contact investigators to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is identified as abstract only). We will try to compute missing summary data from other reported statistics. Whenever it is not possible to obtain data, we will report the level of missingness and consider how that might impact the certainty of the evidence.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【71】If we find studies that are similar enough to combine, we will conduct a meta‐analysis ( Borenstein 2009 ). We will use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identify substantial heterogeneity we will explore it by pre‐specified subgroup analysis.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【73】We will attempt to contact study authors, asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results **.** If we are able to pool more than 10 trials, we will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible publication biases, interpreting the results with caution ( Sterne 2011 ).\n\n【74】#### Data synthesis\n\n【75】We will undertake meta‐analyses only where this is meaningful, that is, if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense ( Borenstein 2009 ). A common way that trialists indicate when they have skewed data is by reporting medians and interquartile ranges. When we encounter this we will note that the data were skewed and consider the implication of this. Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. intervention A versus usual care and intervention B versus usual care) must be entered into the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【76】##### GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【77】Two review authors will independently assess the certainty of the evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) using the five GRADE considerations (risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) ( Guyatt 2008 ). We will use methods and recommendations described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions_ ( Schünemann 2017 ), and the EPOC worksheets ( EPOC 2017d ), and using GRADEpro software ( GRADEpro GDT ). We will resolve disagreements on certainty ratings by discussion and provide justification for decisions to down‐ or up‐grade the ratings using footnotes in the table and make comments to aid readers' understanding of the review where necessary. We will use plain language statements to report these findings in the review ( EPOC 2017e ).\n\n【78】We will create 'Summary of findings' tables for the main intervention comparison(s) and include the following outcomes to draw conclusions about the certainty of the evidence within the text of the review: time between presentation and appropriate response by provider; mortality and health‐related quality of life; clients acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention; resource use; and unintended consequences. If we find enough studies, we will create one summary of findings table each for more common health conditions (e.g., heart failure, diabetes, mental health, asthma). If we find enough studies, we will separate studies according to their main function (monitoring, consulting, and delivering treatment).\n\n【79】We will consider whether there is any additional outcome information that was not able to be incorporated into meta‐analyses and note this in the comments and state if it supports or contradicts the information from the meta‐analyses. If it is not possible to meta‐analyse the data we will summarise the results in the text.\n\n【80】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【81】We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses.\n\n【82】1.  Healthcare provider type (e.g. lay versus professional healthcare provider). Lay health workers often provide healthcare in settings where healthcare resources are scarcer, for example targeting epidemics in low‐ and middle‐income countries and the specific health needs of minority communities in high‐income countries ( Lewin 2010 ). Because lay health workers have no formal professional tertiary education, their knowledge and beliefs might moderate the effects of the intervention ( Akinlua 2016 ).\n    \n2.  Type of communication channel (e.g. voice, SMS, interactive voice response, image exchange). Different communication channels might be used differently and serve distinct purposes ( Ventola 2014 ), as well as providing a more comprehensive and realistic opportunity for communication.\n    \n3.  Setting/income level (e.g. low‐income versus high‐income settings). Traditionally, the quality of healthcare is lower in low‐ and middle‐income countries ( Mills 2014 ), which might increase heterogeneity and pre‐empt the pooled analysis of studies conducted in different settings.\n    \n\n【83】We will use the following outcomes in subgroup analysis.\n\n【84】1.  Time between presentation and appropriate management by provider, including change in time for clients to receive/access health services and information;\n    \n2.  clients' health status and well‐being; and\n    \n3.  clients' utilisation of healthcare services.\n    \n\n【85】We will use the formal statistical techniques of Mantel‐Haenszel and regression to test for subgroup interactions ( Mantel 1959 ).\n\n【86】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【87】We will perform sensitivity analyses defined a priori to assess the robustness of our conclusions and explore its impact on effect sizes. This will involve restricting the analysis to published studies and restricting the analysis to studies with a low risk of bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "02bff441-bb52-4f5d-8f7e-ea46f8206c8b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the safety and efficacy of optical/video laryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy when used for intubation in children, with regard to: intubation time; number of attempts at intubation; changes in oxygen saturation; and adverse effects, including abnormal haemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Tracheal intubation is a lifesaving procedure, and an important step in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which helps in establishing an artificial airway ( Zhao 2014 ). In the operating theatre, tracheal intubation is usually applied after anaesthesia induction to facilitate a secured airway in cases involving neuromuscular paralysis and positive pressure ventilation ( Zhao 2014 ). A direct laryngoscope is the most widely used device to facilitate tracheal intubation ( Scott 2009 ), but is considered difficult to apply for novice personnel; it is reported that a 90% success rate requires 47 times of intubation practice ( Mulcaster 2003 ).\n\n【7】Problems with tracheal intubation were the most frequently recorded primary airway problem with difficult, delayed and failed intubation, as well as \"can’t intubate can’t ventilate\" scenarios ( Woodall 2011 ). Unfortunately, physical findings on examination of the airway discriminate poorly between potentially easy and difficult intubations ( Shiga 2005 ). Direct laryngoscopy (DL) occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Such difficulty, even if ultimately overcome, may result in multiple laryngoscopic attempts and significant morbidity, such as desaturation, airway and dental injuries, and cardiac arrest leading to neurological impairment. Rarely, such incidents may cause death ( Cheney 1999 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Intubation was rarely performed in children before the 1940s, by which time there had been an improvement in the understanding of childhood physiology under anaesthesia and some specialist anaesthetic equipment for children had been developed ( Costarino 2005 ). Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the person's vocal cords by a means other than obtaining a direct line of sight. There are a number of different types of indirect laryngoscope that facilitate intubation. Classic examples are fibreoptic and video laryngoscopes.\n\n【10】The fibreoptic laryngoscope is a single‐use device for tracheal intubation. The curvature of the blade and the special internal arrangement of the optical components allow visualization of the glottic plane without alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes, which may facilitate an easier glottic exposure ( Zhao 2014 ). The combination of the fibreoptic bronchoscope and the laryngoscope led to the development of video laryngoscopes, providing a video‐based view of the glottic opening, with or without additional guidance of the tube towards the tracheal opening ( Theiler 2013 ). In general, these techniques offer the advantage of abandoning the need to align the optical axis in the pharynx and mouth to visualize the entrance of the larynx ( Jungbauer 2009 ). However, it remains unclear if this translates into increased success with intubation ( Griesdale 2012 ; White 2012 ).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Intubation in children is increasingly performed using optical/video laryngoscopes, and these are now emerging as important adjuncts in airway management ( Fiadjoe 2012 ). A video camera at the tip of the blade can potentially provide an increased angle and a magnified view of the glottis in the normal and difficult paediatric airway ( Vlatten 2009 ). Optical laryngoscopes use magnifying mirrors, a light source, and a guide to help in visualization of the vocal cords and passing the endotracheal tube. Specific to paediatric anaesthesia, it is more difficult for the trainer and learner to share the same view, and the excellent view and remote screen of the indirect laryngoscope may therefore be particularly useful ( Macnair 2009 ).\n\n【13】In adults both manikin and human studies have suggested that video laryngoscopy provides superior intubating conditions and has a shorter learning curve ( Vlatten 2012 ). Paediatric studies suggest that video laryngoscopy is equally suitable to facilitate intubation compared to direct laryngoscopy ( Fiadjoe 2012 ; Kim 2011 ; Redel 2009 ; Vlatten 2012 ). A study using paramedics, medical students, respiratory therapists, and nurses in the live situation of the operating room showed that video‐laryngoscopy has higher success rates and shorter times to intubation for adults ( Jungbauer 2009 ). Moreover, a systematic review of adult intubation using video laryngoscopy has shown some improvement in intubation outcomes ( Griesdale 2012 ).\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Airway management and intubation are important in both elective and emergency situations where a secure airway is required. The current practice is to use direct laryngoscopy to facilitate intubation. Optical/video laryngoscopy has the potential to facilitate successful intubation and improve intubation outcomes. Kim 2008 reported that in children, video laryngoscopy provided a laryngoscopic view equal to or better than that of direct laryngoscopy. Video laryngoscopy is easier to use by the investigators and results in a lower alteration in the heart rate ( Maharaj 2006 ; Waleed 2012 ); however, to date there have been no systematic reviews to address the effects of optical/video laryngoscopy on paediatric intubation outcomes.\n\n【16】Our review excludes neonatal intubations, as this age group have different airway anatomy and intubation techniques. It is beyond the scope of this review to address the cost effectiveness and global health or policy‐based impact of this expensive and technology‐dependent intervention.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the safety and efficacy of optical/video laryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy when used for intubation in children, with regard to: intubation time; number of attempts at intubation; changes in oxygen saturation; and adverse effects, including abnormal haemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】We will include only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare intubations of children, using either optical or video laryngoscopy, to direct laryngoscopy. We will exclude manikin and simulation studies.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】We will include children aged 28 days to 16 years who needed intubation as an elective or emergency procedure done in the operating room.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】Any optical/video laryngoscope used for intubation of children compared with direct laryngoscopy. We will include all the different types of optical and video laryngoscopy devices used for intubation in children.\n\n【27】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【28】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【29】1.  Intubation time.\n    \n2.  The number of attempts at intubation and unsuccessful intubation.\n    \n3.  Adverse haemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation, including changes in: oxygen saturation, mean blood pressure, heart rate and heart rhythm.\n    \n\n【30】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【31】1.  Other adverse effects of intubation in children, including trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, assessed by visual or laryngoscopic examination.\n    \n2.  Vocal cord view score.\n    \n\n【32】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【33】#### Electronic searches\n\n【34】We will search the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ ), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to date), EMBASE (Ovid SP, 1974 to date), and CINAHL (EBSCO, 1982 to date) . See Appendix 1 for the search strategy that we will use in this review. We will adapt the search terms used in MEDLINE for the other database sources.\n\n【35】#### Searching other resources\n\n【36】We will search for the current unpublished ongoing clinical trials on the following websites: www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials . We will search relevant conference proceedings, abstracts and internal reports, and will contact authors of studies for unpublished data or studies. We will review the reference lists for other possible clinical trials and personal collections of articles if needed. We will apply no language restriction, and will undertake English translation of relevant studies if needed.\n\n【37】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【38】#### Selection of studies\n\n【39】We will follow the standard methods of the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group. Two review authors (IA and MM) will independently assess the titles and the abstracts, and, if needed, the full text of the identified studies, for inclusion eligibility in this review. We will resolve any disagreement by consultation with a third author (JL).\n\n【40】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【41】We will obtain full‐text versions of all studies that may be included in the review for assessment. We will use the form provided by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group for data extraction, which the review authors will do independently when we identify eligible trials (see Appendix 2 ). We will compare the extracted data for any differences, which we will resolve by discussion. We will enter the data into Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 5.3 ) for further processing and analysis.\n\n【42】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【43】Two review authors (IA and MM) will independently assess the risk of bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【44】We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third review author (JL). We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains :\n\n【45】1.  Random sequence generation (selection bias);\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment (selection bias);\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias);\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias);\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias);\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias).\n    \n\n【46】We will grade each potential risk of bias as being at low, high or unclear risk. We will detail all of the judgements made for all the included studies in the review regarding the risk of bias assessment in the 'Risk of bias' tables, which will be part of the 'Characteristics of included studies' tables.\n\n【47】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【48】We will report the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data.\n\n【49】We will calculate the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data.\n\n【50】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【51】We will assess only RCTs, with the unit of analysis being the participating child that needed intubation. We will not assess cluster‐randomized trials, cross‐over trials or studies with multiple treatment groups.\n\n【52】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【53】We will contact the authors of published studies for further clarification or to provide additional information if required. We will highlight all missing data as part of the Results section. We will analyse all the randomized children on an intention‐to‐treat basis (ITT). We will discuss any drop‐out of children after randomization in the review, to address the implications and their effect on the results if applicable.\n\n【54】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【55】We anticipate heterogeneity of studies, due to nature of the interventions used. We will use the I² statistic ( Higgins 2002 ) to measure heterogeneity among the trials. We will further explore this by subgroup analysis if appropriate.\n\n【56】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【57】We will contact study authors to retrieve any missing data, if suspected. We will use a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of including studies with missing data in the overall assessment of results ( Egger 1997 ). If at least 10 studies contribute to an outcome, we will create a funnel plot to investigate the potential of reporting and publication biases.\n\n【58】#### Data synthesis\n\n【59】We will perform statistical analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group. We will use the statistical package Review Manager 5 provided by The Cochrane Collaboration for data synthesis and analysis. We will report all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As we expect heterogeneity between studies, we will undertake meta‐analysis with a random‐effects model. We will explore the influence of predefined subgroups if enough data are available.\n\n【60】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【61】Planned subgroup analyses, where data are available, will be based on:\n\n【62】1.  The degree of airway difficulty;\n    \n2.  The age of the child;\n    \n3.  The skill level of the operator;\n    \n4.  The type of video laryngoscopy equipment used; and\n    \n5.  Emergency versus elective intubation.\n    \n\n【63】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【64】We will use sensitivity analyses to explore the potential impact of missing data and any methodological heterogeneity. If we have sufficient data, we will test the robustness of the evidence by a sensitivity analysis, omitting studies at high risk of bias from the meta‐analysis. We will assess high risk of bias according to the following domains: Random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.\n\n【65】##### Summary of findings\n\n【66】We will use the principles of the GRADE system ( Guyatt 2008 ) to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes (reduction in the intubation time, the number of attempts at intubation, unsuccessful intubation, adverse haemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation, and improving the vocal cord view), and will construct a 'Summary of findings' (SoF) table using the GRADE software. The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. It takes account of within‐study risk of bias (methodological quality), the directness of the evidence, the heterogeneity of the data, the precision of effect estimates, and the risk of publication bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched trial registries and major international stroke conference proceedings, scanned reference lists, and contacted select individuals known to the review team who are actively involved in psychological aspects of stroke research, and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion in the review.

We performed a narrative review.

Both trials used the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A) to assess anxiety, and neither included a placebo control group. One trial randomised 81 patients to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy or standard care. Mean level of anxiety severity scores were 58% and 71% lower in the paroxetine, and paroxetine plus psychotherapy groups respectively compared with those in standard care at follow‐up (P < 0.01). The second trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co‐morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow‐up, the mean level of anxiety was significantly lower for those receiving buspirone relative to controls (P < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. No information was provided about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There is insufficient evidence to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. The data available suggest that pharmaceutical therapy (paroxetine and buspirone) may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in stroke patients with co‐morbid anxiety and depression. No information was available for stroke patients with anxiety only.

This review of two trials, which included 175 participants, found that antidepressant and anxiety reducing drugs decreased the severity of anxiety symptoms. However, they also increased side effects. One trial showed that combining an antidepressant with psychotherapy also decreased anxiety symptom severity but not to a greater extent than antidepressant treatment alone. The findings are only applicable to stroke patients with both anxiety and depression as we did not find any studies that considered stroke patients with anxiety only. Future research will need to ensure that stroke patients with anxiety alone are also included in trials, and these trials should include a placebo control group.\n\n【33】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【34】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the benefit and harm of hPTH in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Osteoporosis is a chronic disorder of bone remodeling in which bone resorption exceeds bone formation. Reduced bone mass and deteriorated bone structure contribute to an increased fracture risk, primarily of the spine, the hip and the forearm. Osteoporosis predominantly affects postmenopausal women, but also men and patients on long‐term corticosteroid therapy. Diagnosis is based on measurement of bone mineral density and defined as more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean of peak bone mineral density for the same sex. Osteoporosis is a widespread disease with a considerable medical and socioeconomic burden. The US Department of Health and Human Services projects that the disease will have an impact on more than 10 million women by 2020 ( Schuiling 2011 ). Treatment for osteoporosis comprises mostly antiresorptive drugs (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin, oestrogen, selective oestrogen receptor modulators). Bone anabolics, such as human parathyroid hormone preparations, are an alternative approach and currently prescribed for osteoporosis treatment and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures (e.g. Briot 2012 ). Combination therapy (antiresorptive and anabolic drugs) for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis is also undergoing clinical trials for assessment of cost‐effectiveness and safety ( Compston 2012 ). Other treatment options for postmenopausal osteoporosis have also been evaluated in Cochrane reviews, e.g. strontium ranelate ( O'Donnell 2004 ), etidronate ( Wells 2008a ), risedronate ( Wells 2008b ) and alendronate ( Wells 2008c ).\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) is currently available in two forms for osteoporosis treatment: as a full‐length parathyroid hormone (1‐84) and teriparatide (1‐34), and for daily subcutaneous administration. This is the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis. Recent non‐Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials have shown that teriparatide (hPTH 1‐34) significantly improved bone mineral density at the spine and hip, and significantly reduced the risk of vertebral and non‐vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with prior fractures ( Cranney 2006 ; Han 2012 ; Silverman 2012 ). Treatment for 24 months showed improvement of lumbar bone mineral density ( Black 2012 ). Poor adherence is a major problem with this type of treatment in the first year, and an even greater problem in the second, as reported in almost all trials ( Baron 2012 ).\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】Parathyroid hormone acts to stimulate bone turnover, promoting bone formation to a greater extent than bone resorption (e.g. Jilka 2007 ; Silva 2011 ). The outcome is an increase of bone mass, in particular of the trabecular thickness and connectivity, but also bone structure and strength (e.g. Black 2012 ; Ferrari 2012 ). The anabolic action of intermittent parathyroid hormone administration has better results on the spine than the hip, which has less trabecular bone than the vertebrae; this is due to direct effects on osteoblasts and indirect effects through skeletal growth factors ( Jilka 2007 ; Silva 2011 ).\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】The proposed systematic review will provide the best evidence on the benefit and harm of anabolic therapy for osteoporosis. This is particularly important because osteoporosis is a chronic disease that affects large segments of the population and presents a significant economic burden to society. For example, acute care costs for osteoporosis in Canada have been estimated at CAD 1.2 billion ( Tarride 2012 ). In Germany, an economic simulation model to predict the burden of incident osteoporosis‐attributable fractures showed that this burden would sharply increase until 2050, creating heavy demand for hospital and long‐term care in the future ( Bleibler 2013 ). Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding the benefit and harm of hPTH as a recent study has demonstrated adverse effects, including increased plasma and urine calcium, arthralgia and headache ( Black 2012 ).\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To determine the benefit and harm of hPTH in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Published randomised controlled trials (RCT) (full reports in a peer‐reviewed journal and conference abstracts). Studies published in any language will be considered.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】Trials including postmenopausal women (surgical or natural menopause with at least 12 months of continuous amenorrhoea) with diagnosed osteoporosis based on dual x‐ray absorptiometry results (lumbar spine, hip or both). Trials including male osteoporosis and corticosteroid osteoporosis will be excluded.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】Trials of hPTH (1‐34, 1‐84, 1‐38) versus placebo or other therapy regimens for osteoporosis (e.g. hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcium/vitamin D) will be included. Dosages of hPTH to be included are as follows: 20 and 40 µg/daily for hPTH 1‐34 and/or 100 µg/daily by subcutaneous injection for hPTH 1‐84. All trial lengths will be included, categorised into short‐, moderate‐ and long‐term outcomes (6, 12 and ≥ 24 months, respectively).\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】##### Major outcomes\n\n【25】1.  Incident fractures – vertebral\n    \n2.  Incident fractures – hip\n    \n3.  Incident fractures – wrist\n    \n4.  Quality of life\n    \n5.  Clinical gastrointestinal symptoms\n    \n6.  Withdrawals due to adverse events\n    \n7.  Serious adverse events (death, hospitalisation, hypercalcaemia)\n    \n\n【26】##### Minor outcomes\n\n【27】1.  Incident fractures (other fractures, non‐vertebral)\n    \n2.  Improvement in skeletal pain sensation (e.g. back pain)\n    \n\n【28】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【29】#### Electronic searches\n\n【30】We will search the following electronic databases, unrestricted by date or language:\n\n【31】1.  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via _The Cochrane Library_ , current issue);\n    \n2.  MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to present);\n    \n3.  EMBASE (via OVID 1947 to present);\n    \n4.  ISI Web of Science via Thomson Web of Knowledge 1996 to present (for conference proceedings).\n    \n\n【32】The MEDLINE search strategy (see Appendix 1 ) will combine the subject search with the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for identifying reports of randomised controlled trials (as published in Box 6.4c in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ Version 5.1.0, updated March 2011) and will be modified for the other databases ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【33】#### Searching other resources\n\n【34】##### Handsearch of literature\n\n【35】We will handsearch major bone topic peer‐reviewed journals from 1996 to present: _Osteoporosis International_ , _Journal of Bone and Mineral Research_ , _Calcified Tissue International_ and _Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism_ .\n\n【36】We will select trials for closer examination if they appear to meet the criteria of being a randomised controlled trial and including a postmenopausal population as participants.\n\n【37】##### Trial registries\n\n【38】We will search for ongoing studies in the following trial registries.\n\n【39】*   ClinicalTrials.Gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov )\n    \n*   International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ), which includes the following registries:\n    \n    *   Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry\n        \n    *   ClinicalTrials.gov\n        \n    *   EU Clinical Trials Register (EU‐CTR)\n        \n    *   ISRCTN\n        \n    *   Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (ReBec)\n        \n    *   Chinese Clinical Trial Registry\n        \n    *   Clinical Trials Registry – India\n        \n    *   Clinical Research Information Service ‐ Republic of Korea\n        \n    *   Cuban Public Registry of Clinical Trials\n        \n    *   German Clinical Trials Register\n        \n    *   Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials\n        \n    *   Japan Primary Registries Network\n        \n    *   Pan African Clinical Trial Registry\n        \n    *   Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry\n        \n    *   The Netherlands National Trial Register\n        \n\n【40】##### Unpublished works\n\n【41】For unpublished but completed studies, we will contact the responsible researcher indicated in the registry.\n\n【42】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【43】#### Selection of studies\n\n【44】Two members of the review team (VK, AM) will carry out the selection of papers and make decisions about eligibility independently. We will obtain a full copy of all possibly or definitely relevant studies for further assessment. The review authors will independently determine study eligibility and discrepancies will be resolved by discussion and consensus. We will consult a statistician (AJ) in cases of doubt about inclusion or data extraction, as well as with regard to data analysis. We will contact authors for clarification and to obtain additional data in order to perform a systematic review whenever necessary. Studies will be translated into English when necessary.\n\n【45】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【46】Two members of the review team (VK, AM) will independently extract relevant data from selected studies according to the inclusion criteria. Possible doubts and disagreements will be discussed and, if they cannot be resolved, we will contact the authors of the original articles for clarification.\n\n【47】We will use standard tables for the characteristics of included studies and risk of bias to minimise errors. We will consider abstracts together with the full publication. The review authors will not be blinded to the authors, interventions or results obtained in the included studies. For each study, we will extract the patient and study characteristics, intervention and outcomes data. We will extract the raw data (means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events and participants for dichotomous outcomes) for the outcomes of interest. We will pilot test predefined data extraction forms and use these, accompanied by a codebook, to collect data. Patient data will also include ethnicity. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion. We will extract both the generic and trade name of the experimental intervention, the type of control used, dosage and frequency, duration of treatment, patient characteristics (average age, postmenopause duration), types of measures used for the outcomes, trial design, trial size, duration of follow‐up, type and source of financial support and publication status.\n\n【48】A priori decision rules for the selection of which data to extract in the event of multiple outcome reporting, are the following:\n\n【49】*   if both final values and change from baseline values are reported for the same outcome, we will extract both; present the change scores as one subgroup, and the final values as another subgroup, and then combine the two in an overall analysis;\n    \n*   if both unadjusted and adjusted values for the same outcome are reported, we will extract both and include adjusted values in the meta‐analysis;\n    \n*   if data are analysed based on an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) sample and another sample (e.g. per‐protocol, as treated), we will extract both, regardless of whether the outcomes assess benefits or harms; and use intention‐to‐treat data in analyses.\n    \n*   if multiple time points are used, we will extract data for 6, 12, 24 and longer periods.\n    \n\n【50】When necessary, we will approximate means and measures of dispersion from the figures in the reports. Whenever possible, we will use results from an intention‐to‐treat analysis.\n\n【51】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【52】Two review authors (VK, AJ) will independently assess risk of bias for all included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias tool ( Higgins 2011 ). The tool addresses seven domains: 1) random sequence generation, 2) allocation concealment (selection bias), 3) blinding of participants and researchers (performance bias), 4) blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), 5) incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), 6) selective reporting (reporting bias) and 7) other sources of bias ( Higgins 2011 ). In the case of lack of important study information, we will contact authors to obtain the information needed, using open‐ended questions. To determine the risk of bias of a study, for each criterion we will evaluate the presence of sufficient information and the likelihood of potential bias. We will rate each criterion as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias (either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias). In a consensus meeting, disagreements among the review authors will be discussed and resolved. If consensus cannot be reached, a third review author will make the final decision.\n\n【53】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【54】We will perform meta‐analysis for benefit and harm outcomes if the data from the studies are clinically and methodologically sufficiently homogeneous. The starting point of all meta‐analyses of studies of effectiveness will involve identification of the data type for the outcome measurements.\n\n【55】For dichotomous data, we will express the results of each RCT as risk ratio (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI).\n\n【56】For continuous data, we will analyse results as mean difference (MD) between the intervention and comparator group with 95% CIs. We will use standardised mean difference (SMD) for outcomes that measure the same construct using different tools.\n\n【57】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【58】For cross‐over trials, we will extract data from the first period only. For studies containing more than two intervention groups, to make multiple pair‐wise comparisons between all possible pairs of intervention groups, we will adjust the comparison groups so that patients are only counted once in the meta‐analysis following the procedure recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【59】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【60】For missing summary data, we will impute missing standard deviations from other statistics such as standard errors, confidence intervals or P values, according to the methods recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). Whenever possible, we will contact the original investigators to request missing data. We will explain the possible impact of missing data in the Discussion section of the systematic review.\n\n【61】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【62】Prior to meta‐analysis, we will first assess studies for clinical homogeneity with respect to type of therapy, control group and outcomes.\n\n【63】We will not combine clinically heterogeneous studies in the analysis but describe them separately. We will assess heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots. For studies judged as clinically homogenous, we will test statistical heterogeneity using the Chi <sup>2 </sup> (Q) test and the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic ( Higgins 2011 ). A P value of less than 0.10 or an I <sup>2 </sup> value greater than 50% indicates substantial heterogeneity.\n\n【64】In cases of substantial heterogeneity (ie, I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 50% ), we will explore the data further, including subgroup analyses, to try to explain it.\n\n【65】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【66】To determine whether reporting bias is present, we will look for the trial protocol published by the authors before starting recruitment of the study participants. We will compare trial protocols with subsequent publication(s) to identify any discrepancies in the outcomes reported.\n\n【67】All trials that began enrolment of participants after September 2005 are supposed to be registered in a public trials registry at or before the onset of enrolment in order to be considered for publication in the major medical journals belonging to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Therefore, for studies published after 1 July 2005, we will check the Clinical Trial Register at the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization. If we do not find protocols, we will compare the outcomes listed in the methods section of a publication with the reported results. For each study, we will evaluate whether selective reporting of outcomes is present. In the case of suspected reporting bias, we will contact study authors for clarification.\n\n【68】We will make a funnel plot if there are at least 10 studies included in the review to assess the possibility of publication bias. A test for funnel plot asymmetry (small study effects) formally examines whether the association between estimated intervention effects and a measure of study size is greater than might be expected to occur by chance. We will interpret the results from tests for funnel plot asymmetry cautiously. When there is evidence of small study effects, we will consider publication bias as only one of a number of possible explanations. In these circumstances, we will attempt to understand the source of small study effects and consider their implication in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【69】#### Data synthesis\n\n【70】The aim is to pool results from individual studies statistically for each intervention, to estimate an overall effect. Where studies are sufficiently homogenous that it is clinically meaningful for them to be pooled, we will use meta‐analysis with the random‐effects model. In the case of significant results we will also calculate the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or harm (NNTH). We will perform analysis using Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2012 ) and produce forest plots for all analyses.\n\n【71】If the meta‐analyses result in statistically significant overall estimates, we will transform these results (pooled estimate of RR, MD or SMD) back into measures which are clinically useful in daily practice, such as the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or harm (NNTH) and the absolute or relative improvement in the original units, when we express the final results of the review. We will translate the results back by multiplying the SMD by the standard deviation from a representative study ( Akl 2011 ).\n\n【72】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【73】Where sufficient data are available, the following subgroup analyses are planned.\n\n【74】1.  Doses of hPTH (20 and 40 μg/daily for hPTH 1‐34 and/or 100 μg/daily for hPTH 1‐84)\n    \n2.  Patients' age (45 to 65 years versus 66 to 80 years)\n    \n3.  Duration of osteoporosis (five years and under versus more than five years)\n    \n4.  Previous medication for osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, yes or no)\n    \n\n【75】All major outcomew will be used for these analyses.\n\n【76】The differences between subgroups will be assessed using the formal test in RevMan.\n\n【77】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【78】We will examine the 'Risk of bias' results for each study. If there are sufficient studies with low overall risk of bias, i.e. estimate low risk of bias on all domains of theThe Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias tool ( Higgins 2011 ), we will perform meta‐analyses on these studies first. If insufficient studies exist with low overall risk of bias, we will determine the number of studies where there is low risk of bias for the following domains: selective reporting, incomplete outcome assessment, unclear allocation concealment, those with subjective outcomes (e.g. pain) or those with unclear or inadequate blinding of outcome assessor. If there are a sufficient number of these studies we will meta‐analyse these. We will then perform sensitivity analysis to assess how the results of meta‐analyses for all major outcomes might be affected if studies with unclear or high risk of bias in these domains are included.\n\n【79】For studies with missing data, we will perform sensitivity analyses to assess how sensitive the results are to the assumptions made by imputing missing data. If the analysis of heterogeneity finds one or more outlying studies with results that conflict with the rest of the studies, we will perform sensitivity analysis to assess the influence on the results of the meta‐analysis.\n\n【80】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【81】We will present the main results of the study in a 'Summary of findings' table, which we will produce using GRADEpro software. This table will provide key information concerning the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of effect of the intervention examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes. The table will include an overall grading of the evidence related to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE approach, as indicated in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【82】The important outcomes that could be included in the 'Summary of findings' tables are:\n\n【83】1.  Incident fractures – vertebral\n    \n2.  Incident fractures – hip\n    \n3.  Incident fractures – wrist\n    \n4.  Quality of life\n    \n5.  Clinical gastrointestinal symptoms\n    \n6.  Withdrawals due to adverse events\n    \n7.  Serious adverse events (death, hospitalisation, hypercalcaemia)\n    \n\n【84】Minor outcomes will be included in additional tables:\n\n【85】1.  Incident fractures ‐ other fractures, non‐vertebral\n    \n2.  Improvement in skeletal pain sensation (e.g. back pain)\n    \n\n【86】The tables will present data separately for the moderate‐term outcomes (12 months; main table) and also for the short‐ and long‐term outcomes (6 and ≥ 24 months, respectively) for all interventions and comparators.\n\n【87】In the 'Comments' column of the 'Summary of findings' table, we will provide the absolute per cent difference, the relative per cent change from baseline and the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or harm (NNTH) (the NNT will be provided only when the outcome shows a statistically significant difference).\n\n【88】For dichotomous outcomes, such as serious adverse events, we will calculate the NNT from the control group event rate and the risk ratio using the Visual Rx NNT calculator ( Cates 2008 ). We will calculate the NNT for continuous measures using the Wells calculator (available at the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group editorial office).\n\n【89】For dichotomous outcomes, we will calculate the absolute risk difference using the risk difference statistic in RevMan and express the result as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, we will calculate the absolute benefit as the improvement in the intervention group minus the improvement in the control group, in the original units.\n\n【90】We will calculate the relative per cent change for dichotomous data as the risk ratio ‐ 1 and express this as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, we will calculate the relative difference in the change from baseline as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3148d174-6e45-4186-b315-7313be18f3ad", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, on maternal morbidity and mortality, and on the child in later life of administering different types of corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone), different corticosteroid dose regimens and mode of administration.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation), especially those born before 32 weeks' gestation, are at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ( Crowther 2007 ). This is a serious complication and remains the primary cause of early neonatal death and disability ( Roberts 2006 ). Those infants born preterm who do survive the neonatal period are at a significantly increased risk of long‐term neurological disability ( Johnson 1993 ).\n\n【6】RDS develops as a consequence of surfactant deficiency and immature lung development. The risk of RDS and neonatal mortality reduces as gestation increases, reflecting maturity of organ systems ( Doyle 2001 ; Moise 1995 ; Roberts 2006 ). RDS is seen in 20% of low birthweight babies (less than 2500 g) and 66% of extremely low birthweight babies (less than 1500 g) ( Roberts 2006 ). Preterm birth poses a significant health burden affecting approximately 5% to 10% of all babies in developed countries ( Haram 2003 ). Treatments that may reduce the incidence of RDS in infants born preterm, including prenatal corticosteroids, have therefore received considerable attention ( Roberts 2006 ).\n\n【7】**Corticosteroids**  \nCorticosteroids act by altering gene expression resulting in glucocorticoid effects, including gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, lipolysis, suppression of immune responses and mineralocorticoid effects, including hypertension, sodium and water retention and potassium loss ( AMH 2006 ). In the fetal lung, the action of corticosteroids leads to an increase in protein production, biosynthesis of phospholipids and the appearance of surfactant ( Roberts 2006 ).\n\n【8】Liggins 1969 demonstrated that the lungs of lambs born preterm became functionally mature following antenatal corticosteroid administration. Following these initial animal studies, several clinical trials were conducted to assess the effects of corticosteroids before preterm birth.\n\n【9】The Cochrane review of antenatal corticosteroid therapy showed that a single course of antenatal corticosteroids reduced the incidence of RDS (relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.73, 21 trials, 4038 infants) ( Roberts 2006 ). Other beneficial effects included a reduction in neonatal death, cerebroventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, infectious morbidity, need for respiratory support and neonatal intensive care unit admission. For the mother, corticosteroid use was not shown to increase the risk of death, chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis ( Roberts 2006 ). Contrary to the concern that corticosteroid treatment may increase infection in those with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes ( Imseis 1996 ) or increase the rate of stillbirth in those with pregnancy related hypertension ( Liggins 1976 ), this Cochrane review confirmed that antenatal corticosteroid treatment is effective in these subgroups of women at risk of preterm birth ( Roberts 2006 ). Corticosteroids have become the standard of care for women at risk of preterm birth before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation in many countries.\n\n【10】Despite their widespread use, there is currently variation in clinical practice as to the type of corticosteroid used, the dose given, the route of administration and the frequency of administration of corticosteroid doses.\n\n【11】**Corticosteroid type**  \nCurrently either betamethasone or dexamethasone are the recommended corticosteroid regimens ( NIH 1995 ). Betamethasone comes in two different forms, as betamethasone sodium phosphate, a solution with a short biological half‐life of 36 to 72 hours, and betamethasone acetate, a suspension with a relatively long half‐life ( Jobe 2004 ; Katzung 2004 ; NNF5 2006 ). These drugs are often used in combination to maximize the drug's efficiency while reducing the number of injections given to the mother ( NNF5 2006 ). Dexamethasone generally comes in the form of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, a solution with a short biological half‐life of 36 to 72 hours ( Jobe 2004 ; Katzung 2004 ; NNF5 2006 ).\n\n【12】Both betamethasone and dexamethasone are able to cross the placenta in their active form and have comparable efficiency ( NNF5 2006 ). The chemical composition of dexamethasone and betamethasone are virtually identical except for the configuration of a methyl group in position 16 ( Bar‐Lev2004 ; NNF5 2006 ). Some dexamethasone preparations contain a sulphite preservative ( NNF5 2006 ). Sulphites have been linked to neurotoxicity in the newborn especially when in combination with peroxy nitrite ( Bar‐Lev2004 ; Baud 1999 ; Goldenberg 2001 ; Walfisch 2001 ).\n\n【13】The optimal type of corticosteroid to use for prenatal treatment remains unclear. The betamethasone and dexamethasone subgroup analysis in the Roberts 2006 Cochrane review showed comparable benefit when assessing short‐term outcomes in the neonate. Maternal outcomes were similar apart from an increase in puerperal sepsis (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.89, four trials, 536 women) in the dexamethasone treatment group compared with no treatment, while betamethasone did not show such an increase (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.72, four trials, 467 women) ( Roberts 2006 ).\n\n【14】The long‐term outcomes related to corticosteroid use have largely been positive. Within the Roberts 2006 Cochrane review, overall antenatal corticosteroid treatment was shown to reduce developmental delay and reduce cerebral palsy when compared with controls. It is not known if the long‐term outcomes vary by type of corticosteroid used. Whilst follow up at 30 years following use showed no clinical differences between infants exposed or not exposed to betamethasone ( Dalziel 2005 ), there are no similar long‐term follow‐up studies on dexamethasone use. There are no published data on the long‐term effects of betamethasone compared directly with dexamethasone.\n\n【15】**Corticosteroid dose, timing and frequency**  \nThe optimal corticosteroid dose, timing and frequency of administration similarly remains unclear. The common regimen of two doses of 12 mg of betamethasone given intramuscularly 24 hours apart and the treatment of four doses of 6 mg of dexamethasone given intramuscularly 12 hours apart was recommended by the NIH Consensus Development Panel on the Effect of Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturation on Perinatal outcomes ( NIH 1995 ). This dose corresponds to a high occupancy of steroid receptors in fetal tissues. Accompanying the benefits of corticosteroids, there is concern that at high doses corticosteroids may become adverse. There is a suggestion that the current doses used may be higher than needed ( Jobe 2004 ). Similarly, the rationale for two doses of betamethasone and four doses of dexamethasone and the effects of using different formulations for the initial and subsequent injections remain unclear ( Jobe 2004 ; NNF5 2006 ).\n\n【16】**Corticosteroid route**  \nThe optimal route of administration of dexamethasone and betamethasone is uncertain. Both drugs may be administered as intramuscular injections. Dexamethasone can be given orally; however, oral dexamethasone has been reported to increase neonatal sepsis and intraventricular hemorrhage ( Egerman 1998 ). Betamethasone can be given intra‐amniotically ( Lefebvre 1976 ; Murphy 1982 ) and intravenously ( Petersen 1983 ).\n\n【17】**Repeat steroid**  \nThe reduction in incidence of RDS by steroid therapy has been shown to be effective 24 hours to seven days after treatment ( Roberts 2006 ). There is a belief that the effectiveness of a single dose of antenatal corticosteroid in preventing RDS declines if it is administered seven days or more prior to birth ( Crowther 2007 ; Roberts 2006 ). Whether antenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth need to be repeated seven days after the initial course is assessed in another Cochrane review ( Crowther 2007 ); therefore, this review will not cover repeat steroid dosing compared with single dosing.\n\n【18】Other corticosteroid Cochrane reviews have examined inter‐study differences between regimens, in subgroup analysis. This review will assess studies making a head‐to‐head comparison of different regimens of corticosteroid type, dose, timing, frequency of dose per treatment course and route of administration. We will also attempt indirect comparisons comparing any corticosteroid with placebo following the methods of Song et al ( Song 2003 ). In addition, this systematic review will identify areas needing further research.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To assess the effects on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, on maternal morbidity and mortality, and on the child in later life of administering different types of corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone), different corticosteroid dose regimens and mode of administration.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】We will include all identified published and unpublished randomised controlled trials or quasi‐randomised control trials comparing any two corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone or any other corticosteroid that can cross the placenta), comparing different type, dose regimens or route in women with preterm labour. We will attempt indirect comparisons of published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing any corticosteroid with placebo following the methods of Song et al ( Song 2003 ).\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Women with a singleton or multiple pregnancy expected to give birth preterm (before 37 weeks) as a result of either spontaneous preterm labour, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or elective preterm birth.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】*   Comparisons of different corticosteroid types including betamethasone, dexamethasone or hydrocortisone or any other corticosteroid that can cross the placenta.\n    \n*   Comparisons of different corticosteroid dose regimens, frequency of administration or route.\n    \n\n【29】We will exclude trials which tested the effect of corticosteroids with other interventions; trials assessing repeat steroid dosing versus single steroid dosing; and trials assessing corticosteroid administration directly into the fetus.\n\n【30】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【31】These will cover outcomes of maternal morbidity, perinatal morbidity and mortality, child morbidity and mortality, child as adult morbidity and mortality and the use of health services by the mother and by the neonate or child.\n\n【32】They will be divided into primary outcomes, thought to be the most clinically significant, and secondary outcomes, including possible complications and also other measures of effectiveness.

 \n(2) monthly searches of MEDLINE;  \n(3) handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;  \n(4) weekly current awareness search of a further 36 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.\n\n【45】Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL and MEDLINE, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the 'Search strategies for identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.\n\n【46】Trials identified through the searching activities described above are given a code (or codes) depending on the topic. The codes are linked to review topics. The Trials Search Co‐ordinator searches the register for each review using these codes rather than keywords.\n\n【47】We will not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【48】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【49】**Selection of studies**  \nWe will assess trials for consideration of inclusion without consideration of the results. We will resolve any differences of opinion by discussion until we reach a consensus. There will be no blinding of authorship.\n\n【50】**Data extraction and management**  \nTwo review authors will extract the data using a predesigned form. Any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. We will contact authors of the original reports if further details are required.\n\n【51】**Assessment of methodological quality of included studies**  \nThe validity of each study will be assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2006 ). We will describe the methods used to generate the randomisation sequence in each trial.\n\n【52】_**(1) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)**_  \nWe will assign codes, using the following criteria:  \n(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomisation, consecutively‐numbered, sealed opaque envelopes;  \n(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;  \n(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random‐number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.\n\n【53】_**(2) Attrition bias (loss of participants, eg withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)**_  \nWe will assess completeness to follow up using the following criteria:  \n(A) less than 5% loss of participants;  \n(B) 5% to 9.9% loss of participants;  \n(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;  \n(D) more than 20% loss of participants.\n\n【54】_**(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)**_  \nWe will assess blinding using the following criteria:  \n(1) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);  \n(2) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);  \n(3) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).\n\n【55】**Measures of treatment effect**  \nStatistical analyses will be performed using the Review Manager software ( RevMan 2003 ). We will use fixed‐effect meta‐analysis for combining data in the absence of substantial heterogeneity where the trials are sufficiently similar.\n\n【56】**Dichotomous data**  \nFor dichotomous data, results will be presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【57】**Continuous data**  \nFor continuous data, we will use the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【58】**Dealing with missing data**  \nWe will extract data from the trials on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Where this is not done in the original report, re‐analysis will be performed where possible. If missing data are such that they might significantly affect the results, we will exclude these data from the analysis. If missing data later become available, they will be included in the analyses.\n\n【59】**Assessment of heterogeneity**  \nWe will apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, using the I² statistic. On identifying high levels of heterogeneity among the trials (exceeding 50%), we will explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis and perform sensitivity analysis. A random‐effects meta‐analysis will be used as an overall summary if it is considered appropriate.\n\n【60】**Sensitivity analyses**  \nWe will plan sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality assessed by concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation of concealment (rated C).\n\n【61】**Subgroup analyses**  \nThe following subgroups are to be analysed:\n\n【62】*   singleton versus multiple pregnancy;\n    \n*   gestational age at entry to trial (24 to 26 weeks, 27 to 29 weeks, 30 to 34 weeks, 35 to 37 weeks);\n    \n*   gestational age at delivery (24 to 26 weeks, 27 to 29 weeks, 30 to 34 weeks, 35 to 37 weeks);\n    \n*   prelabour rupture of membranes (at trial entry, more than 24 hours before delivery, more than 48 hours before delivery);\n    \n*   pregnancy‐induced hypertension syndromes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The review represents one from a family of four reviews focusing on interventions for drug‐using offenders. This specific review considers interventions aimed at reducing drug use or criminal activity, or both for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness in reducing criminal activity or drug use, or both.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched 14 electronic bibliographic databases up to May 2014 and 5 Internet resources (searched between 2004 and 11 November 2009). We contacted experts in the field for further information.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials designed to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse of drug use and criminal activity, or both in drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness. We also reported data on the cost and cost‐effectiveness of interventions.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Eight trials with 2058 participants met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the trials was generally difficult to rate due to a lack of clear reporting. On most 'Risk of bias' items, we rated the majority of studies as unclear. Overall, we could not statistically combine the results due to the heterogenous nature of the different study interventions and comparison groups. A narrative summary of the findings identified that the interventions reported limited success with reducing self report drug use, but did have some impact on re‐incarceration rates, but not re‐arrest. In the single comparisons, we found moderate‐quality evidence that therapeutic communities determine a reduction in re‐incarceration but reported less success for outcomes of re‐arrest, moderate quality of evidence and self report drug use. Three single studies evaluating case management via a mental health drug court (very low quality of evidence), motivational interviewing and cognitive skills (low and very low quality of evidence) and interpersonal psychotherapy (very low quality of evidence) did not report significant reductions in criminal activity and self report drug use respectively. Quality of evidence for these three types of interventions was low to very low. The trials reported some cost information, but it was not sufficient to be able to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of the interventions.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Two of the five trials showed some promising results for the use of therapeutic communities and aftercare, but only in relation to reducing subsequent re‐incarceration. Overall, the studies showed a high degree of variation, warranting a degree of caution in the interpretation of the magnitude of effect and direction of benefit for treatment outcomes. More evaluations are required to assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (9)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Legal Issues\n*   Substance-related Disorders\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Mental disorder\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (0)\n\n【22】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【23】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【24】*   Substance Use\n*   Criminal Activity\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental health problems represent a group who access treatment for a variety of different reasons. The complexity of the two problems makes the treatment and rehabilitation of this group particularly challenging.\n\n【33】**Study characteristics**\n\n【34】The review authors searched scientific databases and Internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (where participants are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) of interventions to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse or criminal activity of drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness. We included people of any gender, age, or ethnicity.\n\n【35】**Key results**\n\n【36】We identified eight trials evaluating treatments for drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness. The interventions included case management via a mental health court: a therapeutic community; an evaluation of motivational interviewing techniques and cognitive skills (a person's ability to process thoughts) in comparison to relaxation training; and an evaluation of interpersonal psychotherapy in comparison to a psycho‐educational intervention. Overall, the interventions reported limited success with reducing self report drug use, but did report some success with reducing re‐incarceration rates, but not re‐arrest. The therapeutic community studies reported a reduction in re‐incarceration but were shown to be less effective for re‐arrest and self report drug use. Three single studies evaluating case management via a mental health drug court, motivational interviewing and cognitive skills, and interpersonal psychotherapy did not report significant reductions in criminal activity and self report drug use respectively. Some information is provided on the costs and cost‐effectiveness of such interventions and trial evaluations focusing specifically on the needs of drug‐using offenders with co‐occurring mental illness are required.\n\n【37】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【38】This review was limited by the lack of information reported in this group of trials. The quality of the evidence was moderate for therapeutic community and low to very low for the other types of intervention. The evidence is current to May 2014.\n\n【39】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【40】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies that test the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for adults with head and neck cancer.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Head and neck cancer describes a range of tumours that arise in the head and neck region, which includes the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and salivary glands. The worldwide incidence of head and neck cancer exceeds half a million cases annually, ranking it as the fifth most common cancer worldwide ( Harrison 2009 ). With ongoing developments in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the overall survival rate for head and neck cancer has improved marginally but mainly for those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds ( CRUK 2011 ). Head and neck cancer is strongly associated with certain lifestyle factors, mainly tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption ( Duffy 2007 ).\n\n【7】Cancer has a significant impact on the lives of many people and is life‐disrupting on many levels. A diagnosis of head and neck cancer, like any other cancer, brings with it significant psychosocial effects including uncertainty and fear. Patients with head and neck cancer have very specific needs, due to the location of their disease. Many patients face the reality of altered appearance, changes to their speech, swallowing and breathing and high levels of symptomatology (pain, xerostomia, shoulder dysfunction). The burden of head and neck cancer can manifest in psychosocial distress and social isolation, which can have a negative impact on quality of life ( Semple 2008 ). The prevalence of psychological distress amongst head and neck cancer patients is difficult to estimate, with reported incidences of psychological morbidity varying from 12% to 45%, depending on the criteria and diagnostic tool utilised ( Frampton 2001 ; Haman 2008 ; Veer 2010 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】As treatments for head and neck cancer develop, modest improvement in survival rates is noted. This presents clinicians with a growing challenge to devise and test interventions that can help people manage the side effects of treatment and the psychosocial impact on their lives. Over the past three decades a variety of psychosocial interventions have been developed to help head and neck cancer patients cope with the emotional and social impact of the condition. Psychosocial intervention refers to any attempt to provide solutions to the challenges individuals may encounter to their psychological well‐being when interacting with any element of the social environment ( Bessell 2009 ). Holland 1982 described the goals of these interventions as being to decrease feelings of alienation, lessen feelings of isolation, helplessness and hopelessness, assist in clarifying misperceptions and misinformation and to take more responsibility for getting well. These interventions vary considerably in their theoretical premise, complexity, content and mode of delivery.\n\n【10】Fawzy 1995 reported on four main types of psychosocial interventions which include: psychoeducational, psychotherapy (individual), cognitive behavioural training and group interventions.\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】#### Types of interventions\n\n【13】*   _Psychoeducational_ interventions vary in the amount of psychosocial information or coping instruction and behavioural training they provide, but the emphasis is generally on educating patients on the disease process and how to cope with the disease.\n    \n*   _Psychotherapy_ is generally within a one‐to‐one interaction between a therapist and patient. The aim of psychotherapy is to help the patient gain a sense of mastery over the situation and help in overcoming the practical problems.\n    \n*   _Cognitive behavioural therapy_ involves identifying and correcting negative thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to psychosocial difficulties.  Behavioural and cognitive techniques are employed and are aimed at improving emotional and functional adjustment.\n    \n*   _Group interventions_ centre on two types of support groups which are either led by a professional or by patients themselves, often referred to as peer support groups. Group interventions are thought to influence self esteem by normalising the experience and reduce feelings of deviance, promote adjustment and add meaning to life through helping others and instillation of hope by social comparisons.\n    \n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】It is currently recommended in UK government policy that all patients with a cancer diagnosis should \"undergo systematic psychological assessment at key points and have access to appropriate psychological support\" ( NICE 2004 , page 13). Similar endeavours are evident in the USA, with the National Cancer Comprehensive Network advocating that all cancer patients should be screened for psychological distress, with the premise that a number may benefit from further psychosocial interventions ( Holland 2005 ). Despite this flourishing body of literature identifying the importance of assessment and intervention, this imposes the need for further evaluative research to determine which psychosocial interventions are most effective for different groups of patients.\n\n【16】A previous integrative review of the head and neck cancer literature tentatively suggested that psychosocial interventions improved quality of life, had a positive impact on emotional adjustment and improved coping skills, but many of these studies had methodological flaws ( Semple 2004 ). Within recent years there has been an increase in the number of studies that are developing and testing interventions to improve quality of life, reduce distress and enhance adjustment for patients with head and neck cancer; therefore it is reasonable to suggest that a higher standard of methodology and reporting should be evident in this systematic review. This review will systematically assess the best available evidence on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for patients with head and neck cancer. This will provide clinicians with reliable information on the most appropriate interventions, thus promoting adjustment and quality of life for a patient population that has a considerable disease burden.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies that test the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for adults with head and neck cancer.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs of psychosocial interventions for patients with a head and neck cancer diagnosis.\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Adults (aged 18 or older) with any type or stage of head and neck cancer. There will be no restriction on gender, ethnicity, treatment modality, type of setting or stage in the cancer journey.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】Psychosocial interventions will include: psychoeducational, psychotherapy (individual), cognitive behavioural training, supportive and group interventions. Individual or group interventions must comprise interaction that is face‐to‐face, via telephone or computer‐assisted learning (demonstrating completion of intervention), at home or in a healthcare setting (or a combination of these) by lay or trained personnel (or a combination of both). Interventions that are solely based on the distribution of informational material (without input from trained or lay personnel) and those that are physical in nature, such as exercise or massage alone, will be excluded from this review.  Control groups may include those who have not received a psychosocial intervention or who have received ‘standard care’.\n\n【27】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【28】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【29】Quality of life, as measured by an established and/or validated tool, for example such as the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale.\n\n【30】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【31】The secondary outcome measures will include the following.\n\n【32】*   Depression\n    \n*   Anxiety\n    \n*   Coping\n    \n*   Social functioning\n    \n*   Self esteem\n    \n*   Self efficacy\n    \n*   Body image\n    \n*   Locus of control\n    \n*   Adjustment/adaptation\n    \n*   Life satisfaction\n    \n*   Satisfaction with the intervention\n    \n*   Fear of recurrence\n    \n\n【33】All primary and secondary outcome measures must be assessed using an established and/or validated scale, for example: University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale, Impact of Events Scale and Derriford Appearance Scale.\n\n【34】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【35】We will conduct systematic searches for randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials. There will be no language, publication year or publication status restrictions. We may contact original authors for clarification and further data if trial reports are unclear, and we will arrange translations of papers where necessary.\n\n【36】#### Electronic searches\n\n【37】We will identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies by searching the following databases from their inception: the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, _The Cochrane Library_ ); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; CNKI; ISRCTN; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP; National Cancer Institute trials database; and Google.\n\n【38】We will model subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL (see Appendix 1 ). Where appropriate, we will combine subject strategies with adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by the Cochrane Collaboration for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ Version 5.1.0, Box 6.4.b. ( Handbook 2011 )).\n\n【39】#### Searching other resources\n\n【40】We will scan the reference lists of identified publications for additional trials and contact trial authors if necessary. In addition, we will search PubMed, TRIPdatabase, NHS Evidence ‐ ENT & Audiology and Google to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this systematic review, so that we can scan their reference lists for additional trials. We will search for conference abstracts using the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register.\n\n【41】##### Research in progress\n\n【42】We will search the following online registers of ongoing trials:\n\n【43】*   http://controlled‐trials.com ;\n    \n*   http://clinicaltrials.gov ; and\n    \n*   http://www.who.int/ictrp .\n    \n\n【44】##### Language\n\n【45】We will place no language restrictions on trials (unless accurate translation proves problematic). We will initially translate foreign language abstracts and measure them against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Where necessary we will translate the methods, results and discussion sections for inclusion in the review.\n\n【46】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【47】#### Selection of studies\n\n【48】We will download the results of the searches into a reference manager database (RefWorks) and remove duplicates. Two review authors will review the remaining titles and abstracts independently and screen them for suitability, according to the following basic criteria:\n\n【49】*   RCT or quasi‐RCT;\n    \n*   psychosocial intervention (based on definition in Background section and confirmed by CJS and/or AB);\n    \n*   adult (aged 18+) with head and neck cancer; and\n    \n*   outcome to include a validated measure of psychosocial functioning or quality of life.\n    \n\n【50】When it is unclear whether the trial clearly meets the above inclusion criteria, we will obtain the full text of the article and check it for eligibility. If discrepancies arise regarding the inclusion/exclusion of trials between the two review authors this will be resolved by discussion or, if necessary, by appeal to a third review author. We will collate a list of excluded studies and reasons for exclusion.\n\n【51】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【52】Two review authors will independently extract data from the original reports onto data extraction forms. Disagreement will be resolved by discussion between two review authors or, where necessary, there will be collaboration with a third author. Extraction data will include the following.\n\n【53】*   GENERAL: author, year of publication, title, journal, country and language of publication.\n    \n*   PARTICIPANT: age, gender, cancer stage, ethnicity, stage of cancer journey, sample size and distribution in each arm of the trial.\n    \n*   INTERVENTION: components of intervention, mode of delivery, setting, length and frequency of intervention, healthcare professional delivering the intervention, duration of follow‐up, control intervention characteristics.\n    \n*   METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: see below.\n    \n*   OUTCOMES: names of the validated tools used and results pertaining to the outcome measures.\n    \n\n【54】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【55】Two review authors will independently assess the methodological quality of the studies selected and, using a quality appraisal checklist, code them as follows:\n\n【56】##### Random allocation (selection bias)\n\n【57】*   Low risk (e.g. computer‐generated random sequence or table of random numbers)\n    \n*   High risk (e.g. hospital ID, date of birth or surname)\n    \n*   Unclear (e.g. insufficient information about the sequence generation process)\n    \n\n【58】##### Allocation concealment (selection bias)\n\n【59】*   Low risk (e.g. allocation concealment could not be foretold)\n    \n*   High risk (e.g. researcher/healthcare provider aware of the assignment arm of the participant)\n    \n*   Unclear (e.g. insufficient information to permit judgement)\n    \n\n【60】##### Blinding (detection bias)\n\n【61】Participants cannot be blinded to this type of intervention, nevertheless the outcome assessors can be blinded and this will be coded as:\n\n【62】*   Low risk\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n*   Unclear\n    \n\n【63】##### Incomplete data (attrition bias)\n\n【64】*   Low risk (no missing outcome data or attrition rate/loss to follow‐up clearly accounted for)\n    \n*   High risk\n    \n*   Unclear\n    \n\n【65】We will use the information collected in the ‘Risk of bias’ tool available in RevMan 5.1 ( RevMan 2011 ) to assess the quality of each study.\n\n【66】##### Selective reporting\n\n【67】*   Low risk (e.g. primary and secondary outcome measures have been reported in a pre‐specified way)\n    \n*   High risk (e.g. not all of the study's pre‐defined outcome measures have been reported or report fails to include results from a key outcome that would be expected)\n    \n*   Unclear (e.g. insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk')\n    \n\n【68】##### Other sources of bias\n\n【69】*   Low risk ‐ free of other sources of bias\n    \n*   High risk (e.g. potential sources of bias related to the specific study design)\n    \n*   Unclear (e.g. insufficient information to assess whether an important risk exists)\n    \n\n【70】When there is insufficient information we will seek contact with the study authors for clarification.\n\n【71】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【72】We will analyse dichotomous outcome variables using the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcome variables we will use the mean difference (MD) and where different scales have been used to measure the continuous outcome variable we will use the standardised mean difference (SMD) instead. We will use a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis.\n\n【73】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【74】When missing data or study discrepancies are evident, where possible we will make contact with the original investigators for further information.\n\n【75】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【76】Studies in this review will be derived from a heterogeneous group of psychosocial interventions which may differ in their theoretical premises. However, when the essential characteristic of the intervention is based on psychosocial elements to improve well‐being, this will render data appropriate for combing assuming they use the same outcome measure. We will assess heterogeneity between studies using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. We will consider an  I <sup>2 </sup> greater than 50% indicative of heterogeneity. When heterogeneity is found, we will make an attempt to investigate the source by examining individual studies and subgroup characteristics. In the event of substantial clinical, methodological or statistical heterogeneity, we will not combine study results by means of meta‐analysis.\n\n【77】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【78】We will use funnel plots to assess for the potential existence of publication bias or other differences in effect between larger and smaller studies.\n\n【79】If sufficient high‐quality studies are not determined for pooling of data, then we will produce a description of the studies identified and their main findings.\n\n【80】#### Data synthesis\n\n【81】If the generated data are suitable for conducting a quantitative synthesis, we will apply formal meta‐analysis techniques. We will enter data into RevMan 5.1 ( RevMan 2011 ).\n\n【82】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【83】We will conduct the following subgroup analyses where data are available.\n\n【84】*   Stage in cancer journey (potentially curative, palliative).\n    \n*   Healthcare professional delivering intervention (nurse, psychologist, counsellor, allied health professional).\n    \n*   Method of delivery (individual, group, telephone, computer‐assisted).\n    \n*   Duration (short‐term (i.e. less than three months), longer‐term (i.e. more than three months)).\n    \n*   We will conduct a separate analysis on studies by type as described in the Background section ( Fawzy 1995 ).\n    \n\n【85】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【86】If high‐risk studies are identified by the ‘Risk of bias’ tool we will perform a sensitivity analysis, including only those studies with suspected low risk of bias. If a study is initially determined as having an ‘unclear’ risk of bias due to lack of information on what happened in the study then we will seek further clarity from the authors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】*   To assess the effects of _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts on adverse effects during cancer treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy).\n    \n*   To assess effects due to _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts on survival, recurrence, and disease progression.\n    \n*   To evaluate the evidence in relation to the type of preparation of the mushroom (e.g. whole fresh, dried, or extract).\n    \n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Approximately 12.7 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2008. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer, with an increasing incidence in the developing world ( IARC and Cancer Research UK 2012 ). Colorectal cancer includes colon (large bowel) cancer and cancer of the rectum (the last portion of the gastro‐intestinal tract before the anus). It may result in blood in the stools and gastro‐intestinal symptoms including constipation, bloating and bowel obstruction. The treatment of colorectal cancer may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and possibly radiotherapy, or a strategy using monoclonal antibodies (antibodies designed to target specific types of cells) ( NCI 2013 ; NICE 2011 ). Both the disease and its treatment may cause symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, or depression, which adversely affect the quality of life of patients with colorectal cancer ( Gray 2011 ). Chemotherapy regimens incorporating oxaliplatin or irinotecan, or both, may be more effective at preventing recurrence or delaying disease progression than those based solely on 5‐fluorouracil/leucovorin, but serious adverse events and discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity are more frequent ( Pandor 2006 ). Treatment‐related adverse effects, including diarrhoea, neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils), stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth), nausea and vomiting, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), and hand‐foot syndrome, are reported in about half of the patients treated ( Schmoll 2007 ). Toxicity may be severe in 5% to 30% of patients, requiring dose reduction or withdrawal of potentially life‐saving or life‐prolonging treatment. Thus, there is a need for adjuvant therapies that can support colorectal cancer patients through conventional cancer therapy by alleviating symptoms and side effects without adversely affecting overall survival.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Mushrooms have a long history of use to promote health in China and Japan and, as some mushroom preparations are orally bioavailable, they are relatively easy to administer ( Lindequist 2005 ). Medicinal mushrooms appear to have low toxicity and useful immune‐modulating and health‐promoting properties that may combat fatigue and aid cellular repair. Numerous studies have been conducted in humans and several mushroom extracts are licensed as adjuvant treatments in oncology practice in Japan ( Kidd 2000 ). There has been increasing interest in their use in western countries and they appear to be popular in the USA among cancer patients ( Standish 2008 ), where they can be purchased without prescription. The four mushrooms commonly used clinically are _Coriolus versicolor_ (also known as _Trametes versicolor_ , Japanese and Chinese names Kawaratake and Yun Zhi, respectively), _Ganoderma lucidum_ (Reishi or Ling Zhi), _Lentinula edodes_ (Shiitake or Hua Gu/Xiang Gu) and _Grifola frondosa_ (Maitake or Hui Shu Hua) ( Smith 2000 ).\n\n【9】The _Coriolus versicolor_ fungus, the focus of this review, has a colourful fruiting body with features that resemble a 'turkey tail'. It grows on dead logs in many countries worldwide and is not edible. Hot‐water extracts of the whole fruiting body have been used in traditional Chinese medicine since historic times ( Smith 2000 ). Today, two commercial extracts are used clinically in the Far East: polysaccharide‐K (PSK) and polysaccharopeptide (polysaccharide‐peptide or PSP). Both are orally bioavailable extracts from the cultured mycelium (the filamentous part of the mushroom that grows through the soil) of the _Coriolus versicolor_ fungus. PSK (or Krestin®) was developed in Japan in the 1960s and is a soluble protein‐bound polysaccharide derived from the CM‐101 strain of the fungus. PSP was developed in China in the 1980s and is a polysaccharide‐peptide derived from the COV‐1 strain ( Kidd 2000 ; Smith 2000 ). The molecular weights of the two preparations (about 100 kDa) and the biochemical compositions are similar but not identical. Commercial cultivation and production aims to ensure a steady supply of the fungus, control of the polysaccharide concentration (which varies considerably in the plant depending on growth phase and storage conditions) and purity of the final product. However, over‐the‐counter products may not be standardised ( Memorial Sloan‐Kettering 2012 ).\n\n【10】Coriolus extracts are used as adjuvant therapy for treating cancers, either combined with herbal mixtures in Asian cultures, or combined with conventional chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and they have been reported to have an effect by boosting suppressed immune function, extending the survival rate and improving quality of life ( Eliza 2012 ).\n\n【11】Recommended doses vary according to the preparation. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the recommended dose of _C. versicolor_ is 9 g to 27 g daily ( Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2005 ). The daily dose of the authorised PSK product (Krestin®), according to the manufacturer, is 3 g ( Daiichi‐Sankyo 2012 ). Doses of PSK most commonly used in clinical trials in cancer have been between 1 g and 3.6 g daily ( Eliza 2012 ). Data available on pharmacokinetics are based mainly on studies in animal (small mammal) models. These indicate that PSK is rapidly absorbed and partly metabolised in the gastro‐intestinal tract. Peak plasma levels occur between 0.5 to 2 hours for small molecules and 4 to 24 hours for large molecules ( Memorial Sloan‐Kettering 2012 ). Excretion is primarily through the lungs with 70% excreted in expired air after 24 hours ( Daiichi‐Sankyo 2012 ; Mitomi 1988 ). Radiolabelled PSK or its metabolites are also excreted in the urine and faeces with 86% excreted within 24 hours ( Memorial Sloan‐Kettering 2012 ; Mitomi 1988 ). Adverse interactions between _C. versicolor_ mushroom and herbs or drugs have not been reported ( Natural Database 2013 ). PSP has been shown to affect phase I metabolism and hepatic cytochrome P450 in animal models but the potential for clinically significant interactions in humans is low ( Yeung 2012 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】_Coriolus versicolor_ has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a general 'tonic' for anorexia, fatigue, and lack of strength, and is recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as an 'immune modulator' ( Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2005 ). The pharmacological actions of mushrooms have been studied extensively in Japan and China in animal and human studies ( Rowan 2003 ; Sullivan 2006 ). These studies support the idea that they are biological response modifiers that act by stimulating the non‐specific immune system ( Lindequist 2005 ; Ng 1998 ).\n\n【14】PSK has been shown to restore immune systems depressed by chemotherapy to normal levels in animal studies, and has been reported to improve survival in clinical studies ( Sakamoto 2006 ). PSK is also reported to attenuate the adverse reactions induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy, including neutropenia ( Maehara 2012 ). Similar effects are reported for PSP: results of clinical trials in China indicated reduction in chemotherapy‐induced adverse effects, including vomiting, and restoration of chemotherapy‐induced immunosuppression when PSP was used in combination with cytotoxic agents ( Chan 2006 ). Such findings suggest that these extracts have the potential to improve tolerance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to reduce adverse effects due to depressed immune function. Both products also appear to have anti‐tumour properties, which may contribute to an overall effect on survival.\n\n【15】The mechanism of action is yet to be fully established. The immune‐potentiating activity is attributed to mushroom proteoglycans: these proteoglycans comprise a central linear polypeptide chain with multiple side‐branches of beta‐D‐glucans ( Kidd 2000 ). Multiple potential actions have been reported including suppression of tumour cell growth, reversal of immune suppression, and an increase in white blood cell counts, mediated in part by scavenging of free radicals by PSK ( Fisher 2002 ). A review of the biological effects of PSK suggested that it had beneficial effects on cytokines ('chemical messengers') including tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (TNFα), interferon‐gamma (IFNγ), and interleukin‐2 (IL‐2) ( Standish 2008 ). Animal studies indicate that PSK does not affect the normally functioning immune response but can contribute to the restoration of a response depressed by tumour burden or chemotherapy. Specific mechanisms considered to be involved include production of antibodies and cytokines, and improved activity of natural killer cells, T cells, macrophages, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.\n\n【16】While immune‐stimulatory actions may contribute to the apparent beneficial effects of these extracts, the mechanism of action underlying reports of reduced adverse effects when these extracts are used in combination with anticancer agents is as yet unclear. Effects on the pharmacokinetics of cytotoxic agents have been observed in some animal studies but results from human studies indicate that clinically significant effects are unlikely ( Chan 2006 ).\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】For colorectal cancer patients in particular, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used to prolong life and improve survival, but side effects can be a problem with significant numbers of patients suffering severe effects ( Schmoll 2007 ), resulting in dose reduction or cessation of treatment, which have an impact on survival. Some of these side effects, such as fatigue and peripheral neuropathy, can persist into the survivorship period, and as more cancer patients survive, the prevalence of those with persistent side effects increases ( Aziz 2007 ). This is particularly relevant as 50% of colorectal cancer patients in the UK currently survive more than 10 years ( IARC and Cancer Research UK 2012 ). There is a need for adjuvant therapies that can support colorectal cancer patients through conventional cancer therapy by alleviating symptoms and side effects without adversely affecting survival.\n\n【19】A number of reviews of the effects of mushrooms in cancer have been conducted previously. Within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, a review of _Ganoderma lucidum_ (Reishi mushroom) for cancer treatment concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support its use as a first‐line treatment for cancer or long‐term cancer survival, but that it could be considered for use as an alternative adjunct to conventional treatment due to its potential to enhance tumour response and stimulate host immunity while being generally well tolerated ( Jin 2012 ). Several published systematic reviews have focused on _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts. One meta‐analysis published in 2012 focused on the effects of _Coriolus versicolor_ on survival in cancer patients and concluded that there was strong evidence of a beneficial effect on survival, particularly in breast, gastric, and colorectal cancer patients ( Eliza 2012 ). However, only research published up to 2003 was included. A second meta‐analysis focused on the efficacy of PSK for survival of patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer; PSK used as an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy improved overall and disease‐free survival but risk of bias and adverse events were not addressed ( Sakamoto 2006 ). The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center also produced a detailed scientific review of studies published up to March 2005, summarising and categorising the research by study design ( MD Anderson 2010 ). A review of safety data relating to medicinal mushrooms in cancer patients showed no evidence of cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, effects on female ovulation, or reproduction at acute or chronic doses ( Smith 2000 ). Adverse effects that have been reported include possible darkening of the fingernails and faeces ( Kidd 2000 ). No systematic review has been performed to evaluate the strength of evidence on the effects of _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts on both adverse effects during cytotoxic treatment and on survival in colorectal cancer. Thus, a review focusing on evaluating the evidence on the adjuvant effects of _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts in colorectal cancer is warranted.\n\n【20】Objectives\n----------\n\n【21】*   To assess the effects of _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts on adverse effects during cancer treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy).\n    \n*   To assess effects due to _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts on survival, recurrence, and disease progression.\n    \n*   To evaluate the evidence in relation to the type of preparation of the mushroom (e.g. whole fresh, dried, or extract).\n    \n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【24】#### Types of studies\n\n【25】We will consider randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy and safety of _Coriolus versicolor_ and its extracts in participants with a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer, in addition to conventional treatment. We will include trials regardless of language and publication status. We will consider all types of RCT design for inclusion, e.g. parallel‐group and cluster‐RCTs.\n\n【26】We will only include trials including different types of cancer if data for colorectal cancer patients are reported separately.\n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】Adult patients (minimum age 18 years) diagnosed with colorectal cancer regardless of tumour stage, age, or gender. Diagnosis must be confirmed by biopsy and will be stratified by tumour site and stage.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Interventions will include any preparation of _Coriolus versicolor_ (raw plant, decoction, capsule, tablet, tincture, extract, injection), any part of the mushroom (mycelium, stem, root, leave, spore, or whole), at any dose and regimen.\n\n【31】Trials will be included that compare:\n\n【32】*   conventional treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy) plus _Coriolus versicolor_ extract versus conventional treatment alone;\n    \n*   conventional treatment and a complementary therapy plus _Coriolus versicolor_ extract versus the same treatment without the extract;\n    \n*   conventional treatment plus _Coriolus versicolor_ extract versus conventional treatment plus placebo.\n    \n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【35】*   Overall survival at one year, three years, and five years.\n    \n*   Adverse effect rates: the incidence of all reported adverse effects or toxicities, including modification of treatment or withdrawal from the trial due to adverse effects.\n    \n\n【36】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【37】*   Disease progression at one year (plus three years and five years, if data are available) confirmed radiologically or biopsy proven.\n    \n*   Disease recurrence at one year (plus three years and five years, if data are available) confirmed radiologically or biopsy proven.\n    \n*   Response rates based on recommended criteria (World Health Organization (WHO) criteria or RECIST ‐ Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) for solid tumours ( Therasse 2000 ).\n    \n*   Quality of life evaluated using any validated assessment tool.\n    \n\n【38】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【39】We will impose no language restrictions and native speakers will translate studies if required.\n\n【40】#### Electronic searches\n\n【41】We will search the following electronic databases:\n\n【42】*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);\n    \n*   MEDLINE (from inception to date);\n    \n*   EMBASE (from inception to date);\n    \n*   AMED (from inception to date);\n    \n*   BIOSIS (from inception to date);\n    \n*   CINAHL (from inception to date);\n    \n*   The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Specialized Register.\n    \n\n【43】International databases:\n\n【44】*   WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( http://www.who.int/trialsearch );\n    \n*   Global Health Library ( http://www.globalhealthlibrary.net/php/index.php ).\n    \n\n【45】Trial databases:\n\n【46】*   ClinicalTrials.gov ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ );\n    \n*   US National Cancer Institute ( http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials );\n    \n*   Current Controlled Trials ( http://www.controlled‐trials.com/ ).\n    \n\n【47】Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database:\n\n【48】*   http://naturaldatabase.therapeuticresearch.com .\n    \n\n【49】Chinese databases:\n\n【50】*   CQVIP, Chinese Scientific Journals Full‐text Database ( www.cqvip.com );\n    \n*   CNKI database ( www.cnki.net );\n    \n*   Wanfang Data's Chinese Online Journals database ( http://www.wanfangdata.com/ );\n    \n*   CBM ( www.imicams.ac.cn ).\n    \n\n【51】Japanese databases:\n\n【52】*   Ichushi Web ( http://www.jamas.or.jp ), web version of _Igaku Chuou Zasshi_ (Japana centra revuo medicina);\n    \n*   UMIN‐CTR  ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index‐j.htm );\n    \n*   Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (Japic‐CTI) ( http://www.clinicaltrials.jp/user/cte\\_main.jsp );\n    \n*   Japan Medical Association‐Center for Clinical Trials (JMACCT) ( https://dbcentre3.jmacct.med.or.jp/jmactr/ ).\n    \n\n【53】We will develop the MEDLINE search strategy and search strategies for databases other than MEDLINE in close collaboration with the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator. We will search all databases from their inception.\n\n【54】For comprehensive search strategies, see Appendix 1 (CENTRAL); Appendix 2 (MEDLINE); Appendix 3 (EMBASE).\n\n【55】#### Searching other resources\n\n【56】We will check the reference lists of all retrieved studies and relevant reviews for further relevant studies. We will screen the proceedings of the International Medicinal Mushroom Conference for studies. We will handsearch the specialist _International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms_ . We will contact manufacturers and authors to check for unpublished trials.\n\n【57】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【58】#### Selection of studies\n\n【59】Two review authors will independently examine all titles and abstracts retrieved by the searches of Western databases (KP and JL) and the Chinese and Japanese databases (JPL and LT). If a record (title or abstract) cannot be rejected with certainty, we will obtain the full‐text article for further evaluation. We will exclude duplicates. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion and if necessary by a third author. We will document the reasons for the exclusion of studies.\n\n【60】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【61】Two review authors will independently extract the following information on: patients (number randomised and analysed, age, sex, stage, treatment situation, setting), methods (design, observation period, analysis), interventions (type of preparation, application, dose and duration, control procedure, anticancer treatments), outcomes and results (reports of adverse effects, survival data, data on quality of life (QoL), number of dropouts, follow‐up). We will use a pre‐defined data extraction form for recording relevant data. Differences between review authors will be resolved by discussion or if necessary by consulting a third review author. If necessary, we will contact study authors for clarification of study methodology and results and, where relevant, for missing data.\n\n【62】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【63】Two review authors will independently assess the trials using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011 ). Differences will be resolved by discussion or, if necessary, by consulting another review author. Assessment of risk of bias ( Appendix 6 ) will consider the following and we will assess this as per the criteria for judging risk of bias in the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (Table 8.5.c) in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ .\n\n【64】*   Sequence generation.\n    \n*   Allocation concealment.\n    \n*   Blinding of participants, personnel and outcomes assessors.\n    \n*   Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n*   Selective outcome reporting. This will follow the methods as per the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment mentioned above. However, as a minimum we expect that trials should report adverse event data and survival or tumour response/disease progression.\n    \n*   Other possible sources of bias: we will assess vested interests based on authorship and funding source for the trial and whether, if commercial funding was provided, this was stated to be unrestricted. If there is a clear statement on lack of a conflict of interest and no vested interest is apparent in the authorship or funding, we will judge the risk of bias to be low; where there is no statement we will judge the risk of bias to be unclear; and where a conflict of interest is apparent, we will judge the risk of bias to be high. We will also assess baseline differences between groups: if these are apparent and have not been addressed, we will judge the risk of bias to be high; if there are no significant baseline differences or these exist but the effect on results has been investigated and found not to be significant, we will judge the risk of bias to be low; in all other cases, we will judge risk of bias to be unclear.\n    \n\n【65】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【66】We will extract the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest, in order to estimate a risk ratio (RR). If sufficient data are available, we will assess the severity of adverse events and categorise these according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), comparing rates of adverse events at each grade of severity ( NCI 2010 ). If the data are available, we will also categorise adverse events as acute (during and up to six weeks after treatment) and late (after six weeks).\n\n【67】We will present dichotomous data as a risk ratio with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We will present continuous data as a mean difference (MDs) for common measurement units or a standardised mean difference (SMD) for differing measurement units and different scales, along with corresponding 95% CI. We will calculate effect size and 95% CI for all primary and secondary outcomes. Where possible, all data extracted will be those relevant to an intention‐to‐treat analysis, in which participants are analysed in the groups to which they were assigned. We will also note the time points at which outcomes were collected and reported.\n\n【68】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【69】For individual trials, the unit of analysis will be the individual patient. In the case of including cluster‐randomised study designs, the unit of analysis will be the cluster. We will extract data if the authors have adjusted for the sample size in each cluster, so that it is appropriately weighted in the following analysis. For studies in which control of clustering is not performed or reported adequately by the authors (after we have contacted them), and individual patient data are not available, we will correct for the intervention effects of cluster‐RCTs by reducing the size of each trial to its 'effective sample size', which is the number of the original sample size divided by the 'design effect'. We will calculate the design effect as 1 + (M‐1)\\* ICC, where M is the average cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coefficient, as described in chapter 16.3.4 in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【70】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【71】We will contact study authors to provide missing data. Where this proves unsuccessful, we will investigate the potential impact of the missing data. If trials reported the number of patients with data missing for the primary outcome, we will take a worst‐case scenario approach to data analyses, that is, taking those with missing data in the treatment group as treatment failures, while taking those with missing data in the control group as treatment successes ( Gamble 2005 ). We will compare per protocol analysis of available data with the analysis incorporating missing data. If the effect estimate is in the same direction and there is a significant difference between groups, we will be able to make a conclusion with more confidence. If the effect estimates from the two analyses are different, then we will need to interpret the findings with more caution and make a more conservative conclusion about the treatment effect.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【73】We will assess heterogeneity between studies by visual inspection of forest plots, by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> ) and, if possible, by subgroup analyses. If heterogeneity is detected (I <sup>2 </sup> ≥ 50%), we will investigate possible reasons for this and consider whether it is appropriate to report a pooled estimate. If there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate and report the possible reasons.\n\n【74】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【75】We will examine funnel plots to assess the potential for small study effects such as publication bias. We will check the symmetry of the funnel plot if a sufficient number of trials are included in a meta‐analysis (more than 10 trials). If there is asymmetry of the funnel plot, it may suggest the existence of publication bias.\n\n【76】#### Data synthesis\n\n【77】If sufficient clinically similar studies are available, we will pool their results in meta‐analyses.\n\n【78】For any dichotomous outcomes, we will calculate the RR for each study and then pool these.\n\n【79】For continuous outcomes, we will pool the MDs between the treatment arms at the end of follow‐up if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, otherwise we will pool SMDs.\n\n【80】We will use random‐effects models with inverse variance weighting for all primary analyses. We will perform all analyses using the Cochrane statistical software, Review Manager 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ). One author (JPL) will oversee all steps of data synthesis. We will summarise the results of included trials descriptively in tables.\n\n【81】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【82】We will perform subgroup analysis according to type of _Coriolus versicolor_ preparation, dose, type of cancer (colon or rectal), stage of cancer and chemotherapy regimen.\n\n【83】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【84】We will perform sensitivity analysis excluding studies considered to be at high risk of bias.\n\n【85】##### Summary of findings\n\n【86】We will evaluate the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and present this in 'Summary of Findings' tables.\n\n【87】The GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence in one of four grades:\n\n【88】1.  High: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.\n    \n2.  Moderate: Further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.\n    \n3.  Low: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.\n    \n4.  Very low: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.\n    \n\n【89】The quality of evidence can be downgraded by one (serious concern) or two levels (very serious concern) for the following reasons: risk of bias, inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity, inconsistency of results), indirectness (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes) and imprecision (wide confidence interval, single trial).  \nThe quality of evidence might be upgraded by one level due to a large summary effect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "d6dcca25-6f16-4d04-9733-0f78e8ae2678", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess whether chuanxiong‐type preparation is effective and safe when administered to patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Generality and epidemiology**  \nStroke is the third leading cause of death ( ASA 2004 ; Bonita 1990 ) and the first leading cause of serious, long‐term disability in the United States ( ASA 2004 ). The death rates per 100,000 population for stroke in 2001 were 56.5 for white males and 85.4 for black males; and 54.5 for white females and 73.7 for black females ( ASA 2004 ). Optimal treatment of the patient who has an acute ischemic stroke onset requires rapid assessment and early intervention. The most promising treatment is the thrombolytic drug recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator (rt‐PA), which must be administered within a three‐hour window from the onset of symptoms ( ASA 2004 ). Antiplatelet therapy, with drugs like aspirin, reduces the risk of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in patients with a history of stroke or TIA by about 15% to 20% ( Algra 1996 ; APT 1994 ). A systematic review of the randomised trials of thrombolytic therapy has shown there are some risks of intracranial hemorrhage ( Wardlaw 2002 ). A survey of treatments used in routine practice in China showed that 75% of doctors surveyed believed that Chinese herb products were effective treatments for acute ischemic stroke, and 66% of doctors used them routinely for most patients ( Chen 1997b ).\n\n【6】**The constituents and functions of chuanxiong**  \nThe common name for chuanxiong is Chuanxiong rhizome, or Szechuan lovage root; the botanical name is Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, and the pharmaceutical name is Rhizoma Ligustici Wallichii. The root of this plant is used as medicine ( Chen 1994 ; Chen 1997a ). It is always used together with Chinese angelica root, and other herbs are added based on the syndromes being treated. There are three alkaloids separated from the plant: tetramethylpyrazine (TMP or ligustrazine); leucylphenylalanine anhydride; and perlolyrine. This herb also includes several essential components including conidium‐lactone and ligustilide ( Wang 1993 ; Xu 2003 ; Zhou 1994 ). In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the functions of Chuanxiong are promoting blood circulation and relieving pain ( Chen 1997a ; Guo 2001 ; Wang 1989 ), enhancing the immune system, and as an anti‐inflammatory ( Sinclair 1998 ). It effectively inhibits platelet aggregation and activation in ischemic tissue; maintains the balance of TXA2/PGI2 in the blood; decreases the permeability of blood vessels, the viscosity of blood and hematocrit; inhibits the synthesis and release of dynorphinA1‐13 (DynA1‐13) (which is an immune substance); and increases the activity of intrinsic superoxide dismutase (SOD) ( Ge 1994 ). Chuanxiong could improve brain microcirculation through preventing thrombus formation and platelet aggregation and blood viscosity ( Chen 1992 ; Sun 2002 ; Wang 1993 ; Xu 2003 ; Zhang 2001 ; Zhou 1994 ) so that it might have significant beneficial effects in the treatment of ischemic stroke.\n\n【7】**The usage of chuanxiong**  \nThe water extracted from chuanxiong can be taken orally or made into injections. After oral administration it is quickly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed widely in the liver, gall bladder, intestine, brain and kidneys with the highest density in the liver ( Sun 2002 ). The peak effects are observed within one to three hours ( Guo 2001 ). It has a short half‐life because of the rapid metabolism in the liver ( Ye 1996 ), and the metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine and a little in the bile ( Sun 2002 ). When used together with other Chinese herbs the common dosage is 3to 9 g ( Wang 1989 ). Ligustrazine, which is isolated from chuangxiong, is one of the most active ingredients used widely for treatment ( Ye 1996 ). For treating ischemic stroke, the ligustrazine injections should last for 10 to 14 days. The daily dose of ligustrazine is 80 to 160 milligrams, diluted in 250 to 500 millilitres solution with 5% to 10% isotonic saline or glucose for intravenous infusion, based on the phase I trial in which three groups of patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) were treated with different dosages of ligustrazine respectively; the effect of ligustrazine with large dose is good for improving clinical effect and haemorrheology ( Cai 2000 ).\n\n【8】**The side effects of chuanxiong**  \nA few comparisons about toxicity between chuanxiong and other drugs are reported and drug‐related adverse events occur occasionally. In the clinical use of chuanxiong, it has been reported to occasionally cause severe hypotension ( Zhang 2002 ), allergic reactions ( Sun 2000 ; Wu 2000 ; Zhu 2001 ) or drug‐induced fever ( Ge 1994 ).\n\n【9】**Rationale for undertaking this review**  \nHundreds of clinical studies about the benefits and side effects of using chuanxiong and other drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke have been carried out. However, poor quality and inadequate methodology are common problems with these studies. We therefore plan to perform a systematic review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of chuanxiong‐type preparations for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To assess whether chuanxiong‐type preparation is effective and safe when administered to patients with acute ischemic stroke.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, comparing chuanxiong‐type preparation with placebo (open control) or active drugs in patients with acute ischemic stroke will be included.\n\n【16】#### Types of participants\n\n【17】Trials including patients of any age or sex within 14 days of an acute ischemic stroke will be eligible. Ischemic stroke is defined as either definite (that is, hemorrhage had been excluded by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) scanning) or possible (that is, clinically definite stroke, but CT or MR scanning had not been performed).\n\n【18】#### Types of interventions\n\n【19】Trials evaluating chuanxiong‐type preparation will be included regardless of duration, dosage or route of administration. The control interventions will be placebo or no treatment. When the addition of chuanxiong‐type preparation to another treatment is compared to the other treatment alone and the trial is therefore assessing chuanxiong‐type preparation, the trial will be included.\n\n【20】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【21】**_Primary outcome measures_**  \n(1) Mortality rate (death from any cause) at the end of the scheduled follow‐up period.  \n(2) Death or dependency at the end of the scheduled follow up, evaluated by: Barthel ADL index (less than 50); modified Rankin Scale grade 3 to 6; Glasgow Outcome Scale (less than or equal to 3). We will accept descriptions such as drowsy, stuporous or unconscious, or unable to feed or dress independently as indicating dependency.\n\n【22】**_Secondary outcomes_**  \n(1) Measures of neurological deficit before and after chuanxiong‐type preparation is administered. For instance, the NIH Stroke Scale or the Scandinavian Stroke Scale.  \n(2) Death or dependency at the end of the scheduled treatment period.  \n(3) Any other recorded adverse effects will be reported and discussed.  \n(4) Quality of life if assessed in the included trials\n\n【23】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【24】We will search the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Chinese Stroke Trials Register, and the trials register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field (http://www.compmed.umm.edu/Cochrane/Registry.html). In addition, we will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( _The Cochrane Library_ , latest issue), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database 1985 to 2005) and the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM‐disc 1979 to 2005), which is a database of Chinese biomedical research literature. The following search strategy, using a combination of controlled vocabulary and text word terms, will be used for MEDLINE and will be modified to suit the other databases.\n\n【25】MEDLINE (Ovid) 1966 to December 2005  \n1\\. cerebrovascular disorders/ or basal ganglia cerebrovascular disease/ or exp brain ischemia/ or carotid artery diseases/ or carotid artery thrombosis/ or cerebrovascular accident/ or exp brain infarction/ or exp hypoxia‐ischemia, brain/ or intracranial arterial diseases/ or cerebral arterial diseases/ or exp \"intracranial embolism and thrombosis\"/  \n2\\.

We plan to handsearch appropriate journals, and relevant conference proceedings to identify further studies. All reference lists of retrieved articles will also be searched.\n\n【27】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【28】**Study selection**  \nAll the titles, abstracts, and full text of study reports will be examined by at least two authors independently. Only those studies that meet the pre‐determined inclusion criteria will be included. Any disagreements on selection of studies for inclusion in the review will be resolved by consensus discussion or with a third party if necessary.\n\n【29】**Quality assessment**  \nMethodological quality will be assessed independently by at least two authors using the following criteria that are described by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Reviewers' Handbook 4.2.5:  \n(1) randomisation (RCT only);  \n(2) allocation concealment: adequate; inadequate; unclear;  \n(3) blinding: blinding of investigator; blinding of participant; blinding of outcome assessor;  \n(4) completeness of follow up;  \n(5) intention‐to‐treat analysis.  \n  \nDisagreements between authors arising at any stage will be resolved by discussion or with a third party when necessary.\n\n【30】**Data extraction**  \nData concerning details of patient characteristics, methods, interventions, and outcomes will be extracted independently by two authors using a data extraction form. Disagreement will be resolved by discussion. Missing data will be obtained from the study authors whenever possible.\n\n【31】**Data synthesis**  \nThe primary analysis will be, for all adequately randomised trials comparing chuanxiong‐type preparation with placebo or open controls or chuanxiong‐type preparation plus other care versus other care alone, the effect on the two primary outcomes.  \n  \nIf data are sufficiently similar, meta‐analysis will be carried out using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software (RevMan 4.2). Results will be expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes, using a fixed effect approach unless there was significant heterogeneity, in which case, a random effects statistical model will be used. Tests for homogeneity will be carried out using a standard I <sup>2 </sup> test with significance being set at P greater than 0.1 and I <sup>2 </sup> less than 75%. If there is evidence of heterogeneity, we will explore which factor caused it and will perform subgroup analysis according to the possible reason. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to explore whether the heterogeneity resulted from low quality trials or not. If so, the lowest quality trials will be excluded.\n\n【32】Sensitivity analyses will be performed, restricting the studies included to:  \n(1) randomised trials only;  \n(2) placebo controlled trials only.\n\n【33】We intend to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses or meta‐regression. We will perform subgroup analysis using the method of Deeks et al ( Deeks 2001 ).  \n(1) Intervention: different comparisons, for instance, placebo or other active drugs.  \n(2) Dose (low, medium, high ‐ based on data).  \n(3) The timing of outcome measurement may vary between studies. In general, our aim is to group outcomes into three stages for analysis ‐ early (immediately after treatment course, within one week), medium term (within eight weeks after treatment) and longer term (beyond eight weeks after treatment).  \n(4) The route of administration (oral or intravenous).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

It is unknown whether improving physical fitness after stroke reduces disability.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, dependence, and disability. The secondary aims were to determine the effects of training on physical fitness, mobility, physical function, quality of life, mood, and incidence of adverse events.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched April 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , July 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2010), EMBASE (1980 to March 2010), CINAHL (1982 to March 2010), SPORTDiscus (1949 to March 2010), and five additional databases (March 2010). We also searched ongoing trials registers, handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised trials comparing either cardiorespiratory training or resistance training, or both, with no intervention, a non‐exercise intervention, or usual care in stroke survivors.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We analysed data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. Diverse outcome measures limited the intended analyses.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included 32 trials, involving 1414 participants, which comprised cardiorespiratory (14 trials, 651 participants), resistance (seven trials, 246 participants), and mixed training interventions (11 trials, 517 participants). Five deaths were reported at the end of the intervention and nine at the end of follow‐up. No dependence data were reported. Diverse outcome measures made data pooling difficult. The majority of the estimates of effect were not significant. Cardiorespiratory training involving walking improved maximum walking speed (mean difference (MD) 8.66 metres per minute, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98 to 14.34), preferred gait speed (MD 4.68 metres per minute, 95% CI 1.40 to 7.96) and walking capacity (MD 47.13 metres per six minutes, 95% CI 19.39 to 74.88) at the end of the intervention. These training effects were retained at the end of follow‐up. Mixed training, involving walking, increased preferred walking speed (MD 2.93 metres per minute, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.84) and walking capacity (MD 30.59 metres per six minutes, 95% CI 8.90 to 52.28) but effects were smaller and there was heterogeneity amongst the trial results. There were insufficient data to assess the effects of resistance training. The variability in the quality of included trials hampered the reliability and generalizability of the observed results.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】The effects of training on death, dependence, and disability after stroke are unclear. There is sufficient evidence to incorporate cardiorespiratory training involving walking within post‐stroke rehabilitation programmes to improve speed, tolerance, and independence during walking. Further well‐designed trials are needed to determine the optimal exercise prescription and identify long‐term benefits.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (7)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Stroke\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Physical exercise therapy\n\n【23】###### Comparison (4)\n\n【24】*   Sham Intervention\n*   Placebo\n*   Attention Placebo Control\n*   Waiting list control\n\n【25】###### Outcome (6)\n\n【26】*   Disability\n*   Physical fitness\n*   All Cause Mortality\n*   Finding Of Gait\n*   Dependence\n*   Death\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Physical fitness is important for the performance of everyday activities. The physical fitness of stroke patients is impaired after their stroke and this may reduce their ability to perform everyday activities and also exacerbate any stroke‐related disability. This review of 32 trials involving 1414 participants found that cardiorespiratory fitness training after stroke can improve walking performance. There are too few data for other reliable conclusions to be drawn.\n\n【34】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【35】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous (bony) groin pain is related to and aggravated by exercise and characterized by overuse ( Lynch 1999 ; Orchard 2000 ; Pizzari 2008 ). Given this link, we generally use the term 'exercise‐related groin pain' to describe this injury. Potential contributing factors towards the etiology of this injury are muscle imbalances between the abdominal wall musculature and the hip adductor muscles, which, combined with excessive loads, result in an abnormal distribution of forces in this region ( Pizzari 2008 ; Rabe 2010 ). Hip adduction involves moving the legs together. The converse movement is hip abduction, where the legs are moved apart. The primary adductor muscles of the hip are the pectineus, adductor longus, gracilis, adductor brevis and adductor magnus, while the primary hip abductor muscles include the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and the tensor fasciae latae ( Neumann 2010 ). It has been demonstrated that restricted hip range of motion ( Verrall 2005a ; Verrall 2007a ) and greater hip abductor to adductor muscle strength ratio or adductor weakness ( Engebretsen 2010 ; Maffey 2007 ) may be important risk factors for the development of groin pain.\n\n【7】Currently there is no recommendation regarding the definition of groin pain in the literature, which makes the diagnosis of this condition a challenge for clinicians ( Hölmich 2007 ; Jansen 2008a ). Usually the clinician deals with the coexistence of two or more disorders, such as adductor strains and osteitis pubis which are the most frequent musculoskeletal causes of exercise‐related groin pain ( Ekberg 1988 ; Hölmich 2007 ; Lloyd‐Smith 1985 ). Osteitis pubis is defined as an inflammatory condition probably caused by a bony stress reaction involving the pubic bones, pubic symphysis and adjacent structures ( Williams 2000 ; Verral 2001 ). Any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine, gynaecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies must first be excluded ( Jansen 2008a ; Machotka 2009 ). The most common symptoms are pain and tenderness on palpation of the pubis symphysis and tubercle that may be referred to the surrounding area including the lower abdominal and adductors; as well as pain provoked by resisted adduction ( Hölmich 2004 ; Verrall 2005b ). After clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging has been suggested as an important diagnostic tool to visualize any abnormalities of the involved structures ( Jansen 2008a ).\n\n【8】Musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain is related to sports, especially those that involve running, kicking, changing directions, twisting and cutting, such as soccer and hockey ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Emery 1999 ; Paajanen 2011 ). Among male soccer players, the incidence of groin pain is between 8% to 12% per year ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Hawkins 2001 ; Paajanen 2011 ). A study conducted during the Australian Football League season indicated that this condition was responsible for players missing many games, at a cost of AU$1.7 million in player unavailability during this period ( Pizzari 2008 ).\n\n【9】The prognosis of exercise‐related groin pain is not straightforward and patients may wait more than six months to return to practicing sports without restrictions ( Hölmich 1999; Weir 2010 ). It is not unusual for athletes to play with some symptoms even 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and the rate of failure to return to their prior level of sports function can reach more than 25% ( Verrall 2007b ; Weir 2011 ).\n\n【10】The treatment of exercise‐related groin pain is not well‐established in the literature ( Jansen 2008b ), but conservative modalities, such as physical therapy, are usually tried before surgery is considered. Conservative treatment appears to be a safe, low‐cost and accessible option for patients with exercise‐related groin pain.\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Conservative treatment is generally based on an initial period of rest or modification of sports activities, pharmacotherapy and physical therapy, which may involve electrotherapy modalities, manual therapy, and mainly the strengthening of the abdominal and hip muscles to improve core stability ( Verrall 2007b ; Vitanzo 2001 ; Williams 2000 ). Although exercise therapy appears to be effective, a standardized protocol does not exist and the exercises are usually prescribed based on the therapist’s experience ( Machotka 2009 ). When initial conservative treatment fails, steroid injections and dextrose prolotherapy (a technique which involves the injection of growth factor production stimulants to induce growth and repair of normal tissue ( Topol 2005 ) may be used ( Jansen 2008b ).\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】As exercise‐related groin pain is defined as being the result of overuse, a period of rest and reduction of activities that place high loads on the groin region is proposed in order to re‐establish the zone of homeostasis ( Pizzari 2008 ). This is similar to treatment protocols for stress fractures that are also a result of overuse ( Raasch 2006 ). Improving the hip range of motion, specifically internal and external rotation, has been proposed as a possible method to reduce stress across the pubic symphysis and surrounding structures ( Verrall 2005a ; Verrall 2007a ).\n\n【15】Muscular imbalances between abdominal and hip muscles may contribute towards overloading and loss of optimal functional stability of the groin region ( Hölmich 1999 ). The adductors are essential stabilizers of the pelvis in activities such as running, pivoting and kicking, and these are almost always activated together with the gluteus, hamstrings and abdominal muscles ( Biedert 2003 ). Thus, it may be possible that improving control of and strengthening the abdominal ( Cowan 2004 ) and hip stabilising muscles may improve the functional stability of the pelvis and therefore restore the functional unit of the groin region.\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Musculoskeletal, ligamentous and osseous groin injuries are common in athletes ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Hawkins 2001 ; Paajanen 2011 ) and have a large economic impact, since patients may need more than six months for full return to sports ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2010 ). There are no recommendations in the literature nor consensus about the effectiveness of the conservative therapeutic approaches ( Jansen 2008b ; Machotka 2009 ). This uncertainty motivated us to conduct this systematic review which, through the use of rigorous methods and a comprehensive and up‐to‐date search, may help to provide the information needed to support decision making.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random, e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number or alternation) controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain will be included.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】People with a diagnosis of exercise‐related groin pain caused by osteitis pubis, enthesopathy or muscles strains established by primary studies will be included. Excluded will be groin pain from any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine, gynaecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】Included will be all forms of conservative treatment for exercise‐related groin pain, including strengthening of the muscles stabilising the pelvis and hip joints, and stretching of the hip muscles; electrotherapy (for example, laser and ultrasound therapy); manual therapy; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs; steroidal injections or prolotherapy. Studies comparing conservative with surgical treatments will be excluded.\n\n【28】Our main comparisons will be:\n\n【29】*   Conservative intervention versus no or placebo intervention.\n    \n*   One conservative intervention versus another conservative intervention.\n    \n\n【30】All of the interventions may be set in the context of other interventions being provided to all trial participants.\n\n【31】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】1.  Pain relief at rest, on palpation and during physical activity (visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, and others).\n    \n2.  Function (SF‐36‐physical component, and others).\n    \n\n【34】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【35】1.  Patients' subjective global assessment (for example, classified as much better, better, not better, worse and much worse).\n    \n2.  Return to sports or normal activities.\n    \n3.  Adverse events (for example, burns from cryotherapy, reports of severe discomfort or intolerance from other interventions).\n    \n\n【36】If possible, the outcomes will be evaluated in the short term (four to six weeks after the end of treatment, for example); mid term (12 to 16 weeks after the end of treatment, for example), and long term (for example, one year after the end of treatment).\n\n【37】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【38】#### Electronic searches\n\n【39】We will search the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( _The Cochrane Library_ , current issue); MEDLINE (1948 to present); EMBASE (1980 to present); CINAHL (1982 to present); Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (1982 to present); PEDro ‐ the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (1929 to present), SPORTDiscus (1985 to present) and OTseeker ‐The Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence Database (to present). No language restrictions will be applied.\n\n【40】The subject‐specific strategy will be combined with the sensitivity‐maximizing version of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy ( Lefebvre 2011 ) to identify randomized trials in MEDLINE. Complete search strategies are shown for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS in Appendix 1 .\n\n【41】#### Searching other resources\n\n【42】We will contact professional experts in this field, and search reference lists of papers and conference proceedings (American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meetings; American Physical Therapy Association; American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Annual Assembly; Canadian Physiotherapy Association Annual Congresses; Australian Physiotherapy Association Conferences).\n\n【43】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【44】The methods will be undertaken according to the guidance in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】Two review authors (MOA and BNGS) will independently select and assess potentially eligible articles for inclusion in the review. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved by consensus. Where necessary, a third author (MSP) will act as adjudicator. There will be no blinding of author, institution or journal of publication at any stage.\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】Two review authors (MOA and RBA) will independently extract data from selected articles using a standard extraction form. Data extracted will include study methods, the characteristics of participants, interventions and outcome measures, and results. When necessary, requests will be sent to trial authors for additional information or data.\n\n【49】The data will be entered into RevMan by three review authors (MOA, BNGS, RBA).\n\n【50】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【51】As recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration ( Higgins 2011 ), two review authors (MOA and RBA) will assess the risk of bias for each included study. Disagreements will be resolved by a third review author (MSP). The following domains will be evaluated for risk of bias: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Risk of bias for the individual domains will be assessed as either 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear risk of bias'.\n\n【52】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【53】Dichotomous outcome data will be expressed as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) will be used if the studies use the same instrument of evaluation. However, if the primary trials assessing the same variables using different scales, the standardized mean difference (SMD) will be used. The estimated effects will be reported together, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\n【54】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【55】The unit of analysis will be based on the individual patient. We expect that, due to the biological and epidemiological characteristics of exercise‐related groin pain, cluster RCTs will be very unlikely. Should we identify any cross‐over randomised controlled trials, we will use only the first period before the treatments are crossed over.\n\n【56】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【57】For missing data (for example, publication bias, outcome not measured, incomplete reporting, lack of intention‐to‐treat analysis, attrition from the study), the following strategies will be adopted:\n\n【58】*   Whenever possible, contact the original investigators to request missing data.\n    \n*   Make explicit the assumptions of any methods used to cope with missing data: for example, that the data are assumed to be missing at random, or that missing values were assumed to have a particular value such as a poor outcome.\n    \n*   Perform sensitivity analyses to determine how sensitive results are to reasonable changes in the assumptions that are made.\n    \n*   Address the potential impact of missing data on the findings of the review in the Discussion section.\n    \n\n【59】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【60】Heterogeneity will be assessed by visual inspection of the forest plot (analysis) along with consideration of the chi² test for heterogeneity (with a level of significance of P < 0.1) and the I² statistic. We will consider that there is probably substantial heterogeneity where I² > 50%.\n\n【61】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【62】We will assess the likelihood of publication bias using funnel plots, provided that there are at least 10 trials contributing to a primary outcome.\n\n【63】#### Data synthesis\n\n【64】In the absence of significant heterogeneity, we plan to use a fixed‐effect model and 95% confidence intervals. However, if we find diversity in clinical or methodological characteristics, or unexplained heterogeneity, we will consider using a random‐effects model for analysis. Intention‐to‐treat analysis will be the first choice where possible, and the data from the included studies will be combined in a meta‐analysis if they are sufficiently clinically and statistically homogeneous.\n\n【65】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【66】If data are available to investigate heterogeneous results for specific patient groups, we will consider performing subgroup analyses according to gender, duration of symptoms, and activity (recreational versus professional athletes).\n\n【67】We will investigate whether the results of subgroups are significantly different by inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals, and performing the test for subgroup differences available in RevMan.\n\n【68】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【69】Where possible, we plan sensitivity analyses examining various aspects of study and review methodology, including the inclusion of studies at high risk of bias (specifically from lack of allocation concealment, assessor blinding, and incomplete outcome data), and inclusion of trials only reported in abstracts. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to look at the effects of missing data. We will examine the robustness of the fixed‐effect results by checking these using the random‐effects model.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【3】To assess the efficacy and harms of various behavioral interventions, such as educational and reward systems, for improving children's objective adherence to amblyopia treatments.\n\n【4】Secondary objective: to assess the subsequent treatment effects of improved adherence to amblyopia treatments and qualitatively explore equity and social determinants of health as factors affecting adherence.\n\n【5】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】### Description of the condition\n\n【8】Amblyopia, commonly referred to as 'lazy eye', is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from the abnormal processing of visual images in which the best‐corrected vision in one or, less often, both eyes is reduced in the absence of ocular disease ( Cruz 2022 ). This condition is classified by cause and can be unilateral or bilateral. Causes of unilateral amblyopia include anisometropia (unequal refractive error between the eyes), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes), visual deprivation (e.g. cataract or ptosis), and/or mixed mechanism (more than one type, typically anisometropia and strabismus). Causes of bilateral amblyopia include significant isoametropia (high degree of refractive error in both eyes) and, much less commonly, bilateral visual deprivation. If one of these conditions is present to disrupt the child’s visual experience during the critical period of visual development from birth to six to eight years of age, amblyopia may develop.\n\n【9】Amblyopia is a common cause of reduced vision in infants and young children, affecting 2% to 5% of the population ( Chen 2016 ; Fu 2020 ; Hassan 2018 ; NEI 2022 ; Rouse 2004 ; Webber 2005 ). An increased prevalence has been reported in populations with lower socioeconomic status, with lower cognitive function, of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, and immigrant status ( Fu 2020 ; Nitzan 2021 ). Meridional amblyopia affects the Hispanic/Latinx community at a higher rate, and the lack of timely treatment of bilateral amblyopia affects vision potential and perpetuates health disparities ( MEPEDS 2008 ; Varma 2017 ).\n\n【10】The incidence of amblyopia globally is 1% to 5% ( Hu 2022 ). Based on a 2022 meta‐analysis by Hu and colleagues, countries in Africa, such as Nigeria and Egypt, have a prevalence of around 0.38%, whereas countries in Europe, such as Sweden and Spain, have a prevalence of around 2.7%. There appears to be a slight predilection towards males, and this appears to be unrelated to geographical location, economic status, or age ( Hu 2022 ). Another meta‐analysis reported similar findings of increased prevalence in Europe and North America ( Fu 2020 ). Additionally, in terms of ethnicity, the highest prevalence is in the Hispanic population, followed by Europeans, Africans, and Asians ( Hu 2022 ).\n\n【11】Diagnosis of amblyopia is often based on the interocular difference of best‐corrected visual acuity and amblyogenic factors (anisometropia, strabismus, combination of two conditions, deprivation) ( Cruz 2022 ). However, amblyopia is typically associated with other conditions, such as binocular vision disorders (e.g. interocular suppression and poor stereopsis), as well as accommodative and oculomotor dysfunctions ( Ghasia 2022 ).\n\n【12】Amblyopia has been linked with poor performance on everyday vision‐reliant tasks involving fine motor coordination, such as writing ( Bhutada 2022 ; Chen 2018 ; Grant 2011 ; Grant 2014 ; Kanonidou 2010 ; Kelly 2017 ; Kelly 2020 ; Niechwiej‐Szwedo 2010 ; Niechwiej‐Szwedo 2019 ) reading ( Bhutada 2022 ; Kanonidou 2010 ; Kelly 2017 ), and visual search tasks ( Chen 2018 ). Thus, amblyopia often has a lifelong impact on children's academic and physical abilities, with adverse psychosocial effects ( Carlton 2011a ; Carlton 2011b ; Holmes 2003 ).\n\n【13】The initial treatment for many forms of amblyopia is full‐time optical correction. However, additional treatments are often required. Historically, these include penalization of the fellow eye (e.g. patching, 1% atropine, or Bangerter filter). More recently, dichoptic treatments, utilizing a computer or tablet to display treatment software, have been explored as another viable treatment option ( Levi 2020 ).\n\n【14】Amblyopia treatment has been shown to be more effective in children under seven years of age compared with those aged seven to 12 years ( Holmes 2011 ), although it can still be effective into the teenage years ( PEDIG 2005 ). The success rates for amblyopia treatment using patching or atropine can be quite high (50% to 80%), with success being defined by visual acuity at study completion as either (1) at least 20/25 or better; or (2) better than or equal to that of the sound eye ( Chen 2016 ; Repka 2004 ; Repka 2009a ; Repka 2009b ). But given the long‐term nature of amblyopia treatments, varying from months to years, the success of spectacles, patching, atropine, and binocular treatments is often limited by poor adherence ( Levi 2020 ; Maconachie 2016 ; Wang 2015 ). Poor adherence to treatment may result in reduced treatment efficacy, limiting visual improvement and increasing the burden of visual function deficits.\n\n【15】There are important public health consequences when amblyopia is left untreated; therefore, methods to improve adherence are essential. Untreated amblyopia can negatively impact school performance, self‐esteem, employment prospects, functional skills, quality of life, future social interactions, and overall risk of blindness ( Birch 2019 ; Birch 2020 ; Carlton 2011a ; Carlton 2011b ; Hatt 2020 ; Rahi 2002 ; Tommilla 1981 ). Furthermore, vision loss, often from trauma, in the sound eye can impact quality of life and employment status if the impairment causes inadequate visual function ( Rahi 2002 ; Tommilla 1981 ). Unfortunately, people with amblyopia have an increased risk of their sound eye becoming visually impaired, with the estimated lifetime risk of visual impairment being at least 1.2% to 3.3% ( Rahi 2002 ). Improving adherence to amblyopia treatment could have a positive long‐term impact on visual function and quality of life.\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】Adherence is critical for the successful treatment of amblyopia, particularly with patching ( Stewart 2004 ; Wang 2015 ). Amblyopia treatment adherence is measured using subjective and objective methods. Commonly used subjective methods include caregiver‐reported adherence, as well as calendars, logs, or diaries filled out by the participant's caregiver ( PEDIG 2002 ). Subjective methods are limited by caregiver forgetfulness and recall bias, in which the caregiver reports greater adherence than was actually achieved. However, these subjective methods are still commonly employed due to their low cost and ease of implementation.\n\n【18】Objective methods of measuring adherence to amblyopia treatments vary depending on the type of treatment. For glasses/spectacle wearing, an objective method of adherence includes a type of sensor to track spectacle wearing ( Maconachie 2016 ; South 2021 ). Similarly, during patching, occlusion dose monitors (ODMs) are a well‐known method for tracking adherence. These devices are able to track patching time based on sensing temperature contact with skin. This method of tracking adherence using an ODM has been utilized in many amblyopia studies ( Stewart 2004 ). For atropine penalization (which entails the instillation of 1% atropine eye drops twice‐weekly into the sound eye), some have measured adherence indirectly using objective clinical findings, such as dynamic retinoscopy ( Tejedor 2008 ) and pupil size ( Foley‐Nolan 1997 ). Research studies outside of amblyopia have described eye drop bottles with dose‐use tracking devices, but this has not been utilized in amblyopia treatment research ( Tapply 2021 ). Objective adherence to dichoptic treatment (where different stimuli are displayed to each eye) is measured by using a timer on the device.\n\n【19】There are multiple reasons to focus on objective measures of treatment adherence. First, quantitative, objective adherence data are more precise than qualitative, subjective adherence data. Whereas subjective adherence is often estimated to the hour, or half‐hour, an objective measure of adherence, such as ODMs, can provide estimates as precisely as 5‐minute intervals, while computer logs can measure adherence to the nearest second ( Januschowski 2013 ; Wang 2020 ; Xiao 2022 ). Second, previous patching studies have found that subjective diary data are often better matched to the prescribed regimen than the objective adherence assessed by an ODM ( Fielder 1995 ), which suggests a biased assessment. Third, objective data are often reported electronically and provide data more reliably.\n\n【20】Researchers have used a number of treatment modifications to improve adherence. These include educational cartoons, reward systems, and more engaging therapy techniques, such as video and virtual reality games. The assumption is that improved adherence to the amblyopia treatment will lead to improved treatment effectiveness. This assumption, however, has not been well‐studied. In addition, the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve adherence remains unknown.\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】To improve adherence, behavioral interventions such as educational cartoons, reward systems, and caregiver educational pamphlets have been studied ( Tjiam 2013 ; Tjiam 2016 ; Wang 2015 ). Educational pamphlets have been used to increase caregiver health literacy, which in turn may improve adherence outcomes. Other pediatric healthcare disciplines have described an increase in adherence when interventions are focused on family education ( Uhl 2021 ; Yang 2018 ). Reward stickers and educational cartoon stories have also been designed to target children ( Tjiam 2012 ; Tjiam 2013 ; Tjiam 2016 ).\n\n【23】For recent new dichoptic treatments, novel and engaging stimuli, such as video games, movies, and virtual reality, have been employed to increase the engagement and motivation of children to improve adherence ( Birch 2021 ; Falcone 2021 ; Levi 2020 ; Quoc 2023 ). However, the impact of these interventions on adherence to amblyopia treatment, and subsequent visual outcomes, remains poorly understood.\n\n【24】A variety of studies have examined whether factors intrinsic to participants’ amblyopia and its treatment are associated with increased or decreased adherence, including age, gender, amblyopia type, severity, and treatment assigned ( Le 2022 ). While many of these factors have mixed results, factors such as increased hours of prescribed patching may lead to decreased adherence ( Stewart 2004 ). There are other factors, such as socioeconomic status ( Tjiam 2012 ), psychological components ( Loudon 2009 ), and health literacy ( Loudon 2006 ; Newsham 2002 ), which also play a role in individuals' adherence. These numerous variables contribute to the challenges of measuring adherence.\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】While we have well‐established treatments for amblyopia, a lack of adherence may negatively affect the duration of therapy and its effectiveness. Adherence may be one of the main determinants of success since it directly relates to treatment outcomes and duration. In turn, this affects healthcare resources ( Carlton 2011b ). When a participant fails to respond to amblyopia treatment, the provider looks at different factors that may contribute to this lack of response, including adherence as a highly probable cause. It is well‐documented that treatment is more effective when implemented earlier in life. However, treatment effectiveness – whether treatment consists of refractive correction, penalization of the better‐seeing eye, or dichoptic treatments – is largely limited by poor adherence ( Newsham 2000 ; Newsham 2002 ). A Cochrane Review from 2019 compared conventional patching to pharmacologic penalization for amblyopia. While adherence between the two methods was discussed, interventions to improve adherence were not mentioned ( Li 2019 ).\n\n【27】The systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of different behavioral interventions in improving objectively‐measured treatment adherence. This review has the potential to provide evidence‐based guidance on which behavioral interventions are more effective. Understanding which interventions can reliably improve adherence to amblyopia treatment may help improve the effectiveness of amblyopia treatment. Improved adherence to treatment can also lessen the burden of amblyopia on pediatric and adult populations and save valuable healthcare resources. Furthermore, this review can guide future research in developing novel stimuli that can reliably improve adherence to treatment. By synthesizing the social determinants of health and equity, this review will highlight the role they may play in affecting treatment adherence, and thus shed light on potential contributions to health opportunities and outcomes ( Oliver 2008 ; Oliver 2012 ; O'Neill 2014 ; Welch 2022 ).\n\n【28】Objectives\n----------\n\n【29】To assess the efficacy and harms of various behavioral interventions, such as educational and reward systems, for improving children's objective adherence to amblyopia treatments.\n\n【30】Secondary objective: to assess the subsequent treatment effects of improved adherence to amblyopia treatments and qualitatively explore equity and social determinants of health as factors affecting adherence.\n\n【31】Methods\n-------\n\n【32】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【33】#### Types of studies\n\n【34】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (including parallel, cluster‐randomized and cross‐over designs) as well as quasi‐randomized trials. Quasi‐randomized controlled trials use techniques to allocate participants in a fashion that is not truly random; they allocate, for example, by date of birth, day of the week, medical record number, month of the year, or order in which participants are included in the study (alternation). We will also include multi‐arm trials in this review. The study follow‐up period should range from at least one month to one year. We will not impose any date, language, or publication restrictions on the studies for this review.\n\n【35】#### Types of participants\n\n【36】We will include studies where the participants are children aged three up to 18 years old at the start of the trial. If trials contain a subset of relevant participants (e.g. study includes participants aged 13 to 30), we will contact the study investigators to obtain results for the desired subset (e.g. children aged 13 to 18). We will include participants with bilateral or unilateral amblyopia: isometropic, anisometropic, strabismic, and/or mixed mechanism amblyopia. We will exclude participants with deprivation amblyopia or with a history of ocular diseases unrelated to amblyopia which affects visual acuity. We will not place any restrictions on the gender, ethnicity, or severity of amblyopia of participants in studies included in this review.\n\n【37】#### Types of interventions\n\n【38】Our review will evaluate the ways in which adherence may be improved among those already undergoing treatment for amblyopia; thus, the trials must test various interventions to improve adherence to treatment, regardless of what the treatment may be. The intervention may be carried out by the provider, caregiver, or the participant themselves. These interventions may be applied on their own or in combination, and include the following.\n\n【39】Behavioral interventions, such as:\n\n【40】*   reminders;\n    \n*   reward stickers;\n    \n*   educational cartoons;\n    \n*   pamphlets; and/or\n    \n*   clinic visits (e.g. increased versus standard schedule).\n    \n\n【41】Digital stimulus interventions, such as:\n\n【42】*   virtual reality;\n    \n*   movies (e.g. movie with eye‐tracking); and/or\n    \n*   video games.\n    \n\n【43】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【44】##### Critical outcomes\n\n【45】Our critical outcome is change in the percentage of adherence to prescribed treatment, using objective measures of adherence from baseline up to three months after the intervention. 'Percent adherence' is defined as the percentage of hours of actual treatment undertaken by the participant compared with the hours of prescribed treatment (i.e. number of (#) actual hours/number of (#) prescribed hours), regardless of the specific treatment (e.g. 'percent adherence to patching') ( Stewart 2007 ; Tjiam 2012 ; Wallace 2013 ). If a study with digital interventions collected electronic usage logs from the device(s) used, \"percent adherence with dichoptic treatment\" will be reported.\n\n【46】Our method of aggregation for percent adherence, regardless of treatment, will be a proportion of the number of prescribed treatment hours. In contrast to using a dichotomized adherence (i.e. percent (%) of participants achieving some target threshold of adherence), using a continuous variable can help prevent loss of information, perhaps with the use of a distribution plot to capture the range of the entire data ( Baumgartner 2018 ). For studies that only give dichotomized adherence metrics, we will contact authors to try to obtain continuous data. If continuous data cannot be obtained, we will assess dichotomous and continuous outcomes separately.\n\n【47】##### Important outcomes\n\n【48】There are seven important outcomes related to adherence and treatment outcome, measured at one week to three months and four to six months, as follows.\n\n【49】*   The percentage adherence of prescribed treatment at the additional following time interval:\n    \n    *   four to six months.\n        \n*   The total hours of adherence to prescribed treatment at the following time intervals:\n    \n    *   one week to three months;\n        \n    *   four to six months.\n        \n*   Change (continuous) in recognition visual acuity in the amblyopic eye from baseline to the following time intervals, measured in logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution):\n    \n    *   one week to three months;\n        \n    *   four to six months.\n        \n*   Change (continuous) in random dot stereoacuity from baseline, to the following time intervals, measured in seconds of arc:\n    \n    *   one week to three months;\n        \n    *   four to six months.\n        \n\n【50】If trials report multiple time points within an interval, we will use the latest available time point.\n\n【51】We will also assess the following harms, where reported in included studies by the end of the study follow‐up.\n\n【52】*   Risk of all reported specific adverse effects of adherence monitoring and behavioral intervention (e.g. skin irritation from ODM, dry eye from computer use, eyestrain, physical discomfort from ODM or digital stimulus interventions, meibomian gland dysfunction, etc.) at the latest available time point. We will also extract any harms that are classified as \"serious\" by the study authors, and group those together for meta‐analysis, if applicable.\n    \n*   The burden of adherence monitoring and behavioral interventions at the end of follow‐up (e.g. psychological or social pressure, stigma, time spent, etc.)( Liu 2020 ).\n    \n*   Patient and caregiver privacy concerns as reported by the studies at the end of follow‐up (e.g. risk of cybersecurity breach, etc.)( Campbell 2016 ).\n    \n\n【53】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【54】#### Electronic searches\n\n【55】We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (latest issue), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE E‐pub Ahead of Print, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to present), Embase.com (Elsevier) (January 1947 to present), PubMed (1946 to present), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to present), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We will not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials.\n\n【56】See the appendices for details of search strategies for CENTRAL ( Appendix 1 ), MEDLINE ( Appendix 2 ), Embase.com ( Appendix 3 ), PubMed ( Appendix 4 ), LILACS ( Appendix 5 ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( Appendix 6 ) and the ICTRP ( Appendix 5 ).\n\n【57】#### Searching other resources\n\n【58】We will search the bibliographies of included trials and any relevant systematic reviews to identify potentially relevant studies. We will contact the authors for missing data if indicated. Additionally, we will contact primary investigators if relevant ongoing trials are identified.\n\n【59】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【60】#### Selection of studies\n\n【61】The Information Specialist will perform the search and remove duplicates. After removal of duplicates, two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of records identified in the search for potential inclusion in the review using Covidence and the pre‐specified eligibility criteria based on study type, population, and intervention. All full‐texts will be retrieved for eligible, potentially eligible, or uncertain studies (i.e. those included at the title/abstract stage). Two review authors will independently review the full‐text articles and classify each as “include” or “exclude” and document reasons for exclusion in the characteristics of excluded studies' table. We will collate multiple reports of the same study, so that the unit of interest in the review is each study rather than each report. For both initial screening and full‐text review, we will resolve any disagreements by consulting a third review author.\n\n【62】If trial registrations or reports of studies that have not yet finished (e.g. interim analyses presented at conferences) meet the eligibility criteria, we will include them in the review and classify them as \"ongoing\" studies. If questions arise regarding any study's eligibility, whether due to incomplete reporting or publications not being obtainable, we will contact the study investigators for clarification. If the investigators do not respond within two weeks or eligibility remains uncertain, we will classify the study as “awaiting classification.” We will report the number of studies in the PRISMA flow diagram ( Page 2021 ).\n\n【63】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【64】Two review authors will independently extract data from the full‐text articles using a pre‐piloted data extraction form in Covidence , including: methods, participants, equity‐related sociodemographic data using the Cochrane PROGRESS‐plus framework (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social status)( Oliver 2008 ; Oliver 2012 ; O'Neill 2014 ; Welch 2022 ), and an adapted version of the Healthy People 2030 social determinants of health framework (economic stability, education and access, healthcare access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context)( Korn 2022 ; ODPHP 2023 ), interventions, outcomes, and other information. The data extraction form and social determinants of health framework are outlined in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 , respectively.\n\n【65】We will contact study investigators to request clarification or missing information. If the investigators do not respond within two weeks or information remains uncertain after the last communication before review, we will proceed with the information available. We will complete data extraction using all identified and available sources from any given study. If there are differences in the information presented across sources, we will use the information from the most complete report (e.g. the primary publication) if available, and from the most recent source if not in the primary publication.\n\n【66】Inconsistencies in data extraction between the review authors will be resolved by a third review author or through consensus. We will export the collated data into Review Manager analysis software ( RevMan Web 2023 ).\n\n【67】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【68】Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in each of the included trials using the Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB 2) outlined in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2022b ). We will settle any disagreements in risk of bias assessment by consensus. We will assess the critical benefit (adherence to prescribed treatment using objective measures of adherence from baseline to three months) and harm (proportion of participants experiencing any serious adverse events by the end of follow‐up) outcomes using RoB 2. We are interested in quantifying the effect of assignment to the interventions ( Fergusson 2002 ; Piantadosi 2005 ). As our interest is in interventions to improve adherence, we want to assess the \"intention‐to‐treat\" effect of assigning participants to one approach or another.\n\n【69】We will evaluate the five bias domains in the RoB2 tool ( Higgins 2022b ):\n\n【70】*   bias arising from the randomization process;\n    \n*   bias arising from deviations from intended interventions;\n    \n*   bias arising from missing outcome data;\n    \n*   bias in measurements of the outcome;\n    \n*   bias in selection of the reported result.\n    \n\n【71】We will use the signaling questions in the RoB 2 tool to rate each domain as (i) low risk, (ii) some concerns (due to either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias) or (iii) high risk ( Sterne 2019 ). If the paper reports insufficient information to assess the risk of bias, we will contact the study investigators and ask for the additional information needed to assess this risk.\n\n【72】As we will include cluster‐randomized and cross‐over randomized trials (in addition to parallel trials, which we will assess using the above approach), there are some additional considerations for assessing risk of bias in these special trial designs ( Higgins 2022c ). We will use the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Extensions for cluster‐randomized and cross‐over randomized trials (available at www.riskofbias.info ). Specifically, for cluster‐randomized trials, we will consider the above domains in the context of clustered randomization instead of individual randomization, and we will also assess the additional selection bias arising from the timing of identification and recruitment of participants ( Higgins 2022c ). For cross‐over trials, we will consider the above domains in the context of cross‐over design which does not have any additional domains, but rather considers bias due to carryover effects and selective reporting of first period data (as opposed to the entire trial) in the Attrition and Reporting bias domains, respectively ( Higgins 2022c ).\n\n【73】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【74】We will undertake the data analyses according to the approach described in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ).\n\n【75】For continuous outcomes, we will extract information on the difference in treatment effects from baseline to the predefined time frames in means (and standard deviations \\[SDs\\] of changes) for the intervention and comparator groups. Where measures of change are not reported, we will extract the mean and SD values of the outcome for the intervention and comparator groups at the specified follow‐up period(s). We will express treatment effects as the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between the intervention and comparator groups. For dichotomous outcomes, we will extract the numbers of events and participants in each study group to estimate the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs.\n\n【76】For our critical outcome, change in percent adherence, we will check if the data are normally distributed before analysis. If the data are skewed, we will transform the data (i.e. baseline and post‐intervention values) using the natural log and perform the meta‐analysis on the log scale before back‐transforming.\n\n【77】For sparse data, as might arise with any specific adverse effects that are reported in two or more trials, we will include zero‐event trials using the Peto odds ratio, as recommended in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ), when conducting meta‐analyses on rare events.\n\n【78】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【79】For this review, we plan to analyze each outcome at the level of the individual. Given the intervention and disease (amblyopia), trials are most likely to be randomized by the individual receiving the intervention and the comparator, rather than by eye.\n\n【80】It is possible that for some subgroup analyses, outcomes (e.g. best‐corrected visual acuity) data may be collected for both eyes rather than for one eye. When this is the case, we will use the data from the eye with the poorer visual acuity. If data are provided for each eye separately, as by definition of the condition, the eye with the poorer visual acuity is the treatment eye when there is an intraocular difference. This will avoid any potential analytical issues in correlation between the eyes. If the data are provided only for both eyes together, without separate data for each, we will follow the guidelines for clustering or paired design, as described in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews for Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ).\n\n【81】Additionally, it is possible that some trials will randomize using clusters and some may utilize a cross‐over design, as amblyopia is a stable condition for which treatment does not generally lead to permanent modification (i.e. low risk of carryover effects). We will include data from cluster‐RCTs and cross‐over RCTs in the meta‐analyses only if available data have been adjusted (or can be adjusted) to account for the intracluster and intra‐person correlations, respectively ( Higgins 2022c ). If the data from these types of trials are not adjusted, we will not include them in the quantitative analyses. We will instead conduct a qualitative synthesis of the data and results from these trials and place this within the broader context of the quantitative analyses for parallel trials and corresponding outcomes.\n\n【82】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【83】If there are missing data (e.g. missing full‐text report from a trial, missing information regarding study methods, missing summary data for an outcome, or individual participants missing from the summary data), we will contact the author(s) of the primary trials to request the information of interest. If the study investigators do not respond within two weeks, we will proceed with the available information and assess the impact of the missing data on the overall interpretation of results. If we are not able to obtain these data, we will report the available results. We will consider excluding studies with the missing data and studies at high risk of bias in a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【84】In dealing with missing data, we will follow the recommendations outlined in Chapters 6 and 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ; Higgins 2022a ). If the authors have correctly imputed missing data to allow an intention‐to‐treat analysis, we will use their imputed (i.e. complete) data. We will not impute the missing data.\n\n【85】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【86】We will assess trials for heterogeneity using the recommendations outlined in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ). We will assess clinical heterogeneity, including variability in participants, severity of amblyopia, type of amblyopia, interventions, and outcomes, by comparing characteristics across studies using tables of study characteristics. We will also assess clinical heterogeneity for frequency of follow‐up visits, and whether the visits were conducted in a clinic or via home monitoring. Adherence may vary if participants were contacted more frequently and in‐person versus remotely. We will assess methodological heterogeneity between trials by considering differences in RCT design (e.g. duration of follow‐up, masking, outcome measurements, etc.) and the risk of bias using RoB 2 ( Higgins 2022b ). We will assess statistical heterogeneity between studies using the magnitude and direction of effects of individual trials, and statistical evidence for heterogeneity (using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic and a P value < 0.10, from the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test as an indicator of significant heterogeneity) ( Higgins 2003 ). We will consider an I <sup>2 </sup> statistic of 50% or more to be at risk of moderate heterogeneity as recommended in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ). When significant heterogeneity is present, we will report it and explore potential causes by pre‐specified subgroup analyses as stated above. If appropriate, we will perform a sensitivity analysis by omitting individual studies to assess the robustness of meta‐analysis results.\n\n【87】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【88】We will examine the risk of reporting bias (due to selective reporting of outcomes) by comparing the outcomes defined in the trial protocol (where available) or clinical trial registry, with those in the full‐text publication(s).\n\n【89】If there are 10 or more studies to include in a meta‐analysis, we will assess any potential publication bias using a funnel plot ( Egger 1997 ). We will interpret any asymmetries in the funnel plot in association with the trial characteristics, considering factors such as sample size ( Page 2022 ).\n\n【90】#### Data synthesis\n\n【91】If appropriate, given clinical and methodological heterogeneity and availability of the data, we will perform pairwise meta‐analyses for the critical and important outcomes. We will perform meta‐analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Review Manager analysis software ( RevMan Web 2023 ), following guidance in Chapters 9 and 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2022 ; McKenzie 2022a ).\n\n【92】As noted in the Unit of analysis issues section, we will only incorporate cluster‐randomized or cross‐over trials in any relevant meta‐analyses with parallel trials if the available data are appropriately adjusted for their respective correlations ( Higgins 2022c ). If the data cannot be combined with the parallel trials, we will qualitatively assess these other trial designs. If there is statistical heterogeneity but all the effect estimates are in a consistent direction, such that a pooled estimate would seem to provide an appropriate summary of the individual RCT results, we will pool data with a meta‐analysis. If fewer than three trials are included in any meta‐analysis, we will use a fixed‐effect model; otherwise, we will use a random‐effects model to calculate pooled estimates. If we do not have the change data (either as the mean difference or as the pre‐ and post‐values), we will use the difference in percent adherence at the time point, as this alternative is appropriate within the context of a randomized trial ( Higgins 2022a ). We will use the generic inverse‐variance method to combine change data with post‐intervention time point data ( Deeks 2022 ). For multi‐arm studies, we will include complete data from all arms in our qualitative synthesis, but we will only include data from two arms (i.e. the primary intervention arm and comparison arm) in any quantitative analyses. For the quantitative harms, we will perform a meta‐analysis on any unique harm if it is reported in two or more included trials. We will extract and report estimates for any harms that are reported in only one trial, but we will not combine these data in meta‐analyses (see Data synthesis section).\n\n【93】If there is inconsistency between trial results such that a quantitative synthesis may not provide an appropriate summary of the findings (see Assessment of heterogeneity ), we will not conduct any meta‐analyses and perform a qualitative synthesis of the evidence based on the patterns of individual trial results. Specifically, we will use structured reporting of available effects in tables and visual displays, following guidance in Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( McKenzie 2022b ).\n\n【94】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【95】If the data are available from the included studies, we will perform subgroup analyses for the change in adherence up to three months by amblyopia type, treatment type, and age.\n\n【96】The type of amblyopia (i.e. unilateral or bilateral) can affect the complexity of the treatments that are required and, by proxy, the potential effectiveness of interventions implemented with the intention of improving treatment adherence ( Chen 2016 ).\n\n【97】The type of amblyopia treatment (i.e. glasses, patching, atropine penalization) may also affect the expected effect of an intervention designed to increase adherence, due to differences in treatment delivery ( Le 2022 ).\n\n【98】We will also stratify by child age (i.e. three to six years old, seven to 12 years old, and 13 to 17 years old), as interventions used to improve adherence may have varying impacts on children in different age groups ( Holmes 2011 ; Scheiman 2005 ). This stratification will also account for differences in the interventions themselves that may be present due to the different age groups.\n\n【99】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【100】If there are a sufficient number of studies without significant bias, we will determine if a risk of bias may have affected our results by rerunning our analysis on change in adherence up to three months after excluding studies at high overall risk of bias.\n\n【101】#### Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence\n\n【102】We will create a summary of findings table summarizing the review findings, following guidance outlined in Chapter 14 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Schünemann 2022 ). Two review authors will independently assess the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE classification ( GRADEpro GDT ). We will grade evidence certainty as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low', depending on the overall risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. We will include the following seven outcomes in the summary of findings table:\n\n【103】*   adherence to prescribed treatment using objective measures of adherence from (1) baseline to three months and (2) four to six months;\n    \n*   total hours of adherence to prescribed therapy from (1) baseline to three months and (2) four to six months;\n    \n*   change in distance recognition visual acuity measured in LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) from baseline to three months;\n    \n*   change in stereoacuity from baseline to three months;\n    \n*   proportion of participants experiencing any serious adverse events (if identified in included studies) by the end of follow‐up.\n    \n\n【104】Note that we will apply RoB2 in full only for \"Adherence to prescribed treatment using objective measures of adherence from baseline to three months\" and \"Proportion of participants experiencing any serious adverse events by the end of follow‐up.\" The other five outcomes' risk of bias will be informed by the first three domains of the RoB2 assessment for \"Adherence to prescribed treatment using objective measures of adherence from baseline to three months\".", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Some patients develop non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis. Bile acids may potentially protect cellular structures and may be of benefit in patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To systematically evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of bile acids versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions for patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched _The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register_ (July 2005), the _Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials_ ( _CENTRAL_ ) in _The Cochrane Library_ (Issue 2, 2005), _MEDLINE_ (1966 to July 2005), _EMBASE_ (1980 to July 2005), and the _Chinese Biomedical Database_ (1978 to July 2005).

No significant differences were found regarding mortality or improvement in liver function tests observed after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Data on the radiological and histological responses were too scant to draw any definite conclusions. Adverse events were non‐specific and considered of no major clinical relevance.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Presently, there are insufficient data to support or refute the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for patients with non‐alcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis.

Hepatic injury might be improved by bile acids. This systematic review identified four randomised clinical trials. Bile acids did not cause any liver‐related deaths and were associated with only minor, non‐specific adverse events. However, these agents did not show any significant amelioration of common liver function tests as compared with placebo. Moreover, data on the radiological (ultrasonography and computer tomography scan) and/or histological response were too limited to draw any conclusions. Further randomised placebo‐controlled trials are necessary.\n\n【22】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【23】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Eclampsia, the occurrence of one or more convulsions (fits) in association with the syndrome of pre‐eclampsia, is a rare but serious complication. Anticonvulsants are used in the belief they help prevent eclamptic fits and so improve outcome.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】The objective was to assess the effects of anticonvulsants for pre‐eclampsia on the women and their children.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (28 November 2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002).\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised trials comparing anticonvulsants with placebo or no anticonvulsants or comparisons of different anticonvulsants in women with pre‐eclampsia.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Six trials (11,444 women) compared magnesium sulphate with placebo or no anticonvulsant. There was more than a halving in the risk of eclampsia associated with magnesium sulphate (relative risk (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.58; number needed to treat (NNT) 100, 95% CI 50 to 100). The risk of dying was non‐significantly reduced by 46% for women allocated magnesium sulphate (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.10). For serious maternal morbidity RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.32. Side effects were more common with magnesium sulphate (24% versus 5%; RR 5.26, 95% CI 4.59 to 6.03; NNT for harm 6, 95% CI 6 to 5). The main side effect was flushing. Risk of placental abruption was reduced for women allocated magnesium sulphate (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; NNT 100, 95% CI 50 to 1000). Women allocated magnesium sulphate had a small increase (5%) in the risk of caesarean section (95% CI 1% to 10%). There was no overall difference in the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.15).\n\n【15】Magnesium sulphate was better than phenytoin for reducing the risk of eclampsia (two trials 2241 women; RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.84), but with an increased risk of caesarean section (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.41). It was also better than nimodipine (1 trial, 1650 women; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.77).\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Magnesium sulphate more than halves the risk of eclampsia, and probably reduces the risk of maternal death. It does not improve outcome for the baby, in the short term. A quarter of women have side effects, particularly flushing.\n\n【18】PICOs\n-----\n\n【19】### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Population (6)\n\n【21】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Pre-eclampsia\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【22】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【23】*   Antiepileptics\n\n【24】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【25】*   Placebo\n*   Antiepileptics\n\n【26】###### Outcome (4)\n\n【27】*   Premature Delivery\n*   Eclampsia\n*   Death\n*   Intensive Care\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Most women with mild pre‐eclampsia give birth without problems. However, severe pre‐eclampsia can cause problems with the liver, blood clotting etc, and some women have fits (eclampsia). These problems can cause severe difficulties for the babies. Sometimes mothers and babies die because of these problems, particularly in low‐income countries. This review showed magnesium sulphate reduced the number of women having fits but did not improve the babies' health. The magnesium sulphate had side effects for the mother, mostly flushing.\n\n【36】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【37】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We checked references of retrieved articles and reviews and contacted authors to identify additional studies.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials (CRTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before‐after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) that reported objectively measured professional practice, patient outcomes, health resource /services utilization, or training costs in healthcare settings (not restricted to studies in low‐income settings).\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We independently selected studies for inclusion, abstracted data using a standardised form, and assessed study quality. Meta‐analysis was not appropriate. Study results were summarised and appraised.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Two studies of varied designs were included. In one RCT of moderate quality, Newborn Resuscitation Training (NRT) was associated with a significant improvement in performance of adequate initial resuscitation steps (risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42, P < 0.001, adjusted for clustering) and a reduction in the frequency of inappropriate and potentially harmful practices (mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66, P = 0.004). In the second RCT, available limited data suggested that there was improvement in assessment of breathing and newborn care practices in the delivery room following implementation of Essential Newborn Care (ENC) training.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There is limited evidence that in‐service neonatal emergency care courses improve health‐workers’ practices when caring for a seriously ill newborn although there is some evidence of benefit.

Currently, a number of emergency care courses, adapted from developed countries are being promoted in developing countries as a means to improving the quality of care provided to seriously ill newborns or children. Whether these courses result in improvement in health workers’ ability to provide appropriate care remains unclear.\n\n【34】Although the results from the two included studies showed that emergency care training could be followed by improvement in health workers’ practices, because of the small number of studies, differences in the training courses, and weaknesses in the study methods, it is not possible to conclude that in general such in‐service training improves health worker practices when they are faced with a seriously ill child. Further well‐conducted studies are therefore needed to provide reliable evidence on what such courses achieve. To guide decisions regarding which interventions to invest in, such studies should also collect data on resources used and costs of training interventions.\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There is good evidence that diclofenac is effective for pain relief in adults, and side effects such as stomach upset are well known. However, developmental differences mean that children may sometimes react differently to medicines than adults do. It is important to assess whether diclofenac is also effective in children, and to understand the type and frequency of adverse reactions that diclofenac causes in children. This review has found that, as with adults, diclofenac is effective for the relief of pain after an operation. If it is given at the time of an operation, it will halve the number of children needing extra pain relief. Diclofenac seems to be twice as effective as paracetamol (acetaminophen) for surgical pain, and this is also true for adults. Diclofenac appears to cause similar types of serious adverse reactions (such as bleeding of the stomach and allergic‐type reactions), but these are rare and occur in fewer than 3 in 1000 children who take the drug. We had hoped to investigate whether diclofenac made children with asthma more wheezy, but there was not enough information for us to do this. The main conclusions of this review are that diclofenac is effective for relief of acute pain arising from operations in children, with a low risk of serious adverse reactions. Intramuscular injections of diclofenac should be avoided, due to risk of injection site problems. The main questions still to be answered are: What is the best dose to give and should diclofenac be avoided in children with asthma?\n\n【25】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【26】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The aim of this review is to determine the effects of Aloe vera derived products (for example dressings and topical gels) on the healing of acute (for example lacerations, surgical and burns) and chronic wounds (for example infected wounds, arterial and venous ulcers).\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The mechanism of wound healing is a complex biological process where the main goal is the promotion of tissue restoration ( Mendonca 2009 ). Wounds can result from many conditions including burns, arterial disease, surgery and trauma, and can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute wounds are wounds that follow a predictable and timely repair process which results in the restoration of sufficient anatomical and functional integrity ( Lazarus 1994 ) if healing proceeds normally. This predictable sequence of events can be broken down to initial inflammation, collagen and fibroblast deposition (scar tissue formation), angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), wound contraction and scar remodeling. Chronic wounds, however, are wounds where the repair process has been disrupted (e.g. infection, immunosuppression) and healing has been subsequently delayed.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Aloe vera (also known as _Aloe barbadensis_ Mill., _Aloe indica_ Royle, _Aloe perfoliata_ L. var. _vera_ and _A. vulgaris_ ) is a plant belonging to the Liliaceae Family, of which there are over 360 known species ( Vogler 1999 ). They are cactus‐like perennial succulents and are characterized by stemless large, thick, fleshy leaves that are lance shaped and have a sharp apex and a spiny margin ( Steenkamp 2007 ). The plant provides two distinct products: the yellow latex, which is referred to as Aloe juice, and the leaf pulp which is the innermost portion of the leaf and is composed of the parenchyma cells whose baseline function is for storage of food and nutrients that contain the aloe vera gel. The raw pulp contains about 98.5% water with the remaining 1.5% containing a range of compounds including water‐soluble and fat‐soluble vitamins, minerals, enzymes, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and organic acids ( Hamman 2008 ). The leaf pulp is commonly delivered as a topical ointment on wounds via a gel or cream form.\n\n【9】Aloe vera has been used in wound healing since ancient times, with evidence suggesting it was well known to the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Indian Culture. The use of Aloe vera was mentioned in the Ebers papyrus, widely considered as an important medical document of ancient Egypt dating back 1550 BC ( Atherton 1998 ). In 330 BC, the famous Greek King Alexander the Great was said to be persuaded by his mentor Aristotle to capture the island of Socotra (now part of modern day Yemen) in the Indian Ocean, famed for its supply of aloe which he needed to heal his wounded soldiers ( Atherton 1998 ).\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】Evidence from animal studies has highlighted the possible effects of Aloe vera in wound healing ( Chithra 1998 ; Mendonca 2009 ; Takzare 2009 ). Prostaglandin and bradykinin hydrolysing enzymes in Aloe vera, including carboxypeptidase and bradykinase, are hypothesised to reduce pain and inflammation ( Steenkamp 2007 ; Takzare 2009 ). Aloe‐derived polysaccharides such as mannose‐6‐phosphate have been postulated to be active growth substances, especially in epithelisation ( Davis 1994 ; Boudreau 2006 ; Steenkamp 2007 ). Davis 1994 hypothesised that the binding of mannose‐6‐phosphate to fibroblast receptors induces fibroblastic proliferation, which ultimately helps promote collagen deposition and tissue reorganisation. Acemannan, another polysaccharide, has been shown to up‐regulate white blood cell activity in the wound healing process ( Boudreau 2006 ; Tamura 2009 ). Similarly, Kuzuya 2001 suggested that the antibacterial properties of anthraquinones, an organic compound responsible for the natural pigment of Aloe vera, is beneficial in minimising infection ( Tamura 2009 ).\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Aloe vera enjoys a great degree of popularity amongst the general population ( Steenkamp 2007 ). It is used in a wide variety of products including cosmetics, creams and toiletries. However there is currently no up to date systematic review available on the effectiveness of this treatment for wound healing ( Vogler 1999 ; Maenthaisong 2007 ). The goal of this review is to summarise what is known of the effects of Aloe vera as a treatment for wounds (e.g. burns, lacerations, post‐surgical) and provide health practitioners and consumers with evidence about the effects of Aloe vera to assist them with their clinical decision‐making.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】The aim of this review is to determine the effects of Aloe vera derived products (for example dressings and topical gels) on the healing of acute (for example lacerations, surgical and burns) and chronic wounds (for example infected wounds, arterial and venous ulcers).\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】Trials involving participants of any age and disease state with acute or chronic wounds will be included. An acute wound will be considered to be any one of the following: surgical wounds, burns, lacerations and other skin injuries resulting from trauma. A chronic wound will be considered as any one of the following: skin ulcers, infected wounds, pressure ulcers, arterial and venous ulcers.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】Trials comparing the effects of wound treatment with Aloe vera, Aloe‐derived products, and a combination of Aloe vera and other dressings with placebo, standard wound care and other wound healing interventions.\n\n【24】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】*   Time to complete wound healing.\n    \n*   Proportion of participants to have a completely healed wound.\n    \n\n【27】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【28】*   Cosmetic appearance of wound healing.\n    \n*   Incidence of adverse events.\n    \n*   Incidence of infection.\n    \n*   Financial cost of wound healing.\n    \n*   Change in wound size.\n    \n*   Quality of life.\n    \n\n【29】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【30】#### Electronic searches\n\n【31】The following electronic databases will be searched:\n\n【32】*   The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register;\n    \n*   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library_ ;\n    \n*   Ovid MEDLINE (1950 onwards);\n    \n*   Ovid EMBASE (1980 onward);\n    \n*   EBSCO CINAHL (1982 onwards).\n    \n\n【33】The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be searched using the following proposed search string:\n\n【34】#1    MeSH descriptor Aloe explode all trees  \n#2    aloe\\*:ti,ab,kw  \n#3    (#1 OR #2)\n\n【35】This strategy will be adapted where appropriate to search Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. The Ovid MEDLINE search will be combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐ and precision‐maximizing version (2008 revision); Ovid format ( Lefebvre 2009 ). The Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches will be combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) ( SIGN 2010 ). There will be no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.\n\n【36】#### Searching other resources\n\n【37】The bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications identified by the above strategies will be searched for further studies. Authors and experts in the field will be contacted for any information about unpublished studies.\n\n【38】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【39】#### Selection of studies\n\n【40】The title and abstract of each potential study identified from the electronic searches will be screened by two review authors (FP and KP). Each author will decide on trial inclusion using pre‐determined eligibility criteria. Disagreement among authors will be resolved by discussion with a third review author (JD) when necessary.\n\n【41】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【42】Data extraction will be processed by two authors (AD and KP) onto a data extraction sheet. If any data are missing from trial reports, we will attempt to contact the study authors and acquire the data. Studies that are published in duplicate will be only included once but all versions will be considered for maximal data extraction. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion amongst the authors.\n\n【43】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【44】Two review authors (FP and KP) will independently assess the eligible studies for bias according to the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2009 ). This tool identifies six distinct domains including sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to validity (see Appendix 1 ).\n\n【45】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【46】For dichotomous data, we will extract counts to enable the calculation of the risk ratio. For continuous outcomes, we will extract mean difference and standard deviation to enable the calculation of the mean difference. If data are available on time to wound healing using time to event analyses and it is judged that a pooled analysis will be clinically informative, we will combine data using the general inverse variance method using both fixed and random effects models. Estimates of log rank estimates will be converted to log hazard ratios and standard errors and combined with estimates of log hazard ratios from Cox proportional models.\n\n【47】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【48】Because the healing of multiple wounds from an individual patient cannot be considered as independent events, the correct unit of randomisation to assess the healing of wounds will be the individual patient.  Measures of effect, such as counts of events or time to events, will also be analysed based on the individual patient.  Where there are possible issues related to the unit of randomisation or unit of analysis, for example if more than one wound on a patient is included in an analysis, the study authors will be contacted to obtain further data.\n\n【49】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【50】If there are trial papers with missing data, attempts will be made to make contact with the study authors.\n\n【51】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【52】Where it is judged the studies are sufficiently clinically homogeneous to estimate a pooled estimate of treatment effects, the results of individual studies will be combined in a meta‐analysis. A priori, we judge that the two most likely sources of clinical heterogeneity are a) the type of wound (for example surgical, lacerations and infected wounds) and b) the type of Aloe vera application.\n\n【53】We will investigate heterogeneity by the use of Chi squared and I squared statistics. Where there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity, results will not be combined in a meta‐analysis. Statistical heterogeneity will be considered substantial if the I squared statistic is greater than 60% or if the p value of the Chi squared statistic is < 0.10.\n\n【54】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【55】We will investigate possible publication bias by constructing a funnel plot of precision (SE of the log OR) against ORs for the primary endpoints of proportion of patients with a completely healed wound.\n\n【56】#### Data synthesis\n\n【57】Where possible, we will combine estimates of the effectiveness of Aloe vera for treatment of wounds. For dichotomous data, we will use both a fixed and random effects model to calculate a pooled relative risk, or a Peto odds ratio for uncommon outcomes. For continuous data, we will use both a fixed and random effects model to calculate a weighted mean difference.\n\n【58】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【59】We determined that the following analyses by sub‐group would be investigated for possible sources:\n\n【60】*   type of wound\n    \n*   type of Aloe vera application\n    \n\n【61】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【62】A sensitivity analysis will be performed by excluding studies of the lowest quality. In this sensitivity analysis, we will only include studies that are assessed as having a low risk of bias in all key domains, namely adequate generation of the randomisation sequence, adequate allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor, for the estimates of treatment effect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective of this systematic review is to measure the blood pressure raising effect of cyclosporine in comparison to placebo in randomized trials. We are not assessing adverse cardiovascular events as we expect the trials to be too short.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The association between elevated blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular events is well known. Hypertension is described as a very common (10% frequency estimate) side effect of cyclosporine therapy ( e‐CPS 2008 ). This side effect is of concern to  physicians and patients. Two trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of anti‐hypertensive drugs in cyclosporine‐associated hypertension ( Van den Dorpel 1994 , Bursztyn 1997 ). However, the incidence and magnitude of this side effect in different populations of patients treated with cyclosporine is not known.\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent discovered in 1972. Its effect is related to the inhibition of T lymphocyte‐dependent immune response by interfering with the synthesis of interleukin‐2 ( Hess 1982 , Elliott 1984 ). It was first used to prevent rejection in patients who have received a transplant. Latterly, the applications for cyclosporine therapy have broadened. Cyclosporine is currently used in the management of autoimmune diseases  such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis. Common side effects associated with a cyclosporine therapy are nephrotoxicity and hypertension.\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】The wider range of applications of cyclosporine therapy will lead to  more patients with possible side events. The official Canadian indications for cyclosporine are solid organ transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and nephritic syndrome ( e‐CPS 2008 ). Many other autoimmune diseases are being  treated with cyclosporine without an approved indication ( Tugwell 1990 ).\n\n【11】The exact mechanism of cyclosporine‐associated increase in blood pressure is not known, but several hypotheses have been proposed. Some investigators have suggested that blood pressure increase with cyclosporine is sodium dependent ( Curtis 1988 ); volume‐dependent ( Porter 1990 ) or due to direct vasoconstriction ( Xue 1987 , Golub 1987 ).\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】It is essential to know the magnitude of increase of blood pressure associated with cyclosporine in order to appropriately manage patients receiving the drug. Although cyclosporine‐induced blood pressure increase is a recognized side effect, the magnitude and characteristics of this side effect have not been documented or quantitated in a systematic review.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】The primary objective of this systematic review is to measure the blood pressure raising effect of cyclosporine in comparison to placebo in randomized trials. We are not assessing adverse cardiovascular events as we expect the trials to be too short.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Study design must meet the following criteria: Randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel design or crossover design trials. The rigorous design is essential to assess a highly variable measure such as blood pressure.\n\n【20】Duration of studies: minimum 1 day.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】All patients treated with cyclosporine will be included without restriction by type of disease. Healthy volunteers study participants will also be included.  There is also no restriction by age and sex.\n\n【23】#### Types of interventions\n\n【24】Cyclosporine compared to placebo.\n\n【25】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【26】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【27】The primary outcome is the mean change in mean arterial pressure (MAP). If systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) data are reported, the MAP will be calculated with the following formula: MAP= DBP + 1/3 (SBP‐DBP). If only SBP or DBP is reported, the mean change in the reported pressure will be used.\n\n【28】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【29】*   Mean change in systolic BP.\n    \n*   Mean change in diastolic BP.\n    \n*   Mean change heart rate.  This might provide some indication as to the mechanism of the change in BP.\n    \n*   Mean change in blood pressure variability (standard deviation).\n    \n\n【30】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【31】#### Electronic searches\n\n【32】The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) will be searched for related reviews.\n\n【33】The following electronic databases will be searched for primary studies:\n\n【34】1.  The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n    \n2.  Bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE (2000‐), EMBASE (1999‐), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1990‐)\n    \n\n【35】Electronic databases will be searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms relating to cyclosporine and hypertension.  No language restrictions will be used.  The following MEDLINE search strategy will be translated into the other databases using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable.\n\n【36】Database: Ovid MEDLINE(R) <2000 to current>\n\n【37】Search Strategy:\n\n【38】1.    Cyclosporine/\n\n【39】2.    cyclosporin$.tw.\n\n【40】3.    1 or 2\n\n【41】4.     randomized controlled trial.pt.\n\n【42】5.     controlled clinical trial.pt.\n\n【43】6.    randomized.ab.\n\n【44】7.     placebo.ab.\n\n【45】8.     drug therapy.fs.\n\n【46】9.     randomly.ab.\n\n【47】10.  trial.ab.\n\n【48】11.  groups.ab.\n\n【49】12.  or/4‐11\n\n【50】13\\. animals/ not (humans/ and animals/)\n\n【51】14\\. 12 not 13\n\n【52】15\\. 3 and 14\n\n【53】16\\. limit 15 to yr=\"2005 ‐ 2009\"\n\n【54】Full search strategies for other databases will be included in the Appendices of the review.\n\n【55】#### Searching other resources\n\n【56】*   Clinical Trials.gov and Current Controlled Trials\n    \n*   Hand searching of those high‐yield journals and conference proceedings which have not already been hand searched on behalf of the Cochrane Collaboration.\n    \n*   Reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews identified\n    \n*   Authors of relevant papers will be contacted regarding any further published or unpublished work\n    \n*   Authors of trials reporting incomplete information will be contacted to provide the missing information\n    \n*   ISI Web of Science will be searched for papers which cite studies included in the review\n    \n\n【57】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【58】Blood pressure measurements in any setting and by any means will be acceptable including the ausculatory or oscillometric method. If measurements are reported in more than one position, the measurement used will be according to following hierarchy: sitting, standing, supine.\n\n【59】Mean blood pressure results will be entered as mean change from placebo and standard error of the mean (SEM).  If SEM is not given it will be calculated from the SD of the change, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) or p value. If SD, SE or 95% CI is missing, SD will be imputed from average values and SEM will be calculated as imputed SD divided by the square root of N.\n\n【60】If blood pressure data is provided at different times after the initiation of cyclosporine therapy the weighted mean BP change from placebo from all the measurements will be used.\n\n【61】#### Selection of studies\n\n【62】Selection of studies will be based on the criteria listed above. Two independent reviewers (NR and GW) will assess the eligibility of the trials and if there is disagreement it will be resolved by a third reviewer (JMW).  Non‐English studies will be translated to determine whether they can be included. Reference Manager 12 software will be used to organize the references.\n\n【63】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【64】Two independent reviewers will independently extract the data (NR, GW) and the data will be cross‐checked before entering it into the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5.\n\n【65】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【66】The risk of bias assessment will be performed using the Risk of Bias Tables for each trial according to the Cochrane guidelines and the following criteria:\n\n【67】1.  Sequence generation\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment\n    \n3.  Blinding or objective assessment of primary outcomes\n    \n4.  Incomplete outcome data\n    \n5.  Selective outcome reporting\n    \n\n【68】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【69】In the case of missing standard deviation of the change in blood pressure, the standard deviation will be imputed based on the information in the same trial or from other trials using the same drug. The following hierarchy will be used to impute standard deviation values:\n\n【70】1.  standard deviation of change in blood pressure taken in a different position than that of the blood pressure data used\n    \n2.  standard deviation of blood pressure at the end of treatment\n    \n3.  standard deviation of blood pressure at the end of treatment measured in a different position than that of the blood pressure data used\n    \n4.  standard deviation of blood pressure at baseline (except if this measure is used for entry criteria)\n    \n5.  mean standard deviation of change in blood pressure from other trials using the same drug\n    \n\n【71】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【72】To identify statistical heterogeneity the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic will be used, values > 50% will be considered heterogeneous and in that case the random effects model will be used to assess the statistical significance of the treatment effect.\n\n【73】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【74】If possible the results will be analyzed for evidence of publication bias using funnel plots.\n\n【75】#### Data synthesis\n\n【76】Blood pressure data will be synthesized in tables and plots using RevMan 5.\n\n【77】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【78】If possible, subgroup analysis of effect of different doses, different disease state, duration of therapy on the treatment effect will be conducted.\n\n【79】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【80】The robustness of the results will be tested using the following characteristics:\n\n【81】1.  Trials with blood pressure data measured after short term vs. long term treatment with cyclosporine.\n    \n2.  Trials with parallel vs. cross over randomized patients.\n    \n3.

We performed fixed‐effect meta‐analysis for the outcomes: rate of exchange transfusion, cerebral palsy or other neurodevelopmental impairment, peak serum bilirubin level and all‐cause mortality.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Nine studies of 3449 participants were included. The rate of exchange transfusion was reduced in one study with liberal transfusion criteria (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.31) but not in the other two more recent studies with stringent criteria (typical RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.28). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of cerebral palsy (typical RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.85; two studies, 756 participants). However, one large study that reported on neurodevelopmental impairment (a composite outcome including cerebral palsy) found a slightly lower rate of neurodevelopmental impairment with prophylactic phototherapy (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; 1804 participants). The prophylactic phototherapy group had lower peak bilirubin levels (mean difference (MD) ‐2.73; 95% CI ‐2.89 to ‐2.57; six studies, 2319 participants) and had fewer neonates with peak unconjugated serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dl (typical RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.33; three studies, 1090 participants) or peak unconjugated serum bilirubin levels > 15 mg/dl (typical RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23; four studies, 1116 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of all‐cause mortality between the two groups (typical RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.26; four studies, 3044 participants).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Prophylactic phototherapy helps to maintain a lower serum bilirubin concentration and may have an effect on the rate of exchange transfusion and the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment.

This can be concerning because jaundice (caused by high levels of serum unconjugated bilirubin) could lead to permanent brain damage and/or death.\n\n【34】In this review we evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy in preventing jaundice in preterm or LBW infants. A total of nine clinical trials representing 3449 infants were included. The findings suggest that phototherapy initiated soon after birth (within 36 hours) for preterm or low birth weight infants may prevent the serum bilirubin from reaching a level that would require exchange transfusion and may reduce the risk of impairment of brain and central nervous system development. However, further well‐designed studies are needed to evaluate the effects of prophylactic phototherapy on brain and central nervous system development and other long‐term outcomes.\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, treatable but incurable obstructive lung disease defined by persistent airflow limitation. Diagnosis is determined by spirometry in the clinical context of a person presenting with dyspnoea, chronic cough or sputum production, and a history of risk factor exposure ( GOLD 2017 ). Development of COPD is primarily attributable to an enhanced chronic inflammatory airway response to noxious particles or gases and is strongly linked to a history of smoking. However, there are a number of other risk factors including exposure to air pollution, occupational exposures, genetics, asthma, history of severe childhood respiratory infection and low socioeconomic status ( GOLD 2017 ). Systemic effects, including systemic inflammation and muscle dysfunction, and comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression, are associated with COPD ( Choudhury 2014 ). Prevalence estimates suggest that COPD affects upwards of 384 million people ( Adeloye 2015 ), and is the third leading cause of death worldwide ( WHO 2017 ). Associated with advancing age ( Anton 2016 ), and in the context of the fastest rate of population growth occurring in people over 65 years of age ( UN 2015 ), COPD poses a substantial and growing economic and social burden ( GOLD 2017 ).\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】The term ‘physical activity’ is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure ( Casperson 1985 ). It is a complex behaviour traditionally described according to type, intensity and duration, and incorporates a subset of undertakings including exercise, occupational and household activities. Public health promotion for regular participation in physical activity typically references a minimum 150 minutes per week of at least moderate intensity activity in bouts of greater than 10‐minutes duration as ‘sufficient’ for health benefits across the adult population ( WHO 2010 ). These benefits include reduced risk of all‐cause mortality, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and depression ( Lee 2012 ).\n\n【9】Participation in regular physical activity is also endorsed for people with COPD ( GOLD 2017 ). Inactivity is one of the main risk factors for development of cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal comorbid conditions in people with COPD, and is observed across the disease spectrum ( Van Remoortel 2014 ). Recent studies show that physical activity is reduced in smokers prior to diagnosis ( Furlanetto 2014 ), in people with a recent diagnosis and mild COPD before symptom onset ( Johnson‐Warrington 2014 ), and is independent of other clinical characteristics including impaired exercise capacity ( Fastenau 2013 ; Gagnon 2015 ; Van Remoortel 2013 ; Watz 2009 ). Physical activity participation is reduced compared to healthy peers ( Pitta 2005 ; Vorrink 2011 ), and to people with other chronic conditions ( Arne 2009 ). It is further compromised during and after hospitalisation for an acute exacerbation ( Pitta 2006a ), and with increasing disease severity ( Shrikrishna 2012 ; Troosters 2010 ; Waschki 2015 ). In people with COPD, low levels of participation in physical activity have been independently associated with poor outcomes, including increased risk for hospitalisation and mortality ( Garcia‐Aymerich 2006 ; Garcia‐Rio 2012 ; Vaes 2014 ; Waschki 2011 ).\n\n【10】Much attention has been given to the development of physical activity interventions that incorporate strategies specifically designed to promote the adoption and maintenance of active lifestyles in the general population ( Marcus 2006 ). For the purposes of this Cochrane Review, an intervention is any approach used with the specific purpose of increasing objectively measured physical activity in people with COPD. Such interventions may be provided by a broad range of healthcare professionals and be delivered in a variety of ways (for example, face to face, via internet or telephone).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Evidence suggests that people with COPD avoid participation in physical activity due to the perception of breathlessness, resulting from inefficiencies related to gas trapping and lung hyperinflation. A vicious circle is perpetuated, where muscle deconditioning results from avoiding activities that involve physical exertion and exacerbate symptoms, further compromising physical capacity to engage in activity ( O’Donnell 2014 ). It is theorised that targeted interventions may be able to interrupt this cycle and increase participation in physical activity at a range of intensities that are associated with health benefits. The dual role of physical inactivity as both a cause and consequence in chronic disease identifies physical activity as a potentially modifiable target that could affect health‐related quality of life and disease trajectory ( Esteban 2010 ; Vaes 2014 ; Watz 2014 ). Whether improvements in physical activity can ameliorate these effects in COPD is unknown.\n\n【13】Many physical and physiological disease features also appear to influence participation in physical activity by people with COPD. However, the quality of association between such features, including lung function, systemic inflammation, body composition, co‐morbidities and psychosocial factors, and physical activity participation is variable ( Gimeno‐Santos 2011 ). Additional considerations, including fatigue ( Andersson 2015 ), balance ( Iwakura 2016 ), and seasonal and environmental factors ( Alahmari 2015 ; Sewell 2010 ), may also impact on physical activity participation in this group. The broad range of strategies considered to date to address physical inactivity in people with COPD (for instance, exercise training, nutritional interventions and behavioural strategies) reflects the complexity of this issue.\n\n【14】Increased physical activity has been associated with reduced rate of exacerbations ( Esteban 2014 ), which highlights that targeting improvements in physical activity in people with COPD may be an important therapeutic goal ( Langer 2016 ; Singh 2016 ). However, achieving consistent improvements in participation and strong evidence for the positive impact on health outcomes remain elusive.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Escalating awareness of the magnitude of the challenge posed by physical inactivity in COPD at all points in the disease course highlights the need for interventions to address the limited participation in physical activity by people with COPD. The widely accepted benefits of physical activity, coupled with the increasing availability of wearable monitoring devices to objectively measure participation, has led to a dramatic rise in the number and variety of studies that aim to improve physical activity levels in people with COPD. However, little is known about the relative effectiveness of interventions tested so far, partly attributable to the complexities of data analysis and challenge of rapidly evolving technology. Whether improvements in physical activity are accompanied by improved exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life is unknown. This Cochrane Review aims to evaluate the efficacy of existing interventions to increase physical activity in people with COPD and signpost directions for future work.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】All randomised controlled trials of interventions designed to increase participation in physical activity for people with COPD. We will only include studies that use objective measures for the assessment of physical activity, as previous consensus statements ( Watz 2014 ), and systematic reviews ( Dhillon 2015 ; Gimeno‐Santos 2011 ), have failed to identify subjective tools that accurately reflect daily physical activity in people with COPD.\n\n【23】We will include studies reported as full‐text articles, those published as abstract only and unpublished data. Physical activity may be either a primary or a secondary outcome of the study. As we expect most studies will examine behavioural interventions, we will not include crossover trials as it would be difficult to exclude carryover of intervention effects between periods.\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】We will include adults (18 years of age and over) with a diagnosis of COPD according to established criteria, regardless of disease severity. We will include studies that incorporate a mix of diagnostic groups only if we can obtain data on any of the review outcomes separately for people with COPD.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】We will include trials that objectively assess physical activity as an outcome. These trials may compare any intervention designed to increase physical activity with no/sham intervention, or may compare a targeted physical activity intervention in addition to another standard intervention common to both groups. Interventions may include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education programmes, activity counselling and self‐management strategies. These may be supervised or unsupervised interventions. The increased focus on physical activity as an outcome of interest for pulmonary rehabilitation, Spruit 2013 , has led to some studies considering its efficacy as an intervention to increase physical activity. Studies including objective assessment of physical activity will therefore be eligible for inclusion in this Cochrane Review. We will also include studies in which both groups received pulmonary rehabilitation (as defined by McCarthy 2015 ) and the inclusion of an additional specific physical activity intervention in one group is assessed.\n\n【28】##### Comparisons\n\n【29】*   One or more interventions to increase physical activity vs no intervention\n    \n*   One or more interventions to increase physical activity vs sham intervention\n    \n*   One or more interventions to increase physical activity in addition to a standard intervention common to both groups\n    \n\n【30】We will analyse studies that include pulmonary rehabilitation separately from studies that do not include pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n【31】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】*   Studies must include variable(s) that reflect participation in physical activity, as measured objectively using a pedometer, accelerometer or activity monitor. Outcomes of interest include, but are not limited to step count, activity counts, energy expenditure and physical activity time (different intensities, range of thresholds used). Primary time points will be at baseline (prior to commencement) and at the time of intervention completion; we will use change in physical activity from baseline for analysis where possible. Additionally, we will categorise any follow‐up measurements reported following intervention completion as either short‐term (within one month), medium‐term (between one to six months) or long‐term (longer than 6 months). We will seek raw data from the study authors where possible to facilitate comparisons.\n    \n\n【34】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【35】*   Health‐related quality of life (measured using either a generic or disease specific tool)\n    \n*   Exercise capacity: measured using a laboratory or field exercise test e.g. cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6‐minute walk test\n    \n*   Adverse events e.g. musculoskeletal injury\n    \n*   Adherence to intervention\n    \n\n【36】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【37】#### Electronic searches\n\n【38】We will identify trials from the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR), which is maintained by the Information Specialist for the Cochrane Airways Group. The CAGR contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal, as well as handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see Appendix 1 for further details). We will search all records in the CAGR using the search strategy in Appendix 2 .\n\n【39】We will also search of ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), the WHO ICTRP portal ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ) and the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( www.anzctr.org.au/ ). We will search all databases from their inception to the present, and we will impose no restriction on language of publication.\n\n【40】#### Searching other resources\n\n【41】We will check reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We will search relevant manufacturers' websites for trial information.\n\n【42】We will search for errata or retractions from included studies published in full‐text on PubMed ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) and report the date of publication in the review.\n\n【43】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【44】#### Selection of studies\n\n【45】Two review authors (AB and NC) will independently screen titles and abstracts for inclusion of all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search and will code them as either 'retrieve' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. We will retrieve the full‐text study reports/publications and two review authors (AB and NC) will independently screen the full‐text articles and identify studies for inclusion, and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third review author (AH). We will identify and exclude duplicates and will collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table ( Moher 2009 ).\n\n【46】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【47】We will use a data collection form that has been piloted on at least one included study in the review, to record study characteristics and outcome data. Two review authors (AB and NC) will independently extract the following study characteristics from included studies.\n\n【48】*   Methods: study design, duration of study, study locations, study setting, date of study\n    \n*   Participants: number, mean age, age range, gender, severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, baseline lung function, smoking history, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, withdrawals\n    \n*   Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant interventions\n    \n*   Measurement tool\n    \n*   Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected (at baseline and at the time of intervention completion) and follow‐up measurements at any other time points noted\n    \n*   Notes: funding for trial, notable conflicts of interest of trial authors\n    \n\n【49】We will resolve disagreements by reaching consensus, or by involving a third review author (AH).\n\n【50】We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if the included studies did not report outcome data in a useable way. We will contact study authors to verify extracted data when necessary and we will provide details of missing data when possible.\n\n【51】One review author (AB) will transfer data into the Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) file ( Review Manager 2014 ). We will double‐check that the review author have entered data correctly by comparing data presented in the systematic review with data provided in the study reports. A second review author (NC) will spot‐check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report.\n\n【52】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【53】Two review authors (AB and NC) will independently assess risk of bias for each included RCT using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author (AH or MA). We will assess risk of bias according to the following domains.\n\n【54】*   Random sequence generation\n    \n*   Allocation concealment\n    \n*   Blinding of participants and personnel\n    \n*   Blinding of outcome assessment\n    \n*   Incomplete outcome data\n    \n*   Selective outcome reporting\n    \n*   Other bias\n    \n\n【55】We will grade each potential source of bias as either high, low or unclear and will provide an extract from the study report together with a justification for our judgement. We will resolve discrepancies by consensus.\n\n【56】We will summarise the 'Risk of bias' judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed and summarise results in a ’Risk of bias' table.\n\n【57】We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes when necessary (e.g. for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of bias for adverse events may be very different from a patient‐reported symptom scale).\n\n【58】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account risk of bias for studies that contribute to this outcome.\n\n【59】##### Assesment of bias in conducting the systematic review\n\n【60】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.\n\n【61】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【62】We will analyse data for each outcome, irrespective of reported participant drop out (intention‐to‐treat analysis).\n\n【63】We will undertake meta‐analyses only when this is meaningful (i.e. if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make clinical sense).\n\n【64】We will analyse dichotomous data as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data we will calculate mean differences (MDs: same metric scale) or standardised mean differences (SMDs: different metric scales) with 95% CIs. We will narratively describe skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges.\n\n【65】Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant trial arms. If we combine two comparisons (e.g. drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) in the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【66】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【67】Where studies randomly allocate individual participants to a physical activity intervention or control/sham we will consider the participant as the unit of analysis. We do not expect to encounter cluster‐randomised studies, but if we do then we will consider the cluster as the unit of analysis. We will exclude crossover trials due to the potential carryover effects of behavioural interventions.\n\n【68】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【69】In the event of missing data, we will contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data when possible (e.g. when a study is reported only as an abstract). When this is not possible, and missing data may be related to the intervention, we will analyse the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by performing a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【71】We will use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identify substantial statistical heterogeneity, we will report it and explore possible causes by prespecified subgroup analyses.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【73】If we can pool more than 10 included trials, we will create a funnel plot and will analyse it to explore possible small‐study and publication biases.\n\n【74】#### Data synthesis\n\n【75】We will perform a pooled quantitative synthesis where the trials are clinically homogeneous. We will pool data using a random‐effects model to incorporate between study heterogeneity into the meta‐analysis. Where the trials are clinically heterogeneous we will perform a narrative synthesis. For instance, we will analyse data for different types of interventions separately, and also data for studies starting in the period following acute exacerbation separately from those in stable disease.\n\n【76】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【77】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes.\n\n【78】*   Physical activity: steps per day, energy expenditure, sedentary time and time spend in moderate to vigorous physical activity\n    \n*   Adverse events\n    \n\n【79】We will use the five Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to studies that contribute data to the meta‐analyses for prespecified outcomes. We will use methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ), and we will use GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool software ( GRADEpro GDT 2014 ). We will justify all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of the evidence using footnotes and we will provide comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.\n\n【80】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【81】We plan to perform the following subgroup analyses.\n\n【82】*   Duration of intervention (≤ 3 months versus > 3 months)\n    \n*   Supervision of intervention (yes or no)\n    \n*   Disease severity (mild disease, defined as FEV <sub>1 </sub> % predicted ≥ 80%, FER < 70, compared with other classifications)\n    \n\n【83】We will use physical activity as the outcome for subgroup analyses.\n\n【84】We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) ( Review Manager 2014 ).\n\n【85】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【86】We plan to examine the effects of methodological quality on the pooled estimate by removing studies that are at high or unclear risk of bias for the domains of blinding and incomplete outcome data. Additionally, we plan to examine the effects of measurement device on the pooled estimate by removing studies that use pedometers, as previous studies suggest these may be less accurate in detecting steps in people with COPD ( Pitta 2006b ).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Psychological therapies are emerging as effective interventions to treat children with chronic or recurrent pain. This update adds recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to the review published in 2009.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】To assess the effectiveness of psychological therapies, principally cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural therapy, for reducing pain, disability, and improving mood in children and adolescents with recurrent, episodic, or persistent pain. We also assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality of the included studies.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】Searches were undertaken of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycLIT. We searched for RCTs in references of all identified studies, meta‐analyses and reviews. Date of most recent search: March 2012.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】RCTs with at least 10 participants in each arm post‐treatment comparing psychological therapies with active treatment were eligible for inclusion (waiting list or standard medical care) for children or adolescents with episodic, recurrent or persistent pain.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】All included studies were analysed and the quality of the studies recorded. All treatments were combined into one class: psychological treatments; headache and non‐headache outcomes were separately analysed on three outcomes: pain, disability, and mood. Data were extracted at two time points; post‐treatment (immediately or the earliest data available following end of treatment) and at follow‐up (at least three months after the post‐treatment assessment point, but not more than 12 months).\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Eight studies were added in this update of the review, giving a total of 37 studies. The total number of participants completing treatments was 1938. Twenty‐one studies addressed treatments for headache (including migraine); seven for abdominal pain; four included mixed pain conditions including headache pain, two for fibromyalgia, two for pain associated with sickle cell disease, and one for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Analyses revealed five significant effects. Pain was found to improve for headache and non‐headache groups at post‐treatment, and for the headache group at follow‐up. Mood significantly improved for the headache group at follow‐up, although, this should be interpreted with caution as there were only two small studies entered into the analysis. Finally, disability significantly improved in the non‐headache group at post‐treatment. There were no other significant effects.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Psychological treatments are effective in reducing pain intensity for children and adolescents (<18 years) with headache and benefits from therapy appear to be maintained. Psychological treatments also improve pain and disability for children with non‐headache pain. There is limited evidence available to estimate the effects of psychological therapies on mood for children and adolescents with headache and non‐headache pain. There is also limited evidence to estimate the effects on disability in children with headache. These conclusions replicate and add to those of the previous review which found psychological therapies were effective in reducing pain intensity for children with headache and non‐headache pain conditions, and these effects were maintained at follow‐up.\n\n【15】PICOs\n-----\n\n【16】### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Population (7)\n\n【18】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Headache\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Chronic Pain\n\n【19】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【20】*   Psychotherapy\n\n【21】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【22】*   Drug Therapy\n*   Usual Care\n*   Waiting list control\n\n【23】###### Outcome (6)\n\n【24】*   Disability\n*   Pain\n*   Depression\n*   Anxiety\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Pain Intensity\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

For children and adolescents there is good evidence that both relaxation and cognitive behavioural therapy (treatment that helps people test and revise their thoughts and actions) are effective in reducing the severity and frequency of pain in chronic headache, recurrent abdominal pain, fibromyalgia, sickle cell disease, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis immediately after treatment is delivered. Psychological therapies also have a lasting effect for improving mood and reducing pain for chronic headache. Forty‐nine per cent of children who received psychological therapies reported less pain compared with 17% of children who did not receive a psychological therapy. Disability is improved immediately after treatment for many pain conditions (not chronic headache) which helps young people to participate in important daily activities. More studies are needed to understand whether psychological therapies can improve mood and have more lasting effects on pain and disability in other groups of young people who have chronic pain.\n\n【30】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【31】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The aim of this review is to assess the effects of supplementary selenium, given at any dose, on:\n\n【3】*   adverse effects of conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or cancer surgery\n    \n*   quality of life and performance status during and after conventional cancer therapy\n    \n\n【4】A further aim is to make recommendations for future research.\n\n【5】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Selenium is an essential trace element for humans. It is involved in antioxidant protection and redox regulation as a component of seleno‐proteins and as a source of seleno‐metabolites ( Hatfield 2001 ).\n\n【8】Several adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cancer patients have been linked to the formation of free radicals and the related oxidative damage to normal cells. Therefore, intervention strategies have been investigated to use biological response modifiers as toxicity antagonists for prevention of chemotherapy and radiotherapy associated side effects. _In vitro_ and animal experiments have found a cytoprotective effect of selenium on healthy tissue without reducing radiotherapy or chemotherapy activity against cancer cells ( Kotamraju 2000 ; Rodemann 1999 ; Schleicher 1999 ; Yoshida 2000 ). Varying bioavailability, metabolic pathways and cellular effects have been shown in laboratory experiments for different sources of organic and inorganic selenium compounds (e.g. selenized yeast, selenized garlic, sodium selenite) ( Fleming 2001 ; Ip 2000 ). However, neither the impact of the form of selenium on its _in vivo_ effects nor the different dose‐response relationships, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, are yet fully understood ( Sinha 2004 ).  \n  \nThe role of the complementary use of selenium in cancer patients is unclear. Some trials could show a positive effect of selenium supplementation on radio‐ or chemotherapy associated side effects, and lymphedema following surgical cancer treatment. However, trial evidence is inconsistent, and a systematic review on this topic could not be found.\n\n【9】Surveys in Canada, UK and Germany found that 4 to 12% of all breast cancer and prostate cancer patients used selenium supplements during and after cancer therapy to alleviate the adverse effects of conventional therapy and to improve quality of life ( Cheetham 2001 ; Nam 1999 ; Petru 2001 ; Sehouli 2000 ). This high number of cancer patients using selenium supplements contrasts with the little clear evidence in this field.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】The aim of this review is to assess the effects of supplementary selenium, given at any dose, on:\n\n【12】*   adverse effects of conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or cancer surgery\n    \n*   quality of life and performance status during and after conventional cancer therapy\n    \n\n【13】A further aim is to make recommendations for future research.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【16】#### Types of studies\n\n【17】Randomized‐controlled trials will be included in this review. Quasi‐randomized trials and controlled clinical studies, in which no attempt for random allocation of treatment was made, will be reported, but will not be included in meta‐analytic procedures.\n\n【18】#### Types of participants\n\n【19】Trials that have recruited patients of any age with malignant diseases (regardless of the stage of disease) who are undergoing tumor‐specific therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) will be included.\n\n【20】#### Types of interventions\n\n【21】Trials that assess selenium supplements or selenium preparations at any dose, duration, route of administration compared with placebo, no intervention or routine care will be included. Trials using selenium supplements as part of a multi component preparation in which there is no arm testing for selenium supplements alone will not be included in this review. Collateral interventions (e.g. manual therapy for lymphoedema) will be allowed if adequately controlled and used in all arms of the trial.\n\n【22】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【23】We will collect data on the following outcomes:\n\n【24】*   the effect of selenium on the incidence and severity of chemo‐ or radiotherapy related toxicities if they are reported according to internationally accepted criteria for common toxicities (e.g. World Health Organisation, ECOG or National Institutes of Health criteria for adverse effects) ( DCTD 2003 ; Miller 1981 ; Oken 1982 )\n    \n*   the effect of selenium on the incidence and severity of lymphoedema following surgical treatment or radiotherapy\n    \n*   patient‐reported levels of physical and psychological indices of symptom distress (measured using reliable and valid assessment tools)\n    \n*   quality of life, as measured by a validated instrument\n    \n*   any adverse effects\n    \n\n【25】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【26】**Electronic databases**  \nThe literature search will include the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group's trials register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL in _The Cochrane Library_ Issue 2, 2004; MEDLINE (1966 to present); EMBASE (1980 to present); SIGLE; CancerLit; and CCMed (Clinical Contents in Medicine, Germany).\n\n【27】The MEDLINE search (PubMed) strategy will incorporate the search strategy to identify controlled trials (adapted from Lefebvre 2001 ):\n\n【28】#1 selen\\* OR seleno\\* OR selenium \\[MeSH\\] OR selenium compounds \\[MeSH\\] OR organoseleno compounds \\[MeSH\\]  \n#2 epidemiologic study characteristics \\[MeSH\\] OR random\\* OR placebo\\* OR clinical trial\\* OR double blind method OR single blind method OR random allocation  \n#3 neoplasms \\[MeSH\\] OR stem cell transplantation \\[MeSH\\] OR therapeutics \\[MeSH\\] OR antineoplastic agents \\[MeSH\\] OR quality of life \\[MeSH\\]  \n#4 cancer\\* OR malignan\\* OR carcino\\* OR neoplasm\\* OR tumor\\* OR tumour\\*  \n#5 radioth\\* OR radiat\\* OR irradiat\\* OR radiochemo\\* OR radio‐chemo\\* OR chemotherap\\*  \n#6 melanoma\\* OR sarcoma\\* OR adenoma\\* OR adenosarcoma\\* OR adenocarcinoma\\* OR carcinosarcoma\\* OR chondrosarcoma\\* OR fibrosarcoma\\* OR dermatofibrosarcoma\\* OR neurofibrosarcoma\\* OR hemangiosarcoma\\* OR leiomyosarcoma\\* OR liposarcoma\\* OR myosarcoma\\* OR rhabdomyosarcoma\\* OR myxosarcoma\\* OR osteosarcoma\\* OR lymphoma\\* OR stem cell transplant\\* OR stem‐cell transplant\\* OR bone marrow transplant\\*  \n#7 lymphedem\\* OR lymphoedem\\* OR cardiotox\\* OR nausea\\* OR vomit\\* OR hair loss\\* OR leukopenia\\* OR neutropenia\\* OR thrombopenia\\* OR anemia\\* OR anaemia\\*  \n#8 #3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 OR #7  \n#9 #1 AND #2 AND #8  \n#10 animals\\[mh\\] NOT humans\\[mh\\]  \n#11 #9 NOT #10\n\n【29】**Other sources**\n\n【30】*   The Chinese Cochrane Centre and the Russian branch of the Nordic Cochrane Centre will be contacted for information about clinical trials in Chinese and Russian databases.\n    \n\n【31】*   The internet will be searched to retrieve relevant clinical trials and ongoing studies (eg, mRCT/ISRCTN via www.controlled‐trials.com; www.cancer.gov; www.studien.de).\n    \n\n【32】*   Authors of publications and manufacturers will be contacted and asked to contribute information about published or unpublished studies.\n    \n\n【33】*   Reference lists of publications will be checked for further studies.\n    \n\n【34】**Language**  \nPapers published in languages other than English papers will be included in this review.\n\n【35】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【36】**Study selection**  \nStudies identified will be checked for eligibility by two reviewers. Articles will be considered eligible if reviewers can identify from the abstract that the article is a report of an interventional trial. The full text of a trial report will be checked if the study cannot be rejected with certainty on the basis of its title and abstract. The full text of all studies of possible relevance will be obtained, translated if necessary, and independently assessed by two reviewers.\n\n【37】If information necessary to make decisions on inclusion or exclusion is missing from trial reports, we will try to obtain the information through direct contact with authors. Reasons for excluding trials from the review will be reported in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.\n\n【38】The reviewers will not be blinded to authors´ names, institution and source of publication.\n\n【39】Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion between the reviewers (if necessary, involving a third party) until consensus is reached.\n\n【40】**Methodological quality**  \nThe reviewers will assess trials for methodological quality. A critical appraisal checklist according to Juni 2001 will be used to assess methodological quality. This checklist assesses the following aspects of methodological quality:\n\n【41】*   randomisation, allocation concealment;\n    \n*   blinding;\n    \n*   specification of eligibility criteria;\n    \n*   equal provision of care (apart from selenium supplementation) and equal follow up;\n    \n*   similarity of groups at baseline;\n    \n*   reporting of protocol deviations, withdrawals and drop‐outs;\n    \n*   reporting of outcome measures and adverse effects;\n    \n*   statistical procedures (intention‐to‐treat analysis).\n    \n\n【42】Additionally, studies will be rated according to the Jadad scale ( Jadad 1996 ) and the Delphi list ( Verhagen 1998 ).\n\n【43】**Data extraction**  \nTwo reviewers will independently extract and document data using a specific, pre‐tested data extraction form. The following information will be collected:\n\n【44】*   study methods (randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, eligibility criteria, follow up);\n    \n*   participants (number of participants in the trial patient characteristics, age, gender, cancer type, other cancer management and treatment, comorbidity) and additional treatments and medication;\n    \n*   interventions (selenium dose, regimen, duration of treatment, route of administration) and placebo;\n    \n*   outcome measures;\n    \n*   study withdrawals, drop‐outs and protocol violations;\n    \n*   adverse effects;\n    \n*   informed consent, research ethics approval.\n    \n\n【45】Discrepancies will be discussed and, if not resolved, the opinion of a third, independent person will be sought. Where data are unclear or further information is required, authors of studies will be contacted.\n\n【46】If several reports from the same study are identified, the most recent or most detailed publication will be used for data extraction of outcome variables. Data from all eligible studies will be summarised in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.  \n  \nIf trials include participants with more than one tumour, outcomes will be extracted 'overall' and, if possible, for each tumour type separately.\n\n【47】**Adverse events**  \nThe number of patients experiencing any adverse effect of selenium and the number of adverse effects described in each included study (both major and minor) will be reported.  \n  \n**Analysis**  \nFor each outcome a summary statistic and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using RevMan Analysis 1.0.2 in Review Manager 4.2.6. In the case of dichotomous data the effect measure will be the risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR). For continuous data, weighted mean difference (WMD) will be calculated if the same scale is used in all trials; otherwise the standardized mean difference (SMD) will be calculated. For trials based on time‐to‐event analyses, hazard ratios will be used, if available. If necessary, risk ratios will be calculated from data extracted from published survival curves.\n\n【48】As randomized controlled trials on the complementary use of selenium in cancer therapy are rare we do not expect to be able to perform a meta‐analysis of summary statistics. Should meta‐analysis be appropriate, fixed or random effects models will be used depending on the heterogeneity detected among studies in chi‐square test (with fixed effects models only used if p<.10). The 'inconsistency statistic', I², ( Higgins 2002 ) will be derived using RevMan Analysis 1.0.2 in Review Manager 4.2.6. The consistency of the treatment effect across the primary studies will be investigated in sensitivity analyses. A decision regarding whether to combine quality of life outcomes and data on treatment‐related and/or disease‐related symptoms will be made depending on how this information is collected in each trial.\n\n【49】**Sub‐groups**  \nIf appropriate, sub‐group analysis by cancer type, treatment characteristics, and study quality will be undertaken.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of aqueous shunts for reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Introduction**  \nAqueous shunts are employed as surgical interventions to control intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open‐angle or secondary angle‐closure glaucomas that have failed medical and laser therapies in addition to one or more surgical procedures such as trabeculectomy. The term aqueous shunt is preferred by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as most appropriate for the group of devices referred to in current peer reviewed literature as glaucoma drainage devices, tube‐implants, tube‐shunts or inappropriately as setons, a term that should be reserved for non‐lumened devices ( Minckler 1997 ; ANSI Z80 1998 ).\n\n【6】With one exception, the ExPRESS™, all aqueous shunts to be considered in this review are composed of a lumened silicone‐rubber tube attached to an explant plate. The Molteno implant, the first successful and widely utilized such device remains the \"gold standard\" commercially available example ( Molteno 1981 ; Molteno 2001 ; Molteno 2003 ). Newer shunts, including the Ahmed, Baerveldt, and Krupin, have features in common with the Molteno, but vary in size, shape, composition and the presence or absence of flow restricting components ( Prata 1996 ). Among these four, all but the Krupin are available with different sized explants. The Ahmed and Molteno devices come in one‐ or two‐plate versions. The Ahmed is now available in either rigid (polymethylmethracylate) or flexible (silicone‐rubber) versions in one or two‐plate models. The Schocket device, assembled intraoperatively, utilizes buckling elements and a segment of silicone rubber tubing. The modified Schocket procedure utilizes a previously installed buckle element as the explant to which a segment of tubing is attached. Schocket shunts are essentially equivalent in concept to commercially available devices ( Schocket 1982 ; Sidoti 1994 ). The surface area of the explant has been demonstrated to correlate with clinical efficacy in humans ( Heuer 1992 ). The most recently marketed shunt, the ExPRESS™, is a translimbal stainless steel tube with an internal diameter of 50µm ( Gandolfi 2002 ). The OptiMed, White shunt pump, and Joseph implants, while of relatively recent origin are probably not in current use.  \n  \n**Epidemiology**  \nBased on informal feedback from manufacturers and Medicare database information (1995 & 1998), approximately 3000 to 4000 aqueous shunts are utilized per year in the US alone, with an even greater number internationally. Aqueous shunts are used in infants and children in addition to adults, but no survey has been done allowing breakdown by glaucoma category, sex or specific age ranges, or safety and efficacy of the variety of different sized devices available. There are no good data indicating a change in utilization patterns of aqueous shunts with regard to age, sex or race, but it seems likely they will be increasingly applied to complex glaucomas at an earlier stage, especially during combined glaucoma and cataract procedures ( Hoffman 2002 ). Commercially available aqueous shunts cost between $400.00 and $600.00 in the US.\n\n【7】**Indications for use**  \nThe majority of adult eyes in which aqueous shunts are currently used in the US are pseudophakic (contain a lens implant after cataract extraction) ( Mills 1996 ; Minckler 1988 ). Aqueous shunts also have clinical application to neovascular, post‐traumatic, and inflammatory glaucomas, and congenital glaucomas that fail goniotomy or trabeculotomy ( Djodeyre 2001 ). Aqueous shunts are used to manage glaucoma in complex cases where penetrating keratoplasty and retina‐vitreous surgery may be simultaneously or serially performed ( Lloyd 1989 ). They are preferred to cyclodestructive procedures (surgery that destroys part of the ciliary body: cyclocryotherapy or trans‐scleral laser) when functional central vision (better than 20/100) is present ( Chalam 2002 ). Aqueous shunts may be preferable to trabeculectomy with adjunctive antifibrotic agents in people who work in dusty or dirty environments or who are immuno‐compromised as the risk of late infection is less.\n\n【8】The flow‐restricted devices (Ahmed, Krupin, White shunt pump, Joseph implant, OptiMed) are typically installed in one stage (complete installation) with immediate function. The non flow‐restricted devices (Molteno, Baerveldt) are typically installed in two stages either in two separate operations or with utilization of a variety of temporary flow‐restricting techniques. With all of these devices the anterior edge of the explant plate is generally located 8 ‐ 10 millimeters posterior to the limbus with the explant centered at the equator ( Minckler 1988 ; Prata 1995 ; Prata 1995a ). The delay in opening of the non flow‐restricted shunts in two stage operations allows encapsulation to develop over the explant before aqueous flow begins and reduces the risk of hypotony postoperatively. The ExPRESS™ is currently being marketed as a one stage device.\n\n【9】**Prognosis, Complications and Alternatives**  \nAqueous shunts may prevent or delay blindness and visual disability in a large percentage of people in whom they are used. Pre‐existing co‐morbidities, including optic nerve injury, corneal disease, and or other damage related to past trauma or previous surgery are frequently present in eyes in which shunts are employed. Prospectively, aqueous shunts probably increase the risk of endothelial failure and they are widely thought to increase the risk of graft failure after penetrating keratoplasty, especially with the drainage tube installed in the anterior chamber.\n\n【10】The long‐term outcome (success & persistence of benefit) for aqueous shunts has not been well studied, but some reports indicate that IOP control benefits may extend out several decades ( Molteno 2001 ; Molteno 2003 ). In general, the failure rates per year parallel those of trabeculectomy in similar cases ( FFSSG 1996 ).\n\n【11】The principal long‐term complication of aqueous shunts is corneal endothelial decompensation. Other postoperative problems include transient hypotony, probably due to leak around the tube in limbal tissues or failure of flow‐restricting devices to maintain sufficient resistance. Additionally, several reports have described a postoperative hypertensive phase, probably due to inflammation induced by aqueous flow around the explant, necessitating resumption of topical anti‐glaucoma medications for many weeks. Clinical failure in many cases is due to excessive fibrosis and relative impermeability of the capsule around the explant.\n\n【12】The current standard initial surgical procedure for glaucoma is trabeculectomy. In some locales, non‐penetrating filtering procedures would be the first alternative, before trabeculectomy and before aqueous shunts. Aqueous shunts are currently the standard of care in the US for complicated glaucomas, especially pseudophakic eyes that have failed one or more previous trabeculectomies.\n\n【13】**Rationale for systematic review**  \nRecently published retrospective case series have indicated long‐term benefit from aqueous shunts in pseudophakic, inflammatory, and traumatic glaucomas ( Molteno 2001 ; Molteno 2003 ). However, there has been no review of randomized trials as to the effectiveness and safety of aqueous shunts as surgical therapy for glaucomas. Controversy persists regarding when aqueous shunts should be used in the sequence of glaucoma surgeries. Most surgeons reserve aqueous shunts until one or more standard procedures have failed. The use of aqueous shunts in combined cataract and glaucoma surgeries has received relatively little attention and no randomized trials investigating this issue have been identified ( Hoffman 2002 ). Most reported randomized trials have examined shunts to glaucomas after previous failed standard surgery. A new study, not yet reported, comparing tube versus trabeculectomy is underway centered at Bascom Palmer in Miami.\n\n【14】Through this study we aim to systematically review the safety and effectiveness of aqueous shunts for surgical therapy of glaucoma including their efficacy for IOP control and complication rates.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of aqueous shunts for reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】We will include randomized and quazi‐randomized trials.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】We will include trials in which the participants were diagnosed with glaucoma irrespective of their lens status. There will be no restrictions with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, co‐morbidities, use of adjunctive medications or the number of participants.\n\n【23】#### Types of interventions\n\n【24】We will include trials that compare various aqueous shunts used for glaucoma to standard surgery or to each other.\n\n【25】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【26】**Primary outcome**  \n1\\.

Mean decrease from baseline at 1 year will be considered as the main primary outcome of the review.\n\n【28】(b) We will dichotomize the data when possible and use the following definitions for control of IOP:\n\n【29】*   Success ‐ a decrease of IOP by 15% from baseline at 12 months.\n    \n*   Complete success ‐ IOP </= 21 mmHg on no adjunctive medications at 12 months.\n    \n*   Qualified success ‐ IOP </= 21 mmHg on medications at 12 months.\n    \n*   Failure ‐ IOP > 21 mmHg on or off medications at 12 months or complete loss of vision or performance of additional surgery or loss of the eye.\n    \n\n【30】**Secondary outcomes**  \n1\\. Visual acuity will be considered stable if unchanged or within one line or letter of baseline measurements (Snellen; DTRS; Log MAR) at last follow up. Decreased vision will be defined as loss of two or more lines or letters compared to baseline using the same measuring methods at last follow up.  \n2\\. The duration (weeks) of a recognizable postoperative hypertensive phase (> 5 mm Hg elevation of IOP above baseline levels).  \n3\\. The follow‐up interval required to reach a 15% reduction from baseline IOP in weeks and the duration of this effect (months‐years) attributable to the shunt through last follow up.  \n4\\. Visual field as available throughout follow up and at last follow up and measured by any method.  \n5\\. Total number of antiglaucoma medications, both topical and systemic as adjuncts to surgery at variable lengths of follow up.\n\n【31】**Complications**  \nIntraoperative, early (within the first two days) and late (after two days) postoperative complications will be tabulated for all devices. Adverse effects of interest include corneal injury (endothelial decompensation/edema); choroidal hemorrhage; retinal detachment; cataract; hypotony, infection, strabismus, host‐immune response to anterior chamber tubes (keratic precipitates), and clinical failure. Late hypotony or late wound leaks will be recorded as will late failure due to vitreous or fibrin plugging of tubes including pars plana installations in post vitrectomy eyes.\n\n【32】Additionally, we will tabulate adverse events from well done prospective or retrospective non‐randomized studies.\n\n【33】**Quality of life**  \nData on quality of life will be described when available.\n\n【34】**Follow up**  \nSince intraoperative and both early and late postoperative complications are of interest, there will not be a restriction based on the length of follow up.\n\n【35】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【36】**Electronic searches**  \nTrials will be identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group trials register) on _The Cochrane Library_ , MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database). There will be no language or date restrictions in the electronic searches.\n\n【37】The following strategy will be used to search CENTRAL:\n\n【38】#1 GLAUCOMA explode tree 1 (MeSH)  \n#2 glaucom\\*  \n#3 #1 or #2  \n#4 INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE single term (MeSH)  \n#5 (intraocular near pressure)  \n#6 (intra‐ocular near pressure)  \n#7 (#4 or #5 or #6)  \n#8 (#3 or #7)  \n#9 GLAUCOMA DRAINAGE IMPLANTS explode tree 1 (MeSH)  \n#10 (Molteno or Ahmed or Baerveldt or Krupin or Schocket or Joseph or Optimed)  \n#11 (shunt\\* or device\\*)  \n#12 glaucom\\* near drainage  \n#13 (tube near implant\\*)  \n#14 (tube near seton\\*)  \n#15 White:ti  \n#16 White: ab  \n#17 (#9 or #10 or #11 or #12 or #13 or #14 or #15 or #16)  \n#18 (#8 and #17)\n\n【39】The following strategy will be used to search MEDLINE on SilverPlatter:  \n#1 explode \"GLAUCOMA\"/ all subheadings  \n#2 glaucoma\\*  \n#3 \"INTRAOCULAR‐PRESSURE\"/ all subheadings  \n#4 intra?ocular near3 pressure  \n#5 #1 or #2 or #3 or #4  \n#6 \"GLAUCOMA‐DRAINAGE‐IMPLANTS \"/ all subheadings  \n#7 \"MOLTENO‐IMPLANTS\"/ all subheadings  \n#8 (Molteno or Ahmed or Baerveldt or Krupin or Schocket or Joseph or Optimed or White or Express) in TI, AB  \n#9 shunt\\* or device\\*  \n#10 glaucom\\* near drainage  \n#11 tube near (implant\\* or seton\\*)  \n#12 #6 or #7 or #8 or #9 or #10 or #11  \n#13 #5 and #12\n\n【40】To identify randomized controlled trials, this search will be combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy phases one and two as contained in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook ( Alderson 2004 ).\n\n【41】The following strategy will be used to search EMBASE on SilverPlatter:  \n#1 explode\"GLAUCOMA\"/ all subheadings  \n#2 glaucoma\\*  \n#3 \"INTRAOCULAR‐PRESSURE\"/ all subheadings  \n#4 intra?ocular near3 pressure  \n#5 #1 or #2 or #3 or #4  \n#6 \"GLAUCOMA‐DRAINAGE‐IMPLANT\"/ all subheadings  \n#7 (Molteno or Ahmed or Baerveldt or Krupin or Schocket or Joseph or Optimed or White or Express) in TI, AB  \n#8 shunt\\* or device\\*  \n#9 glaucom\\* near drainage  \n#10 tube near (implant\\* or seton\\*)  \n#11 #6 or #7 or #8 or #9 or #10  \n#12 #5 and #11\n\n【42】To identify randomized controlled trials, this search will be combined with the following search:\n\n【43】#1 \"RANDOMIZED‐CONTROLLED‐TRIAL\"/ all subheadings  \n#2 \"RANDOMIZATION\"/ all subheadings  \n#3 \"CONTROLLED‐STUDY\"/ all subheadings  \n#4 \"MULTICENTER‐STUDY\"/ all subheadings  \n#5 \"PHASE‐3‐CLINICAL‐TRIAL\"/ all subheadings  \n#6 \"PHASE‐4‐CLINICAL‐TRIAL\"/ all subheadings  \n#7 \"DOUBLE‐BLIND‐PROCEDURE\"/ all subheadings  \n#8 \"SINGLE‐BLIND‐PROCEDURE\"/ all subheadings  \n#9 #1 or #2 or #3 or #4 or #5 or #6 or #7 or #8  \n#10 random\\* or cross?over\\* or factorial\\* or placebo\\* or volunteer\\* in TI,AB  \n#11 (singl\\* or doubl\\* or trebl\\* or tripl\\*) near (blind\\* or mask\\*) in TI,AB  \n#12 #9 or #10 or #11  \n#13 HUMAN in DER  \n#14 (ANIMAL or NONHUMAN) in DER  \n#15 #13 and #14  \n#16 #14 not #15  \n#17 #12 not #16  \n  \nLILACS will be searched using the term glaucoma$ combined with the terms Molteno, Ahmed, Baerveldt, Krupin, Schocket, Optimed, ExPRESS, device$, shunt$, drainage, White pump shunt, Joseph valve or Joseph device.\n\n【44】**Manual searches**  \nReference lists of identified trial reports will be searched to find additional trials. We will use the Science Citation Index to find studies that have cited the identified trials. We will contact the primary investigators of identified trials for details of additional trials. We will contact manufacturers of the aqueous shunts to identify additional trials. Manual searches of conference proceeding abstracts will not be conducted specifically for this review.\n\n【45】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【46】**Assessment of search results**  \nTwo reviewers will independently assess the titles and abstracts of all reports identified by the electronic and manual searches as per the 'Criteria for considering studies for this review.' The abstracts will be classified as (a) definitely include, (b) unsure and (c) definitely exclude. Full copies of those classified as (a) definitely include and (b) unsure will be obtained and re‐assessed as per the 'Criteria for considering studies for this review.' These studies will be classified as (1) included, (2) awaiting assessment and (3) excluded. The concordance between reviewers will be documented. The third reviewer will resolve disagreements between the two reviewers. The authors of studies classified as (2) awaiting assessment will be contacted for further clarification and the studies will be re‐assessed as per the inclusion criteria as further information becomes available. Studies identified by both reviewers as (3) excluded will be excluded and documented in the review. Studies identified as (1) included will be included and assessed for methodological quality.\n\n【47】The reviewers will be unmasked to the report authors, institutions and trial results during this assessment.\n\n【48】**Assessment of methodological quality**  \nTwo reviewers will assess the sources of systematic bias in trials according to methods set out in section 6 of the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook ( Alderson 2004 ). The following parameters will be considered: concealment of allocation (selection bias), rates of follow up and intention to treat analysis (attrition bias). Each of the parameters will be graded as (A) Adequate or Yes, (B) Unclear or Not Reported, and (C) Inadequate or No. Agreement between reviewers will be documented. A third reviewer will resolve any disagreement. For trials categorized as '(B) Unclear or Not Reported', the authors will be contacted for additional information. If the authors do not respond, the reviewers will assign a grade to the trial based on the available information. Masking of investigators during clinical trials comparing aqueous shunts to other methods of glaucoma surgery would not be possible, as the presence of an anterior chamber or vitreous tube or standard filtering bleb would be obvious to any observer. Hence masking of care providers, participants and outcome assessors will not be used as quality criteria in this review.\n\n【49】**Assessment of study characteristics**  \nIn addition to the parameters described above, data will be extracted on the study characteristics, such as details of participants, the interventions, the outcomes, cost and quality of life data, and other relevant information.  \n  \n**Data collection**  \nTwo reviewers will independently extract the data for the primary and secondary outcomes onto paper data collection forms developed by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group. Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion. Primary investigators will be contacted for missing data. One of these reviewers will enter all data into RevMan 4.2.6. A third reviewer will independently re‐enter the data, using the double data‐entry facility in order to check for inaccuracies.  \n  \n**Data synthesis**  \nData analysis will follow the guidelines in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook Section 8 ( Alderson 2004 ). For dichotomous outcomes we will calculate a summary odds ratio or relative risk. Weighted mean difference will be calculated for continuous outcomes. We will test for statistical heterogeneity and if no statistical heterogeneity is detected and if there is no clinical heterogeneity within the trials, we will combine the results in a meta‐analysis using a random effects model. A fixed effects model will be used if the number of trials is three or less. In case of statistical or clinical heterogeneity we will not combine study results but present a tabulated summary.\n\n【50】Subgroup analyses according to the type of glaucoma (primary angle‐closure; primary open‐angle; secondary including neovascular), and the number of previous surgeries will be performed if sufficient numbers specifying these parameters are available.  \n  \n**Sensitivity analysis**  \nSensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the impact of exclusion of studies with lower methodological quality, exclusion of unpublished studies and exclusion of industry‐funded studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine whether any clinical interventions (used either alone or in combination) are effective and safe when treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a lifelong inherited disease and the most common haemoglobinopathy. It is caused by a genetic defect and results in an abnormal structure of the haemoglobin molecule. This disorder affects millions of people world‐wide and is common among people with sub‐Saharan African, Indian, Middle Eastern or Mediterranean ancestry ( Creary 2007 ; Kulozik 1986 ; Modell 2008 ). Sickle cell disease is a major public health problem ( Modell 2008 ) with an estimated 70% of sufferers living in Africa ( Makani 2007 ). Screening programmes for detecting SCD are ongoing worldwide (e.g. Bardakdjian‐Michau 2009 ; Daudt 2007 ; Henthorn 2004 ; Mañú 2009 ; Gulbis 2006 ; Tshilolo 2008 ). The term SCD includes sickle cell anaemia (Hb SS), haemoglobin S combined with haemoglobin C (Hb SC), haemoglobin S associated with ß Thalassemia (Sß0 Thal and Sß+ Thal) and other less prevalent double heterozygous conditions which cause clinical disease ( Steinberg 2009 ; Weatherall 2006 ). Haemoglobin S combined with normal haemoglobin (A) is known as the sickle cell trait (AS), which is generally asymptomatic and is not part of this review.\n\n【7】One chronic complication of SCD is the sickle cell leg ulcer (SCLU) ( Figure 1 ) ( Ballas 2002 ; Knox‐Macaulay 1983 ; Ramalho 1985 ). The frequency of skin ulceration makes it an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with SCD, and resistance to therapy makes chronicity an important feature of the condition. Although there is no universally accepted leg ulcer duration that defines the condition as chronic, a research definition from Jamaica has defined a chronic leg ulcer as \"an active ulcer recorded at least twice over a minimum period of three months\" ( Alexander 2004 ; Serjeant 2005 ). A SCLU is considered to be a disabling complication (psychological and social) and has been considered a marker of disease severity by some authors ( Alleyne 1977 ; Cumming 2008 ; Eckman 1996 ; Halabi ‐Tawil 2008 ). The rationale behind this severity statement is based on an increasing risk of priapism and pulmonary hypertension in those individuals with SCLU ( Halabi ‐Tawil 2008 ; Serarslan 2009 ). People with homozygous SCD and a leg ulcer have a higher prevalence of pulmonary hypertension compared to people with homozygous SCD without a leg ulcer ( Serarslan 2009 ). These vasculopathies have a common denominator: a chronic intravascular hyper‐haemolysis which generate a lower level of nitric oxide ( Taylor 2008 ). Others have used multivariate statistical modelling to explore possible clinical phenotypes in people with homozygous SCD and have suggested a 'leg ulcer phenotype' ( Alexander 2004 ). Individuals with HbSS are more likely to experience a leg ulcer than those with other genotypes ( Ankra‐Badu 1992 ; Koshy 1989 ). Geographically, the reported prevalence of this complication is variable. In Nigeria, the prevalence of SCLU ranges between 7.5% for people with HbSS and 1.5% for people with HbSC ( Akinyanju 1979 ; Durosinmi 1991 ). According to the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease in the USA, leg ulcers affected 2.5% of people with SCD, with a higher rate of between 4% and 5% among those with HbSS ( Koshy 1989 ). In Jamaica, a 70% to 80% prevalence was reported ( Serjeant 2005 ), and more recently a leg ulcer prevalence rate of 29.5% has been published ( Cumming 2008 ). These prevalence rate variations are partly due to differing patient age distributions. It is generally agreed that leg ulcers are most commonly reported in individuals with SCD in adolescence and early adulthood ( Serjeant 2005 ).\n\n【8】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【9】Figure 1\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】* * *\n\n【12】It is noted that SCLUs occur in areas with less subcutaneous fat, with thin skin, and with decreased blood flow ( Trent 2004 ). The commonest sites are the medial and lateral malleoli (ankles), often becoming circumferential if not controlled early; the medial malleolus is more commonly involved than the lateral malleolus ( Serjeant 2005 ; Trent 2004 ) ( Figure 1 ). Less common sites are the anterior tibial area, dorsum of the foot, and achilles tendon area ( Trent 2004 ).\n\n【13】The pathogenesis of SCLU is complex ( Aslan 2007 ; Hagar 2008 ; Kato 2007 ; Kato 2009 ; Mack 2006 ; Morris 2008 ; Paladino 2007 ; Serjeant 2005 ; Trent 2004 ; Wood 2008 ). One or more of the following mechanisms could play a role in the development of leg ulcers in people with SCD:\n\n【14】1.  decreased nitric oxide: the haemolysis (breakdown) of the sickle red blood cells releases haemoglobin into the blood stream which consumes nitric oxide (a powerful vasodilator agent) to the blood, perhaps leading to impaired endothelial function ( Mack 2006 );\n    \n2.  infectious process: the role of bacterial infection or colonization, or both, is illustrated by the growth of organisms such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ , _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and group A streptococci from ulcer swabs, signs of local inflammation and regional lymphadenopathy ( MacFarlane 1986 ; Mohan 2000 ; Sehgal 1992 );\n    \n3.  venous incompetence: low oxygen tension in the venous system, turbulence inevitable around venous valves and high white blood cell and platelet counts promote endothelial adhesion and chronic ischemia ( Chalchal 2001 ; Clare 2002 ; Cumming 2008 ; Mohan 2000 ; Serjeant 2005 ); there is controversy regarding this risk factor ( Billett 1991 );\n    \n4.  blood hypercoagulability: an acquired antithrombin III deficiency that has been described in individuals with SCLU, along with evidence of fibrinolysis (D‐dimer fragment, and fibrinogen or fibrin degradation products) ( Cacciola 1990 );\n    \n5.  defective immunity: the complement system contributes to the immune system's defence against infection, and a lack of ability to fix complement had been proposed as a risk factor for developing this chronic complication ( Morgan 1981 );\n    \n6.  genetic risk factors: there is a relationship between genes of the TGF‐beta/BMP superfamily and endothelial function and nitric oxide biology which may explain the genesis of SCLU ( Nolan 2006 ; Ofosu 1987 ; Steinberg 2009 ).\n    \n7.  postural vasoconstriction: by using laser Doppler flowmeter, it had been demonstrated that individuals with SCLU have a low red cell flux at the ulcer or scar site ( Mohan 1997 ).\n    \n\n【15】In brief, the chronic ischemia may be explained by a blood hypercoagulability, venous incompetence, or postural vasoconstriction, with these mechanisms conditioned by a low nitric oxide that may itself be genetically influenced. Together with a defective immunity, these mechanisms generate the increased susceptibility to leg ulcers in people with SCD.\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】There is a wide range of possible treatments for leg ulcers in people with SCD, and many of these treatments have been considered as interventions among people with leg or foot ulcers resulting from other pathologies, e.g. a silver‐based wound dressing and topical agents for treating diabetic foot ulcers ( Bergin 2006 ; O'Meara 2008 ), the debridement of diabetic foot ulcers ( Edwards 2002 ), oral zinc for arterial and venous leg ulcers ( Wilkinson 1998 ) and compression for venous leg ulcers ( O'Meara 2009 ). Conventional care would generally include occlusive dressing ( Palfreyman 2006 ; Vermeulen 2004 ; Wasiak 2008 ) and debridement and cleansing ( Dryburgh 2008 ; Moore 2005 ; Nelson 2000 ). Ulcers in people with SCD might benefit from those treatment regimens more than ulcers resulting from other conditions; for example, using a compression bandage since venous incompetence has been mentioned as a risk factor for developing SCLU; debridement, cleansing and topical agents (silver, antibiotic and antiseptic agents) may to speed up ulcer healing, such as in foot ulceration in individuals with diabetes mellitus, may be effective in people with SCD due to the infectious process and defective immunity. Skin grafting plus compression bandaging increases the chance of healing a venous ulcer ( Jones 2007 ). On the other hand, laser therapy has been used for treating leg ulcers in other conditions, but the evidence is poor to support its use in clinical practice ( Flemming 1999 ).\n\n【18】Many possible treatments exist as adjuncts to conventional treatment and we have classified these into four treatment groups:\n\n【19】1\\. Systemic pharmaceutical interventions:\n\n【20】*   Vascular drugs (such as _pentoxifylline_ (blood viscosity‐reducing agent) ( Frost 1990 ), _isoxsuprine hydrochloride_ (β‐adrenergic receptor stimulant) ( Serjeant 1977 ), _xanthinol nicotinate_ (vasodilator) ( Afifi 1979 ));\n    \n*   Antioxidant agents (such as _L‐carnitine_ ) ( Harrel 1990 ; Serjeant 1997 );\n    \n*   Recombinant agents and related (such as _recombinant human erythropoietin_ (erythropoiesis‐stimulating agent which increases the haemoglobin levels) ( al‐Momen 1991 ), _antithrombin III concentrate_ (potent coagulation inhibitor) ( Cacciola 1989 ));\n    \n*   Growth factors: such as _Bosentan_ (a receptor endothelin receptor blocker) ( Lionnet 2008 ).\n    \n*   Minerals (oral zinc sulphate) ( Serjeant 1970 ).\n    \n*   Pharmacologic stimulation of HbF synthesis agents (such as arginine butyrate) ( Sher 1994 );\n    \n\n【21】2\\. Topical pharmaceutical interventions:\n\n【22】*   Antibiotics and antiseptics (such as topical antibiotic ( Baum 1987 ), collagen dressing ( Reindorf 1989 ), natural honey ( Okany 2004 ));\n    \n*   Growth factors and related (such as topical granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF) ( Alikhan 2004 ; Mery 2004 ; Pieters 1995 ), RGD peptide matrix, _solcoseryl_ (a tissue stimulating agent) ( La Grenade 2003 ));\n    \n*   Steroids (such as cortisone ‐ a potent anti‐inflammatory) ( Rice 1953 );\n    \n*   Miscellaneous (such as topical opioids ( Ballas 2002 ).\n    \n\n【23】3\\. Non‐pharmaceutical surgical interventions:\n\n【24】*   Reconstructive surgery (free flap transfer) ( Spence 1985 );\n    \n*   Cell therapy (e.g. human skin equivalent ( Gordon 2003 ); allogeneic keratinocytes ( Amini‐Adle 2007 ));\n    \n\n【25】4\\. Non‐pharmaceutical and non‐surgical:\n\n【26】*   Laser therapy (e.g. InGaP (670nm) laser) ( Lucena 2007 );\n    \n*   Miscellaneous (e.g. hyperbaric oxygen) ( Espinosa 1992 ).\n    \n\n【27】These interventions might occur alone or in combination. Recently, for example, a combination of approaches (antibacterial agent, zinc oxide, bandages and debridement) has been proposed for improving the care of people with SCLU ( Schleucher 2007 ).\n\n【28】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【29】Even with rigorous conventional care, leg ulcers tend to be indolent and intractable, healing slowly over months or years ( Ballas 2002 ). In the USA, the average duration of SCLU has been reported to exceed three years ( Wethers 1994 ) with recurrence rates ranging from 25% to 52% ( Koshy 1989 ). The decreased quality of life, increased disability, absence from or inabilities to work and high utilization of health care resources can severely affect the lives of people with SCLU ( Cumming 2008 ; Halabi ‐Tawil 2008 ).\n\n【30】Objectives\n----------\n\n【31】To determine whether any clinical interventions (used either alone or in combination) are effective and safe when treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.\n\n【32】Methods\n-------\n\n【33】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【34】#### Types of studies\n\n【35】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n【36】#### Types of participants\n\n【37】People with all types of SCD who have been diagnosed with leg ulcers.

No limits will be applied with respect to period of follow‐up.\n\n【54】#### Electronic searches\n\n【55】We will identify relevant trials from the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also plan to contact the Cochrane Wounds Group to request a search of their Specialised Register.\n\n【56】The CFGD Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) (updated each new issue of _The Cochrane Library_ ) and quarterly searches of MEDLINE. Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of five major conferences: the European Haematology Association conference; the American Society of Hematology conference; the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting; the Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings; and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting.

We will use the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency websites to identify the drug companies.\n\n【67】By email, we will also contact those groups or individuals who may have done randomised trials in SCLU (Dr G. Searjent, Dr E. Vichinsky, Professor C. Johnson, Dame Professor S. Davies, Dr O. Castro, Dr R.F. Machado, Dr A. Almeida, Professor M. Steinberg).\n\n【68】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【69】Our anticipated data collection and analysis procedures are described below, and follow documented Cochrane Collaboration methodologies ( Higgins 2008 ).\n\n【70】#### Selection of studies\n\n【71】Three review authors will independently assess each identified RCT to evaluate if it meets the review inclusion criteria. We plan to resolve any disagreements that may arise through discussion and we will consult a fourth review author if necessary.\n\n【72】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【73】Two authors will independently extract data from the selected trials using a standardised data extraction form from a web‐based computer program which contains a data extraction form designed to facilitate an easy transfer of information to RevMan using a copy‐paste function ( Zavala 2006 ).\n\n【74】Overall, we plan to extract the following groups of data:\n\n【75】*   demographics (age, sex, country);\n    \n*   characteristic of the ulcer (anatomic site, size, number of ulcers, presence of infection, how long the patient has had the ulcer);\n    \n*   Sickle cell genotype (SS, SC).\n    \n*   Phenotypic expression (E.g. total haemoglobin, fetal haemoglobin)\n    \n\n【76】Again, we aim to resolve disagreements by consensus. Arturo Martí‐Carvajal will enter the data into RevMan 5; Jennifer Knight‐Madden and María J. Martínez‐Zapata will check the data.\n\n【77】We plan to report our endpoints at three months and six months: work from the Jamaican sickle cell cohort suggest that most leg ulcers take between three and six months to heal ( Serjeant 2005 ).\n\n【78】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【79】We will follow the domain‐based evaluation for risk of bias in included RCTs. Two authors will assess risk of bias, with disagreements resolved through discussion.\n\n【80】We will assess the following domains as 'Yes' (i.e. low risk of bias), 'Unclear' (uncertain risk of bias) or 'No' (i.e. high risk of bias):\n\n【81】1.  Sequence generation / randomisation;\n    \n2.  Concealment of allocation;\n    \n3.  Blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors);\n    \n4.  Incomplete outcome data;\n    \n5.  Selective outcome reporting;\n    \n6.  Other sources of bias (such as baseline imbalance, early stopping) ( Gurusamy 2009 ; Ioannidis 2008a ; Ioannidis 2008b ).\n    \n\n【82】We will use the following definitions.\n\n【83】##### Generation of the allocation sequence\n\n【84】*   Yes (low risk of bias), if the allocation sequence was generated by a computer or random number table. We will consider the drawing of lots, tossing of a coin, shuffling of cards, or throwing dice as adequate if a person who was not otherwise involved in the recruitment of participants performed the procedure.\n    \n*   Unclear (uncertain risk of bias), if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used for the allocation sequence generation was not described.\n    \n*   No (high risk of bias), if a system involving dates, names, or admittance numbers was used for the allocation of participants. These studies are known as quasi‐randomised and will be excluded from the present review when assessing beneficial effects.\n    \n\n【85】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【86】*   Yes (low risk of bias), if the allocation of participants involved a central independent unit, on‐site locked computer, identically appearing numbered drug bottles or containers prepared by an independent pharmacist or investigator, or sealed envelopes.\n    \n*   Unclear (uncertain risk of bias), if the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described.\n    \n*   No (high risk of bias), if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi‐randomised. The latter will be excluded from the present review when assessing beneficial effects.\n    \n\n【87】##### Blinding (or masking)\n\n【88】We will assess each trial (as 'Yes', 'Unclear' or 'No') with regard to the following levels of blinding:\n\n【89】*   blinding of clinician (person delivering treatment) to treatment allocation;\n    \n*   blinding of participant to treatment allocation;\n    \n*   blinding of outcome assessor to treatment allocation.\n    \n\n【90】##### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【91】*   Yes (low risk of bias), if the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or if it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals.\n    \n*   Unclear (uncertain risk of bias), if the report gave the impression that there had been no dropouts or withdrawals, but this was not specifically stated.\n    \n*   No (high risk of bias), if the number or reasons for dropouts and withdrawals were not described.\n    \n\n【92】We will further examine the percentages of dropouts overall in each trial and per randomisation arm and we will evaluate whether intention‐to‐treat analysis has been performed or could be performed from the published information.\n\n【93】##### Selective outcome reporting\n\n【94】*   Yes (low risk of bias), if pre‐defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on.\n    \n*   Unclear (uncertain risk of bias), if not all pre‐defined, or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes are reported on or are not reported fully, or it is unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.\n    \n*   No (high risk of bias), if one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.\n    \n\n【95】##### Other sources of bias\n\n【96】*   Yes (low risk of bias), if the trial appears to be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias such as baseline imbalance, early stopping, academic, drug company involvement.\n    \n*   Unclear (uncertain risk of bias), if the trial may or may not be free of other components that could put it at risk of bias.\n    \n*   No (high risk of bias), if there are other factors in the trial that could put it at risk of bias, e.g., no sample size calculation made, early stopping, or an extreme baseline imbalance.\n    \n\n【97】To summarize, trials that achieve a 'yes' for generation of allocation sequence, adequate allocation concealment, adequate blinding, adequate handling of incomplete outcome data, no selective outcome reporting, and without other bias risks will be considered as trials with a low risk of bias. Trials at moderate risk of bias will be in between and trials at high risk of bias are either 'No' or 'Unclear' on the majority of domains.\n\n【98】Results from these six domains will be summarized in a Risk of Bias table for each trial. For each included RCT, the authors will review the evidence of bias in all domains, before reaching a judgement on the likely overall bias. These judgements will take into account the evidence of bias, the likely bias direction, and the likely bias magnitude, and will be be stated explicitly.\n\n【99】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【100】For binary outcome measures (incidence of complete closure, incidence of amputation, adverse events, and adverse drug reaction), we plan to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome.\n\n【101】For continuous outcomes (quality of life), we will use the standardized mean difference with 95% CIs, since different scales may be used to measure quality of life. Change in ulcer size (surface area or volume) will be measured using a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference with 95% CIs. If statistical information is missing (such as standard deviations), we will try to extract them from other relevant information in the paper, such as P values and CIs.\n\n【102】For time‐to‐event outcome (time to ulcer closure and ulcer‐free survival following treatment for SCLU), we plan to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs for each outcome. We will use the methods described by Tierney ( Tierney 2007 ) and a computer program ( Zavala 2007 ) to transform data for analysis for time‐to‐event outcomes.\n\n【103】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【104】An individual may have more than one ulcer on either one or both legs. In these cases a trial may intervene for a single ulcer, or all ulcers may receive the same intervention, or uncommonly ulcers may receive different interventions. For non‐systemic interventions, these three designs necessitate different analysis approaches. If a participant has more than one ulcer treated with the same intervention, we will multiply the standard error of the effect estimate by the square root of the design effect (Section 16.3.6, The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2008 )). If a participant has more than one ulcer treated with different interventions, a paired analysis is appropriate.\n\n【105】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【106】For each included trial we will assess the percentage of dropouts by randomisation arm. We will confirm whether an intention‐to‐treat analysis has been performed. We will perform an intention‐to‐treat analysis in this review, obtaining additional information from authors if necessary. We will also contact the authors for information about participants who remain in the trial but have partially missing data e.g. at some of the reported time‐points.\n\n【107】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【108】For each included trial we will quantify statistical heterogeneity using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across trials that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error ( Higgins 2003 ). If I <sup>2 </sup> is in excess of 30% there may be moderate or substantial heterogeneity ( Higgins 2008 ).\n\n【109】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【110】If we are able to include at least 10 RCTs in a single meta‐analysis, we will assess whether the review is subject to possible publication bias by using a funnel plot to graphically illustrate variability between trials. If asymmetry is detected, we will explore causes other than publication bias.\n\n【111】#### Data synthesis\n\n【112】If the eligible trials are sufficiently homogenous, we will summarize their findings using a fixed‐effect model. However, if we find statistical heterogeneity using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic we will use a random‐effects model. Clinical variability (variability in types of participants, interventions, or outcomes) may prevent us from pooling trials.\n\n【113】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【114】If we find clinical heterogeneity, we will conduct sub‐group analyses as follows:\n\n【115】1.  SS type versus SC type;\n    \n2.  type of intervention;\n    \n3.  severity and depth of wound and ulcer size;\n    \n4.  follow‐up duration.\n    \n\n【116】These subgroup analyses will be only conducted for primary outcomes .\n\n【117】Since there is no recognised classification system for leg ulcer severity in people with SCD, we may only be able to perform subgroup analysis on the severity and depth of wound if we are able to obtain individual patient data.\n\n【118】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【119】If sufficient trials are identified, we plan to conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing the results using all trials as follow:\n\n【120】1.  RCTs classified as having a 'low risk of bias' versus those identified as having a 'high risk of bias' ( Higgins 2008 ).\n    \n2.  RCTs that performed intention‐to treat versus per‐protocol analyses.\n    \n\n【121】We will also evaluate the risk of attrition bias, as estimated by the percentage of participants lost. Trials with a total attrition of more than 30% or where differences between the groups exceed 10%, or both, will be excluded from meta‐analysis but will be included in the review ( Higgins 2008 ).\n\n【122】Figures and Tables -\n\n【123】Figure 1\n\n【124】Navigate to figure in Protocol Print figure Open in new tab", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess, in women with fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding, the effectiveness and safety of progestogen‐only contraceptives (oral, subdermal, injectable and implanted) compared to combined oral contraceptive pills.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Uterine fibroids (or leiomyoma) are a common gynaecologic problem. Uterine fibroids are benign growths of smooth muscle and connective tissue of the uterus ( Lethaby 2005 ; Vollenhoven 1998 ). They develop from tiny groups of uterine muscle cells and are composed of numerous copies of the same or very few cells, which is termed monoclonal expansion ( Cramer 1990 ; Marshall 1997 ; Vollenhoven 1998 ). There are four subtypes of uterine fibroids, depending on their location within the uterus. These include submucous (beneath the endometrial lining or immediately adjacent to the uterine cavity); intramural (entirely within the wall of the uterus); subserous (beneath the outer uterine covering or serosa) and pedunculated (attached to the uterus by a stalk) ( Marshall 1997 ). Of all the four types, the submucous category is most commonly associated with heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\n【6】The prevalence of uterine fibroids varies from place to place ( Vollenhoven 1998 ). Prevalence studies report that 5.4% to 77% of women have uterine fibroids, depending on the population under consideration and the diagnostic method used ( Lethaby 2005 ; Lurie 2005 ). Women at increased risk of uterine fibroids include women who attained menarche (first menstruation) at a young age ( Lumbiganon 1996 ); women who have neither given birth to a child nor miscarried before (nulliparous women) ( Chen 2001 ; Faerstein 2001 ; Sato 2000 ); women who gave birth after one or more previous myomectomies (surgical removal of uterine fibroids) ( Fedele 1995 ); long interval since last birth or miscarriage ( Chen 2001 ); black race, especially African and African‐American women ( Faerstein 2001 ; Kjerulff 1996 ) and high body mass index ( Parazzini 1988 ; Parazzini 1996 ). Uterine fibroids increase with age until menopause, after which new fibroids are rare ( Baird 2003 ; Marshall 1997 ).\n\n【7】While uterine fibroids may be asymptomatic ( Parker 2007 ), they may be associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation), pelvic pressure and obstructive symptoms such as urinary frequency and constipation. Approximately one‐third to one‐half of asymptomatic women become symptomatic at some point during their reproductive lives, experiencing irregular uterine bleeding, anaemia, pelvic pain or recurrent pregnancy loss (three or more miscarriages). These symptoms, if not properly and promptly managed, can lead to increased morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. The complications of uterine fibroids can have serious impact on the lives of affected women. Hence, uterine fibroids constitute a major gynaecological and public health problem.\n\n【8】Management of uterine fibroids starts from a good history and physical examination. A large fibroid uterus can often be palpated as a firm pelvic mass. The ideal first‐line investigation for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids includes pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal and transabdominal). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful when planning surgery or as a baseline prior to uterine artery embolization (UAE).\n\n【9】Management of uterine fibroids has been associated with substantial economic burden and healthcare cost. Hartmann et al estimated a healthcare cost in the United States exceeding USD 4600 during the year following a woman’s diagnosis of fibroids ( Hartmann 2006 ). In fact, national medical costs associated with fibroids exceed 2 billion dollars annually ( Flynn 2006 ). These estimates of costs were from a societal perspective.\n\n【10】### Description of the condition\n\n【11】The etiology of uterine fibroids is not very well understood. However, there is some evidence that estrogens and progestogens contribute to the development of uterine fibroids ( Cowan 2004 ). Progestogens in particular are capable of increasing the mitotic rate of tumours in vitro and thus may have an effect on growth factors or their receptors during the luteal phase ( Cowan 2004 ). Other evidence that points towards the role of hormones includes the discovery of estrogen and progestin receptors on fibroids as well as the observation that fibroids usually shrink after menopause but regrowth may occur with hormonal therapy ( Cowan 2004 ).\n\n【12】Approximately half of all women with uterine fibroids will suffer from clinical symptoms ( Sakuhara 2006 ). The most common clinical presentation is menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding). Menorrhagia is subjectively defined as a complaint of heavy cyclical menstrual bleeding occurring over several consecutive cycles ( RCOG 1998 ). Objectively, it is a total menstrual blood loss equal to or greater than 80 ml per menstruation ( Hallberg 1966a ). This degree of blood loss can cause disturbances of a woman’s occupational, social or sexual life. The presence of such bleeding can also raise concerns about possible underlying endometrial or cervical disease (especially endometrial or cervical cancer) ( Hallberg 1966b ).\n\n【13】Other presenting symptoms of fibroids include pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, abdominal distension, infertility, lower extremity swelling, constipation and intestinal obstruction ( Okogbo 2011 ). In addition, the presence of uterine fibroids can lead to complications during pregnancy. These include spontaneous miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor, obstructed labor, postpartum haemorrhage and hydronephrosis (abnormal dilatation of the kidney and ureters) ( Okogbo 2011 ).\n\n【14】Submucous fibroids are described clinically as having the greatest influence on heavy menstrual bleeding and reproductive outcomes. However, subserous fibroids have the greatest pressure effects on surrounding organs. The position of subserous fibroids with respect to position and size relative to other surrounding structures such as the bladder, bowel, vaginal vault and nerve bundles in the pelvis is most often used to explain pressure symptoms (for example increased urinary frequency, constipation or pain with bowel movements, pressure or pain with intercourse, and more generalized pain symptoms).\n\n【15】Uterine fibroids can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically.  Medical treatment has been increasingly preferred among women and has been used as a cost effective pharmacological treatment to prevent or decrease the amount of heavy uterine bleeding from uterine fibroids. Levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine devices were shown to have led to greater reductions in menstrual blood loss and higher rates of complete menorrhagia treatment compared to medroxyprogesterone acetate ( Kaunitz 2010 ). Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogens are commonly used to regulate heavy uterine bleeding resulting from uterine fibroids ( Carr 1993 ; Friedman 1988 ). These medications can be useful in women with co‐existing dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation) or oligo‐ovulation (defined as infrequent or irregular ovulation, usually with cycles of ≥ 36 days or < 8 cycles a year). There is also evidence that these contraceptives may be associated with a decreased risk of uterine fibroids in some women ( Grigorieva 2003 ; Marshall 1998 ).\n\n【16】Surgical and minimally invasive treatments for uterine fibroids include myomectomy (which can be done via hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, abdominal and robotic methods), hysterectomy (laparoscopic; laparoscopic assisted vaginal, abdominal and robotic), endometrial resection or ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance‐guided focused ultrasound ablation, laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion with or without utero‐ovarian occlusion and bipolar radiofrequency ablation (intrauterine ultrasound‐guided or laparoscopic‐guided). Treatment needs to be highly individualised for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.\n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】Both oral contraceptives and progestins have been used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. The combined oral contraceptive pill contains both estrogens and progestogens, whereas the progestogen‐only pill lacks estrogen. The combined oral contraceptive pills are classified according to the type of progestogen they contain and the phase of the menstrual cycle in which they act. Based on the type of progestogen which they contain, they are classified as second generation (norethisterone and levonorgestrel) and third generation (desogestrel, gestodene and norgestimate) oral contraceptive pills. The first generation oral contraceptive pills are no longer in use because they contained high estrogen levels, which caused numerous adverse effects notably thromboembolic disorders. Combined oral contraceptive pills also come with varying doses of estrogen.\n\n【19】It is important to define dosage regimens of oral contraceptive pills. In the United Kingdom, combined oral contraceptive pills are defined as low strength preparations (containing ethinyl estradiol, 20 µg) and standard strength preparations (containing ethinyl estradiol 30 or 35 µg or in 30 to 40 µg phased preparations). In most other parts of the world, 50 µg of estradiol is considered high dose, 30 to 35 µg average dose, and 20 µg or less is considered low dose. Estrogen doses in the oral contraceptive pill should not exceed 50 µg as higher doses increase the risk of complications.\n\n【20】There are some risks associated with combined oral contraceptives that may limit their prescription in certain groups (for example in smokers, obese women, women with a family history of thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease, liver disease or genital bleeding). Some of the absolute contraindications to the use of the combined oral contraceptives include past and present history of cardiovascular disease like family history of being less than 45 years with abnormal lipid profile or haemostatic profile, poorly controlled diabetes or diabetic complications like diabetic retinopathy, blood pressure consistently greater than 160/95 mm Hg, smokers of more than 40 cigarettes per day, smokers over 35 years, women with body mass index (BMI) greater than 35, and focal or crescendo migraine or migraine requiring ergotamine treatment. Other absolute contraindications to the use of the combined oral contraceptive pill include active liver disease like recurrent cholestatic jaundice or cholestatic jaundice occurring in pregnancy, Dubin‐Johnson or Rotor's syndrome, liver adenoma or carcinoma, gallstones; pregnancy; undiagnosed genital tract bleeding; estrogen dependent tumours like breast cancer; and medical conditions affected by sex steroids like pemphigoid gestationis. Relative contraindications include hyperprolactinaemia, long‐term immobilization, severe depression, family history greater than 45 years with normal lipid and haemostatic profiles, well controlled diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure of 135 to 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 85 to 95 mm Hg, 5 to 40 cigarettes/day, BMI of 30 to 35 and uncomplicated migraine.\n\n【21】There are four major types of progestogen‐only contraceptives. These include the progestogen only pill (POP); injectables; implants and intrauterine systems. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) is a second generation synthetic progestin based contraceptive that is highly efficacious and reversible ( Shawki 2009 ). LNG‐IUS (also called Mirena) is a T‐shaped device composed of a polyethylene frame 32 mm long with a cylinder around the vertical arm which contains the hormone levonorgestrel (LNG). Of the 52 mg of the total hormone in the cylinder, approximately 20 µg is released per day. It can be inserted into the uterus at any time during the menstrual cycle as long as there is no unprotected sexual intercourse ( Endrikat 2009 ; Hurskainen 2004 ). Its main actions are on the uterus.\n\n【22】The adverse effects of the progestogen‐only contraceptives include irregular vaginal bleeding and changes in the menstrual bleeding pattern; delayed return of fertility after discontinuing depo‐medroxyprogesterone acetate; weight gain and osteoporosis (bone loss) as a result of hypoestrogenism with long‐term treatment.\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】Using immunohistochemistry, aromatase expression has been detected in the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding ( Maia 2008 ). Combined oral contraceptives have been shown to work by reducing both aromatase expression in the endometrium and heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids ( Maia 2007 ). This suggests that oral contraceptives are effective in reducing the heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Also, estrogens in oral contraceptive pills are known to increase angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) and cyclo‐oxygenase (COX)‐2 expression in the endometrium ( Ebert 2005 ; Ishira 2003 ; Kelly 2002 ).\n\n【25】Progestogens exerts an anti‐inflammatory effect on the endometrium of patients with uterine fibroids by suppressing nuclear factor (NF)‐kappa B induced genes, which in turn leads to reduction of heavy menstrual flow ( Critchley 2003 ; Kelly 2002 ). The progestin intrauterine device (IUD) has been shown to be effective in decreasing heavy menstrual periods because of the constant release of levonorgestrel into the uterus, which suppresses the endometrium subsequently reducing uterine bleeding ( Endrikat 2009 ). LNG‐IUS suppresses endometrial proliferation and endovascular changes to prevent heavy menstrual bleeding. Its main effect is due to an overall reduction in uterine blood flow and endometrial thickness. This endometrial transformation causes atrophy and reduction in the number of steroid receptors, which in turn alters local progestogen regulated mediators ( Endrikat 2009 ). This effect leads to a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss ( Endrikat 2009 ; Rauramo 2004 ; Reid 2005 ) and, consequently, an increase in haemoglobin levels ( Luukkainen 1995 ). In addition, the local administration of LNG‐IUS produces minor systemic hormonal effects. Local progestins also have both androgenic and antiestrogenic endometrial activities resulting from downregulation of estrogenic receptors ( Hurskainen 2004 ). Overall, strong endometrial suppression explains the progestogenic effect on the uterus, particularly in women with fibroid uteri.\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) is the commonest and most debilitating symptom of uterine fibroids. About one‐third of women with uterine fibroids experience fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding at some point in their lives. The combined oral contraceptive pills and progestogen‐only contraceptives have both been shown to reduce fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding. However, while some studies have found that progestogen only contraceptives (for example LNG‐IUS) reduced menstrual blood loss better than oral contraceptive pills, others have found that combined oral contraceptive pills are better at reducing heavy menstrual blood loss. Again, mixed results have been obtained for patient satisfaction or health related quality of life (HRQOL) in studies comparing progestogen only to combined oral contraceptives. Results regarding the impact of combined oral contraceptives and progestogen only contraceptives on fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding and patient satisfaction or health related quality of life are inconsistent at the moment. Also, there is no Cochrane review that has examined the efficacy, safety and adverse effects of these methods in controlling fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding. This prompted the present Cochrane review.\n\n【28】Objectives\n----------\n\n【29】To assess, in women with fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding, the effectiveness and safety of progestogen‐only contraceptives (oral, subdermal, injectable and implanted) compared to combined oral contraceptive pills.\n\n【30】Methods\n-------\n\n【31】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【32】#### Types of studies\n\n【33】The review will analyse randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing progestogen only contraceptives with combined oral contraceptives in women with fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding. Only trials that are either clearly randomised or claim to be randomised and do not have evidence of inadequate sequence generation, such as date of birth or hospital number, will be included. Crossover trials will be included in the review for completeness but data from the first phase only will be included in meta‐analyses as the crossover is not a valid design in the context of this review.\n\n【34】#### Types of participants\n\n【35】Women who presented with fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding or pressure symptoms from uterine fibroids will be included in the review. The women must have had an ultrasound or MRI diagnosis of leiomyoma (uterine fibroids).\n\n【36】#### Types of interventions\n\n【37】Trials comparing progestogen only contraceptives (oral, subdermal, injectable and implanted) versus combined oral contraceptive pills for fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding.\n\n【38】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【39】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【40】1\\. Reduction in menstrual blood loss (to be evaluated using pictorial blood assessment charts (PBAC) and alkaline haematin methods of assessing blood loss).\n\n【41】2\\. Improvement in haemoglobin levels (evaluated using any change in haematocrit or haemoglobin levels before and after treatment of fibroids).\n\n【42】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【43】1\\. Changes in quality of life (measured using Health Related Quality of Life–4 (HRQoL‐4) questionnaires that assess the quality of life of the patients in the previous month). The HRQOL‐4 questionnaire includes the following four questions: health as assessed by the patient, usually as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor; number of days feeling physically unhealthy; number of days feeling mentally unhealthy (including stress, depression and problems with emotions); and lost days.\n\n【44】2\\. Adverse effects of the interventions (including irregular menstrual or breakthrough bleeding, headache, dizziness, breast tenderness and enlargement, weight gain, nausea and vomiting, severe abdominal pains, chest pains, visual disturbances, hypertension, development of migraine, development of cerebrovascular accidents, venous thromboembolism, development of breast and cervical cancer, delayed return of fertility and osteoporosis).\n\n【45】3\\. Improvement in other symptoms associated with uterine fibroids (including improvement in pressure symptoms and development of new fibroids, detected by measuring the fibroids before and after treatment with oral contraceptives or the progestogens).\n\n【46】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【47】We will search for all published and unpublished RCTs of progestogen only versus combined oral contraceptives for fibroid related heavy menstrual bleeding, without language restriction and in consultation with the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Trials Search Co‐ordinator:\n\n【48】#### Electronic searches\n\n【49】The following electronic databases, trial registers and websites will be searched from inception to the present: Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. The MEDLINE search will be combined with the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy for identifying randomised trials, which appears in the searching chapter of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . The EMBASE search will be combined with trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.html#random).\n\n【50】Other electronic sources of trials will include the following.\n\n【51】*   Trial registers for ongoing and registered trials: 'Current Controlled Trials' (www.controlled‐trials.com/), 'ClinicalTrials.gov' a service of the US National Institutes of Health (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) and the 'World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal' (www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx).\n    \n*   Citation indexes (http://scientific.thomson.com/products/sci/).\n    \n*   Conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge (http://isiwebofknowledge.com/).\n    \n*   LILACS database, as a source of trials from the Portuguese and Spanish speaking world (http://bases.bireme.br/cgibin/wxislind.exe/iah/online/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&base=LILACS&lang=i&form=F).\n    \n*   Clinical Study Results for clinical trial results of marketed pharmaceuticals (www.clinicalstudyresults.org/).\n    \n*   PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), the random control filter for PubMed will be taken from the searching chapter of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ .\n    \n*   OpenSIGLE database (http://opensigle.inist.fr/) and Google for grey literature.\n    \n\n【52】#### Searching other resources\n\n【53】We will handsearch reference lists of articles retrieved by the search and make personal contact with experts in the field and with the manufacturers of combined oral contraceptives and progestogens to obtain any additional relevant data. We will also handsearch any relevant journals and conference abstracts that are not covered in the MDSG register, in liaison with the Trials Search Co‐ordinator.\n\n【54】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【55】Data collection and analysis will be conducted in accordance with the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【56】#### Selection of studies\n\n【57】Two review authors will independently scan the titles and abstracts of articles retrieved by the search and obtain the full text of all potentially eligible studies. They will independently examine the full text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and select studies eligible for inclusion in the review. We will correspond with study investigators, if required, to clarify study eligibility (for example with respect to participant eligibility criteria and allocation method). Disagreements as to study eligibility will be resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third author.\n\n【58】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【59】We will extract data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed and pilot‐tested by the authors. Where studies have multiple publications, the main trial report will be used as the reference and additional details supplemented from secondary papers. We will correspond with study investigators in order to resolve any data queries, as required. Two review authors (one a methodologist and one a topic area specialist) will independently extract the data. Any disagreement between these authors will be resolved by a third author.\n\n【60】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【61】The included studies will be assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool to assess: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, providers and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias such as funding. Two authors will assess these six domains, with any disagreements resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third author. All judgments will be fully described. The conclusions will be presented in the risk of bias table and incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses.\n\n【62】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【63】For dichotomous data, the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study will be used to calculate Peto odds ratios. For continuous data, mean differences between treatment groups will be calculated if all studies report exactly the same outcomes. If similar outcomes are reported on different scales, the standardised mean difference will be calculated. Ordinal data (for example quality of life scores) will be treated as continuous data. The 95% confidence intervals will be presented for all outcomes.\n\n【64】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【65】All outcomes will be expressed per woman randomised. In the case of crossover trials, only data from the first phase will be included. In the case of cluster randomised data, a sensitivity analysis will be performed excluding those studies.\n\n【66】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【67】The data will be analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis, as far as possible, and attempts will be made to obtain missing data from the original investigators. Where these are unobtainable, imputation of individual values will be undertaken for the primary outcomes only. If studies report sufficient detail to calculate mean difference but no information on the associated standard deviation (SD), the outcome will be assumed to have a standard deviation equal to the highest SD from other studies within the same analysis. For other outcomes, only the available data will be analysed. Any imputation undertaken will be subjected to sensitivity analysis.\n\n【68】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【69】The authors will consider whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies are sufficiently similar for meta‐analysis to provide a meaningful summary. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by the measure of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. An I <sup>2 </sup> value greater than 50% will be taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity ( Higgins 2011 ). If substantial heterogeneity is detected, possible explanations will be explored in sensitivity analyses.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【71】In view of the difficulty in detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the authors will aim to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data. If there are 10 or more studies in an analysis, a funnel plot will be used to explore the possibility of small study effects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies). Within study reporting, bias will be detected by seeking published protocols and comparing the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study.\n\n【72】#### Data synthesis\n\n【73】The data from primary studies will be combined using fixed‐effect models in the following comparisons.\n\n【74】1\\. Progestogen only versus combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) stratified by dose:  \n(i) low dose (OCPs containing less than 20 µg of ethinyl estradiol);  \n(ii) standard or average dose (OCPs containing 30 to 35 µg of ethinyl estradiol).\n\n【75】2\\. Progestogen only versus combined oral contraceptive pills stratified by type:  \n(i) LNG‐IUS (intrauterine progestogen);  \n(ii) depot‐medroxyprogesterone acetate (intramuscular progestogen);\n\n【76】(iii) progestogen only pills (oral progestogen);\n\n【77】(iv) implants (subdermal).\n\n【78】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【79】Where data are available, subgroup analyses will be conducted to determine the separate evidence within the following subgroups:  \n1\\. age (women below 35 years of age versus women above 35 years of age);  \n2\\. location of the uterine fibroids (submucosal, intramural or subserosal).\n\n【80】If excessive heterogeneity exists within trials, it will be explored informally using the clinical and design details recorded in the ’Characteristics of included studies’ table. Some heterogeneity between trials is anticipated, and possible reasons will be discussed.\n\n【81】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【82】Sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary outcomes to determine whether the conclusions are robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding the eligibility and analysis. These analyses will include consideration of whether conclusions would have differed if:  \n1\\. eligibility was restricted to studies without high risk of bias;  \n2\\. alternative imputation strategies had been adopted;  \n3\\. a random‐effects model had been adopted;  \n4\\. the summary effect measure was relative risk rather than odds ratio.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

A number of studies published in China have suggested that acupuncture is beneficial for children with mumps but the literature reporting the benefits or harms of acupuncture for mumps has not been systematically reviewed.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with mumps.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to April week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to May 2012), CINAHL (1981 to May 2012), AMED (1985 to May 2012), the Chinese BioMedicine Database (CBM) (1979 to May 2012), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to May 2012), Chinese Technology Periodical Database (CTPD) (1989 to May 2012) and WANFANG database (1982 to May 2012). We also handsearched a number of journals (from first issue to current issue).\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture with placebo acupuncture, no management, Chinese medication, Western medication or other treatments for mumps. Acupuncture included either traditional acupuncture or contemporary acupuncture, regardless of the source of stimulation (body, electro, scalp, fire, hand, fine needle, moxibustion).\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effective percentage and standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs for the time to cure.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Only one study with 239 participants met our inclusion criteria. There were a total of 120 participants in the acupuncture group, of which 106 recovered, with their temperature returning back to normal and no swelling or pain of the parotid gland; the condition of 14 participants improved, with a drop in temperature and alleviation of swelling or pain of the parotid gland. There were 119 participants in the Western medicine group, of which 56 recovered and the condition of 63 improved. The acupuncture group had a higher recovery rate than the control group. The relative RR of recovery was 1.88 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.30). However, the acupuncture group had a longer time to cure than the control group. The mean was 4.20 days and the standard deviation (SD) was 0.46 in the acupuncture group, while in the control group the mean was 3.78 days and the SD was 0.46.There was a potential risk of bias in the study because of low methodological quality.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】We could not reach any confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture based on one study.

Benefits attributed to acupuncture include decreased swelling and pain, and shortening of the disease duration. According to traditional Chinese medicine, health is achieved by maintaining an uninterrupted flow of Qi, or energy, along 14 meridians. Mumps is caused by 'wind warmth evil' (epidemic heat) and 'pyretic toxicity' accumulated in Shaoyang and Yangming meridians, thus the flow of Qi, sputum and 'heat evil' stagnate in and around the ears and the cheeks. Acupuncture can help expel 'wind warmth evil', clear pathogenic heat, remove toxic substances, act as an anti‐inflammatory, alleviate pain and re‐establish the normal flow of Qi, thus restoring internal balance.\n\n【34】Although acupuncture has been widely used in China for children with mumps and quite a number of trials claiming to be randomised controlled trials have been published, we identified only one study with 239 participants that met our inclusion criteria. The study results suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial in improving swelling and pain of the parotid gland and returning the body temperature to normal. However, the included study is of low methodological quality and did not report adverse effects and long‐term follow‐up. Therefore, we could not draw any definite conclusions about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children with mumps.\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective of this review is to assess existing evidence for the effectiveness and safety of immunisation in pregnancy (in any trimester) in preventing pertussis infection in infants who are too young to be protected by the routine primary vaccinations compared to no vaccination, sham or placebo vaccination.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pertussis (whooping cough) is a vaccine‐preventable, acute bacterial respiratory infection caused by the organism _Bordetella pertussis_ ( _B. pertussis_ ) and is an infection of global public health importance. It is characterised by a protracted coughing illness and can result in severe complications including death. In many countries, pertussis vaccine is offered as part of a routine childhood immunisation programme (e.g. two, three and four months in the UK; and two, four and six months in the USA. The youngest age of immunisation in any country for pertussis‐containing vaccine is six weeks). However, protection against infection is not life‐long and the disease continues to show cyclical peaks in activity every three to four years despite high vaccine coverage. Whilst adolescents and adults tend to display milder symptoms, young infants less than six months of age remain at a disproportionate risk of severe or complicated infections ( Amirthalingam 2013a ).\n\n【7】Many countries with long‐standing vaccination programmes have reported a resurgence of pertussis, particularly in adolescents and adults ( Quinn 2007 ; Skowronski 2002 ; Tan 2005 ) and young infants less than six months of age ( Somerville 2007 ; Spokes 2010 ; Tanaka 2003 ), despite sustained high vaccine coverage. This has led to a growing international debate on the potential strategies to optimise global pertussis control. A 2010 review by the Strategic Group of Experts in Immunisation on pertussis control strategies recommended a booster dose for children aged one to six years, preferably during the second year of life, following completion of the primary infant schedule ( WHO 2010 ). Although a number of countries, including France, the USA and Australia, have recommended adolescent boosters and cocooning (vaccinating close household contacts of young infants), data to support the introduction of neonatal pertussis immunisation remain inconclusive ( WHO 2010 ). In 2011, the USA became the first country to advise that pertussis‐containing vaccine can be safely administered to pregnant women who have not previously received the recommended adult dose ( ACIP 2010 ). This advice was updated in October 2012 to recommend that pertussis‐containing vaccine be routinely offered to women in every pregnancy ( ACIP 2013 ).\n\n【8】In England and Wales, an increase in laboratory‐confirmed cases of pertussis amongst those aged 15 years or older was observed during July to September of 2011, which differed from the usual age distribution of cases. The increase in cases has continued into 2012 and extended to affect very young infants with an unusually high number of infant deaths (14 infant deaths in 2012 compared with average of 4.4 infant deaths in the previous four years (2008 to 2011)). This has prompted a review of current vaccination strategies, with the aim of providing further protection for those infants who are too young to benefit from existing immunisation programmes ( Amirthalingam 2013b ).\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Several vaccination strategies such as an adolescent or adult booster programme, and neonatal and maternal immunisation (post‐partum and antenatal) have been considered, some of which have already been implemented in other countries ( WHO 2010 ). A recent review, conducted by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, concluded that there was insufficient evidence that the introduction of booster doses for adolescents provides indirect protection for young infants ( WHO 2010 ). A cross‐sectional study carried out in the USA showed little impact of post‐partum vaccination on laboratory‐diagnosed cases of pertussis infection in infants of six months of age and under, pre‐ and post‐introduction of a maternal vaccination programme ( Castagnini 2012 ). More targeted strategies including neonatal and antenatal maternal vaccination programmes are being considered for the protection of infants against pertussis.\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】Data from the pre‐vaccine era suggest that maternal antibodies may provide at least short‐term protection for newborn infants, with a lower proportion of deaths observed in children less than one month of age compared with those aged one to three months ( Sako 1945 ). This pattern of mortality is no longer typically observed and likely reflects a reduction in maternal antibody following the introduction of mass vaccination programmes and decreased immunity from natural infection ( Van Rie 2005 ). All subclasses of immunoglobulin (Ig) G are transferred from mother to infant across the placenta, primarily during the third trimester of pregnancy ( Van Rie 2005 ). Vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy, when concerns about fetal loss and development are reduced ( Healy 2006a ), may boost maternal antibody levels to a sufficiently high level to result in indirect infant protection following transplacental transfer. It may also offer indirect protection for newborn infants through reduction of maternal illness. Transplacental transfer of pertussis IgG antibody has already been demonstrated, with concentrations in newborn ( Healy 2004 ; Van Savage 1990 ) or cord serum samples ( Gonik 2005 ; Healy 2004 ; Healy 2006b ) reflective of those in the mother. Indeed, higher concentrations of pertussis antibodies have been demonstrated in cord blood for newborn infants of vaccinated when compared with non‐vaccinated mothers ( Gall 2011 ; Leuridan 2011 ). Maternal antibodies are thought to have a half‐life of approximately six weeks and so if boosted to sufficiently high levels, are likely to provide time‐limited, passive protection for newborn infants prior to administration of the first childhood immunisation and during the period when they are most vulnerable to severe infection ( Healy 2006a ; Van Savage 1990 ). Indeed, antenatal maternal immunisation programmes for other vaccine‐preventable diseases, such as tetanus, are well established ( WHO 2010 ) and have been shown to be effective in terms of reducing neonatal mortality ( Demicheli 2013 ). However, there is no clear immunological correlate of protection following pertussis vaccination and, as such, evidence regarding the clinical relevance of vaccination and any blunting of response to subsequent immunisation is more difficult to ascertain.\n\n【13】Some animal studies suggest that vaccination of pregnant sows results in elevated serological levels of pertussis IgG with evidence of transfer to newborn piglets ( Elahi 2006 ). Those newborn piglets receiving passive immunity exhibit fewer clinical symptoms, suggesting this may result in clinical protection ( Elahi 2006 ), although it is not clear whether such findings can be extrapolated to humans.\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】In 2011, the USA recommended that pregnant women who had not previously received a pertussis‐containing vaccine, should be offered the Tdap vaccine at more than 20 weeks gestation ( ACIP 2011 ). However, to date, evidence of infant protection is largely indirect. In October 2012, in response to the outbreak and continued increase in disease amongst infants less than three months of age in the UK, the Department of Health, with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), announced the introduction of a temporary programme of maternal antenatal vaccination ( DoH 2012 ). The committee noted that whilst this was likely to be the most effective strategy to provide protection of infants from birth and there is good evidence of transplacental transfer of antibodies, the effectiveness in terms of providing infant protection remains uncertain, primarily consisting of single studies. Following this announcement, in October 2012, the USA revised their recommendation to include all pregnant women ( ACIP 2013 ).\n\n【16】As with any maternal immunisation programme, there are also concerns about the safety of vaccination during pregnancy. A number of vaccines are already recommended for use in pregnant women and, to date, there is little evidence of any adverse outcomes for either mother or child ( Mooi 2007 ). A randomised clinical trial carried out amongst pregnant women in Egypt, for example, demonstrated few adverse effects amongst mothers or their children following immunisation with tetanus in pregnancy ( Salama 2009 ). Enhanced reactogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines has been described with increasing numbers of doses in infants and young children and is associated with more pronounced local side effects ( ACIP 2000 ) but further evidence of any adverse impact following maternal antenatal vaccination is required.\n\n【17】A Cochrane systematic review on this topic would enable evidence‐based conclusions to be drawn to further inform this policy. This is a relevant priority topic that will fill an important gap in the current literature and help to guide international policy.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】The primary objective of this review is to assess existing evidence for the effectiveness and safety of immunisation in pregnancy (in any trimester) in preventing pertussis infection in infants who are too young to be protected by the routine primary vaccinations compared to no vaccination, sham or placebo vaccination.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Any primary (experimental or observational) or secondary study type reporting on the effectiveness of antenatal vaccination with a pertussis‐containing vaccine, in any pregnant woman.\n\n【24】The most relevant study design to address the proposed review questions and that presenting the lowest risk of bias is a randomised controlled trial (RCT). However, given that antenatal vaccination for pertussis has only recently been considered in immunisation policy, we anticipate that the existing evidence base is likely to be limited. As such, we will also consider other experimental and observational study designs including non‐RCTs, prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case‐control studies. We will use systematic reviews to obtain further primary studies of relevance, but will not extract data from secondary analyses of these.\n\n【25】##### Exclusion criteria\n\n【26】1.  Any study that does not consider immunisation with a pertussis‐containing vaccine during pregnancy.\n    \n2.  Any study that considers vaccination of groups which do not include pregnant women.\n    \n3.  Animal studies.\n    \n4.  Any study which considers minor adverse events only (i.e. those that are self limiting).\n    \n\n【27】#### Types of participants\n\n【28】Pregnant woman of all ages and gestations of pregnancy, with any pregnancy (single, multiple, complicated or uncomplicated) and their infants.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】We will consider pertussis‐containing vaccines (acellular or whole cell) administered at any stage of pregnancy for the purposes of this review as compared with no vaccination, sham or placebo vaccination. In the UK the dTaP‐IPV vaccine (Repevax and Boostrix‐IPV) is the licensed acellular pertussis‐containing vaccine suitable for use in adults and adolescents ( HPA 2012 ). In other countries, additional vaccines are licensed for this, e.g. Tdap (ADACEL or BOOSTRIX) in the USA ( ACIP 2011 ).\n\n【31】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【32】*   1.  Evidence of infant infection as demonstrated by:\n        \n        1.  cases of pertussis infection with clinical or laboratory confirmation (or both);\n            \n        2.  admission to a healthcare facility or any other suggestion of severity of illness such as length of stay, admission to intensive or critical care, or death, where pertussis is specified as the primary diagnosis or a major contributing factor.\n            \n    2.  Evidence of transplacental transfer of antibody, as demonstrated by cord, fetal or infant blood maternal antibody titres to pertussis vaccine component, at birth or prior to the first primary vaccination.\n        \n    3.  Antibody titres to pertussis vaccine component in mother pre‐ and post‐immunisation.\n        \n    4.  Evidence of blunting of the response to routine, primary childhood immunisations as demonstrated by infant antibody titres to pertussis vaccine component and immunological correlates of protection (where these exist), pre‐ and post‐immunisation.\n        \n    5.  Any reported major side effect or adverse event in the mother (between 30 minutes post‐administration and four months post‐delivery) or in the fetus/infant(s) (from birth until 13 months of age), or in both.\n        \n\n【33】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【34】1.  Evidence of protection against pertussis infection in infants, including frequency of clinically defined or laboratory‐confirmed cases, admission to a healthcare facility or any other indication of severity of illness (e.g. requirement for intensive care or death) where pertussis is specified as the primary diagnosis or a major contributing factor.\n    \n2.  Evidence of the safety of vaccination in pregnancy, as demonstrated by major adverse events in the mother or in the fetus/infant(s), or both. Given that the profile of any associated serious adverse events is unknown, we will consider the time period between 30 minutes post‐administration and four months post‐delivery for mothers and from birth until 13 months of age for infants, in accordance with ongoing clinical trials ( Dalhousie University 2013 ; NIAID 2013 ).\n    \n3.  Given that immunisation schedules are likely to vary, we will consider the time period between birth and 12 months of age, or six months post‐completion of the primary immunisation programme.\n    \n\n【35】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【36】1.  Antibody response in the mother following vaccination in pregnancy, as evidenced by maternal serum antibody titres to pertussis vaccine component pre‐ and post‐immunisation.\n    \n2.  Transplacental transfer of antibody as evidenced by cord, fetal or infant blood titres of maternally derived antibody to any vaccine component, at birth or prior to the first primary vaccination.\n    \n3.  Blunting of the immunological response to primary childhood vaccinations as evidenced by antibody levels to any vaccine component pre‐ and post‐administration of the vaccine and established correlates of protection where these exist.\n    \n4.  Impact on maternal pertussis infection as evidenced by the incidence of pertussis (clinically or laboratory defined). As described above, we will consider the period from two weeks after vaccination to six months post‐completion of the infants primary immunisation programme in order to capture potential indirect effects of reduced mother to infant transmission during the time infants remain most susceptible to severe infection.\n    \n\n【37】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【38】#### Electronic searches\n\n【39】We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , current issue), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group’s Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1981 to present), EMBASE (1974 to present), LILACS (1982 to present) and Web of Science (1985 to present).We will use the search strategy in Appendix 1 to search MEDLINE and CENTRAL. We will adapt the search strategy for the other databases. We will not use any language, date or publication restrictions.\n\n【40】#### Searching other resources\n\n【41】We will search the trials registries, ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and WHO ICTRP ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch ). In addition, snowballing technique such as reference list follow up, expert authors, advisory bodies (e.g. SAGE working group) and vaccine manufacturers will be contacted in order to identify any further potentially relevant, but unpublished studies. Reference and citation tracking will be carried out for all included papers (particularly to look for historical papers – pre‐1950) and any links to additional sources of relevance identified during searching of conference proceedings and Internet sites followed in order to identify any additional studies of interest.\n\n【42】Where possible, results will be merged using reference management software in attempt to minimise duplication.\n\n【43】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【44】#### Selection of studies\n\n【45】We will scan the titles and abstracts from the searches and obtain full‐text articles when they appear to meet the eligibility criteria, or when there is insufficient information to assess the eligibility. We will assess the eligibility of the studies independently and document the reasons for exclusion. We will resolve any disagreements between the review authors by discussion. We will contact the trial authors if clarification is needed.

We will attempt to contact the study authors where data are insufficient or missing.\n\n【66】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【67】We will assess the risk of bias ( Table 2 ) based on random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, completeness of outcome data, selectivity of outcome reporting and other bias, as discussed in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion.\n\n【68】We will use the GRADE approach ( Duclos 2012 ) (as modified by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts) to cater for non‐randomised vaccine studies.\n\n【69】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【70】Where data are available, we will express effect sizes for dichotomous outcomes as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and for continuous variables as mean differences (MDs) if outcomes are measured in the same way with 95% CIs.\n\n【71】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【72】We will assume an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) policy for all outcomes such that all participants will be analyzed in the group to which they are allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the intervention.\n\n【73】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【74】We will deal with missing data in accordance with the recommendations in Chapter 16 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). In the first instance, we will attempt to contact the trial authors to request missing data. If this is not possible and missing data are thought likely to have occurred at random, we will exclude them. Where missing data are not thought to have occurred randomly, we will use replacement values. We will record any instance of missing data in the data extraction form and will outline subsequent assumptions made and methods of dealing with this elsewhere in the methodological description. Where appropriate, we will use a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of any assumptions made.\n\n【75】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【76】We will assess the presence of heterogeneity in two steps. First, we will assess obvious heterogeneity at face value by comparing populations, settings, interventions and outcomes. Second, we will assess statistical heterogeneity by means of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【77】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【78】If there are sufficient studies, we will use funnel plots to assess the possibility of reporting biases or small study biases, or both.\n\n【79】#### Data synthesis\n\n【80】We would only consider a meta‐analysis of studies where the intervention, design and end point were similar. Where this is not the case we will just summarise the results of different studies (giving descriptive results) but not produce pooled estimates. Any evidence from RCTs will be analyzed separately from observational evidence.\n\n【81】If the studies are considered appropriate for combining in meta‐analysis, we plan to undertake meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5.2 software ( RevMan 2012 ) if appropriate, and will use either a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model to pool data, depending on the degree of significant clinical or statistical heterogeneity. Thresholds for the interpretation of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic can be misleading, since the importance of inconsistency depends on several factors. We plan to use the guide to interpretation of heterogeneity as outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ): 0% to 40% might not be important; 40% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 60% to 75% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% would be considerable heterogeneity.\n\n【82】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【83】If possible, we will conduct the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【84】*   gestation of pregnancy in which the intervention occurs;\n    \n*   type of intervention (vaccine used: whole cell or acellular);\n    \n*   antibody response by vaccine component;\n    \n*   previous vaccination status; and\n    \n*   clinically confirmed or laboratory‐confirmed.\n    \n\n【85】We will explore the potential sources when important heterogeneity is present and either not pool the studies or use a random‐effects model.\n\n【86】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【87】If a meta‐analysis is conducted we will conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to determine the potential impact of any assumptions made.\n\n【88】Table 1.

Concern about weight gain can limit the use of this highly effective method of contraception by deterring the initiation of its use and causing early discontinuation among users. However, a causal relationship between combination contraceptives and weight gain has not been established.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The aim of the review was to evaluate the potential association between combination contraceptive use and changes in weight.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS for studies of combination contraceptives, as well as clinical trials databases. We also wrote to known investigators and manufacturers to request information about other published or unpublished trials not discovered in our search.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】All English‐language, randomized controlled trials were eligible if they had at least three treatment cycles and compared a combination contraceptive to a placebo or to a combination contraceptive that differed in drug, dosage, regimen, or study length.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】All titles and abstracts located in the literature searches were assessed. Data were entered and analyzed with RevMan, and a second author verified the data entered. Depending on the data available, the mean difference using a fixed effects model with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the mean change in weight between baseline and post‐treatment measurements or the Peto odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated using the proportion of women who gained or lost more than a specified amount of weight.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】The three placebo‐controlled, randomized trials did not find evidence supporting a causal association between combination oral contraceptives or a combination skin patch and weight gain. Most comparisons of different combination contraceptives showed no substantial difference in weight. In addition, discontinuation of combination contraceptives because of weight gain did not differ between groups where this was studied.\n\n【13】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【14】Available evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of combination contraceptives on weight, but no large effect was evident.\n\n【15】PICOs\n-----\n\n【16】### PICOs\n\n【17】###### Population (4)\n\n【18】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【19】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【20】*   Progestogens And Estrogens Systemic Contraceptives, Sequential Preparations\n*   Progestogens And Estrogen Systemic Contraceptives, Fixed Combinations\n\n【21】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【22】*   Progestogens And Estrogens Systemic Contraceptives, Sequential Preparations\n*   Placebo\n*   Progestogens And Estrogen Systemic Contraceptives, Fixed Combinations\n\n【23】###### Outcome (1)\n\n【24】*   Weight change\n\n【25】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Many women and health care providers believe that pills and patches cause weight gain. Concern about weight gain can limit the use of these effective birth control methods. Fear of weight gain keeps some women from starting the pill or patch. Women may stop using the pill because they think it caused weight gain. This review looked at trials of birth control pills or patches where the woman's weight was measured.\n\n【30】We did a computer search for studies of pills or patches containing two types of hormones. We also wrote to researchers and manufacturers to find other trials. We included randomized trials in the English language if they had at least three treatment cycles. The studies also had to compare two types of birth control methods or one type with a 'dummy' method.\n\n【31】The three trials with a dummy did not show that these pills or patches led to weight gain. Most studies of different birth control methods showed no large weight difference. Also, women did not stop using the pill or patch because of weight gain. The evidence was not strong enough to be sure that these methods did not cause some weight gain. However, we found no major effect on weight.\n\n【32】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【33】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

One reviewer extracted data. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using RevMan analyses 1.0.1.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Fifty seven studies (12,614 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was fair.  \n**Dose ratio 1:2:** FP produced a significantly greater FEV1 (0.09 litres (95% CI 0.03 to 0.15 litres), change in morning PEF (8.15 L/min (95% CI 5.21 to 11.09 L/min), but not evening PEF. This applied to all drug doses, age groups, and delivery devices. No difference between FP and BDP/BUD were seen for trial withdrawals. Symptoms and rescue medication use were widely reported but few trials provided sufficient data for analysis. When given at half the dose of BDP/BUD, FP led to a greater likelihood of pharyngitis. There was no difference in the likelihood of oral candidiasis. Plasma cortisol and 24 hour urinary cortisol was measured frequently but data presentation was limited.  \n**Dose ratio 1:1:** FP produced a statistically significant difference in am PEF (8.78 L/min (95% CI 5.14 to 12.41)), pm PEF (6.37 L/min (95% CI 2.75 to 9.99)), and FEV1 (0.09 L (0.02 to 0.17)).

To determine if any type of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis reduces the incidence of conjunctivitis in neonates.\n    \n2.  To determine which ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis is most effective at reducing the incidence of conjunctivitis in neonates.\n    \n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Ophthalmia neonatorum, also called neonatal conjunctivitis, is an inflammatory disorder of the ocular surface in newborns in the first month of life ( WHO 1986 ). In Europe in the late 1800s, a significant percentage of those who were blind was due to gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. Specifically, it was reported that the percentage of those who were blind from ophthalmia neonatorum was 8% in Copenhagen, 20% in Berlin, 30% in Vienna and 45% in Paris ( Buller 1900 ; Haussman 1895 ; Milot 2008 ). During the same period, it has been estimated that 20% to 80% of the children in blind institutions in Germany were blind due to ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( Konigstein 1882 ). In the United States, among new admissions to schools for the blind between 1906 and 1911, approximately 24% were due to ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with a range of 8% to 45% ( Barsam 1966 ). In 1918, a hospital was opened specifically for the treatment of neonates with ophthalmia neonatorum in London, UK; ( Annonymous 1918 ; Annonymous 1919 ).\n\n【8】Ophthalmia neonatorum remains a significant cause of childhood corneal blindness in developing countries, mainly from Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( Whitcher 2001 ). There are major epidemiological challenges in determining the prevalence and incidence of blindness from ophthalmia neonatorum. In addition, childhood blindness is related to mortality in the under the age of five age range, thereby underestimating rates of childhood blindness ( Gilbert 2012 ). Notwithstanding these limitations, cross‐sectional surveys have estimated the percentage of blindness or severe visual impairment due to ophthalmia neonatorum to be 3% in Ethiopia ( Kello 2003 ), 0.7% in Bangladesh ( Muhit 2007 ), 0.4% in Malaysia ( Koay 2015 ), 5% in East Africa ( Foster 1991 ), 0.8% in India ( Rahi 1995 ), and 2% in Tanzania ( Foster 1987 ).\n\n【9】Ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also called gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, is mainly contracted from the mother's infected birth canal during delivery, but can also be contracted in‐utero by ascending infections. Neonates born to gonorrhoea‐infected mothers have a 30% to 50% risk of developing gonococcal conjunctivitis ( Laga 1989 ). Untreated or inappropriately treated gonococcal conjunctivitis can result in corneal perforation and vision loss within 24 hours ( Donham 2008 ; Duke‐Elder 1965 ). In one case series, the mean duration of corneal perforation from untreated gonococcal conjunctivitis was 11 days ( Kawashima 2009 ). In areas with low incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum or limited access to appropriate health care, appropriate clinical diagnosis and appropriate therapy may be delayed, which can lead to loss of vision ( Bastion 2006 ; McElnea 2015 ; Schwab 1985 ; Wan 1986 ).\n\n【10】After historical declines in rates of gonorrhoea, it is now making a resurgence in some developed countries. In 2012, among adults aged 15 to 49 years, it was estimated that there were 27 million cases of gonorrhoea globally ( Newman 2015 ). Further, there is increasing incidence of drug‐resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae globally ( Martin 2015 ; Van de Laar 2012 ; WHO 2012 ). In addition to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis is another significant sexually transmitted pathogen that can be transmitted from the mother to the neonate during delivery. While ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae has a high risk of blindness, ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis has a low risk of blindness ( Whitcher 2001 ). Still, chlamydial conjunctivitis may lead to corneal and conjunctival scarring and rarely, loss of vision, if left untreated ( Darville 2015 ). Chlamydia trachomatis can also cause a hemorrhagic conjunctivitis ( Chang 2006 ). Studies of the risks of an infant acquiring Chlamydia trachomatis conjunctivitis from an infected mother range from 8% to 44%, with a point estimate of 15% ( Rosenman 2003 ).\n\n【11】Chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum is much more prevalent than gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, and has historically been underdiagnosed, first, due to a lack of appropriate diagnostic techniques, and second, due to a lack of diagnostic techniques with appropriate sensitivity and specificity ( Darville 2015 ; Yip 2008 ). In some developed countries, there is an increasing rate of chlamydial infection, and in some jurisdictions, a commensurate rise in the rate of chlamydial conjunctivitis ( Quirke 2008 ). In 2012, among adults aged 15 to 49 years, it was estimated that there were 128 million cases of chlamydia globally ( Newman 2015 ). In addition to the sexually transmitted pathogens of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis, ophthalmia neonatorum can be caused by other bacteria, less often by viruses such as herpes simplex, and adenovirus, and finally, it can be caused by chemical agents ( Albert 1994 ).\n\n【12】The relative frequencies of bacterial causes of ophthalmia neonatorum varies by study and jurisdiction ( Amini 2008 ; Chhabra 2008 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Di Bartolomeo 2005 ; Hammerschlag 1993 ; Mohile 2002 ; Sandstrom 1984 ). In a high percentage of ophthalmia neonatorum cases, no causative pathogen is found. This could be due to the method of obtaining the sample, the culture medium, an inability to culture for viruses or other microorganisms, or the cause is not a pathogen, but rather chemical conjunctivitis or nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( Sandstrom 1987 ).\n\n【13】Even though certain bacteria are frequently cultured from neonates with conjunctivitis, their role as the causative agent of conjunctivitis is uncertain, as the same bacteria may be frequently cultured from the eyes of asymptomatic neonates. An example of this is Staphylococcus aureus, which is frequently found in both asymptomatic neonates and neonates with conjunctivitis ( Amini 2008 ; Fransen 1987 ; Krohn 1993 ).\n\n【14】Many of the agents that cause ophthalmia neonatorum are not acquired from the birth process or the mother’s birth canal, but are acquired postnatally from caregivers or the nasopharyngeal passages of the neonate ( Krohn 1993 ). The proportion acquired from the birth process compared to postnatal acquisition, likely varies by jurisdiction ( Isenberg 1995 ; Vedantham 2004 ; Verma 1994 ).\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】There are four strategies to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum:\n\n【17】1.  primary prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted infections;\n    \n2.  secondary screening of pregnant women for genital infection;\n    \n3.  topical or systemic eye prophylaxis at birth;\n    \n4.  tertiary prevention via early diagnosis and treatment of eye infections in neonates ( Foster 1995 ; Laga 1989 ).\n    \n\n【18】German born obstetrician and gynaecologist Carl Siegmund Franz Credé (1819 to 1892) introduced the third strategy, ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, to the world in his seminal publication in 1881 ( Crede 1881 ; Dunn 2000 ). In his seminal study, Dr. Credé showed that he reduced the incidence of ophthalmia neonatorum in his maternity hospital in Leipzig, Germany, from 13.6% to 0.05% with the introduction of silver nitrate prophylaxis ( Crede 1884 ).\n\n【19】The procedure of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis was simple. After mechanical cleansing of the eyelids, he instilled a drop of silver nitrate solution into each of the open eyes of all neonates, immediately after birth. This same procedure has continued into the current day with different prophylactic agents ( Crede 1881 ). Since the introduction of silver nitrate prophylaxis, consideration of other prophylactic agents, or even the complete abandonment of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, have been caused by the following factors:\n\n【20】1.  the introduction of antibiotics;\n    \n2.  the declining prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in developed countries;\n    \n3.  increased rates reported of ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis;\n    \n4.  concomitant questions about the relative effectiveness of silver nitrate; and\n    \n5.  concerns about side effects of silver nitrate, such as chemical conjunctivitis and their concomitant effects on maternal‐infant bonding ( Napchan 2005 ; Wahlberg 1982 ).\n    \n\n【21】Initially, studies looking for alternatives to silver nitrate mainly examined penicillin as a prophylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum. Later, erythromycin and tetracycline were studied in comparison to silver nitrate, and more recently, povidone‐iodine. There have been studies of other prophylactic agents, but the majority of jurisdictions in the world today appear to use either erythromycin or povidone‐iodine as a prophylaxis. However, there remains a high degree of variability in the prophylactic agents used for ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, with some jurisdictions using prophylactic medications that are uncommon or not well‐studied ( Guala 2005 ; Zloto 2016 ).\n\n【22】Erythromycin and tetracycline gained acceptance as prophylactic agents in the 1980s because of their allegedly superior activity against Chlamydia trachomatis, and because they lacked some of the side effects of silver nitrate, such as chemical conjunctivitis ( Isenberg 1994 ). However, it remains unresolved whether these antibiotic agents are in fact, any more effective than silver nitrate in preventing chlamydial conjunctivitis. Further, the emergence of beta‐lactamase‐producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae has reduced the prophylactic effectiveness of erythromycin and tetracycline ( Ison 1998 ; Martin 2015 ; Van de Laar 2012 ; WHO 2012 ). Povidone‐iodine is a more recently used prophylactic agent, which is alleged to have many advantages over silver nitrate, erythromycin, and tetracycline, including a broader antibacterial spectrum and lack of development of bacterial resistance ( Isenberg 1994b ).\n\n【23】### How the intervention might work\n\n【24】Ophthalmia neonatorum prophylactic agents used around the world are antimicrobial or antiseptic agents, which, when administered topically, or systemically (only rarely), destroy or inhibit microorganisms in the eye to prevent conjunctivitis and keratitis ( Kramer 2000 ). The microorganisms may be acquired from the mother’s infected birth canal, in‐utero by ascending infections, or from the hospital or home environment.\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】Launched in 1999, Vision 2020 is a global initiative of the World Health Organization and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, with the goal to eliminate avoidable blindness by 2020 ( WHO 1999 ). Vision 2020 was updated by the World Health Organization in 2013 to develop a Global Action Plan for 2014 to 2019, “to reduce the prevalence of avoidable visual impairment by 25% by 2019” ( WHO 2013 ).\n\n【27】Controlling childhood blindness is a high priority of this plan, as it has been estimated that 4% of all global blindness is due to childhood blindness, and 45% of all childhood blindness is avoidable. Corneal scarring is one of five childhood blindness conditions prioritised for control. While Vitamin A and measles are responsible for the majority of corneal scarring, ophthalmia neonatorum is a significant cause of corneal blindness, mainly in developing countries such as those in sub‐Saharan Africa ( Gilbert 2012 ; Robaei 2014 ; Whitcher 2001 ; WHO 2013 ).\n\n【28】There is considerable global variability in the requirement for ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, and the prophylactic agents used around the world. Certain jurisdictions still carry out ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, including Brazil ( Caligaris 2010 ), the US ( USPSTF 2011 ), Italy ( Guala 2005 ), Spain ( Luna 2009 ), Canada ( Moore 2015 ), Slovenia ( Dosier 2015 ), France ( Dageville 2015 ), Turkey ( Eser 2009 ), certain areas of Central America, some countries of Africa, parts of the Far East, areas of the Middle East, and sections of Central Asia ( Zloto 2016 ). Norway, Great Britain, Sweden, The Netherlands ( Geneeskundige 1980 ; Rours 2008 ), Australia ( Shaw 1977 ), Belgium ( Tribolet 2016 ), and Denmark ( Pande 2006 ) discontinued ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis years ago ( Kramer 2000 ). As recently as 2010, England and Wales removed ophthalmia neonatorum from the list of reportable diseases, even though, there is some evidence of significant underreporting of ophthalmia neonatorum ( Dharmasena 2015 ; UK Department of Health 2010 ).\n\n【29】In Canada, there have been recent recommendations that prophylaxis for ophthalmia neonatorum be discontinued, although no legislative changes have yet been made ( Moore 2015 ). Some groups in Canada oppose this recommendation ( Mulholland 2015 ); others question whether the alternative strategy of prenatal screening is an optimal substitute ( Poliquin 2015 ). The Canadian recommendation to discontinue prophylaxis has been made in spite of the fact that between 2003 and 2012, the rate of chlamydia in Canada has increased by 57.6% ( Totten 2015a ), and the rate of gonorrhoea has increased by 38.9%, mainly in women ( Totten 2015b ). In France, ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis is no longer universally recommended. Ocular prophylaxis is only recommended for neonates when there is a risk of sexually transmitted infections in the mother, and when the mother has had poor prenatal care ( AFSSAPS 2010 ). Still, other jurisdictions are considering implementation of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis ( Alexandre 2015 ).\n\n【30】This global variability in practice and adoption of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis can be explained by the following reasons:\n\n【31】1.  There is uncertainty about the evidence of effectiveness of the various prophylactic agents, particularly against Chlamydia trachomatis and emerging resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n    \n2.  There are questions about the risk‐benefit ratio of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, considering the side effects of the prophylactic agents, such as chemical conjunctivitis, and their effect on maternal‐infant bonding.\n    \n3.  There is controversy about whether there is a difference in rates of ophthalmia neonatorum in jurisdictions where ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis continues and those in which it has been discontinued.\n    \n4.  There is debate about whether rates of ophthalmia neonatorum caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae have sufficiently declined in the developed world to warrant discontinuing ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis.\n    \n5.  There are differences of opinion about whether alternative strategies, such as screening of pregnant women for genital infections, and early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal conjunctivitis, are adequate to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum.\n    \n\n【32】This systematic review aims to synthesize the best available evidence to determine if ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis is effective, and to determine which prophylactic agent is most effective.\n\n【33】Objectives\n----------\n\n【34】The objectives of this review are:\n\n【35】1.  To determine if any type of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis reduces the incidence of conjunctivitis in neonates.\n    \n2.  To determine which ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis is most effective at reducing the incidence of conjunctivitis in neonates.\n    \n\n【36】Methods\n-------\n\n【37】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【38】#### Types of studies\n\n【39】We will consider randomised and quasi‐randomised trials.\n\n【40】#### Types of participants\n\n【41】We will consider trials that enrolled neonates born either vaginally or by cesarean section for inclusion in this review.\n\n【42】#### Types of interventions\n\n【43】We will consider trials that compare any medication with placebo, or with each other, whether administered topically, systemically, or in a combination. Medications can include antibiotics or antiseptics. Examples of antibiotics include tetracycline and erythromycin. Examples of antiseptics include povidone‐iodine and silver nitrate. An example of systemic medication is intramuscular penicillin.\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【46】1.  Proportion of infants developing blindness, defined as a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, measured, for example, with a Teller visual acuity card at 12 months.\n    \n2.  Proportion of infants developing any adverse visual outcome measured, for example, with a Teller visual acuity card at 12 months.\n    \n3.  Proportion of neonates developing gonococcal conjunctivitis (GC) within 28 days of birth, where diagnosis was made with a laboratory‐based method to identify the infecting organism. We anticipate that most studies would not have studied blindness as an outcome. Because severe GC can result in loss of vision, we will consider this outcome as a substitute for the more important measure of blindness.\n    \n\n【47】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【48】1.  Proportion of neonates developing chlamydial conjunctivitis (CC) within 28 days of birth.\n    \n2.  Proportion of neonates developing bacterial conjunctivitis (BC) within 28 days of birth; this includes cases of conjunctivitis confirmed to be of bacterial origin by culture, gram stain, or both. In addition to conjunctivitis cases of other bacterial etiology, this category includes GC and CC.\n    \n3.  Proportion of neonates developing any clinical conjunctivitis within 28 days of birth, referred to as any conjunctivitis cases of any etiology (ACAE): includes all cases of conjunctivitis clinically diagnosed, irrespective of etiology. This would include infectious and non‐infectious conjunctivitis. Infectious conjunctivitis includes bacterial conjunctivitis, mycoplasma conjunctivitis, chlamydial or viral conjunctivitis. Non‐infectious conjunctivitis includes chemical, toxic or mechanical conjunctivitis. In cases where there was selective outcome reporting, and all cases of clinical conjunctivitis were not reported, this outcome will not be included in comparisons.\n    \n4.  Proportion of neonates developing conjunctivitis of unknown etiology (CUE) within 28 days of birth: this includes cases of conjunctivitis which are culture‐negative, where the etiology is unknown. These may be infectious, but showing no growth of pathogenic agents on culture media, or on other methods to identify microbiologic etiology. This may include non‐infectious conjunctivitis, such as chemical conjunctivitis. Finally, it may be a mix of the aforementioned causes of conjunctivitis. In many cases, it is calculated by subtracting the total conjunctivitis cases of any etiology from the conjunctivitis cases proven to be bacterial origin.\n    \n5.  Proportion of neonates developing the following adverse effects of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis:\n    \n    1.  Proportion of neonates developing keratitis from ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis within 28 days of birth:\n        \n    2.  Proportion of neonates developing nasolacrimal duct obstruction from ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis within 60 days of birth\n        \n\n【49】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【50】#### Electronic searches\n\n【51】We will search CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; latest issue), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to present), Embase (January 1980 to present), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS; 1982 to present), the ISRCTN registry ( isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; who.int/ictrp/search/en ). We will not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials.\n\n【52】See appendices for details of search strategies for CENTRAL ( Appendix 1 ), MEDLINE ( Appendix 2 ), EMBASE ( Appendix 3 ), LILACS ( Appendix 4 ), ISRCTN ( Appendix 5 ), ClinicalTrials.gov ( Appendix 6 ) and the ICTRP ( Appendix 7 ).\n\n【53】#### Searching other resources\n\n【54】We will check the reference lists of identified trial reports and existing review articles to identify additional trials. We will contact the authors of identified trials, pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the area to locate further trials.\n\n【55】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【56】#### Selection of studies\n\n【57】Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of records retrieved from the searches, and categorize each record as either include, exclude, or unclear. We will retrieve full‐text articles of records that any of the review authors mark as include or unclear. Two review authors will independently assess the full‐text articles and mark them as include or exclude. We will report reasons for full‐text articles excluded in this process. The authors will resolve disagreements through discussion and consensus. In cases where additional information is needed before a decision on eligibility of the full‐text articles, we will attempt to obtain this information from the study investigator.\n\n【58】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【59】For each eligible study (using all reports from the study), two review authors will independently extract information on methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources using data forms developed for this review. We will contact the study authors for information missing from available reports.\n\n【60】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【61】Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias in each included study according to methods described in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will assess risk of bias for generation and concealment of the allocation sequence, masking of participants, caregivers or study personnel, and outcome assessors, completeness of follow‐up, reporting biases (selective outcome reporting), and other sources of potential bias, such as funding.\n\n【62】The review authors will mark the risk of bias for each item as high, low, or unclear. We will contact study authors if available reports do not contain information necessary for our assessment. We will use available information if study authors do not respond within four to six weeks.\n\n【63】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【64】We will compute the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes.\n\n【65】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【66】We will consider the individual as the unit of analysis. The interventions are typically administered to both eyes, and we will consider infants to be infected if at least one eye is affected. We anticipate that trials will have randomised infants and not eyes. We will exclude studies in which both eyes within infants are randomised to different interventions.\n\n【67】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【68】We will contact authors of included trials where we identify missing data on risk of bias or outcomes. If authors provide information on risk of bias that is not described in the trial reports, we will mark it as such in the review. If missing data on outcome are not available from authors of included trials, we will assess whether a meta‐analysis is possible, using an intention‐to‐treat or an available case approach.\n\n【69】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【70】We will assess heterogeneity in effect estimates from included trials through a visual examination of the forest plot and based on the I² value. We will consider I² values of 60% or greater to indicate substantial heterogeneity. If we find substantial heterogeneity and the effect estimates in the included trials are in the same direction of the null value, then we will consider performing a meta‐analysis; we will discuss the observed heterogeneity in such an instance. If we find estimates on both sides of the null value and substantial heterogeneity, we will not do a meta‐analysis and instead provide a narrative summary. We will also consider the nature of interventions and the patient population to evaluate clinical heterogeneity in the included trials.\n\n【71】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【72】For meta‐analyses where we include more than 10 trials, we will evaluate the risk of publication bias using a funnel plot. For trials where the protocol is available, we will assess whether all the outcomes relevant to this review that were specified in the protocol have been described in the published reports.\n\n【73】#### Data synthesis\n\n【74】We will conduct a meta‐analysis for comparisons where we determine minimal or no clinical heterogeneity and no substantial statistical heterogeneity. We will use a random‐effects model. We will use a fixed‐effect model for comparisons with two eligible studies. For trials with more than one comparison group, we will include the trial in relevant non‐overlapping comparisons.\n\n【75】We will not explicitly include risk of bias as a factor in determining whether to include eligible trials in meta‐analyses. We will discuss the findings from meta‐analyses considering the risk of bias in included studies, and perform sensitivity analyses as described below.\n\n【76】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【77】We will consider subgroups by the cause of infection where data allow such analyses. If data permit, we will assess the effect of interventions within studies conducted in high income versus low income countries, using classification specified by the United Nations ( WESP 2014 ).\n\n【78】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【79】We will conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of studies with high risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, or completeness of follow‐up.\n\n【80】**Summary of findings**\n\n【81】We will prepare Summary of Findings tables using the GRADE approach ( Langendam 2013 ) for the following seven outcomes:\n\n【82】1.  Blindness\n    \n2.  Any adverse visual outcome\n    \n3.  Gonococcal conjunctivitis (GC)\n    \n4.  Chlamydial conjunctivitis (CC)\n    \n5.  Bacterial conjunctivitis (BC)\n    \n6.  Conjuncitivitis of any etiology (ACAE)\n    \n7.  Conjunctivitis of unknown etiology (CUE)\n    \n\n【83】Summary of Findings tables will be done for the following comparisons, each with the above seven outcomes. This selection has been determined based on the clinical questions of the review, current global use of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, and consultation with CEVG:\n\n【84】1.

Research suggests that the number of intellectually disabled people with children is increasing. Children of parents with intellectual disabilities may be at increased risk of neglectful care which could lead to health, developmental and behavioural problems, or increased risk of intellectual disability.\n\n【5】However, there is some indication that some parents with intellectual disabilities are able to provide adequate child care if they are given appropriate training and support to do so.\n\n【6】### Objectives\n\n【7】To assess the effectiveness of parent training interventions to support the parenting of parents with intellectual disabilities\n\n【8】### Search methods\n\n【9】We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, _The Cochrane Library_ ), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts International, MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, and ZETOC.\n\n【10】### Selection criteria\n\n【11】Randomised controlled trials comparing parent training interventions for parents with intellectual disabilities with usual care or with a control group. Outcomes of interest were: the attainment of parenting skills specific to the intervention, safe home practices and the understanding of child health.\n\n【12】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【13】Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and undertook data extraction.\n\n【14】### Main results\n\n【15】Three trials met the inclusion criteria for this review but no meta‐analysis was possible. One study reported improved maternal‐child interaction following group parent training compared with the control group. The second study reported some improvements in parents knowledge of life threatening emergencies, ability to recognise dangers and identify precautions and smaller improvements in their ability to implement precautions, use medicines safely and recognise child illness and symptoms. The third study reported improvement in child care and safety skills following the intervention.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】There is some risk of bias in the included studies, with limited information available to assess possible bias and to fully assess the findings of one included study. Whilst the evidence presented here does seem promising with regard to the ability of such interventions to improve parenting knowledge and skill in this population, there is a need for larger RCTs of interventions before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of parent training for this group of parents.\n\n【18】PICOs\n-----\n\n【19】### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Population (8)\n\n【21】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Parent\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Caregiver\n*   Intellectual Disability\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【22】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【23】*   Caregiver Education\n*   Parenting Education\n\n【24】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【25】*   Usual Care\n\n【26】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【27】*   Child Care Assessment\n*   Interaction With Others\n*   Patient knowledge\n*   Safety Finding\n*   Parenting\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The quality of the evidence in the studies is moderate to low. One study found improvement in mother‐child interaction compared with the control group, whilst the second found improvement in safe home practices, recognition of child illness and safe use of medicines. The third study found improvement in child care and safety. More research is needed to assess the effects of these interventions before conclusions can be drawn.\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Aspirin has been known for many years to be an effective analgesic for many different pain conditions. Although its use as an analgesic is now limited in developed countries, it is widely available, inexpensive, and remains commonly used throughout the world.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of single dose oral aspirin in acute postoperative pain.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】For the earlier review, we identified randomised trials by searching CENTRAL ( _The Cochrane Library_ ) (1998, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 1998), EMBASE (1980 to January 1998), and the Oxford Pain Relief Database (1950 to 1994). We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to January 2012.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Single oral dose, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials of aspirin for relief of established moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We assessed studies for methodological quality and two review authors extracted the data independently. We used summed total pain relief (TOTPAR) over four to six hours to calculate the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief. We used these derived results to calculate, with 95% confidence intervals, the relative benefit compared to placebo, and the number needed to treat (NNT) for one participant to experience at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. We sought numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, as additional measures of efficacy. We collected information on adverse events and withdrawals.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included 68 studies in which aspirin was used at doses from 300 mg to 1200 mg, but the vast majority of participants received either 600/650 mg (2409 participants, 64 studies) or 990/1000 mg (380 participants, eight studies). There was only one new study.\n\n【15】Studies were overwhelmingly of adequate or good methodological quality. NNTs for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours were 4.2 (3.9 to 4.8), 3.8 (3.0 to 5.1), and 2.7 (2.0 to 3.8) for 600/650 mg, 900/1000 mg, and 1200 mg respectively, compared with placebo. Type of pain model had no significant impact on the results. Lower doses were not significantly different from placebo. These results do not differ from those of the earlier review.\n\n【16】Fewer participants required rescue medication with aspirin than with placebo over four to eight hours postdose, but by 12 hours there was no difference. The number of participants experiencing adverse events was not significantly different from placebo for 600/650 mg aspirin, but for 900/1000 mg the number needed to treat to harm was 7.5 (4.8 to 17). The most commonly reported events were dizziness, drowsiness, gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting, nearly all of which were of mild to moderate severity.\n\n【17】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【18】Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain of moderate to severe intensity. High doses are more effective, but are associated with increased adverse events, including drowsiness and gastric irritation. The pain relief achieved with aspirin was very similar milligram for milligram to that seen with paracetamol.

This review assessed both the pain‐relieving effectiveness and the adverse effects of a single dose of aspirin in acute postoperative pain of moderate to severe intensity. We included 67 studies, with 3111 participants given aspirin in comparisons with 2632 given placebo. Most of the information was for a 600 mg or 650 mg dose. The results confirm that in patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain, about 40% of those treated with aspirin 600/650 mg will experience good levels of pain relief, compared with about 15% treated with placebo. This level of pain relief is comparable to that experienced with the same dose of paracetamol. In these single dose studies there was no significant difference between aspirin 600/650 mg and placebo for the number of participants experiencing adverse events, but at 900/1000 mg, twice as many did so, with dizziness, drowsiness, gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting being the most common events reported.\n\n【36】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【37】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Even then, this may not be at the former level of sport activity. The treatment of exercise‐related groin pain is mainly conservative (non‐surgical), using interventions such as exercises, electrotherapy, manual therapy and steroid injections.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2011, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1948 to November week 3 2011); EMBASE (1980 to Week 49 2011); CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); LILACS (1982 to December 2011); PEDro (1929 to December 2011), SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2011), OTseeker (to December 2011), reference lists of papers and conference proceedings (2000 to 2011).\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain were included. Studies comparing conservative with surgical treatments were excluded.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments. There was no pooling of data.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Two studies, involving a total of 122 participants who had experienced adductor‐related groin pain for at least two months, were included in this review. All but one of the participants were male athletes aged between 18 and 50 years old. Both studies were assessed as 'high risk of bias' for at least one source of bias domain. The 'successful treatment' outcome reported in both studies was based primarily on pain measures.\n\n【15】One study, based on an intention‐to‐treat analysis, found a significant difference favouring exercise therapy (strengthening with an emphasis on the adductor and abdominal muscles and training muscular co‐ordination) compared with 'conventional' physiotherapy (stretching exercises, electrotherapy and transverse friction massage) in successful treatment at 16‐week follow‐up (25/34 (74%) versus 10/34 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.37, P = 0.001). Similarly, of those followed‐up significantly more athletes treated by exercise therapy returned to sport at the same level (23/29 (79%) versus 4/30 (13%); RR 5.95, 95% CI 2.34 to 15.09, P = 0.0002). Although still favouring the exercise group, the differences between the two groups in patients' subjective global assessment at 16 weeks and successful treatment at 8 to 12 years follow‐up were not statistically significant.\n\n【16】The second study (54 participants) found no significant differences at 16‐week follow‐up between a multi‐modal treatment (heat, manual therapy and stretching) and exercise therapy (the same intervention as in the above study) for the outcomes of successful treatment (14/26 (54%) versus 12/22 (55%); RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.66, P = 0.96) and return to full sports participation (13/26 (50%) versus 12/22 (55%); RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.58, P = 0.75). Those returning to full sports participation returned on average 4.5 weeks earlier after receiving multi‐modal therapy (mean difference ‐4.50 weeks, 95% CI ‐8.60 to ‐0.40, P = 0.03) than those in the exercise therapy group. This study reported that there were no complications or side effects found in either intervention group.\n\n【17】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【18】The available evidence from the randomized trials is insufficient to advise on any specific conservative modality for treating exercise‐related groin pain. While still low quality, the best evidence is from one trial which found that exercise therapy (strengthening of hip and abdominal muscles) in athletes improves short‐term outcomes (based primarily on pain measures) and return to sports compared with physiotherapy consisting of passive modalities. Given the low quality of the available evidence from both included trials, further randomized trials are necessary to reinforce their findings.\n\n【19】Plain language summary\n----------------------\n\n【20】available in\n\n【21】*   English\n*   Deutsch\n*   Español\n*   فارسی\n*   Français\n*   Hrvatski\n*   日本語\n*   한국어\n*   தமிழ்\n\n【22】### Conservative treatment for exercise‐related groin pain\n\n【23】Exercise‐related groin pain is common in sports especially those involving running, kicking and changing directions, such as in soccer and hockey. Athletes may have a delay of several months before being able to resume the sport, and this may not be at their former level of sports activity. Usually the treating clinician deals with the coexistence of two or more disorders, such as muscle, tendon and ligament strains and a bony stress reaction. Conservative interventions are generally the first choice for treatment and include an initial period of rest; strengthening of the muscles stabilising the pelvis and hip joints; stretching the hip muscles; electrotherapy (for example, transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), laser and ultrasound therapy); manual therapy; non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs; steroidal injections or prolotherapy (injection of growth factor production stimulants to induce growth and repair of normal tissue).\n\n【24】Two randomized controlled trials, involving a total of 122 athletes with exercise‐related groin pain, were included in this review. Participants were aged between 18 and 50 years and all but one were male. They had had groin pain for at least two months. One trial demonstrated positive results in athletes treated by exercise therapy (strengthening of hip and abdominal muscles, and training muscular co‐ordination) in comparison with 'conventional' physiotherapy consisting of passive modalities (stretching exercises, electrotherapy and transverse friction massage) 16 weeks after the end of treatment, for 'successful treatment' (based primarily on pain measures) and for the rate of return to sports at the same level without groin pain. The second study compared multi‐modal treatment (heat, manual therapy and stretching) with exercise therapy and found no significant difference between groups for 'successful treatment' and return to sports, but did show an earlier return to sport for those athletes who achieved this outcome following the multi‐modal treatment.\n\n【25】The available evidence is exclusively related to athletes and is limited because of the low number of studies and low number of participants for each outcome. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to ratify these results.\n\n【26】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【27】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【28】### Implications for practice\n\n【29】The available evidence from the randomized trials is insufficient to advise on any specific conservative modality for treating exercise‐related groin pain. While still low quality, the best evidence is from one trial which found that exercise therapy (strengthening of hip and abdominal muscles) in athletes improves short‐term outcomes (based primarily on pain measures) and return to sports compared with physiotherapy consisting of passive modalities (stretching exercises, laser therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and transverse friction massage).\n\n【30】### Implications for research\n\n【31】Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm or refute the possible favourable effects of exercise therapy, multi‐modal treatments, and other conservative modalities for treating patients diagnosed with exercise‐related groin pain. Future research should include long‐term follow‐up and evaluate pain through standardized instruments, such as the visual analogue score or numerical rating score. The use of standardized outcome assessment would facilitate future data synthesis, particularly where the sample size is small. In addition, single outcome measures should be adopted to improve accurate assessment, instead of the combined criteria used in the trials included in this review.\n\n【32】Function should also be evaluated in future trials as it is important to evaluate whether athletes demonstrate limitations during sports activities, and not only the presence of pain or whether they returned to sports or not. It is insufficient to evaluate only return to sports because athletes may return to sports in an inadequate condition. Although there is no validated questionnnaire that evaluates function for exercise‐related groin pain, the recently developed and validated Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score ( Thorborg 2011 ), which assesses groin symptoms and function during activities of daily life and sports activities, seems a reasonable substitute.\n\n【33】Background\n----------\n\n【34】### Description of the condition\n\n【35】Musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous (bony) groin pain is related to and aggravated by exercise and is characterized by overuse ( Lynch 1999 ; Orchard 2000 ; Pizzari 2008 ). Given this link, we generally use the term 'exercise‐related groin pain' to describe this injury. Potential contributing factors towards the etiology of this injury are muscle imbalances between the abdominal wall musculature and the hip adductor muscles that, combined with excessive loads, result in an abnormal distribution of forces in this region ( Pizzari 2008 ; Rabe 2010 ). Hip adduction involves moving the legs together. The converse movement is hip abduction, where the legs are moved apart. The primary adductor muscles of the hip are the pectineus, adductor longus, gracilis, adductor brevis and adductor magnus, while the primary hip abductor muscles include the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and the tensor fasciae latae ( Neumann 2010 ). It has been demonstrated that restricted hip range of motion ( Verrall 2005a ; Verrall 2007a ), greater hip abductor to adductor muscle strength ratio, or adductor weakness ( Engebretsen 2010 ; Maffey 2007 ) may be important risk factors for the development of groin pain.\n\n【36】Currently there is no recommendation in the literature regarding the definition of groin pain, which makes the diagnosis of this condition a challenge for clinicians ( Hölmich 2007 ; Jansen 2008a ). Usually the clinician deals with the coexistence of two or more disorders, such as adductor strains and pubic bone‐related dysfunction, which are the most frequent musculoskeletal causes of exercise‐related groin pain ( Ekberg 1988 ; Hölmich 2007 ; Lloyd‐Smith 1985 ). Any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine, gynaecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies must first be excluded ( Jansen 2008a ; Machotka 2009 ). The most common symptoms are pain and tenderness on palpation of the pubis symphysis and tubercle, which may be referred to the surrounding area including the lower abdominal musculature and adductors, as well as pain provoked by resisted adduction ( Hölmich 2004 ; Verrall 2005b ). After clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as an important diagnostic tool to visualize any abnormalities of the involved structures ( Jansen 2008a ).\n\n【37】Musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain is related to sports, especially those that involve running, kicking, changing directions, twisting and cutting, such as soccer and hockey ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Emery 1999 ; Paajanen 2011a ). Among male soccer players, the incidence of groin pain is between 8% to 12% per year ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Hawkins 2001 ; Paajanen 2011a ). A study conducted during the Australian Football League season indicated that this condition was responsible for players missing many games, at a cost of AUD 1.7 million in player unavailability during this period ( Pizzari 2008 ).\n\n【38】The prognosis of exercise‐related groin pain is not straightforward and patients may wait more than six months to return to practicing sports without restrictions ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2010 ). It is not unusual for athletes to play with some symptoms even 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and the rate of failure to return to their prior level of sports function can reach more than 25% ( Verrall 2007b ; Weir 2011 ).\n\n【39】The treatment of exercise‐related groin pain is not well‐established in the literature ( Jansen 2008b ), but conservative modalities, such as physical therapy, are usually tried before surgery is considered. Conservative treatment appears to be a safe, low‐cost and accessible option for patients with exercise‐related groin pain.\n\n【40】### Description of the intervention\n\n【41】Conservative treatment is generally based on an initial period of rest or modification of sports activities, pharmacotherapy and physical therapy, which may involve electrotherapy modalities, manual therapy (a clinical approach utilizing a hands‐on technique to treat soft tissues and joint structures ( Carnes 2010 ), including but not limited to manipulation or mobilization), and mainly the strengthening of the abdominal and hip muscles to improve core stability ( Verrall 2007b ; Vitanzo 2001 ; Williams 2000 ). Although exercise therapy appears to be effective, a standardized protocol does not exist and the exercises are usually prescribed based on the therapist’s experience ( Machotka 2009 ). When initial conservative treatment fails, steroid injections and dextrose prolotherapy (a technique which involves the injection of growth factor production stimulants to induce growth and repair of normal tissue ( Topol 2005 )) may be used ( Jansen 2008b ).\n\n【42】### How the intervention might work\n\n【43】As exercise‐related groin pain is defined as being the result of overuse, a period of rest and reduction of activities that place high loads on the groin region are proposed in order to re‐establish the zone of homeostasis ( Pizzari 2008 ). Improving the hip range of motion, specifically internal and external rotation, has been proposed as a possible method to reduce stress across the pubic symphysis and surrounding structures ( Verrall 2005a ; Verrall 2007a ).\n\n【44】Muscular imbalances between abdominal and hip muscles may contribute towards overloading and loss of optimal functional stability of the groin region ( Hölmich 1999 ). The adductors are essential stabilisers of the pelvis in activities such as running, pivoting and kicking, and these are almost always activated, together with the gluteus, hamstrings and abdominal muscles ( Biedert 2003 ). Thus, it may be possible that improving control of and strengthening the abdominal ( Cowan 2004 ) and hip stabilising muscles may improve the functional stability of the pelvis and therefore restore the functional unit of the groin region.\n\n【45】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【46】Musculoskeletal, ligamentous and osseous groin injuries are common in athletes ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Hawkins 2001 ; Paajanen 2011a ) and have a large economic impact since patients may need more than six months for full return to sports ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2010 ). There are no recommendations in the literature nor consensus about the effectiveness of the conservative therapeutic approaches ( Jansen 2008b ; Machotka 2009 ). This uncertainty motivated us to conduct this systematic review which, through the use of rigorous methods and a comprehensive and up‐to‐date search, may help to provide the information needed to support decision making.\n\n【47】Objectives\n----------\n\n【48】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain.\n\n【49】Methods\n-------\n\n【50】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【51】#### Types of studies\n\n【52】Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized (method of allocating participants to a treatment which is not strictly random, for example by date of birth, hospital record number or alternation) controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for treating exercise‐related musculotendinous, ligamentous and osseous groin pain were included.\n\n【53】#### Types of participants\n\n【54】People with a diagnosis of exercise‐related groin pain caused by pubic bone‐related dysfunction, enthesopathy or muscles strains, established by the primary studies, were included. Excluded were groin pain from any type of hernia, sacroiliac dysfunction, piriformis syndrome, nerve entrapments, lumbar spine, gynaecological or urological diseases, and hip pathologies.\n\n【55】#### Types of interventions\n\n【56】Included were all forms of conservative treatment for exercise‐related groin pain, such as strengthening of the muscles stabilising the pelvis and hip joints, stretching of the hip muscles, electrotherapy (for example, laser and ultrasound therapy), manual therapy, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroidal injections or prolotherapy. The interventions could be single interventions or complex interventions, such as programmes incorporating different types of exercises or combinations of different interventions. Studies comparing conservative with surgical treatments were excluded.\n\n【57】Our main comparisons were:\n\n【58】*   conservative intervention (single or complex intervention) versus placebo intervention;\n    \n*   one conservative intervention (single or complex intervention) versus another conservative intervention (single or complex intervention).\n    \n\n【59】All of the interventions could be set in the context of other interventions being provided to all trial participants.\n\n【60】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【61】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【62】1.  Pain relief at rest, on palpation and during physical activity (visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, and others)\n    \n2.  Function (Short Form‐36 (SF‐36) physical component, and others)\n    \n3.  Successful treatment\n    \n\n【63】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【64】1.  Patient subjective global assessment (for example, classified as much better, better, not better, worse and much worse)\n    \n2.  Return to sports or normal activities\n    \n3.  Adverse events (e.g. burns from cryotherapy, reports of severe discomfort from or intolerance of interventions)\n    \n\n【65】If possible, the outcomes were evaluated in the short term (four to six weeks after the end of treatment, for example); mid‐term (12 to 16 weeks after the end of treatment, for example), and long term (one year after the end of treatment, for example).\n\n【66】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【67】#### Electronic searches\n\n【68】We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (December 2011); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2011, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1948 to November week 3 2011); EMBASE (1980 to Week 49 2011); CINAHL (1982 to December 2011); Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (1982 to December 2011); PEDro, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (1929 to December 2011); SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2011); and OTseeker, the Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence Database (to December 2011). No language restrictions were applied.\n\n【69】The subject‐specific strategy was combined with the sensitivity‐maximizing version of the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy ( Lefebvre 2011 ) to identify randomized trials in MEDLINE. Complete search strategies are shown for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS in Appendix 1 .\n\n【70】We searched Current Controlled Trials for ongoing studies.\n\n【71】#### Searching other resources\n\n【72】We contacted professional experts in this field and searched reference lists of papers and conference proceedings (2000 to 2011), such as of the American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meetings; American Physical Therapy Association; American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Annual Assembly; Canadian Physiotherapy Association Annual Congresses; Australian Physiotherapy Association Conferences.\n\n【73】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【74】The intended methodology for data collection and analysis was described in our published protocol ( Almeida 2012 ), which was based on the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【75】#### Selection of studies\n\n【76】Two review authors (MOA and BNGS) independently selected and assessed potentially eligible articles for inclusion in the review. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. Where necessary, a third author (MSP) acted as adjudicator. There was no blinding of authors, institution or journal of publication at any stage.\n\n【77】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【78】Two review authors (MOA and RBA) independently extracted data from selected articles using a standard extraction form. Data extracted included study methods, the characteristics of participants, interventions, outcome measures and results. When necessary, requests were sent to trial authors for additional information or data.\n\n【79】Data entry into RevMan was by three review authors (MOA, BNGS, RBA).\n\n【80】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【81】As recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration ( Higgins 2011 ), two review authors (MOA and RBA) independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study. Disagreements were resolved by a third review author (MSP). The following domains were evaluated for risk of bias: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Risk of bias for the individual domains was assessed as either 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear risk of bias'.\n\n【82】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【83】Dichotomous outcome data were expressed as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) were used if the studies use the same instrument of evaluation. However, if the primary trials assessed the same variables using different scales, we planned to use the standardized mean difference (SMD). The estimated effects were reported together with the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\n【84】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【85】The unit of analysis was based on the individual patient. Due to the biological and epidemiological characteristics of exercise‐related groin pain, cluster randomized controlled trials and cross‐over randomized controlled trials were not expected.\n\n【86】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【87】For missing data (for example, publication bias, outcome not measured, incomplete reporting, lack of intention‐to‐treat analysis, attrition from the study) we planned to adopt the following strategies.\n\n【88】*   Whenever possible, we would contact the original investigators to request missing data.\n    \n*   Make explicit the assumptions of any methods used to cope with missing data, for example, that the data were assumed to be missing at random, or that missing values were assumed to have a particular value such as a poor outcome.\n    \n*   Perform sensitivity analyses to determine how sensitive the results were to reasonable changes in the assumptions that were made.\n    \n*   Address the potential impact of missing data on the findings of the review in the Discussion section.\n    \n\n【89】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【90】We planned to assess heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot (analysis) along with consideration of the Chi² test for heterogeneity (with a level of significance of P < 0.1) and the I² statistic. We considered that there was probably substantial heterogeneity where I² > 50%.\n\n【91】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【92】We planned to assess the likelihood of publication bias using funnel plots, if there were at least 10 trials contributing to a primary outcome.\n\n【93】#### Data synthesis\n\n【94】In the absence of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity, we planned to use a fixed‐effect model and 95% confidence intervals for pooling the results of trials testing comparable interventions. However, if we had found diversity in clinical or methodological characteristics, or unexplained heterogeneity, we would have considered using a random‐effects model for analysis. Where possible, we planned to perform intention‐to‐treat analysis.\n\n【95】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【96】If data had been available, we planned to investigate heterogeneous results for specific patient groups, performing subgroup analyses according to gender, duration of symptoms, and activity (recreational versus professional athletes). We planned to investigate whether the results of subgroups were significantly different by inspecting the overlap of confidence intervals and performing the test for subgroup differences that is available in RevMan.\n\n【97】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【98】Where possible, we planned sensitivity analyses examining various aspects of study and review methodology, such as the inclusion or not of studies at high risk of bias (specifically from lack of allocation concealment, assessor blinding, and incomplete outcome data) and inclusion or not of trials only reported in abstracts. We also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses to look at the effects of missing data.\n\n【99】Results\n-------\n\n【100】### Description of studies\n\n【101】#### Results of the search\n\n【102】For our search, completed in December 2011, we screened a total of 1549 records from the following databases: Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (3 records); CENTRAL (142), MEDLINE (405), EMBASE (466), CINAHL (15), LILACS (12), PEDro (9), SPORTDiscus (409), OTseeker (1), and Current Controlled Trial (87). After discarding duplicates and obviously ineligible references, 37 references remained. Of these, 30 were excluded because they were clearly not reports of randomized controlled trials. The study flow diagram is presented in Figure 1 .\n\n【103】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【104】Figure 1\n\n【105】* * *\n\n【106】* * *\n\n【107】Flow diagram showing the reference screening and study selection.\n\n【108】Where possible, full reports were obtained for the seven potentially eligible studies. Upon study selection, two were included ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2011 ), two were excluded ( Ekstrand 2001 ; Paajanen 2011 ), and one is awaiting classification ( Backx 2009 ). The other two articles were additional reports of Hölmich 1999 ; one was a conference abstract and the other ( Hölmich 2011 ) was a longer‐term follow‐up (eight to 12 years after the original study).\n\n【109】Thus, overall there were two included trials, two excluded studies and one study awaiting classification.\n\n【110】#### Included studies\n\n【111】Both studies included in the review ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2011 ) were randomized clinical trials reported in English language journals. They recruited a total of 122 athletes, all with adductor‐related groin pain of at least two months duration.\n\n【112】Hölmich 1999 recruited 68 male athletes aged between 18 and 50 years. The study was carried out in Copenhagen (Denmark). Hölmich 1999 compared exercise therapy (strengthening with emphasis on the adductor and abdominal muscles, and training muscular co‐ordination) with conventional physiotherapy consisting of passive modalities (transverse friction massage, laser therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and stretching of adductor, hamstring and hip muscles). The outcomes assessed were 'successful treatment' (based on pain measures), patients' subjective global assessment, and return to sports at the same level without groin pain. Hölmich 1999 reported on the outcomes at four months and, in another report ( Hölmich 2011 ), at eight to 12 years.\n\n【113】Weir 2011 recruited 53 male athletes and one female athlete aged between 18 and 50 years. The study was carried out in Leidschendam (Netherlands). The study compared multi‐modal treatment (consisting of heat followed by manual therapy and stretching of adductor muscles) with exercise therapy (this was the same programme as in Hölmich 1999 : strengthening with emphasis on the adductor and abdominal muscles, and training muscular co‐ordination). The outcomes assessed were 'successful treatment', maximum pain during sports, return to sports at the same level without groin pain, time to return to sports, and adverse effects. Weir 2011 reported on the outcomes at 16 weeks.\n\n【114】For further details about the included studies, see the Characteristics of included studies .\n\n【115】#### Excluded studies\n\n【116】Two studies ( Ekstrand 2001 ; Paajanen 2011 ) were excluded because they compared conservative treatment with surgical treatment ( _see_ the Characteristics of excluded studies ).\n\n【117】##### Studies awaiting classification\n\n【118】Backx 2009 aimed to randomize 80 male athletes with groin pain for at least six weeks to receive either pelvic‐stabilising muscle training or usual care. The outcomes measures listed in the trial registration document are pain, general disability, global change, sport participation, time to return to full athletic activity and recurrences of the same complaints. Participants were evaluated after the period of treatment and 26 and 52 weeks after the start of treatment. Although the trial is indicated as completed in the trial registration document, contact with the trial investigator by email revealed this was not the case and that, in consequence, the trial results have not been published ( Backx 2013 ).\n\n【119】For more details, see the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification .\n\n【120】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【121】Details of the risk of bias assessment for each trial are shown in the Characteristics of included studies , and the judgements are shown visually in Figure 2 .\n\n【122】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【123】Figure 2\n\n【124】* * *\n\n【125】* * *\n\n【126】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【127】#### Allocation\n\n【128】##### Randomization\n\n【129】Hölmich 1999 and Weir 2011 clearly reported that the process of randomization involved sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, and were classified as 'low risk of bias'.\n\n【130】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【131】As both Hölmich 1999 and Weir 2011 used envelopes independently administered by a secretary, they were judged at low risk of selection bias relating to allocation concealment.\n\n【132】##### Implementation\n\n【133】Hölmich 1999 reported a statistically significant (P = 0.008) and clinically important difference in the baseline proportions of participants with bilateral groin pain in the two groups (5/34 (15%) versus 15/34 (44%)). Hölmich 1999 , however, reported that the findings for the 'successful treatment' outcome remained statistically significant for the exercise group when this was adjusted for using either univariate or multiple logistic‐regression analysis. In Weir 2011 , the allocation was implemented successfully because no significant difference was found in the baseline characteristics of the treatment groups. Our judgements for selection bias thus remained unaltered.\n\n【134】#### Blinding\n\n【135】##### Performance bias\n\n【136】Both studies ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2011 ) were considered to have high risk of bias because blinding of participants and therapists was not possible due to the nature of the interventions. Therefore, this bias was unavoidable.\n\n【137】##### Detection bias\n\n【138】In Hölmich 1999 and Weir 2011 , the examining physicians were unaware of the treatment allocation, but there were subjective outcomes (that is, successful treatment, patients' subjective global assessment) that meant that the participants, who were not blinded, were the key outcome assessors. Hence both studies were considered as at 'unclear risk of bias'.\n\n【139】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【140】Hölmich 1999 was classified as at 'unclear risk of bias' since the analyses were not entirely intention‐to‐treat analyses; the assumptions for the missing participants in the intention‐to‐treat analysis for the outcome 'successful treatment' were not described. A per protocol analysis was performed for the other outcomes (patients' subjective global assessment and return to sports at the same level without groin pain). The percentage of participants lost at 16 weeks follow‐up was 13% (9/68), and 31% (21/68) at eight to 12 years. Patient flow within the study was clear, missing data were balanced across groups, and reasons for missing data were provided. However, the characteristics of lost participants were not described.\n\n【141】Weir 2011 was also classified as 'unclear risk of bias' because it used a per protocol analysis. Despite the percentage of participants lost to follow‐up being quite small (6/54 (11%)), and missing data being well reported and balanced across groups (three participants in each group), the characteristics of lost participants were not reported.\n\n【142】#### Selective reporting\n\n【143】Despite the absence of suspected selective outcome reporting, Hölmich 1999 and Weir 2011 were classified as 'unclear risk of bias'  because neither study evaluated function, a clinically relevant primary outcome. Furthermore, data from the short‐term follow‐up were not reported in the publications of both included studies. On contact, authors of both studies reported that these data were not available ( Hölmich 2012 ; Weir 2012 ). These issues can be considered a potential source of reporting bias.\n\n【144】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【145】In Hölmich 1999 , there was no explicit information from participants about supplementary treatment and physical activity during the follow‐up period (eight to 12 years) and the study was therefore considered as 'high risk of bias' for this follow‐up outcome. Weir 2011 appeared to be free of other sources of bias and was classified as 'low risk of bias'.\n\n【146】### Effects of interventions\n\n【147】Given that the two included studies evaluated different comparisons, these are presented separately below.\n\n【148】Both studies reported on 'successful treatment'. This outcome was assessed based on the following measures: no pain at palpation of the adductors tendon or during resisted adduction; no pain in connection with or after athletic activity in the same sport and at the same level of competition; and return to sports at the same level without groin pain. If all three measures were reached, the result was labelled excellent; if two measures were reached, the result was good; if one measure was reached, the result was fair; and if no measures were reached, the result was poor. Successful treatment was considered for results labelled as excellent and good in the included studies. Given this outcome was based primarily on pain measures, we included this under our intended primary outcome of pain relief at rest, on palpation and during physical activity (visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, and others).\n\n【149】#### Exercise therapy versus conventional physiotherapy\n\n【150】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【151】###### Pain relief at rest, on palpation and during physical activity\n\n【152】Hölmich 1999 reported 'successful treatment' at follow‐up at 16 weeks using an intention‐to‐treat analysis, which showed significantly better results in the exercise group (25/34 (74%) versus 10/34 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.37, P = 0.001) ( _see_ Analysis 1.1 ). This difference was not maintained at eight to 12 years follow‐up (21/24 versus 18/23; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.45, P = 0.41). As Hölmich 1999 used a per protocol analysis in this follow‐up, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to test the differences using an intention‐to‐treat analysis, where a poor outcome was assumed for the missing participants of both groups. This, likewise, showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.76, P = 0.46).\n\n【153】###### Function\n\n【154】Hölmich 1999 did not report this outcome.\n\n【155】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【156】###### Patients' subjective global assessment\n\n【157】In Hölmich 1999 , the participants were asked about their groin problems compared with their situation before the treatment. At the 16‐week follow‐up, all participants of the exercise therapy group reported that they were 'much better' or 'better', whereas only 27 out of 30 reported this in the physiotherapy group. The difference between the two groups for this outcome was not statistically significant either using a per protocol analysis (29/29 (100%) versus 27/30 (90%); RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.97, P = 0.13) ( _see_ Analysis 1.2 ) or a sensitivity analysis where it was assumed that all missing participants had a poor outcome (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.34, P = 0.53).\n\n【158】Though the results still tended to favour the exercise group, a similar lack of statistically significant differences between the two groups was found at long‐term follow‐up, either using a per protocol analysis (20/24 versus 16/23; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.66, P = 0.27) ( _see_ Analysis 1.2 ) or a sensitivity analysis (intention‐to‐treat analysis) where missing participants were assumed to have a poor outcome (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.97, P = 0.34).\n\n【159】###### Return to sports in the same level without pain\n\n【160】In Hölmich 1999 , the proportion of athletes who returned to sports at the same level without pain after 16 weeks was significantly higher in the exercise therapy group (23/29 (79%) versus 4/30 (13%); RR 5.95, 95% CI 2.34 to 15.09, P = 0.0002) ( _see_ Analysis 1.3 ). In the sensitivity analysis (intention‐to‐treat analysis where missing participants were assumed not to have returned to sports), the difference between groups remained statistically significantly in favour of the exercise therapy group (RR 5.75, 95% CI 2.23 to 14.86, P = 0.0003).\n\n【161】###### Adverse events\n\n【162】Hölmich 1999 did not report this outcome.\n\n【163】###### Uptake of treatment\n\n【164】Hölmich 1999 reported that the median number of treatments in terms of physiotherapy attendance was 15 in the exercise group and 14 in the physiotherapy group.\n\n【165】#### Multi‐modal therapy versus exercise therapy\n\n【166】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【167】###### Pain relief at rest, on palpation and during physical activity\n\n【168】Weir 2011 found no significant difference between the two groups in the achievement of 'successful treatment', see above definition (14/26 (54%) versus 12/22 (55%); RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.66, P = 0.96) ( _see_ Analysis 2.1 ). The same finding applied for a sensitivity (intention‐to‐treat) analysis where the three lost to follow‐up in each group were assumed to have had unsuccessful treatment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.71, P = 0.96).\n\n【169】Weir 2011 also reported the maximum pain during sports (visual analogue score, 0 to 100: worst pain) in the 25 participants who had returned to full sports participation. While favouring exercise therapy, the difference between the two groups for this subgroup was not statistically significant (MD 15.10, 95% CI ‐7.29 to 37.49, P = 0.19) ( _see_ Analysis 2.2 ).\n\n【170】###### Function\n\n【171】Weir 2011 did not report this outcome.\n\n【172】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【173】###### Patients' subjective global assessment\n\n【174】Weir 2011 did not report this outcome.\n\n【175】###### Return to sports in the same level without pain\n\n【176】Weir 2011 found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the numbers who returned to full sports participation (13/26 (50%) versus 12/22 (55%); RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.58, P = 0.75) ( Analysis 2.3 ). The same finding applied for a sensitivity analysis where the three in each group lost to follow‐up were assumed not to have returned to full sports participation (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.66, P = 0.82). However, the trial participants in the multi‐modal group who returned to full sports participation took significantly less time to do so than those in the exercise group (12.6 weeks versus 17.3 weeks; MD ‐4.5 weeks, 95% CI ‐8.60 to ‐0.40, P = 0.03) ( _see_ Analysis 2.4 ).\n\n【177】###### Adverse events\n\n【178】Weir 2011 reported that there were no complications or side effects found in either intervention group.\n\n【179】###### Uptake of treatment\n\n【180】Weir 2011 noted that in the multi‐model group, 11 athletes received one treatment and 15 received two treatments. In the exercise group, the mean number of sessions performed was 75% of the programme. They reported that there was no correlation between the dose of treatment and outcome in either group.\n\n【181】Discussion\n----------\n\n【182】### Summary of main results\n\n【183】The available evidence is limited to two small trials, each of which compared a different comparison. Together the two studies involved 122 participants who had experienced adductor‐related groin pain for at least two months. All participants were young male athletes, except for one female athlete.\n\n【184】Evidence from Hölmich 1999 (68 participants) showed that exercise therapy produced significantly better results at 16 weeks follow‐up than conventional physiotherapy consisting of passive modalities (stretching exercise, electrotherapy and transverse friction massage) for the outcomes of 'successful treatment' (based primarily on pain measures) and return to sports at the same level without groin pain. Although still favouring the exercise group, the differences between the two groups in patient's subjective global assessment and 'successful treatment' at eight to 12 years follow‐up were not statistically significant.\n\n【185】The second study (54 participants) found no significant differences at 16 weeks follow‐up between a multi‐modal treatment and exercise therapy for the outcomes of 'successful treatment' and return to full sports participation. For those returning to full sports participation, Weir 2011 found no significant difference in the maximum pain experienced at 16‐week follow‐up. However, athletes receiving multi‐modal treatment returned on average 4.5 weeks earlier than those treated by exercise therapy. Weir 2011 reported that there were no complications or side effects found in either intervention group.\n\n【186】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【187】When interpreting the findings of this review one should be aware of the characteristics of the participants, the types of interventions and the outcomes assessed. The participants were predominantly young male athletes; only one was female. Therefore the evidence found cannot be generalized for both genders because of their anatomical and physiological differences. The high prevalence of male participants was expected because groin pain is more common in sports practiced more by males than females, such as soccer and hockey ( Ekstrand 1999 ; Emery 1999 ; Paajanen 2011a ). The evidence is strengthened by the consistency between the two trials in the population, the exercise intervention and outcome assessment. However, 'successful treatment' as defined in these two trials is a crude and non‐validated measure for assessing outcome.\n\n【188】In clinical practice, physical therapists commonly treat patients with groin pain with the interventions used in the included studies. The studies did not use a single intervention but rather one therapeutic modality in combination with others. This approach is widely used for treating chronic musculoskeletal conditions. It is important to note that, despite the limited evidence, the exercise therapy based on strengthening and co‐ordination exercises appears to be more effective than a more passive treatment (stretching, electrotherapy and transverse friction massage) ( Hölmich 1999 ). Strengthening abdominal and hip muscles seems reasonable because muscular imbalance may contribute to functional instability of the pelvis and the groin region ( Cowan 2004 ).\n\n【189】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【190】Neither study was assessed as 'low risk of bias' in all domains. It is encouraging to note that both included studies ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2011 ) reported quite clearly the process of sequence generation and allocation concealment, and were thus classified as at low risk of selection bias. For the domains of detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias, there was insufficient information to judge the included studies, and so they were considered at 'unclear risk of bias'. Both studies were assessed as at high risk of performance bias because the nature of the interventions made blinding of participants and personnel impossible. Although this source of bias is unavoidable, it still should be recognized and reported. We judged the long‐term follow‐up outcomes for Hölmich 1999 at high risk of other bias because of the lack of information about the trial participants’ supplementary treatments and physical activity during this follow‐up period.\n\n【191】Both studies were small and the available evidence cannot be considered conclusive. While the results for Hölmich 1999 are strongly in favour of exercise compared with conventional physiotherapy for 'successful treatment', with a 79% return to sports at 16 weeks, Weir 2011 found only 55% in their exercise group had returned to full sports by 16 weeks. The imbalance between groups in the baseline incidence of bilateral groin pain in Hölmich 1999 favoured the exercise group and, as shown in Hölmich 1999 , is likely to have exaggerated the effect size. Weir 2011 reported a sample size calculation for the outcome 'time to return to sports without groin pain', requiring 21 athletes in each group. While Weir 2011 found a statistically significant earlier return in the multi‐modal therapy group (MD ‐4.5 weeks, 95% CI ‐8.60 to ‐0.40), this promising result only applies to the subgroup of 25 participants who had returned to sports.\n\n【192】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【193】This systematic review used an adequate search strategy with high sensitivity to avoid missing any randomized controlled trials on conservative treatments for patients with exercise‐related groin pain. There were also no language restrictions in our searches. It is still possible, however, that we have missed unpublished studies or those published in journals that are not listed in the various databases.\n\n【194】The change in the primary outcomes measures between the protocol and the review should be reported as a limitation of the review and a potential selective reporting bias. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on which outcomes should be evaluated for exercise‐related groin pain. When planning the primary outcomes in the protocol, we intended to approach the ideal and more common method of evaluating participants, but both included studies ( Hölmich 1999 ; Weir 2011 ) used different criteria. In the protocol of this review we defined pain as one of the primary outcomes, but both included studies assessed pain associated with another outcome (return to sports), resulting in the outcome 'successful treatment'. Accordingly, we decided to include 'successful treatment' (despite not being listed in the protocol) as a primary outcome in the review because pain was the main basis for categorising the patient outcome.\n\n【195】Another potential source of bias in the review was our approach to dealing with missing dichotomous data. Both included studies used a per protocol analysis to report some outcome measures, so we decided to do a sensitivity analysis through an intention‐to‐treat analysis by imputing the worst‐case outcomes for the missing participants. Although this approach might not reflect reality, we opted for the worst‐case scenario because the treatment is more likely to be successful if it works even when assuming the worst‐case scenario for those who dropped out of the study regardless of the reason.\n\n【196】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【197】We located two other reviews ( Jansen 2008b ; Machotka 2009 ) that focused on the treatment of patients with exercise‐related groin pain. Both pre‐date the publication of Weir 2011 .\n\n【198】Jansen 2008b investigated the evidence on all interventions (conservative or surgical) in the treatment of patients with longstanding groin pain. As well as covering a more extensive scope of interventions and patients, Jansen 2008b included non‐randomized studies. Its conclusion that exercise therapy should be the first choice of conservative treatment was based primarily on the results of the only identified randomized controlled trial ( Hölmich 1999 ).\n\n【199】Machotka 2009 focused on the evidence for exercise therapy and, similar to Jansen 2008b , included evidence from other study designs, such as case reports and case series. Machotka 2009 concluded that an exercise intervention focused on strengthening of hip and abdominal muscles can lead to favourable results for the return to sports; this again was based on the limited evidence from Hölmich 1999 .\n\n【200】Figures and Tables -\n\n【201】Figure 1\n\n【202】Flow diagram showing the reference screening and study selection.\n\n【203】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【204】Figures and Tables -\n\n【205】Figure 2\n\n【206】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【207】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【208】Figures and Tables -\n\n【209】Analysis 1.1\n\n【210】Comparison 1 Exercise therapy versus conventional physiotherapy, Outcome 1 'Successful treatment'.\n\n【211】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【212】Figures and Tables -\n\n【213】Analysis 1.2\n\n【214】Comparison 1 Exercise therapy versus conventional physiotherapy, Outcome 2 Patients' subjective global assessment (better or much better).\n\n【215】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【216】Figures and Tables -\n\n【217】Analysis 1.3\n\n【218】Comparison 1 Exercise therapy versus conventional physiotherapy, Outcome 3 Return to sports.\n\n【219】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【220】Figures and Tables -\n\n【221】Analysis 2.1\n\n【222】Comparison 2 Multi‐modal treatment versus exercise therapy, Outcome 1 'Successful treatment'.\n\n【223】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【224】Figures and Tables -\n\n【225】Analysis 2.2\n\n【226】Comparison 2 Multi‐modal treatment versus exercise therapy, Outcome 2 Maximum pain during sports.\n\n【227】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【228】Figures and Tables -\n\n【229】Analysis 2.3\n\n【230】Comparison 2 Multi‐modal treatment versus exercise therapy, Outcome 3 Return to sports.\n\n【231】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【232】Figures and Tables -\n\n【233】Analysis 2.4\n\n【234】Comparison 2 Multi‐modal treatment versus exercise therapy, Outcome 4 Time to return to sports (weeks).\n\n【235】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【236】Comparison 1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the clinical effects and safety of antipsychotic drugs in comparison with placebo or another antipsychotic drug in the treatment of people with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder with disturbance of thought, emotion and behaviour. The life‐time risk is about 1% world‐wide, and its onset is most commonly in early adulthood. The evidence from long‐term outcome studies suggests that while about half of those people with schizophrenia will remain chronically ill, the other half will recover fully or improve substantially after the initial acute illness ( Gaebel 2000 ). Ultimately, about half are able to live independently, while 10% remain chronically institutionalised. Nevertheless, schizophrenia has been estimated to be one of the thirty leading causes of disability worldwide. The financial cost of treatment in schizophrenia is high for both those with the illness and health services as it often requires hospitalisation ( Buchanan 2005 ).\n\n【7】The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an important dimension of psychopathology in schizophrenia, and reflect the absence or diminution of normal behaviours and functions. These include deficiencies in emotional responsiveness (blunted or flat affect), poverty of speech, poor rapport, emotional and social withdrawal, anhedonia, apathy, and avolition. Feelings of emotional numbness, difficulty in communicating with others, lack of motivation, inability to care about or cope with everyday tasks such as getting out of bed in the morning, washing and dressing are all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Such phenomena have been recognised as part of schizophrenia since early in the last century.  \nPersistent negative symptoms are held to account for much of the long‐term morbidity and poor functional outcome of people with schizophrenia ( Blanchard 2005 ; Ho 1998 ; Milev 2005 ), with studies demonstrating correlations between negative symptoms and impairments in occupational and social functioning in the community as well as a reduced likelihood of living independently ( Hofer 2005 ; Rosenheck 2006 ). But in this regard an important clinical distinction is between primary negative symptoms which constitute an enduring deficit state, predict poor prognosis and are stable over time, and secondary negative symptoms which are consequent upon positive psychotic symptoms, depression or demoralisation, or medication side effects (such as bradykinesia as part of drug‐induced parkinsonism). Secondary negative symptoms tend to be more common during acute psychotic episodes, and would be expected to respond to treatment of the underlying cause.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Today, within both hospital and community settings, antipsychotic medication remains the primary treatment for schizophrenia. There is well‐established evidence for their efficacy in both the treatment of acute psychotic episodes and relapse prevention over time ( Janicak 1993 ). However, despite this, considerable problems remain. A significant proportion (up to 40%) of people with schizophrenia have a poor response to first‐generation antipsychotic drugs, and continue to show moderate to severe psychotic symptoms, both positive and negative ( Kane 1996 ; Klein 1969 ). Around a half to three‐quarters of people with chronic schizophrenia objectively exhibit some negative symptoms ( Selten 2000 ), although the figure for persistent, primary negative symptoms is probably 15‐20% ( Buchanan 2007 ; Kirkpatrick 2006 ).\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】Although a number of different classes of drugs have antipsychotic activity, the primary pharmacological action of antipsychotic drugs is their antagonistic effect on the D2 dopamine receptors. Indeed, the potency of a drug's antipsychotic effect is, at least in part, determined by its affinity for the D2 receptor ( Agid 2007 ; Kapur 2001 ; Snyder 1974 ), an association that informed the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Various theories have been propounded for second‐generation (atypical) antipsychotics having superior benefit for negative symptoms, such as enhanced dopamine release in the mesocortical system and antagonist activity at 5HT <sub>2A </sub> receptors ( Meltzer 1991 ; Rao 1994 ). However, whether second‐generation actually have any therapeutic advantages over first‐generation antipsychotics at optimum dosage remains uncertain.\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Currently available treatments for negative symptoms have only modest benefits, with the result that negative symptoms continue to disproportionately limit patient recovery ( Buchanan 1996 ; Erhart 2006 ; Goff 1998 ). While treatment guidelines recommend a combination of pharmacological management with psychological and psychosocial interventions or psychiatric rehabilitation in order to optimise functional outcomes for those with schizophrenia, negative symptoms may render participation in such programmes more difficult to facilitate, and possibly less efficacious.\n\n【14】The proposed review will add to the evidence base for treating persistent negative symptoms in schizophrenia by providing some clarification of the impact of the currently available antipsychotic drugs on these features. The results will inform clinical practice, informing the risk‐benefit balance for a particular antipsychotic for an individual with schizophrenia who presents with persistent negative symptoms.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】To determine the clinical effects and safety of antipsychotic drugs in comparison with placebo or another antipsychotic drug in the treatment of people with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia and schizophrenia‐like psychosis.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】We considered all relevant randomised controlled trials greater than 4 weeks in duration. We excluded very small trials (less than 10 participants per arm) and quasi‐randomised studies, such as those allocating by using alternate days of the week. Where trials were described as 'double‐blind', but it was implied that the study was randomised and where the demographic details of each group's participants were similar, we included the trials and undertook a sensitivity analysis to the presence or absence of these data. Randomised cross‐over studies will be eligible but only data up to the point of first cross‐over because of the likely carry‐over effects of all treatments ( Elbourne 2002 ). Trials that examined the augmentation of an antipsychotic with a second antipsychotic or another class of drug (such as anticonvulsants, mood stabilisers, anticholinergics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines) were included, but analysed separately.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】Adults (18+ years) with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), irrespective of the diagnostic criteria used, ethnicity and sex. There is no clear evidence that the schizophrenia‐like psychoses are caused by fundamentally different disease processes or require different treatment approaches ( Carpenter 1994 ). Where a study described the participant group as suffering from 'serious mental illnesses' and did not give a particular diagnostic grouping, these trials were included. The exception to this rule was when the majority of those randomised clearly did not have a functional non‐affective psychotic illness.\n\n【23】Persistent negative symptoms were defined as the presence of negative symptoms despite adequate antipsychotic treatment, as judged by the investigators in each study, and assessed using a specific rating scale with established reliability and validity, such as the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS: Kay 1986 ) or the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS: Andreasen 1983 ).\n\n【24】Persistent negative symptoms were used as the inclusion criterion rather than primary negative symptoms, as the former are the clinically‐relevant target, and the latter term represents a hypothesis about aetiology (i.e. they are not manifestations of depressive symptoms, antipsychotic side effects such as bradykinesia, or positive symptoms, and therefore secondary negative symptoms) that cannot be definitively determined on cross‐sectional assessment.\n\n【25】#### Types of interventions\n\n【26】1\\. Amisulpride: any oral form of application, any dose.\n\n【27】2\\. Aripiprazole: any oral form of application, any dose.\n\n【28】3\\. Asenapine: any oral form of application, any dose.\n\n【29】4\\.

Placebo.\n\n【40】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【41】We grouped outcomes into short term (up to 12 weeks), medium term (13‐26 weeks) and long term (over 26 weeks).\n\n【42】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【43】1\\. Mental state: Average endpoint or change in negative symptom score (by long term)\n\n【44】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【45】1\\.

Reference searching  \nWe examined the reference lists of all retrieved articles, clinical guidelines, and previous reviews of schizophrenia for additional trials.\n\n【64】2\\. Personal contact  \nWe contacted the authors of significant papers identified from trials and review articles found in the search and asked for their knowledge of other studies, published or unpublished, relevant to the review. We also contacted other experts in the field for similar information.\n\n【65】3\\. Drug companies  \nWe contacted the pharmaceutical company that manufactures each of the antipsychotic drugs and asked them to provide relevant published and unpublished data.\n\n【66】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【67】#### Selection of studies\n\n【68】Two review authors (CW, TB) independently inspected citations identified from the search. We identified potentially relevant reports and ordered full papers for reassessment. Retrieved articles were assessed independently by the two review authors for inclusion according to the previously defined inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus discussions with the third member of the review team. If it was impossible to resolve disagreements these studies were added to those awaiting assessment and the authors of the papers contacted for clarification. Non‐concurrence in trial selection was reported.\n\n【69】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【70】1\\. Extraction  \nTwo review authors (CW, TB) independently extracted data from included studies. Again, any disagreement was discussed with the third member of the review team, decisions documented and, if necessary, authors of studies were contacted for clarification.\n\n【71】2\\. Management  \nData were extracted into standard, paper or electronic forms.\n\n【72】3\\. Scale‐derived data  \nWe included continuous data from rating scales only if: (a) the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument had been described in a peer‐reviewed journal ( Marshall 2000 ); (b) the measuring instrument was not written or modified by one of the trialists; (c) the measuring instrument is either (i) a self‐report or (ii) completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).\n\n【73】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【74】Two review authors (CW, TB) independently assessed risk of bias in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration’s tools for assessing quality and risk of bias ( Higgins 2008 ). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases.\n\n【75】The risk of bias in each domain and overall were assessed and categorised into:  \nA. Low risk of bias: plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results (categorised as 'Yes' in Risk of Bias table)  \nB. High risk of bias: plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results (categorised as 'No' in Risk of Bias table)  \nC. Unclear risk of bias: plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results (categorised as 'Unclear' in Risk of Bias table)\n\n【76】We did not included trials with high risk of bias (defined as at least 3 out of 5 domains were categorised as 'No') in the meta‐analysis. If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus with the involvement of another member of the review group. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials are provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to obtain further information. Non‐concurrence in quality assessment was reported.\n\n【77】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【78】1\\. Dichotomous data.  \nWhere possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data. This could be done by identifying cutoff points on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It was generally assumed that if there had been a 50% reduction in a scale‐derived score such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall 1962 ) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, Kay 1986 ), this could be considered as a clinically significant response ( Leucht 2005a , Leucht 2005b ). If data based on these thresholds were not available, we used the primary cut‐off presented by the original authors.\n\n【79】We calculated the relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the random‐effects model, as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. It has been shown that RR is more intuitive ( Boissel 1999 ) than odds ratios and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians ( Deeks 2000 ). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. When the overall results were significant we calculated the number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to induce harm (NNTH) as the inverse of the risk difference.\n\n【80】2\\. Continuous data.  \n2.1 Summary statistic  \nFor continuous outcomes we estimated a Mean Difference (MD) between groups (or where necessary, a Standardised Mean Difference \\[SMD\\]). Summary effects were based on the random‐effects model as this takes into account any differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity.\n\n【81】2.2 Endpoint versus change data  \nSince there is no principal statistical reason why endpoint and change data should measure different effects ( Higgins 2008 ), we used scale endpoint data which is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. If endpoint data were not available, we used change scores.\n\n【82】2.3 Skewed data  \nContinuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non‐parametric data, we applied the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, ( Altman 1996 ); (c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD>(S‐S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.\n\n【83】2.4 Data synthesis  \nWhen standard errors instead of standard deviations were presented, the former were converted to standard deviations. If standard deviations were not reported and could not be calculated from available data, authors were asked to supply the data. In the absence of data from authors, the mean standard deviation from other studies were used.\n\n【84】2.5 Multiple doses  \nShould a study investigate a number of fixed doses of antipsychotic medication, we used the method described in section 16.5 of the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2008 ) to combine data from multiple groups.\n\n【85】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【86】1\\. Cluster trials  \nStudies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error ( Divine 1992 ) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This can lead to type I error or false positive ( Bland 1997 , Gulliford 1999 ).\n\n【87】Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (\\*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods ( Gulliford 1999 ). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we also presented these data as if from a non‐cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.\n\n【88】Binary data as presented in a report were divided by a 'design effect'. This was calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) \\[Design effect=1+(m‐1)\\*ICC\\] ( Donner 2002 ). If the ICC was not reported, it was assumed to be 0.1 ( Ukoumunne 1999 ). This assumption may be too high and, should this instance occur, we had planned to see if taking an ICC of 0.01 would make any substantive difference for the primary outcome. If it had not we would have used 0.01 in preference across outcomes.\n\n【89】If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, we synthesised these with other studies using the generic inverse variance technique.\n\n【90】2\\. Cross‐over trials  \nA major concern of cross‐over trials is the carry‐over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash‐out phase. For the same reason cross‐over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable ( Elbourne 2002 ). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we will only use data of the first phase of cross‐over studies.\n\n【91】3\\. Studies with multiple treatment groups  \nWhere a study involved more than two treatment groups, if relevant, the additional treatment groups were presented in additional relevant comparisons using methods described in section 16.5 of the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2008 ) to avoid unit‐of‐analysis errors. Where the additional treatment groups were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.\n\n【92】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【93】1\\. Overall loss of credibility  \nAt some degree of loss of follow‐up data must lose credibility ( Xia 2007 ). We are forced to make a judgment where this is for the short‐term trials likely to be included in this review. Should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.\n\n【94】2\\. Binary  \nIn the case where attrition for a binary outcome is between 0 and 50% and outcomes of these people are described, we included these data as reported. Where these data were not clearly described, data were presented on a 'once‐randomised always‐analyse' basis, assuming an intention to treat analysis. Those lost to follow‐up were all assumed to have a negative outcome, with the exception of the outcome of death. For example, for the outcome of relapse, those who were lost to follow‐up all relapsed.\n\n【95】3\\. Continuous  \nIn the case where attrition for a continuous outcome is between 0 and 50% and completer‐only data were reported, we have reproduced these.\n\n【96】4\\. Intention‐to‐treat (ITT)  \nIntention‐to‐treat (ITT) was used when available. We anticipated that in some studies, in order to do an ITT analysis, the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report. As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results. Therefore, where LOCF data have been used in the analysis, it was indicated in the review.\n\n【97】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【98】1\\. Clinical heterogeneity  \nWe considered all included studies hoping to use all studies together. Should clear unforeseen issues have been apparent that may add obvious clinical heterogeneity, we noted these issues, considered them in analyses and undertook sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome.\n\n【99】2\\. Statistical  \n2.1 Visual inspection  \nWe visually inspected graphs to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity.\n\n【100】2.2 Employing the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic  \nHeterogeneity between studies was investigated by considering the I <sup>2 </sup> method alongside the chi <sup>2 </sup> P value. The I <sup>2 </sup> provides an estimate of the percentage of inconsistency thought to be due to chance ( Higgins 2003 ). The importance of the observed value of I <sup>2 </sup> depends on i. magnitude and direction of effects and ii. strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from chi <sup>2 </sup> test, or a confidence interval for I <sup>2 </sup> ).\n\n【101】I <sup>2 </sup> estimate greater than or equal to 50% accompanied by a statistically significant chi <sup>2 </sup> statistic, was interpreted as evidence of substantial levels of heterogeneity (Section 9.5.2 ‐ Higgins 2008 ) and reasons for heterogeneity were explored. If the inconsistency was high and the clear reasons were found, data were presented separately.\n\n【102】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【103】Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results ( Egger 1997 ). These are described in section 10.1 of the Cochrane Handbook ( Higgins 2008 ). We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating small‐study effects but are of limited power to detect such effects when there are few studies. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.\n\n【104】#### Data synthesis\n\n【105】Where possible we employed a random‐effects model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random‐effects models. The random‐effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random‐effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies ‐ those trials that are most vulnerable to bias.\n\n【106】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【107】If data are clearly heterogeneous we checked that data are correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit‐of‐analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained we did not undertake a meta‐analysis at this point for if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We would want to explore heterogeneity. We pre‐specifed no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity, except quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods, we continued to investigate for other reasons for the heterogeneity. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted ‐ but plausible causes of heterogeneity ‐ these post‐hoc reasons were discussed, the sensitivity of the estimate of effect size for the primary outcome to inclusion and exclusion of these causes investigated and data analysed and presented. However, should the heterogeneity be substantially unaffected by any investigation and no reasons for the heterogeneity being clear, the final data were presented without a meta‐analysis.\n\n【108】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【109】We planned sensitivity analyses a priori for examining the change in the robustness of the sensitivity to including studies with implied randomisation (see Criteria for considering studies for this review : Types of studies), skewed and non‐skewed data, inappropriate comparator doses of drug and different clinical groups). If inclusion of studies with implied randomisation made no substantive difference to the primary outcome they were left in the final analyses. For outcomes with both skewed data and non‐skewed data, we investigated the effect of combining all data together and if no substantive difference was noted then the potentially skewed data were left in the analyses. A recent review showed that some of the comparisons of antipsychotics may have been biased by using inappropriate comparator dose ranges ( Heres 2006 ). The inappropriate dose ranges were defined as the ranges not within the range recommended in the American Psychiatric Association Practice Guideline for the treatment of patients with Schizophrenia (or alternatively the British National Formulary, 57): 50‐300 mg/day of amisulpride, 10‐30 mg/day of aripiprazole, 0.25‐1.5 mg/day of benperidol, 300‐1000 mg/day of chlorpromazine hydrochloride, 150‐600 mg/day of clozapine (maximum 900 in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia), 6‐18 mg/day of flupentixol (flupenthixol), 5‐20 mg/day of fluphenazine hydrochloride, 5‐20 mg/day of haloperidol (maximum 30 mg/day in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia), 25‐50 mg/day (bed patients initially 100‐200 mg; increased if necessary to 1 g daily) of levomepromazine (methotrimeprazine), 30‐100 mg/day of loxapine, 150‐400 mg/day of mesoridazine, 30‐100 mg/day of molindone, 10‐30 mg/day of olanzapine, 3‐12 mg/day of paliperidone, 75‐300 mg/day of pericyazine, 16‐64 mg/day of perphenazine, 2‐20 mg/day of pimozide, 75‐100 mg/day of prochlorperazine, 400‐800 mg/day of promazine hydrochloride, 300‐800 mg/day of quetiapine, 2‐8 mg/day of risperidone, 12‐24 mg/day of sertindole, 400‐800 mg/day of sulpiride, 15‐50 mg/day of thiothixene, 300‐800 mg/day of thioridazine, 15‐50 mg/day of trifluoperazine, 120‐200 mg/day of ziprasidone, 75‐300 mg/day of zotepine, 20‐150 mg/day of zuclopenthixol. If inclusion of studies with inappropriate doses of control drugs made no substantive difference to the primary outcome and outcomes relevant to adverse effects they were left in the final analyses. We recognise that we may not have considered some clinical causes for heterogeneity that become more obvious after seeing the data. The sensitivity of the primary outcome of including or removing groups of trials with distinct clinical groups will be investigated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We did not use any date or language restrictions in our electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 August 2018.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pars plana vitrectomy combined with scleral buckle versus pars plana vitrectomy alone for giant retinal tear regardless of age, gender, lens status (e.g. phakic or pseudophakic eyes) of the affected eye(s), or etiology of GRT among participants enrolled in these trials.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full‐text articles, using Covidence. Any differences in classification between the two review authors were resolved through discussion. Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included trials.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We found two RCTs in abstract format (105 participants randomized). Neither RCT was published in full. Based on the data presented in the abstracts, scleral buckling might be beneficial (relative risk of re‐attachement ranged from 3.0 to 4.4), but the findings are inconclusive due to a lack of peer reviewed publication and insufficient information for assessing risk of bias.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】We found no conclusive evidence from RCTs on which to base clinical recommendations for scleral buckle combined with pars plana vitrectomy for giant retinal tear. RCTs are clearly needed to address this evidence gap. Such trials should be randomized, and patients should be classified by giant retinal tear characteristics (extension (90º, 90º to 180º, > 180º), location (oral, anterior, posterior to equator)), proliferative vitreoretinopathy stage, and endotamponade. Analysis should include both short‐term (three months and six months) and long‐term (one year to two years) outcomes for primary retinal reattachment, mean change in best corrected visual acuity, study eyes that required second surgery for retinal reattachment, and adverse events such as elevation of intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg, choroidal detachment, cystoid macular edema, macular pucker, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and progression of cataract in initially phakic eyes.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (11)\n\n【20】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Giant Retinal Tear\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【22】*   Scleral Buckle\n*   Pars Plana Virectomy\n\n【23】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【24】*   Scleral Buckle\n\n【25】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【26】*   Retinal Detachment\n*   Reattachment Of Choroid And Retina\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

The retina partially lines the vitreous body, a jelly‐like fluid inside the eye. A giant retinal tear occurs when the vitreous body detaches from the retina (known as a retinal detachment) and creates a hole (retinal tear) of a certain size. For people who suffer retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear, vitrectomy is usually indicated right away to prevent permanent vision loss. Vitrectomy is a type of eye surgery in which a doctor removes the vitreous and replace it with another solution.\n\n【36】For people with retinal detachment who are subjected to vitrectomy, this procedure can be combined with scleral buckling. Scleral buckling is a procedure to repair a retinal detachment in which a doctor attaches a piece of silicone or a sponge onto the white of the eye (scleral). Using scleral buckling may assist attachment of the retina.\n\n【37】**What are the main results of the review?**  \nCochrane researchers searched for all relevant studies to answer this question and found only two conference abstracts, neither of which was published in full. Cochrane researchers also reached out to the investigators of these two studies but did not receive additional information.\n\n【38】People affected by giant retinal tears and retinal surgeons treating them need evidence to show whether it is useful to combine scleral buckle with vitrectomy. They need more information about the surgical procedure associated with a higher rate of retinal reattachment and reduced surgical risk. Future studies need to obtain information on outcomes for people affected by this condition, such as eye and systemic medical history, eye and retinal tear findings, vision gained from surgery, and adverse events associated with surgery.\n\n【39】**How up‐to‐date is this review?**  \nCochrane researchers searched for studies published up to 16 August 2018.\n\n【40】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【41】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We will examine whether the delivery of a medication review by a physician, pharmacist or other health care professional improves the health outcomes of hospitalized patients compared to standard care. In addition we will examine differences in effect between different types of medication reviews compared to standard care.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】It is a well‐established fact that the population in most parts of the world live longer and thereby have an increased risk of chronic medical conditions ( Christensen 2009 ; \\[no author\\] 2006 ). The risk of adverse drug events is considerably higher in elderly patients ( Kongkaew 2008 ; Hallas 1996 ). Notably, the risk of drug side effects and interactions are amplified in the elderly patient by the age‐related biological changes that affect the drugs pharmacokinetics and ‐dynamics e.g. decreases in liver and kidney function, changes in drug absorption and the body's sensitivity to certain drugs ( Mangoni 2004 ). Even so the older medical patients are often prescribed several drugs; and there is ample literature about polypharmacy in the elderly, a term that has been used to describe the use of many drugs as well as the use of too many drugs ( Aronson 2006 ; Hajjar 2007 ).\n\n【6】Evidence correlates an increasing number of drugs used by a given patient not only to increased risk for drug interactions and adverse effects, but also to poorer compliance, a greater economic burden, hospital admissions and even drug‐related deaths ( Routledge 2004 ; Schneeweiss 2002 ; Classen 1997 ; Ebbesen 2001 ). While polypharmacy often is appropriate e.g. in treatment of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic pain, inappropriate polypharmacy implies unfavorable health and economic consequences ( Spinewine 2007 ; Page 2010 ). Thus, substantial efforts have been made to characterize and improve the multifaceted issue, appropriateness of prescribing in elderly ( Spinewine 2007 ).\n\n【7】A key element in the attempts to improve quality of prescribing and preventing adverse drug events is the concept of medication review. While no generally accepted definition of medication review exists, it can be defined as a systematic assessment of a patient's records that aims to evaluate and optimize patient medication by a change in prescription either by a recommendation or by a direct change. This could also include the process of medication reconciliation i.e. identifying the most accurate list of medications a patient is taking and using that list to provide correct medication especially during transitions in care ( Joint Commission 2009 ; Rogers 2006 ; Steurbaut 2010 ).To aid the process of reviewing patient medication several criteria have been formulated to identify potentially inappropriate medications especially in elderly people ( Beers 1991 ; Hanlon 1992 ; Beers 1997 ; Samsa 1994 ; McLeod 1997 ; Naugler 2000 ; Fick 2003 ; Laroche 2007a ; Gallagher 2008a ). However, the applicability and effects in clinical practice for these various measures remains uncertain ( Spinewine 2007 ; Bregnhoj 2009 ; Gallagher 2008b ; Ryan 2009 ; Lund 2010 ).\n\n【8】Randomised trials of medication reviews have been summarised in recent systematic reviews ( Royal 2006 ; Holland 2008 ; Nkansah 2010 ). These trials often involved pharmacists and ranged from 'hands‐on' clinical evaluation of hospital inpatient medication to informational approaches to outpatients or primary care physicians performed by community pharmacists or other health care professionals ( Royal 2006 ; Holland 2008 ; Nkansah 2010 ). The studies of medications reviews mostly included elderly people in primary care and failed to show an effect on morbidity or mortality ( Royal 2006 ; Holland 2008 ; Nkansah 2010 ). It is important to note that some of the pharmacist‐led medication reviews may be restricted because they are not directly linked to changes in clinical care ( Spinewine 2007 ). Physicians do not always implement pharmacists suggestions ( Mannheimer 2006 ; Chen 2007 ; Spinewine 2007 ), and older patients may be reluctant to accept pharmacist suggestions ( Salter 2007 ) or may prefer to have their medications reviewed by a physician ( Jones 1997 ). However, there is some evidence that inpatient medication reviews by pharmacists in close contact with physicians might lead to fever readmissions and lower morbidity ( Gillespie 2009 ). Even though hospitalized patients might represent a frailer patient group compared to primary care patients ( Laroche 2007b ), systematic reviews of medication reviews have not yet focused on this patient group. As the hospital setting could differ in many ways from the more heterogeneous outpatient setting this review will focus on hospitalized patients.\n\n【9】### Description of the condition\n\n【10】Inappropriate prescription of drugs, where prescriptions are prescribed without continued indication, with incorrect dosage, or in combination with certain patient conditions or other drugs which increase the risk of adverse effects, is a major cause of morbidity and possibly mortality.\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】Any medication review of a patient's prescribed medication delivered by a healthcare professional with the aim of improving the health of the patient (i.e. optimizing efficacy of current medication, minimizing side effects, minimizing harms\n\n【13】### How the intervention might work\n\n【14】More appropriate prescribing could reduce adverse drug events, improve adherence and correctness of drug therapy (i.e. proper indication, drug and patient), thereby decreasing patient morbidity and mortality.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】Scientific evidence is currently lacking that medication reviews are effective in reducing patient morbidity and mortality for hospitalized patients. In addition, the optimal method for medication review is at present unsubstantiated. Through an analysis of the collective scientific evidence in randomized clinical trials, we will clarify whether medication review can reduce mortality, hospitalization or adverse events of medical patients. We will also examine whether some methods for medication reviews are more favorable than others. Based on the results of this systematic review of present research, an optimization of the current practice in this complex and important area could be encouraged. Also, future scientific studies could be pointed in a more favorable direction.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】We will examine whether the delivery of a medication review by a physician, pharmacist or other health care professional improves the health outcomes of hospitalized patients compared to standard care. In addition we will examine differences in effect between different types of medication reviews compared to standard care.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【21】#### Types of studies\n\n【22】We will include randomized clinical trials (RCTs), in any language, published or unpublished; and trials with randomization on an individual level or on an aggregated level (i.e. cluster RCTs).\n\n【23】#### Types of participants\n\n【24】Hospitalized patients.\n\n【25】_Exclude_\n\n【26】Outpatients or patients seen at emergency department who are not admitted to the hospital.\n\n【27】Patients hospitalized at pediatric departments.\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】Any medication review of a patient's prescribed medication delivered by a healthcare professional with the aim of improving the health of the patient (i.e. optimizing efficacy of current medication, minimizing side effects, minimizing harms). We define medication review as any systematic assessment of a patient's records that aims to evaluate and optimize patient medication by a change in prescription either by a recommendation or by a direct change. We will include studies comparing medication review to usual care or two or more types of medication reviews.\n\n【30】_Exclude_\n\n【31】Studies aimed solely at increasing the patients knowledge about current medication, improving compliance or reducing costs.\n\n【32】Studies where the results of medication review were to be implemented after discharge (e.g. letter to patient's general practitioner).\n\n【33】Studies only reviewing parts of a patient's medication related to a specific condition or a single class of drugs (e.g. only dealing with diabetes or heart failure medication).\n\n【34】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【35】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【36】1.  Mortality (all causes)\n    \n\n【37】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【38】1.  Hospital re‐admission (all causes)\n    \n2.  Hospital re‐admission (due to drug‐related adverse events)\n    \n3.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this review is to assess the impact of enteral and total parenteral nutrition on clinically important outcomes in critically ill children. There are two primary hypotheses:  \n1\\. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally or parenterally is different compared to children who are given no nutrition;  \n2\\. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally is different compared to children fed parenterally.\n\n【3】If data are available, we will conduct subgroup analyses to examine whether the treatment effect is altered by:  \na. age (infants less than one year versus children greater than or equal to one year);  \nb. type of patient (medical (purpose of admission to ICU is for medical illness without surgical intervention immediately prior to admission) versus surgical (purpose of admission to ICU is for postoperative care)).\n\n【4】If there are other clinical trials that examine nutrition more distinctly, the following secondary hypotheses will also be examined:  \n3\\. the mortality rate is different in children who are given enteral nutrition alone versus enteral and parenteral combined;  \n4\\. the mortality rate is different in children who are given both enteral feeds and parenteral nutrition versus no nutrition.\n\n【5】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】**_Theoretical considerations_**\n\n【8】Feeding in the critically ill child has not been extensively investigated and remains a controversial topic within paediatric intensive care. There are no clear guidelines as to the best form or timing of nutrition in critically ill infants and children. The balance between relative starvation of children with its harmful effects on muscle strength, wound healing, and immune function must be weighed against the harmful effects associated with intravenous nutrition and overfeeding which occurred in older studies ( Cerra 1980 ). Children have increased energy requirements per kilogram of body weight and decreased energy reserves compared to adults, and critical illness disrupts normal metabolic demands by increasing the risk of cell death and impairing growth ( Dimand 1999 ). Current nutritional goals include minimizing the effects of an increased metabolic rate and subsequent energy depletion but not to the extent where overfeeding may worsen the clinical situation ( Zaloga 1994 ). The Recommended Nutrient Intake goals are not appropriate for critically ill children since those goals were designed for healthy children and do not take into account differences in activity, growth, and the changes in metabolism related to critical illness ( Dimand 1999 ). Critical illness often results in abnormal metabolism at several different levels within the human cell ( Fink 2001 ; Hotchkiss 2003 ; Mizock 1984 ). Each of these mechanisms makes it difficult to predict food requirements in critically ill children ( Dimand 1999 ). Patients with critical illness and a very high metabolic rate can be markedly catabolic, meaning they can digest their own muscle protein to create more energy, resulting in weight loss and a poor outcome ( Cerra 1980 ; Joffe 2001 ). Although it seems intuitive that providing nutrition will always be of benefit and malnutrition is harmful, it does not necessarily follow that feeding can improve a patient's outcome ( Heyland 1998 ; Joffe 2001 ; Klein 1997 ; Koretz 1995 ).\n\n【9】**_Paediatric experience_**\n\n【10】Children with critical illness are not capable of normal growth and therefore it is unrealistic, and potentially harmful, to try to promote growth in these patients ( Chwals 1994 ). Predicting the food requirements in any patient is difficult and recent studies show that the energy used at rest in critically ill children is significantly less than the predicted energy requirement ( Briassoulis 2000 ; White 2000 ). Attempts to provide enough nutrition can place the patient at risk of overfeeding and increased carbon dioxide production (which can contribute to ventilatory compromise), abnormal fat production and subsequent liver dysfunction ( Chwals 1994 ; Zaloga 1994 ). Ideally nutrition should be targeted to support basal metabolic requirements, prevent autodigestion of protein, and not to promote growth. Traditionally, enteral or gut feeding via a naso‐gastric or more recently, naso‐jejunal tube has been promoted within 48 to 72 hours of admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), depending on the nature and severity of the presenting illness. In those patients in whom enteral nutrition is often delayed because of unstable heart rate or blood pressure, parenteral or intravenous nutrition (TPN) has been instituted days to weeks after admission. There are very few studies examining this practice and controversy still exists as to whether either mode of nutrition is superior in children, and at what point nutrition is necessary to minimize further morbidity. Critically ill children are often fluid restricted and are therefore limited in the volume of nutrition which can be provided; this often delays feeding, especially in young infants. Whether this delay harms has yet to be determined.  \n  \n**_Adult experience_**\n\n【11】Feeding in adult critical care patients is also controversial, but somewhat better studied in terms of general guidelines. Gut barrier dysfunction is thought to be a major contributor to the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( Doig 1998 ), the most common cause of death in the intensive care unit ( Marshall 1996 ). Enteral nutrition may be superior to TPN based on the surrogate outcomes of gut barrier function and infectious complications ( Hadfield 1995 ; Moore 1992 ). Furthermore, parenteral nutrition has been associated with increased complications compared with enteral nutrition in adult patients with abdominal trauma ( Lipman 1998 ). Total parenteral nutrition enhances the body's response to certain toxins ( Fong 1989 ), and when compared to intravenous fluid infusion, TPN increased mortality in the severely ill adult patient in a recent meta‐analysis ( Heyland 1998 ). Although information from the above studies and several adult meta‐analyses regarding feeding is helpful, we cannot extrapolate that information directly to children since they adapt differently to critical illness.\n\n【12】Objectives\n----------\n\n【13】The objective of this review is to assess the impact of enteral and total parenteral nutrition on clinically important outcomes in critically ill children. There are two primary hypotheses:  \n1\\. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally or parenterally is different compared to children who are given no nutrition;  \n2\\. the mortality rate of critically ill children fed enterally is different compared to children fed parenterally.\n\n【14】If data are available, we will conduct subgroup analyses to examine whether the treatment effect is altered by:  \na. age (infants less than one year versus children greater than or equal to one year);  \nb. type of patient (medical (purpose of admission to ICU is for medical illness without surgical intervention immediately prior to admission) versus surgical (purpose of admission to ICU is for postoperative care)).\n\n【15】If there are other clinical trials that examine nutrition more distinctly, the following secondary hypotheses will also be examined:  \n3\\. the mortality rate is different in children who are given enteral nutrition alone versus enteral and parenteral combined;  \n4\\. the mortality rate is different in children who are given both enteral feeds and parenteral nutrition versus no nutrition.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), (completed or ongoing).\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】We will include trials of paediatric patients aged 1 day to 18 years of age that are cared for in a paediatric intensive care setting and who receive nutrition within the first seven days of admission. We will include studies involving both paediatric and adult participants if data are available for paediatric cases. We will analyse those patients aged less than one year separately from those older than one year if such data are available, given that infants are believed to have higher nutritional requirements compared to older children. Furthermore, medical patients are often studied separately from surgical critical patients. If there are no studies that differentiate medical from surgical patients, we will not consider these groups separately in the analysis.\n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】Patients must be randomized to receive either:\n\n【24】1.  enteral feeding versus no feeding;\n    \n2.  total parenteral nutrition versus no feeding;\n    \n3.  enteral versus total parenteral nutrition;\n    \n4.  enteral versus enteral with supplemental parenteral nutrition.\n    \n\n【25】Other areas of paediatric nutrition, such as immediate versus delayed feeding and immunonutrition versus normal nutrition, will not be addressed in this review.\n\n【26】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【27】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【28】30‐day mortality; if this is not available PICU mortality will be used.\n\n【29】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【30】1.  length of stay in the PICU;\n    \n2.  length of stay in hospital;\n    \n3.  number of days on ventilator;\n    \n4.  morbid complications including nosocomial infections.\n    \n\n【31】We will not consider nutritional outcomes, quality of life assessments, or economic implications.\n\n【32】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【33】#### Electronic searches\n\n【34】We will search the following bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (current issue of _The Cochrane Libra_ ry), OVID MEDLINE (1966 to present), OVID EMBASE (1988 to present), OVID All Evidence Based Medicine Reviews (includes Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, and CCTR), ISI Web of Science ‐ Science Citation Index Expanded (1965 to present), WebSPIRS Biological Abstracts (1969 to present) and WebSPIRS CAB Abstracts (1972 to present)) and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, CenterWatch Clinical Trials Listing Service, Current Controlled Trials, GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trial Register, National Clinical Trials Registry and the National Research Register; all found at: http://www.ualberta.ca/ARCHE/litsearch.html#trials ).\n\n【35】The MEDLINE search strategy (1966 to June 2003, Week One) is available in Appendix 1 . We will modify this strategy as necessary for the other databases.\n\n【36】#### Searching other resources\n\n【37】We will review reference lists of all selected articles, handsearch relevant conference proceedings (the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition), and contact primary authors, experts in the area, and manufacturers of enteral nutrition products _._\n\n【38】We will not limit the search by language or publication status.\n\n【39】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【40】#### Study selection\n\n【41】The selection of studies will involve two steps. First, two authors will independently screen the results from searching to identify citations with potential relevance (AJ, NA). Second, we will obtain the full text of selected articles. Two authors will independently decide on trial inclusion using a standard form with predetermined eligibility criteria (AJ, NA). We will resolve any disagreements through discussion with a third author (LL).\n\n【42】#### Assessment of quality\n\n【43】Two authors will independently assess the methodological quality of all included studies using the Jadad 5‐point scale ( Jadad 1996 ) (NA, LH). The Jadad scale is the only quality assessment tool, to the best of our knowledge, that has been validated and it incorporates components that are directly related to the control of bias including randomization (0 to 2 points), double blinding (0 to 2 points), and reporting of withdrawals and dropouts (0 to 1 point). We will provide overall quality scores according to the Jadad scale. In addition, we will describe and display the quality information by individual components (ie generation of random sequence, blinding, loss to follow‐up, and allocation concealment ( Schulz 1995 )) which will be classified as adequate, inadequate, unclear or not used. We will examine the effect of methodological quality through sensitivity analyses as described below under \"Data Analysis\". In addition, we will record whether or not the studies used an intention‐to‐treat analysis, as well as the funding source. We will resolve differences through discussion with a third party (BV).\n\n【44】#### Data extraction\n\n【45】Two authors will extract data from each study (NA, LL, or BV) and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion and by referring to the original paper. We will request unpublished data from authors when necessary. We will use a standard form that will describe the following: characteristics of the study (design, method of randomization, withdrawals or dropouts); participants (age, gender); intervention (type, dose, route of administration, timing and duration of therapy, co‐interventions); control (agent and dose); outcomes (types of outcome measures, timing of outcomes, adverse effects); and results. We will request additional data from study authors as required.\n\n【46】#### Data analysis\n\n【47】We will conduct separate analyses for the four comparisons: enteral feeding versus standard care; total parenteral nutrition versus standard care; enteral versus total parenteral nutrition; and enteral versus enteral with supplemental parenteral nutrition. We will express dichotomous data (for example, mortality) as a relative risk and we will calculate an overall relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. We will likely express complications as risk differences due to low event risks. We will derive the number needed to treat for dichotomous data to help clarify the degree of benefit for a range of baseline risks. We will convert continuous data to the mean difference and we will calculate an overall weighted mean difference (with 95% confidence intervals). We will summarize time to event data (for example, length of stay in hospital, number of days on a ventilator) by the log hazards ratio ( Parmar 1998 ) and we will calculate an overall log hazards ratio. If this is not possible due to insufficient reporting of individual cases in the RCTs, then we will treat survival data as continuous data.\n\n【48】We will calculate results using random effects models. We will quantify heterogeneity using the I‐squared statistic ( Higgins 2002 ). The I‐squared statistic estimates the percent variability due to between study differences. If a sufficient number of trials are included in the study, we will assess possible sources of heterogeneity with either subgroup or sensitivity analyses or both. We will examine the following clinical subgroups: age (infants less than one year, children greater than or equal to one year); and surgical patients (purpose of admission to PICU is for postoperative care) versus medical patients (purpose of admission to PICU is for medical illness without surgical intervention prior to admission). The age subgroup is based on the fact that infants are at higher risk of catabolism and are generally fed more aggressively than older children. The subgroup based on surgical versus medical patients is based on inherent differences between these populations and the precedence in the literature to examine these populations separately ( Heyland 1998 ; Heyland 2001 ; Marik 2001 ). If a study does not provide the data or results by age, or has a different age categorization, we will contact authors for additional data for the subgroups of interest. If data are unavailable from the authors and the report, the study will not be included in the subgroup analysis. We will conduct the following sensitivity analyses: methodological quality of included trials; intention‐to‐treat status; and funding source (medical or pharmaceutical companies versus other). We will also calculate fixed‐effect estimates as a sensitivity analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed on the primary outcome.\n\n【49】We will test for asymmetry using the funnel plot visually and quantitatively (ie the rank correlation test ( Begg 1994 ), the trim and fill method ( Duval 2000 ), and weighted regression ( Egger 1997 )) depending on the number of trials included in the review. One source of asymmetry is publication bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Without surgery, only 30% to 40% of patients affected will survive to 10 years old. Mortality has fallen since the 1990s with 2006 to 2007 figures showing surgical survival at one year of 95%. Patients with congenital heart disease are potentially exposed to red cell transfusion at many points in the surgical pathway. There are a number of risks associated with red cell transfusion that may be translated into increased patient morbidity and mortality.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To evaluate the effects of red cell transfusion on mortality and morbidity on patients with congenital heart disease at the time of cardiac surgery.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched 11 bibliographic databases and three ongoing trials databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1950 to 11 June 2013), EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 11 June 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and the ISRCTN Register (to June 2013). We also searched references of all identified trials, relevant review articles and abstracts from between 2006 and 2010 of the most relevant conferences. We did not limit the searches by language of publication.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing red cell transfusion interventions in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease. We included participants of any age (neonates, paediatrics and adults) and with any type of congenital heart disease (cyanotic or acyanotic). We excluded patients with congenital heart disease undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. No co‐morbidities were excluded.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We identified 11 trials (862 participants). All trials were in neonatal or paediatric populations. The trials covered only three areas of interest: restrictive versus liberal transfusion triggers (two trials), leukoreduction versus non‐leukoreduction (two trials) and standard versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime (seven trials). Owing to the clinical diversity in the participant groups (cyanotic (three trials), acyanotic (four trials) or mixed (four trials)) and the intervention groups, it was not appropriate to pool data in a meta‐analysis. No study reported data for all the outcomes of interest to this review. Risk of bias was mixed across the included trials, with only attrition bias being low across all trials. Blinding of study personnel and participants was not always possible, depending on the intervention being used.\n\n【15】Five trials (628 participants) reported the primary outcome: 30‐day mortality. In three trials (a trial evaluating restrictive and liberal transfusion (125 participants), a trial of cell salvage during CPB (309 participants) and a trial of washed red blood cells during CPB (128 participants)), there was no clear difference in mortality at 30 days between the intervention arms. In two trials comparing standard and non‐standard CPB prime, there were no deaths in either randomised group. Long‐term mortality was similar between randomised groups in one trial each comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion or standard and non‐standard CPB prime.\n\n【16】Four trials explored a range of adverse effects following red cell transfusion. Kidney failure was the only adverse event that was significantly different: patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.79, 1 study, 309 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between transfusion strategies for any other severe adverse events.\n\n【17】The duration of mechanical ventilation was measured in seven trials (768 participants). Overall, there was no consistent difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the intervention and control arms.\n\n【18】The duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was measured in six trials (459 participants). There was no clear difference in the duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms in the transfusion trigger and leukoreduction trials. In the standard versus non‐standard CPB prime trials, one trial examining the impact of washing transfused bypass prime red blood cells showed no clear difference in duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms, while the trial assessing ultrafiltration of the priming blood showed a shorter duration of ICU stay in the ultrafiltration group.\n\n【19】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【20】There are only a small number of small and heterogeneous trials so there is insufficient evidence to assess the impact of red cell transfusion on patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery accurately. It is possible that the presence or absence of cyanosis impacts on trial outcomes, which would necessitate different clinical management of two groups. Further adequately powered, specific, high‐quality trials are warranted to assess this fully.\n\n【21】PICOs\n-----\n\n【22】### PICOs\n\n【23】###### Population (11)\n\n【24】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Congenital Heart Disease\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【25】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【26】*   Cardiac Surgery\n*   Red Blood Cell Transfusion\n\n【27】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【28】###### Outcome (1)\n\n【29】*   All Cause Mortality\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Heart surgery may allow a child to live and grow or may correct the defect in children and adults alike. Patients often need red blood cell transfusions during or after heart surgery. Most patients will have the surgery on a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine, which acts as the heart and lungs during the operation. More patients are now surviving heart surgery and the aim is to make surgery even safer. Some research suggests that red blood cell transfusions may make people more ill.\n\n【39】**Study characteristics**\n\n【40】We searched scientific sources to identify eligible trials and found 11 studies with 862 participants. We found no trials including adults. The identified studies examined three treatments: two trials compared giving a red blood cell transfusion only when the levels of haemoglobin in the blood fell below a certain concentration (known as a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion trigger); two trials compared whether there was a benefit to removing white blood cells (leukocytes) from the transfused red blood cells and seven trials compared methods used to prepare the fluid for the CPB machine. The trials were different in terms of the age of the participants, the type of heart disease and the exact treatment studied so there was been no opportunity to pool data for analysis. All studies did not report on all outcomes (a measure of a participant's clinical and functional status that is used to assess the effectiveness of a treatment, e.g. death, side effects).\n\n【41】**Key results**\n\n【42】Our primary outcome was death within 30 days after surgery. Five trials looked at this outcome and found no clear difference in mortality between the treatment arms. Four trials explored other adverse effects following a red blood cell transfusion. A difference in the number of adverse events was only observed for kidney failure: in one trial (with 309 participants), patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage.\n\n【43】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【44】This review identified only a few, small studies across three interventions. These studies measured many different aspects of red blood cell transfusion in patients having heart surgery so it is difficult to make accurate conclusions about the benefits or risks of red blood cell transfusion for these patients. More research is needed to allow accurate conclusions. Future studies should be bigger and focus on one aspect of transfusion in a specific type of heart disease.\n\n【45】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【46】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【47】### Implications for practice\n\n【48】Transfusion practice in children with congenital heart disease is likely to be firmly based on individual centre practice, as there are no widely accepted guidelines for transfusion practice in this patient population. There is no high‐quality evidence on which to provide guidelines for transfusion practice in this population. This is not surprising as congenital heart disease affects small numbers of people with a previously high mortality.\n\n【49】Congenital heart disease is now associated with a low mortality. Although cardiac surgery carries inherent risks in this population, the estimated effects on postoperative and longer‐term mortality were imprecise in the trials assessing postoperative restrictive versus liberal transfusion triggers, and were consistent with benefit and harm. We were unable to determine whether transfusion plays a role in reducing morbidity. This review has found few studies to assess the impact of red cell transfusion on children undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease. These studies provide limited evidence, and the trials were underpowered for clinical outcomes.\n\n【50】### Implications for research\n\n【51】This review highlights gaps and deficiencies in the current evidence base. Future trials need to be designed correctly: adequately powered, age specific (neonates, paediatrics and adult age groups) and specific for the type of congenital heart disease (cyanotic and acyanotic groups). The adult congenital heart disease population is one of the fastest growing populations in the UK but this review has not found any studies assessing the impact of red cell transfusion in this particular population group. These are all important considerations for future research.\n\n【52】Background\n----------\n\n【53】### Description of the condition\n\n【54】Congenital heart disease describes the presence of a structural abnormality of the heart present form birth ( Bédard 2008 ), and more specifically a gross structural abnormality of the heart or intrathoracic great vessels that is actually or potentially of functional importance ( Mitchell 1971 ). Although there is worldwide variation, primarily due to the ability to detect trivial lesions ( Hoffman 2002 ), the estimated incidence is four to nine cases per 1000 live born infants ( Dolk 2011 ; Perloff 2001 ). It is the most common congenital condition diagnosed in neonates ( Gatzoulis 2005 ) with congenital heart defects accounting for 30% of all live born infants with a major congenital anomaly ( EURO‐PERISTAT project 2008 ). Neonates are born with a wide range of defects, for example, atrial and ventricular septal defects, transposition of the great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot ( Bédard 2008 ).\n\n【55】The defects may be broadly classified into cyanotic or acyanotic heart disease. Cyanotic heart disease is caused by an increased amount of reduced haemoglobin (non‐oxygenated blood) from either mixing of oxygenated and non‐oxygenated blood (right to left shunting or univentricular heart) or inadequate pulmonary blood flow (underdeveloped pulmonary vasculature or progressive pulmonary hypertension). Examples of cyanotic lesions are transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Acyanotic heart disease describes infants with normal oxygen levels (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis, atrioseptal defect, ventricular septal defect ( Gatzoulis 2005 )). Patients with cyanotic heart disease have high haemoglobin and haematocrit levels and this has been shown to be a significant risk factor for perioperative bleeding and blood product use ( Williams 1999 ).\n\n【56】Surgery for congenital heart disease aims to reduce mortality and morbidity. In the 1950s, without surgery, of 10 affected children born alive, two would die by the end of the first week, a further one or two by the end of the first month, with six in total having died by the end first year. Only three or four would survive to 10 years old ( MacMahon 1953 ). Since this time, an improvement in diagnostic, interventional and surgical techniques has produced an overall dramatic decrease in mortality and morbidity rates ( British Cardiac Society 2002 ). Between 1965 and 1975 in Canada, survival rates in the first month after surgery rose from 37% to 70% ( Izukawa 1979 ). Between 1999 and 2006 in the US, overall mortality from congenital heart disease fell by 24.1% ( Gilboa 2010 ). Surgical survival at one year in the UK was approximately 95% in 2006 to 2007 ( CCAD 2008 ).\n\n【57】Patients present for surgery at a variable age according to the underlying defect but there are three main groups; neonates (within four weeks of birth), paediatrics (four weeks to 16 years) and adult congenital (over 16 years). The surgery may be either corrective (completely corrects the lesion into a normal circulation) or palliative (changes the anatomy/circulation into one that is more compatible with life). Whether the surgery is corrective or palliative depends on the underlying defect. Some patients will undergo a sequence of surgeries to correct their defects (e.g. patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome) while other patients will need repeat operations. Almost half of adult congenital cardiac surgical operations are repeat operations ( van der Bom 2011 ).\n\n【58】Mortality and morbidity are variable. For some defects (e.g. atrioseptal defects) surgery is relatively routine. For other defects, the patient is critically unwell and surgery has a very significant associated morbidity and mortality. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is an example where children are often critically unwell at presentation and surgery has a significant mortality risk. These children will undergo a palliative three‐stage repair throughout their early childhood. The first stage is the Norwood procedure where early mortality is estimated at 29% ( McGuirk 2006 ). The second stage is the bidirectional Glenn procedure followed by the Fontan procedure (total cavopulmonary connection). One study in the US cited hypoplastic left heart syndrome as the greatest specific diagnosis contributor to overall congenital heart disease mortality at 10.9% of all deaths ( Gilboa 2010 ).\n\n【59】More children are surviving after surgery for congenital heart disease with 80% to 85% expected to reach adulthood ( Khairy 2010 ; Nieminen 2001 ; Wren 2001 ). Despite excellent outcomes for many individuals, challenges remain in all patient groups especially those at higher risk, such as neonates, premature infants and patients undergoing complex surgery ( Cheng 2011 ; Padley 2011 ). About 10.4% of all UK infants who died in one UK‐based study population had a cardiovascular malformation ( Wren 2012 ). Adult re‐operations are associated with significant morbidity and mortality with early mortality rates between 3.6% and 7.6%, and 15% to 24% of patients experiencing serious postoperative complications ( Berdat 2004 ; Giamberti 2009 ). Research now focuses on further reducing mortality and maybe even more importantly, on decreasing perioperative morbidity ( Gatzoulis 2005 ).\n\n【60】### Description of the intervention\n\n【61】Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease are potentially exposed to red cell transfusion at many points in the surgical pathway; to treat anaemia preoperatively, correct blood loss during surgery, haemodilution while on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and ongoing blood loss or haemodilution in the intensive care unit (ICU) or the ward post surgery.\n\n【62】CPB replaces the work of the heart and lungs allowing the heart to be stopped during surgery, providing a still and bloodless field for the surgeon ( Allman 2002 ). The blood is oxygenated, carbon dioxide is removed and then the blood is returned to the patient. The circuit provides a continuous circulation between the venous cannula draining blood from the patient and the aortic cannula returning blood to the patient. The circuit tubing is primed with fluid to prevent air passing from the circuit into the patient. This fluid is known as the bypass prime and it may have a number of components ( Allman 2002 ). If it does not contain any red cells, it is known as a clear or bloodless prime. As the bypass prime mixes with the patient's own circulation, there is a risk of excessive haemodilution so red cells are added to prevent this. Red cells can be added into the prime volume before bypass or into the bypass pump once the patient is on bypass. A neonate is likely to undergo 60% haemodilution on bypass ( Eaton 2005 ), so is almost always likely to have donor red cells added to the CPB prime ( Groom 2005 ). However, a number of centres have been investigating bloodless CPB prime to reduce exposure to red cell transfusion ( Ging 2008 ; Golab 2009 ; Miyaji 2007 ; Olshove 2010 ).\n\n【63】Despite improvements in the risks associated with red cell transfusion, many still exist. These risks can result in increased morbidity and mortality, especially in the critically ill patient population ( Hebert 1999 ; Vincent 2002 ). In previous years, the major concerns were with the transmission of infection, especially hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ( Guzzetta 2011 ; Morley 2009 ). Through donor screening and donation testing, the infectious risks are now small in developed countries with the quoted risk of hepatitis C being one in 100 million, hepatitis B one in one million and HIV one in 6.25 million ( SHOT 2011 ). However, some countries do not have the same rigorous testing systems and infection transmission remains a real risk. The 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) Blood Safety Survey showed that out of 162 countries, 41 were not able to screen for one or more transfusion‐transmissible infections (HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) ( WHO Blood 2013 ).\n\n【64】As transfusion medicine practice has developed and improved, the focus of risks associated with red cell transfusion has shifted to non‐infectious sequelae with the main current issues of adverse transfusion reactions, acute lung injury and the negative effects of immunomodulation ( Raghavan 2005 ).\n\n【65】Adverse transfusion reactions are a real concern. Children under 18 years old receive 4.2% of all red cell transfusions while children under one year old receive 1.7% ( Wallis 2006 ). However, children have a disproportionately higher number of adverse reactions when compared with adults: 37 in 100,000 for children under one year old, 18 in 100,000 transfusion for children under 18 years, while for adults it is 13 in 100,000 ( Stainsby 2008 ).\n\n【66】Transfusion‐related acute lung injury (TRALI): new acute lung injury occurring during or within six hours of a transfusion ( Lavoie 2011 ) is estimated to have an incidence between 0.08% and 15% of patients receiving a transfusion ( Benson 2010 ; Silliman 2003 ) with an adult mortality of 5% to 10% ( Vlaar 2013 ). Although reported to be rare in children, it is probably under‐reported as it can be difficult to diagnose ( Harrison 2011 ).\n\n【67】The negative effects of immunomodulation and red cell storage are increased nosocomial infections and the development of autoimmune diseases or cancer ( Raghavan 2005 ; Sanchez 2005 ). Critically ill patients have been shown to have a six‐fold incidence of developing a nosocomial infection when transfused with red cells compared with those not transfused and this incidence is dose‐related with each additional unit of blood increasing the risk by a factor of 1.5 ( Taylor 2002 ).\n\n【68】The recognition of these risks associated with red cell transfusion has led to a more critical appraisal of the use of red cell transfusion. Although red blood cells are transfused more frequently than any other blood component, their overall usage in the UK has been declining with a decrease of around 20% in the 10 years from 1999/2000 ( SHOT 2011 ).\n\n【69】Literature in critically unwell patient groups suggests that avoiding red cell transfusions may reduce morbidity, which explains the trend to reduce such exposure. Adult critical care patients subjected to a restrictive transfusion policy were shown to have a similar 30‐day mortality during hospitalisation when compared with those with a liberal transfusion policy (18.7% versus 23.3%) ( Hebert 1999 ), with red cell transfusions suggested as an independent predictor of death with an odds ratio of 1.7 ( Marik 2008 ).\n\n【70】Relatively few studies have examined the effects of red cell transfusion on critically ill children ( Istaphanous 2011 ). Lacroix reported the results of a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCTs) comparing a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill children showing a decrease in transfusion requirements in the restrictive group without increasing adverse outcomes. The study did caution the use of a restrictive strategy in children with cyanotic heart disease ( Lacroix 2007 ).\n\n【71】Neonatal studies have also examined restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies. One of the largest studies, the Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion (PINT) study, suggested that a liberal transfusion strategy in extremely low birth weight neonates resulted in more infants receiving transfusions but conferred little evidence or benefit ( Kirpalani 2006 ). When this study was combined with three others ( Bell 2005 ; Chen 2009 ; Connelly 1998 ), a Cochrane review concluded that restrictive as compared with liberal transfusion thresholds resulted in modest reductions in transfusion and haemoglobin levels. Restrictive practice did not appear to have significant impact on death or major morbidities at hospital discharge or first hospital follow‐up. However, there were uncertainties with these conclusions and further trials are needed ( Whyte 2011 ).\n\n【72】### How the intervention might work\n\n【73】The most important physiological consequence of anaemia is reduced oxygen‐carrying capacity of the blood. The optimal concentration of haemoglobin for avoidance of severe morbidity is unknown but animal experiments suggest the critical haemoglobin level for oxygen delivery to be 3 to 4 g/dL ( Van der Linden 1998 ). Although healthy adult volunteers tolerate a haemoglobin of 5 g/dL with no increase in lactate production or decrease in oxygen consumption, they do show an increase in heart rate and a decline in cognitive function suggesting borderline tissue oxygen delivery ( Weiskopf 2002 ). The physiological response to anaemia is to increase cardiac output so anaemia effectively consumes some of the cardiac reserve ( Morley 2009 ). Patients with congenital heart disease and a marginal cardiac reserve often have a precarious oxygen supply/demand balance so anaemia may adversely alter this balance. Red cell transfusion augments tissue oxygen delivery by increasing the oxygen‐carrying capacity of the blood ( Guzzetta 2011 ). Many centres transfuse at a higher starting haemoglobin for patients with congenital heart disease when they require surgery or intensive care ( Morley 2009 ).\n\n【74】The red cells that are transfused can vary in age and nature. They may or may not contain leukocytes, they may be fresh or old and they may come as packed cells or in whole blood. Each of these factors may be important in determining outcome for the transfusion recipient.\n\n【75】The negative immunomodulatory effects of red cell transfusion may be due to the presence of donor lymphocytes in transfused components ( Morley 2009 ), and leukoreduction may reduce these negative effects ( van de Watering 1998 ; van Hilten 2004 ).\n\n【76】Red blood cell function may become impaired with increased storage time ( Morley 2009 ). Prolonged storage time may increase mortality, pneumonia, infection, multiorgan failure and length of hospital stay but these observations are based on laboratory and observational clinical studies and further work is needed ( Tinmouth 2006 ).\n\n【77】Theoretically, whole blood should improve haemostasis and decrease systemic inflammation in comparison with packed red cells. Manno 1991 compared the immediate postoperative transfusion needs of children undergoing open‐heart surgery with CPB with either whole blood or reconstituted whole blood (packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets). Transfusion with reconstituted blood significantly increased mean 24‐hour postoperative blood loss in those less than two years old (85% more blood loss) but for those aged over two years undergoing surgery for simple defects, there was no significant difference between treatment groups.When whole blood was added into the bypass circuit prime, there were no significant differences in terms of bleeding and inflammatory mediator levels. There was a trend to longer ICU stay, greater positive fluid balance and longer hospital stay ( Mou 2004 ).\n\n【78】In summary, the issues concerning red cell transfusion for patients with congenital heart disease relate to:\n\n【79】1.  What haemoglobin trigger should blood be transfused ‐ can patients tolerate a lower (restrictive) haemoglobin concentration before they need to be transfused?\n    \n2.  How much blood to give ‐ what volume of red cell transfusion should be given to reach the intended haemoglobin target?\n    \n3.  Leukoreduced versus non‐leukoreduced ‐ is there a benefit to removing leukocytes from the transfused red blood cells?\n    \n4.  Whole blood versus packed cells ‐ do patients benefit from whole blood more than packed red cells?\n    \n5.  The age of red cells transfused: new versus old ‐ do patients have better outcomes if they are transfused 'newer' red blood cells?\n    \n\n【80】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【81】The patient population with congenital heart disease is small but they are surviving longer. Epidemiological studies have confirmed this decreasing mortality and prolonged survival in young patients resulting in a growing and ageing population with congenital heart disease ( Khairy 2010 ; Knowles 2012 ; Wren 2001 ).\n\n【82】Although mortality and morbidity have improved, cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease remains a risk especially in neonatal, premature and those undergoing complex surgery populations. Blood transfusion has been associated with adverse outcomes in other critically unwell patient populations and the specialty of congenital heart disease has begun to address the specific risks to this population ( Guzzetta 2011 ). Studies have tried to elicit the risk factors for adverse outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease ( Székely 2006 ). One secondary analysis suggested that intraoperative and early postoperative blood transfusion was a powerful independent predictor of duration of mechanical ventilation in infants undergoing reparative cardiac surgery ( Kipps 2011 ). Infants receiving the highest volume of transfusion had a hazard of remaining intubated that was twice as high as infants receiving the lowest volume of transfusion. The total amount of blood transfusion has been independently associated with infections but not mortality ( Székely 2009 ). Red cell transfusions have also been associated with longer hospital stay with the strongest association in the high transfusion group ( Salvin 2011 ). This association was limited to patients with a biventricular and not a univentricular circulation. For patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a higher haemoglobin nadir on postoperative days two to five was associated with higher early mortality but neither haemoglobin concentrations nor transfusions were associated with two‐year mortality or neurodevelopmental outcomes. More transfusions two to five days postoperatively were associated with morbidity measured by ventilation days ( Blackwood 2010 ).\n\n【83】There are no systematic reviews examining red cell transfusion in this patent population ( Dorée 2010 ). Unanswered clinical questions include at what haemoglobin concentration should blood be given, how much blood should be given, what age (new versus old) and what type of blood should be used (leukoreduced or non‐leukoreduced, irradiated or non‐irradiated, packed cells or whole blood). This review aims to address these knowledge gaps and direct future research and clinical practice.\n\n【84】Although the three patient groups of neonates, paediatrics and adults appear different, the same questions exist for all of them and it is likely that a neonate will survive to adulthood and possibly require further surgery at a later stage. We assessed the three groups separately but kept them in the same review. Clinicians often manage these patients from birth to adulthood so the review will cover all ages.\n\n【85】Objectives\n----------\n\n【86】To evaluate the effects of red cell transfusion on mortality and morbidity on patients with congenital heart disease at the time of cardiac surgery.\n\n【87】Methods\n-------\n\n【88】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【89】#### Types of studies\n\n【90】We included RCTs in this review.\n\n【91】#### Types of participants\n\n【92】We included all patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease with no restriction on age. The congenital heart disease could be cyanotic or acyanotic. We grouped patients by age: neonates (newborns up to four weeks old), paediatrics (children four weeks post birth to age 16 years) and adults (over 16 years) and analysed them separately.\n\n【93】We excluded patients with congenital heart disease undergoing non‐cardiac surgery and considered all co‐morbidities.\n\n【94】#### Types of interventions\n\n【95】The intervention was red cell transfusion at any point in the surgical pathway. This included red cell transfusion intraoperatively directly into the patient or into the CPB machine (either into the prime cardiopulmonary volume before bypass or subsequently into the cardiopulmonary pump volume during bypass) or postoperatively during their hospital stay.\n\n【96】We included the following comparisons:\n\n【97】*   Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger ‐ blood was transfused at two or more different patient haemoglobin concentrations with liberal transfusion trigger being higher than restrictive (different studies chose different haemoglobin concentrations but were around haemoglobin 7 to 8 g/dL for restrictive and 9 to 10 g/dL for liberal).\n    \n*   Volume A red cell transfusion versus volume B red cell transfusion (e.g. higher volume versus lower volume (different mL/kg)). The standard advised resuscitation volume for paediatric patients is 20 mL/kg so the doses were likely to be factors of 20 mL/kg.\n    \n*   Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion.\n    \n*   Whole blood versus packed red cell transfusion.\n    \n*   'New' (not near to expiry date) versus 'old' (near to expiry date) red cell transfusion. In the UK, red blood cells up to five days old may be given for neonates and up to 35 days old for paediatric patients so each group contained comparison groups appropriate to the suggested national guidelines ( BCSH 2004 ).\n    \n*   Standard CPB prime versus non‐standard CPB prime (e.g. bloodless prime or different methods of processing the prime).\n    \n\n【98】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【99】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【100】*   All‐cause mortality: short term (0 to 30 days post surgery).\n    \n\n【101】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【102】*   All‐cause mortality: long term: 30 days to two years post surgery.\n    \n*   Severe adverse events: cardiac events, acute lung injury, stroke, thromboembolism, renal failure (needing renal replacement therapy), infection, haemorrhage (return to theatre for bleeding).\n    \n*   Haematocrit/haemoglobin (g/dL) concentrations post operative and at discharge.\n    \n*   Volume or number of red cell units transfused.\n    \n*   Volume or number of other blood products transfused (i.e. fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate).\n    \n*   Postoperative chest drain output.\n    \n*   Duration of mechanical ventilation.\n    \n*   Duration of ICU stay.\n    \n*   Re‐hospitalisation rates.\n    \n*   Biochemistry levels (added post‐hoc).\n    \n\n【103】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【104】#### Electronic searches\n\n【105】The Systematic Review Initiative's information specialist (CD) formulated the search strategies in collaboration with the Cochrane Heart Group. We searched the following databases.\n\n【106】##### Bibliographic databases\n\n【107】*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 5, 2013).\n    \n*   MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   PubMed (e‐publications only: searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   LILACS (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   Transfusion Evidence Library ( www.transfusionevidencelibrary.com) (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (Web of Science) (1990 to 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   IndMed (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   KoreaMed (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   PakMediNet (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n\n【108】##### Online databases of ongoing trials\n\n【109】*   ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ) (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   ISRCTN Register ( www.controlled‐trials.com/isrctn/) (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n*   WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Search Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/AdvSearch.aspx ) (searched 11 June 2013).\n    \n\n【110】We modified the search strategy that was used to search MEDLINE to search the other databases listed. Searches in MEDLINE were combined with the Cochrane RCT search filter as detailed in Chapter 6 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined searches in EMBASE and CINAHL with adaptations of the relevant Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) RCT filters ( www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.html ). The search strategies for all databases are available in Appendix 1 . We applied no restrictions by language of publication or publication status.\n\n【111】#### Searching other resources\n\n【112】We also:\n\n【113】*   handsearched reference lists;\n    \n*   checked references of all identified trials and relevant review articles for further literature. We limited these searches to the 'first generation' reference lists;\n    \n*   handsearched conference proceedings;\n    \n*   searched abstracts (published between 2006 and January 2011) of the most relevant conferences for further studies, including the European Society of Cardiology, World Congress of Cardiology, American Heart Association, Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons, British Cardiovascular Society, European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery and Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology.\n    \n\n【114】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【115】#### Selection of studies\n\n【116】One review author (CD) screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers identified by the review search strategy. We excluded studies that were clearly irrelevant (e.g. non‐RCTs, non‐cardiac surgery papers and duplicates) at this stage.\n\n【117】Two review authors (KW, SB) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all potentially relevant trials for eligibility. We obtained the full text of any papers where eligibility could not be assessed on title and abstract alone and two review authors (KW, SB) independently assessed eligibility. At all stages, we resolved any disagreements by discussion or by consultation with a third review author (MM). We sought further information from the study authors where articles contained insufficient data to make a decision about eligibility. We designed a study eligibility form to help in the assessment of relevance using the criteria outlined above.\n\n【118】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【119】Two review authors (KW, SB) independently conducted data extraction according to the guidelines proposed by The Cochrane Collaboration. We resolved disagreements by consensus. The review authors were not blinded to names of authors, institutions, journals or the outcomes of the trials. We extracted data from the studies using a standardised data extraction form. The form was initially piloted on a sample of the eligible papers and any disagreements were resolved before the rest of the data extraction was completed.\n\n【120】We used both full‐text versions and abstracts including additional information (e.g. slides) of eligible studies to retrieve the data. We extracted trials reported in more than one publication on one form only. Where these sources did not provide sufficient information, we requested additional details from the contact author.\n\n【121】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【122】Two review authors (KW, SB) assessed all included studies for possible risk of bias, using the 'Risk of bias' tool, as described in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). The assessment included information about the design, conduct and analysis of the trial. We evaluated the criteria using a three‐point scale: low, high or unclear risk of bias.\n\n【123】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【124】For dichotomous outcomes, the numbers of outcomes in treatment and control groups were recorded and the risk ratio (RR) was reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI) that was used for reporting the treatment effect measures across individual studies.\n\n【125】For continuous outcomes, the mean and standard deviations (SD) were recorded. For continuous outcomes measured using the same scale, the effect measure was the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs, and, if data had necessitated, the standardised mean difference (SMD) for outcomes measured using different scales. Three trials reported standard error of the means (SEM) ( Komai 1998 ; Liu 2007 ; Swindell 2007 ): we calculated SDs from the SEM and used these for our calculations throughout this review.\n\n【126】Five trials reported outcome data using median values (with interquartile ranges) ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ; de Vries 2004 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Ye 2013 ): these values have been commented on in the text and individual outcome data reported in Table 1 ; Table 2 ; Table 3 ; and Table 4 . The trials report that some of their outcome data were reported as median and interquartile ranges due to a skew in particular distributions. Such skew is commonplace in measures of duration (e.g. duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay) and thus was expected by the authors of this review.\n\n【127】Open in table viewer\n\n【128】Table 1.

However, as no change from baseline SDs were reported by these trials, we have chosen to not calculate change from baseline scores. The findings from these studies has been reported using MDs with 95% CIs as per all other continuous outcomes in this review.\n\n【149】We had planned to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with 95% CI and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) with 95% CI but were unable to do so as we had insufficient relevant data to undertake this calculation.\n\n【150】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【151】We did not encounter any unit of analysis issues, as we did not include any cluster‐randomised trials in this review, and the unit of analysis and randomisation was always the patient. If any unit of analysis issues had arisen, we would have treated these in accordance with the advice given in Chapter 16 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【152】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【153】We successfully contacted three study authors by email to obtain missing data. One was contacted for more information on randomisation sequence as it was unclear in the published report ( Komai 1998 ). The second was contacted to request clarity on outcome data and information on whether study personnel were blinded to treatment allocation ( Cholette 2012 ). The third was contacted to clarify some outcome data and in response we received the mean and SD values for the baseline characteristics and outcomes they reported in their manuscript ( Ye 2013 ).\n\n【154】Where possible, we used intention‐to‐treat (ITT) data, but if not we included per‐protocol (PP) data. One trial stated that they analysed data by both ITT and PP but the manuscript reported baseline data by ITT and outcome assessment data by PP ( Cholette 2012 ). A second trial reported both ITT and PP data for their primary outcome: with the results being very similar by both analyses ( Willems 2010 ). In accordance with our protocol, we have used the ITT data from this trial in our review.\n\n【155】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【156】We did perform any meta‐analyses in this review, thus we did not make a formal assessment of heterogeneity. Should there have been sufficient data to support meta‐analyses, the decision about whether or not to combine the results of individual studies would have depended on an assessment of heterogeneity. We would have assessed statistical heterogeneity of treatment effects between trials using a Chi <sup>2 </sup> test with a significance level at P value < 0.1. We would have used the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic to quantify the percentage of heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 30% moderate heterogeneity, I <sup>2 </sup> \\> 75% considerable heterogeneity). We would have explored potential causes of heterogeneity using sensitivity and subgroup analyses. In any future updates of this review, assuming we find sufficient data, we will perform assessment of heterogeneity as outlined.\n\n【157】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【158】As there were no meta‐analyses with more than 10 trials, we did not perform an assessment of reporting biases. In future updates of this review, we will explore potential publication bias (small trial bias) by generating a funnel plot and do statistical testing using a linear regression test. A P value of less than 0.1 would be considered significant for this test ( Lau 2006 ; Sterne 2011 ).\n\n【159】#### Data synthesis\n\n【160】We performed analyses according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration ( Schunemann 2011 ), with aggregated data used for analysis. For statistical analysis, we used Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2012 ).\n\n【161】We used a fixed‐effect model for meta‐analysis and employed the Mantel‐Haenszel method for dichotomous data outcomes (and the generic inverse variance method for survival data outcomes, should this data have been available). We found no unexplained statistical heterogeneity, but if we had, we would have undertaken a random‐effects meta‐analysis, and reported both fixed‐effect and random‐effects meta‐analyses. As most outcome data did not allow for meta‐analysis (due to clinical and outcome diversity), we have reported outcome data descriptively.\n\n【162】We created no 'Summary of findings' table for this review due to the lack of reported data across the included trials. If we had been able to produce a 'Summary of findings' table, we would have used the GRADE profiler as suggested in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Schunemann 2011a ).\n\n【163】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【164】Sufficient data were not available to perform our intended subgroup analyses relating to whether a patient had acyanotic or cyanotic congenital heart disease and the timing of the transfusion: preoperatively, intraoperatively, postoperatively. In future updates of this review, we will explore these subgroup analyses should we find appropriate data.\n\n【165】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【166】We had intended to assess the robustness of our findings by the following sensitivity analyses:\n\n【167】*   including only those trials at low risk of bias on the dimensions of selection and performance bias (clinicians only);\n    \n*   including only those trials in which 25% of patients or less were lost to follow‐up.\n    \n\n【168】However, there were insufficient data to enable these assessments. In future updates of this review, we will explore these sensitivity analyses should we find appropriate data.\n\n【169】Results\n-------\n\n【170】### Description of studies\n\n【171】#### Results of the search\n\n【172】The database search identified 1485 references. After initial screening of the database citations, we excluded 570 for being duplicates or not an RCT. We screened the remaining 915 records according to the criteria defined above and excluded 870 (see Figure 1 ).\n\n【173】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【174】Figure 1\n\n【175】* * *\n\n【176】* * *\n\n【177】Study flow diagram.\n\n【178】Handsearching of the abstracts from the annual conference proceedings identified 11,202 references. After initial screening, we excluded all but two as they were either not the correct intervention or not an RCT. We excluded the two remaining abstracts after obtaining further information: one was not an RCT and the other did not solely use red blood cells as the intervention.\n\n【179】We obtained the full text of 45 references. We deemed 23 references (providing data on 11 independent trials) eligible for inclusion, identified three references (providing data on two separate trials) as a 'trial awaiting assessment', found three references to be ongoing trials and excluded 17 references for not meeting the eligibility criteria of this review.\n\n【180】#### Included studies\n\n【181】We found 11 trials (from 22 references) to be eligible for inclusion in this review (see Characteristics of included studies table).\n\n【182】##### Design\n\n【183】The trials were published between 1990 and 2013 and all were published in English as full journal articles. All trials were parallel RCTs. One paper ( Willems 2010 ) was a sub‐study analysis of a larger RCT ( Lacroix 2007 ). The larger trial was not eligible for inclusion in our review as it examined the general paediatric intensive care population and was not specific to children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery ( Lacroix 2007 ). The sub‐study of Willems 2010 explored transfusion strategies for paediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease in paediatric intensive care units (PICU).\n\n【184】##### Sample sizes\n\n【185】The trials included 862 patients. The number of patients ranged from 16 ( Liu 2007 ) to 309 ( Ye 2013 ). Three trials reported inadequate powering of their studies with reference to testing for statistical differences in clinical outcomes ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ; Willems 2010 ).\n\n【186】##### Setting\n\n【187】The trials were conducted in eight countries with three trials in the US ( Cholette 2012 ; Cholette 2011 ; Hosking 1990 ); two in China ( Liu 2007 ; Ye 2013 ); and one in each of Japan ( Komai 1998 ), Germany ( Shimpo 2001 ), the Netherlands ( de Vries 2004 ), Korea ( Han 2004 ), and UK ( Swindell 2007 ). One trial was multi‐country, with patients included from Belgium, Canada and the US ( Willems 2010 ).\n\n【188】##### Patients\n\n【189】The patients were neonates or children. There were no trials including adults with congenital heart disease. One trial looked at neonates only ( Liu 2007 ), two trials included both neonates and children ( Cholette 2012 ; Swindell 2007 ). The remaining eight trials examined children only ( Cholette 2011 ; de Vries 2004 ; Han 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Komai 1998 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Willems 2010 ; Ye 2013 ). Three trials included only cyanotic patients ( Cholette 2011 ; Liu 2007 ; Swindell 2007 ), four trials only acyanotic patients ( Han 2004 ; Komai 1998 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Willems 2010 ), and four trials included both cyanotic and acyanotic patients ( Cholette 2012 ; de Vries 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Ye 2013 ).\n\n【190】##### Interventions\n\n【191】The trials examined red cell transfusion as an intervention in several different ways (see Table 5 ).\n\n【192】Open in table viewer\n\n【193】Table 5. Included studies by intervention and age groups\n\n|  | Cyanosis  | Neonates  | Neonates/paediatric  | Paediatric  | Adults  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | Willems 2010  | None  |\n| Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger  | Cyanotic  | None  | None  | Cholette 2011  | None  |\n| Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger  | Both  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Volume A red cell transfusion versus volume B red cell transfusion  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Volume A red cell transfusion versus volume B red cell transfusion  | Cyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Volume A red cell transfusion versus volume B red cell transfusion  | Both  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Leukoreduced red cell versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | Komai 1998  | None  |\n| Leukoreduced red cell versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion  | Cyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Leukoreduced red cell versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion  | Both  | None  | None  | de Vries 2004  | None  |\n| Whole blood versus packed red cell transfusion  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Whole blood versus packed red cell transfusion  | Cyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Whole blood versus packed red cell transfusion  | Both  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| 'New' (not near to expiry date) versus 'old' (near to expiry date) red cell transfusion  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| 'New' (not near to expiry date) versus 'old' (near to expiry date) red cell transfusion  | Cyanotic  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| 'New' (not near to expiry date) versus 'old' (near to expiry date) red cell transfusion  | Both  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n| Standard CPB prime versus non‐standard CPB prime  | Acyanotic  | None  | None  | Han 2004 ; Shimpo 2001  | None  |\n| Standard CPB prime versus non‐standard CPB prime  | Cyanotic  | Liu 2007  | Swindell 2007  | None  | None  |\n| Standard CPB prime versus non‐standard CPB prime  | Both  | None  | Cholette 2012  | Hosking 1990 ; Ye 2013  | None  |\n\n【195】CPB: cardiopulmonary bypass.\n\n【196】Two trials assessed a restrictive versus a liberal red blood cell transfusion policy ( Cholette 2011 ; Willems 2010 ). In the restrictive arm, children (with single ventricle physiology post cavopulmonary connection (cyanotic group)) were transfused when their haemoglobin concentration was less than 9.0 g/dL ( Cholette 2011 ), or when their haemoglobin concentration was less than 7.0 g/dL ( Willems 2010 ). In the liberal arm, children (with new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction post cardiac surgery (acyanotic group) received a red blood cell transfusion when their haemoglobin concentration was greater than 13.0 g/dL ( Cholette 2011 ), or when their haemoglobin concentration was less than 9.5 g/dL ( Willems 2010 ).\n\n【197】Two trials assessed the impact of leukoreduction but at different time points in the operation and in different patient populations. One trial, in acyanotic neonates and paediatric patients, explored the benefits (postoperative oxygenation and circulating leukocyte counts) of a leukoreduction filter for the blood in the bypass circuit at the end of the operation ( de Vries 2004 ). The other trial, in acyanotic paediatric patients, reported on the clinical effect (lung function) of applying leukoreduction filters to stored donor red blood cells added to the CPB circuit at the beginning of the operation ( Komai 1998 ).\n\n【198】Seven trials assessed red blood cell usage during CPB, but each was for a different aspect of non‐standard CPB prime. In addition, the age of the patients and inclusion of acyanotic or cyanotic patients differed between the trials. Three of these trials assessed the impact of washing packed red blood cells ( Cholette 2012 ; Hosking 1990 ; Swindell 2007 ): in two trials the red blood cells had also been irradiated ( Cholette 2012 ; Swindell 2007 ); one trial assessed CPB prime containing red blood cells versus crystalloid (bloodless) prime ( Han 2004 ); one trial assessed cell salvage versus no cell salvage during CPB ( Ye 2013 ); one trial compared the effects of unprocessed and processed packed red cells with the continuous autologous transfusion system ( Liu 2007 ); and one trial compared red blood cells that had been ultrafiltrated versus red blood cells that had not been ultrafiltrated ( Shimpo 2001 ).\n\n【199】##### Outcomes\n\n【200】No trial measured all outcomes of interest to this review. Two trials did not include any outcomes pre‐defined as of interest to this review ( Hosking 1990 ; Swindell 2007 ). However, they both included an outcome (biochemistry levels) that should be relevant to this review (and may be important in any future updates). We have added this outcome into this review, clearly marking it as an outcome that was identified and added after the review protocol was agreed.\n\n【201】#### Excluded studies\n\n【202】We excluded 17 studies from the review following full‐text eligibility assessment (see Characteristics of excluded studies table). In summary, eight studies were not RCTs; seven had an incorrect intervention (five did not analyse red blood cell independently of other blood products) and two had an incorrect patient population (one contained neonates with cardiac neonates but they did not undergo cardiac surgery and one was in the general neonatal population).\n\n【203】##### Studies awaiting classification\n\n【204】We included two trials (from three references) in the 'studies awaiting classification' section of the review (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table).\n\n【205】##### Ongoing studies\n\n【206】We identified three ongoing studies (see Characteristics of ongoing studies table). We will monitor the progress of these trials and, on publication (assuming eligibility), will include them in future updates of this review. The ongoing RCTs cover two interventions: transfusion triggers ( Cholette 2012a ; Reeves 2008 ), and age of red blood cells to be transfused ( Steiner 2010 ).\n\n【207】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【208】See the 'Risk of bias' tables for details of our assessment for each study and Figure 2 and Figure 3 for a 'Risk of bias' graph and tabular summary.\n\n【209】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【210】Figure 2\n\n【211】* * *\n\n【212】* * *\n\n【213】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【214】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【215】Figure 3\n\n【216】* * *\n\n【217】* * *\n\n【218】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【219】#### Allocation\n\n【220】Four trials reported details of the randomisation sequence ( de Vries 2004 ; Han 2004 ; Komai 1998 ; Willems 2010 ). Three of these four trials were defined as being of low risk of bias, using computer generated lists ( de Vries 2004 ; Han 2004 ) and assigning patients to intervention groups in blocks of two or four ( Willems 2010 ). One trial was defined as being of high risk of bias as an alternation method was used ( Komai 1998 ).\n\n【221】The generation of the randomisation sequence was defined as unclear risk of bias in the other seven trials ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ; Hosking 1990 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Swindell 2007 ; Ye 2013 ). Two trials used block randomisation to randomise into either transfusion strategy but no further description was provided as to how the random sequence was generated ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ). Five trials did not report details of their generation of the randomisation sequence methods ( Hosking 1990 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Swindell 2007 ; Ye 2013 ), so we defined them as having an unclear risk of bias.\n\n【222】##### Concealment of treatment allocation\n\n【223】The method of randomisation (as described above) was deemed to be of low risk of bias to conceal treatment allocation in two trials ( Shimpo 2001 ; Willems 2010 ), where only the perfusionist was informed of allocation in one trial ( Shimpo 2001 ), and the physicians, nurses and research staff were unaware of the block‐randomisation strategy in the other trial ( Willems 2010 ). One trial had its method of randomisation deemed inadequate (high risk of bias) to conceal treatment allocation, as the author confirmed directly by email that unsealed envelopes were used ( de Vries 2004 ). Eight trials did not provide information to enable assessment of adequate allocation concealment ( Cholette 2012 ; Cholette 2011 ; Han 2004 ; Hosking 1990 Komai 1998 ; Liu 2007 ; Swindell 2007 ; Ye 2013 ); therefore, we defined them as having unclear risk of bias.\n\n【224】#### Blinding\n\n【225】Blinding of patients, clinicians or outcome assessors was reported in four trials ( Cholette 2012 ; Cholette 2011 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Willems 2010 ). In one trial, only the perfusionist was informed of trial allocation and all other people involved in the trial were blind to treatment allocation (low risk of bias) ( Shimpo 2001 ). We defined blinding as high risk of bias in the other three trials: no‐one involved in the care of or outcome assessment of the patients was blinded to treatment allocation ( Cholette 2012 ); the blinding of personnel and patients was inadequate as clinical staff and patients' families were aware of transfusion group assignment while the blinding of the outcome assessors was not reported so rated as unclear risk of bias in the one trial ( Cholette 2011 ). In the third trial ( Willems 2010 ), blinding of personnel and patients was also of high risk of bias, but the outcome assessors were stated as being \"unaware of treatment assignment\" and we have defined blinding as at a low risk of bias for outcome assessors.\n\n【226】The blinding of all trial personnel (patients, clinicians and outcome assessors) to treatment allocation was unclear in seven trials ( de Vries 2004 ; Han 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Komai 1998 ; Liu 2007 ; Swindell 2007 ; Ye 2013 ).\n\n【227】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【228】Eight trials included all randomised patients in the analysis of outcome data and did not lose any patients during follow‐up ( de Vries 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Komai 1998 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Swindell 2007 ; Willems 2010 ; Ye 2013 ). The remaining three trials did not include all randomised patients in the analysis of clinical, scientific or both clinical and scientific outcomes, but reported reasons for this non‐inclusion ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ; Han 2004 ).\n\n【229】In Cholette 2012 , no patient was lost to follow‐up, but six patients were excluded following randomisation for reported surgical reasons. Following randomisation, a further 34 patients (17 in each treatment arm) did not receive a transfusion and, therefore, were not included in the PP analysis. In Cholette 2011 , two randomised patients (3% of patients in this trial) were excluded from the trials and, therefore, outcome analysis (one patient from each intervention arm). No other patient dropped out of the study or was lost to follow‐up. In Han 2004 , one patient (3% of patients in this trial) in the intervention group was excluded for clinical reasons and this patient's data were not included in any outcome analyses.\n\n【230】#### Selective reporting\n\n【231】In six RCTs, all outcomes defined in their methods section were reported on in their results section (low risk of bias) ( Cholette 2012 ; Cholette 2011 ; de Vries 2004 ; Liu 2007 ; Swindell 2007 ; Willems 2010 ). Four RCTs did not define the outcomes they were interested in; therefore, it is impossible to identify whether there was reporting bias in these trials ( Han 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Komai 1998 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Ye 2013 ), and we have rated them as having unclear risk of bias.\n\n【232】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【233】##### Protocol adherence\n\n【234】Three trials reported protocol adherence ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ; Willems 2010 ). In one trial, there was 100% compliance with the trial protocol and the protocol was never suspended during the trial ( Cholette 2011 ). There were three protocol violations in one trial; one in a neonate receiving washed red blood cells and two in neonates in the unwashed red blood cell group ( Cholette 2012 ). In the other trial, 10 patients did not reach their pre‐defined criteria for good protocol adherence (80%) and seven patients in the restrictive group and one in the liberal group were suspended temporarily from the transfusion protocol ( Willems 2010 ).\n\n【235】##### Support and sponsorship\n\n【236】Eight trials did not report the source of funding ( de Vries 2004 ; Han 2004 ; Hosking 1990 ; Komai 1998 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Swindell 2007 ; Ye 2013 ). In the three trials that reported source of funding, two trials were supported in part by university grants ( Cholette 2011 ; Cholette 2012 ) and the study authors did not disclose any potential conflicts of interest. The third trial was supported by government grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec (FRSQ). The authors conflicts of interest were reported and we assessed them as low risk of bias ( Willems 2010 ).\n\n【237】### Effects of interventions\n\n【238】The outcome data in this review are reported by outcome and then by intervention. Relevant eligible trials were only identified for three of the interventions of interest: restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger; leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion; and standard CPB prime versus non‐standard CPB prime.\n\n【239】The clinical diversity in the patient groups (cyanotic and acyanotic, and paediatric and neonate) has meant that there was no opportunity to pool data within these intervention groups. In addition, no data was pooled across the intervention standard versus non‐standard CPB prime due to clinical diversity in the patient groups and also due to differences in the red blood cells (processed versus unprocessed, washed versus unwashed) used in the CPB machine.\n\n【240】#### Primary outcome\n\n【241】##### All‐cause mortality: short term (30 days post surgery)\n\n【242】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【243】Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the restrictive and liberal threshold (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.77, 125 patients). The time at which death occurred and the causes of death were not reported (Figure 4).\n\n【244】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【245】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【246】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【247】Four trials report measuring this outcome ( Cholette 2012 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Ye 2013 ), although incidents of mortality were only reported in two trials ( Cholette 2012 ; Ye 2013 ), as Liu 2007 and Shimpo 2001 reported no in‐hospital deaths in their trials. We did not perform a meta‐analysis due to clinical and intervention diversity.\n\n【248】There were no differences in the number of deaths between the intervention arms (RR, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.18; 128 patients, Cholette 2012 ; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.31, 309 patients, Ye 2013 ) ( Figure 4). Where reported, details of the cause and time of death are provided in Table 6 .\n\n【249】Open in table viewer\n\n【250】Table 6.

There was no difference in the number of deaths over a long (up to two years post surgery) period between the restrictive and liberal threshold group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87, 60 patients) ( Analysis 1.2 ).\n\n【257】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【258】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【259】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【260】Data for this outcome were obtained directly from the study author for one trial ( Cholette 2012 ). There was no difference in the number of deaths over a long time period (at two years) between the washed intervention and the unwashed intervention groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.59, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.2 ). Details of the cause and time of death are provided in Table 6 .\n\n【261】##### Severe adverse events: cardiac events\n\n【262】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【263】Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients who had cardiovascular dysfunction between the restrictive and liberal trigger arms (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.36, 125 patients) ( Analysis 1.3 ). No further details were given as to when the dysfunction occurred, how it was treated or the outcome for these patients.\n\n【264】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【265】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【266】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【267】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome, defining a cardiac event as arrhythmia that was haemodynamically significant, required intervention or both. There was no difference in the number of patients who had a cardiac event at any time during the hospital admission between the intervention arms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.64, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.3 ).\n\n【268】##### Severe adverse events: acute lung injury\n\n【269】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【270】Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing an acute lung injury between intervention arms (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26, 125 patients) ( Analysis 1.4 ). No further details were given as to when the acute lung injury occurred, how it was treated or the outcome for these patients.\n\n【271】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【272】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【273】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【274】Ye 2013 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing an acute lung injury between the cell salvage and the no‐cell salvage treated groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.27, 309 patients) ( Analysis 1.4 ). No further details were given as to when the acute lung injury occurred, how it was treated or the outcome for these patients.\n\n【275】##### Severe adverse events: stroke\n\n【276】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【277】##### Severe adverse events: thromboembolism\n\n【278】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【279】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【280】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【281】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【282】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【283】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients who had a thromboembolism, at any time during the hospital admission, between the washed intervention and unwashed intervention groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.27, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.5 ).\n\n【284】##### Severe adverse events: renal failure (needing renal replacement therapy)\n\n【285】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【286】Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing renal failure between the intervention arms (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.90, 125 patients) ( Analysis 1.6 ). No details as to timing and severity of dysfunction were provided.\n\n【287】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【288】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【289】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【290】Ye 2013 reported data for this outcome. There was a difference in the number of patients experiencing renal failure, with patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB being less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.79, 309 patients) ( Analysis 1.6 ).\n\n【291】##### Severe adverse events: infection\n\n【292】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【293】Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients who had systemic inflammatory response syndrome between the intervention arms (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.32, 125 patients) ( Analysis 1.7 ).\n\n【294】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【295】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【296】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【297】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients who had an infection at some time during their hospital admission between the washed and unwashed red blood cell intervention arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.99, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.7 ). In all cases, a diagnosis of an infection was supported by culture data.\n\n【298】##### Severe adverse events: haemorrhage (return to theatre for bleeding)\n\n【299】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【300】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity. Neither trial reported a difference in the number of patients experiencing a haemorrhage requiring a return to theatre for bleeding between their intervention arms (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.03, 60 patients, Cholette 2011 ; RR 2.95, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.13, 125 patients, Willems 2010 ) ( Analysis 1.8 ).\n\n【301】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【302】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【303】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【304】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing a haemorrhage requiring a return to theatre for bleeding between the washed and unwashed red blood cell intervention groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.03, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.8 ).\n\n【305】##### Haematocrit/haemoglobin (g/dL) levels postoperatively\n\n【306】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【307】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical and timing of outcome measurement diversity. There was a difference in haemoglobin concentrations after the first postoperative transfusion between the intervention arms favouring the restrictive threshold group in one trial (MD ‐1.20 g/dL, 95% CI ‐1.61 to ‐0.79, 125 patients, Willems 2010 ). The second trial found no difference in haemoglobin concentrations between the intervention arms when measured postoperatively (MD 0.10 g/dL, 95% CI ‐4.01 to 4.21, Cholette 2011 ) ( Analysis 1.9 ).\n\n【308】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【309】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【310】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【311】Han 2004 , Liu 2007 , and Ye 2013 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity. In all three trials, there was a difference in haematocrit levels postoperatively between the intervention arms. In Han 2004 , the difference favoured the CPB prime containing red blood cells (MD ‐3.90%, 95% CI ‐4.35 to ‐3.45, 36 patients); in Liu 2007 , the difference favoured the processed red blood cell group (MD 23.30%, 95% CI 6.01 to 40.59, 16 patients). In Ye 2013 , the difference favoured the cell salvage group (MD 1.19%, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.35, 309 patients) ( Analysis 1.9 ).\n\n【312】##### Haematocrit/haemoglobin (g/dL) levels at discharge\n\n【313】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【314】##### Volume or number of red blood cell units transfused\n\n【315】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【316】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity and how the outcome was measured. In one trial, there was a difference in the mean number of red blood cell units transfused within 48 hours of paediatric cardiac intensive care unit (PCICU) admission, favouring the restrictive threshold group (MD ‐1.67 units, 95% CI ‐2.15 to ‐1.19, 60 patients, Cholette 2011 ).\n\n【317】Willems 2010 reported no difference in the volume of red blood cell units transfused between intervention arms (MD ‐1.00 mL/kg, 95% CI ‐2.35 to 0.35, 125 patients) ( Analysis 1.10 ). Willems 2010 also reported the total number of transfusions (13 in the restrictive red blood cell trigger group and 82 in the liberal group).\n\n【318】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【319】Komai 1998 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the mean number of red blood cell units transfused across the study period between the intervention arms (MD 0.30 units, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.92, 46 patients) ( Analysis 1.10 ).\n\n【320】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【321】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the mean number of red blood cell units transfused over the entire hospitalisation period between the washed and unwashed red blood cell intervention groups (MD ‐0.30 units, 95% CI ‐1.62 to 1.02, 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.10 ).\n\n【322】##### Volume or number of other blood products transfused (i.e. fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate)\n\n【323】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【324】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported the number of patients receiving fresh frozen plasma and Willems 2010 reported the number of patients receiving platelets. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity and the timing of the outcome measurement. There was no difference between intervention arms in the number of patients receiving fresh frozen plasma in the first 48 hours after admission (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.83, 60 patients) ( Cholette 2011 ); in the number of patients receiving fresh frozen plasma up to 28 days following randomisation (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.36, 125 patients) ( Willems 2010 ), or in the number of patients receiving platelets up to 28 days following randomisation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.37, 125 patients) ( Willems 2010 ) ( Analysis 1.11 ; Analysis 1.12 ).\n\n【325】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【326】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【327】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【328】Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the mean number of platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate units transfused over the entire hospitalisation period between the washed and unwashed red blood cell intervention groups (platelets: MD ‐0.30 units, 95% CI ‐0.67 to 0.07; fresh frozen plasma: MD ‐0.17 units, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.13; cryoprecipitate: MD ‐0.11 units, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 0.05; 128 patients) ( Analysis 1.13 ; Analysis 1.14 ; Analysis 1.15 ).\n\n【329】##### Postoperative chest drain output\n\n【330】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【331】Cholette 2011 (with 60 patients) reported data for this outcome. There was no difference in the mean volume of postoperative mediastinal tube drainage between the intervention arms at postoperative day 0 (MD ‐0.20 mL/kg/hour, 95% CI ‐0.88 to 0.48, 60 patients), postoperative day 1 (MD ‐0.20 mL/kg/hour, 95% CI ‐1.19 to 0.79, 60 patients) and postoperative day 2 (MD ‐0.20 mL/kg/hour, 95% CI ‐1.87 to 1.47, 60 patients) ( Analysis 1.16 ).\n\n【332】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【333】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【334】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【335】Cholette 2012 and Ye 2013 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity and differences in how the outcome was measured. In both trials, there was no difference between the intervention arms in the mean duration of postoperative chest drain output (MD 0.14 days, 95% CI ‐1.66 to 1.94, 128 patients, Cholette 2012 ) or in the mean volume of postoperative chest drain output (MD ‐0.18 mL/kg, 95% CI ‐2.20 to 1.84, 309 patients, Ye 2013 ) ( Analysis 1.16 ).\n\n【336】##### Duration of mechanical ventilation\n\n【337】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【338】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity and the method of statistical analysis. Cholette 2011 reported the length of mechanical ventilation as median (plus interquartile range). The restrictive threshold group requiring a greater duration of mechanical ventilation than the liberal threshold group. The skew of this data prevents a conversion to mean (and SD). Median values are reported in Table 3 . In the second trial ( Willems 2010 ), there was no difference in the length of mechanical ventilation between the treatment arms after randomisation (MD ‐0.70 hours, 95% CI ‐2.01 to 0.61, 125 patients) and for total PICU stay (MD ‐0.10 hours, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 1.28, 125 patients) (see Figure 5).\n\n【339】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【340】de Vries 2004 and Komai 1998 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity and the method of statistical analysis. de Vries 2004 reported intubation time as median (plus interquartile range). The non‐leukoreduced group required a greater duration of mechanical ventilation than the leukoreduced group. The skew of this data prevents a conversion to mean (and SD). Median values are reported in Table 3 . In the second trial ( Komai 1998 ), there was no difference in intubation time between the two groups (MD ‐7.20 hours, 95% CI ‐20.62 to 6.22, 48 patients) ( Analysis 1.17 ).\n\n【341】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【342】Shimpo 2001 , Cholette 2012 , and Ye 2013 reported measuring this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to lack of suitable data. Two trials reported intubation time as median (plus interquartile range) ( Cholette 2012 ; Ye 2013 ). In Cholette 2012 , the comparator group (unwashed red blood cells) required a greater duration of mechanical ventilation than the interventions group (washed red cell group), while in Ye 2013 , the intervention group (cell salvage) required a greater duration of mechanical ventilation than the control group. The skew of this data prevents a conversion to mean (and SD). Median values are reported in Table 3 . No data were reported by the third trial ( Shimpo 2001 ).\n\n【343】##### Duration of intensive care unit stay\n\n【344】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【345】Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay between the restrictive and liberal threshold in both trials (MD 1.20 days, 95% CI ‐1.38 to 3.78, 60 patients, Cholette 2011 ; MD ‐0.40 days, 95% CI ‐2.42 to 1.62, 125 patients, Willems 2010 ) (Figure 6).\n\n【346】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【347】de Vries 2004 and Komai 1998 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity. de Vries 2004 reported similar lengths of median ICU stay for both groups. Median values are reported in Table 4 . In Komai 1998 , there was no difference in the duration of ICU stay between the two groups (MD ‐1.10 days, 95% CI ‐2.21 to 0.01, 46 patients) (Figure 6).\n\n【348】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【349】Shimpo 2001 and Cholette 2012 reported data for this outcome. We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity in the intervention arms. In Shimpo 2001 , there was a difference in the mean length of ICU stay favouring the ultrafiltration treated arm (MD ‐16.00 hours, 95% CI ‐21.89 to ‐10.11, 100 patients), but in Cholette 2012 , there was no difference in the mean length of stay in paediatric cardiac intensive care between the washed and unwashed red blood cell intervention groups (MD ‐0.30 days, 95% CI ‐4.32 to 3.72, 128 patients) (Figure 6).\n\n【350】##### Re‐hospitalisation rates\n\n【351】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【352】##### Biochemistry levels (outcome identified and added post‐hoc)\n\n【353】###### Restrictive transfusion trigger versus liberal transfusion trigger\n\n【354】Cholette 2011 measured lactate levels. There was no difference in mean lactate level between the intervention arms at baseline (RR ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.73 to 0.53, 60 patients) and the 'peak' level during the initial 48‐hour postoperative period (RR ‐0.10, 95% CI ‐0.81 to 0.61, 60 patients) ( Analysis 1.19 ).\n\n【355】###### Leukoreduced red cell transfusion versus non‐leukoreduced red cell transfusion\n\n【356】No trial reported data for this outcome.\n\n【357】###### Standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime versus non‐standard cardiopulmonary bypass prime\n\n【358】Five trials measured this outcome _(_ Cholette 2012 ; Hosking 1990 ; Liu 2007 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Swindell 2007 ). We did not undertake a meta‐analysis due to clinical diversity in the nature of intervention.\n\n【359】###### Lactate levels\n\n【360】Cholette 2012 , Liu 2007 , and Swindell 2007 measured lactate levels at different time points ( Analysis 1.19 ). A difference was observed in mean lactate levels in two of these trials at different time points. In Liu 2007 , there was a difference in lactate levels between the two groups favouring the processed packed red cells for the priming arm immediately after CPB with the clamp of arterial cannula (MD ‐1.60 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐2.65 to ‐0.55, 16 patients). In Swindell 2007 , there was a difference in lactate levels on CPB prime prior to bypass (MD ‐2.00 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.94 to ‐3.06, 22 patients) and during re‐warming at 28°C (MD ‐1.40 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐2.54 to ‐0.26, 22 patients). Comparisons for all three trials are available in Analysis 1.19 .\n\n【361】###### Sodium levels\n\n【362】Shimpo 2001 and Swindell 2007 measured sodium levels. Shimpo 2001 measured sodium levels before and after ultrafiltration in the patients who were treated with ultrafiltrated red blood cells only. Sodium levels remained within a clinically accepted normal range following receipt of ultrafiltrated red blood cells. Shimpo 2001 did not report the sodium levels for patients not receiving ultrafiltrated red blood cells, therefore, no further comparison of this outcome can be made.\n\n【363】In Swindell 2007 , there was a difference in sodium levels on CPB prime prior to bypass (MD 4.00 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.94 to 7.06, 22 patients); during re‐warming at 36°C (MD 3.10 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.44 to 5.76, 22 patients); and immediately after CPB with clamp of arterial cannula (MD 4.00 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.19 to 6.81, 22 patients). However, it should be notes that both sodium levels in the CPB circuit prime after line connection were not within normal clinical value ranges and would be of clinical concern. At the later time points (at 36°C during re‐warming and immediately after CPB with clamp of arterial cannula) the sodium levels were within normal clinical levels. All comparisons for this trial are available in Analysis 1.20 .\n\n【364】###### Potassium levels\n\n【365】Shimpo 2001 and Swindell 2007 measured potassium levels. Shimpo 2001 measured potassium levels before and after ultrafiltration in the patients who were treated with ultrafiltrated red blood cells only. Potassium levels fell to within a clinically accepted normal range following receipt of ultrafiltrated red blood cells. Shimpo 2001 did not report the potassium levels for patients not receiving ultrafiltrated red blood cells, therefore, no further comparison of this outcome can be made. In Swindell 2007 , there was a difference in potassium levels on CPB prime prior to bypass (MD ‐5.50 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐6.31 to ‐4.69, 22 patients); at 28°C during re‐warming (MD ‐1.90 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐2.71 to ‐1.09); and immediately after CPB with clamp of arterial cannula (MD ‐1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐1.44 to ‐0.56, 22 patients) ( Analysis 1.21 ).\n\n【366】###### Blood glucose levels\n\n【367】In Hosking 1990 measured blood glucose levels. There was a difference in blood glucose level favouring the washed red blood cells at four time points: in the bypass priming solution prior to initiation of CPB (MD ‐282.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐315.06 to ‐248.94, 20 patients); 10 minutes after the initiation of CPB (MD ‐132.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐147.64 to ‐116.36, 20 patients); prior to separation from bypass (MD ‐134.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐168.44 to ‐99.56, 20 patients); and after the administration of protamine (MD ‐117.00 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐151.31 to ‐82.69, 20 patients). Two patients, one in each group, had a blood glucose concentration less than 60 mg/dL (outside that accepted normal range) in the pre‐bypass period. The patient in the washed red blood cell group received two doses of glucose to correct the low glucose before the start of CPB. The other patient did not require treatment to correct their low glucose level before starting CPB. All comparisons for this trial are available in Analysis 1.22 .\n\n【368】Discussion\n----------\n\n【369】The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of red cell transfusion on mortality and morbidity on patients with congenital heart disease at the time of cardiac surgery. We identified 11 completed RCTs including 862 patients to evaluate red cell transfusion in three intervention areas: two trials explored transfusion triggers, two trials explored the benefit of leukoreduction and seven trials explored non‐standard CPB. All trials were in neonatal or paediatric populations and there was a mix of cyanotic and acyanotic patients included across the trials.\n\n【370】### Summary of main results\n\n【371】The 11 studies included in this review were heterogeneous in terms of study population, interventions, outcomes and data quality. Therefore, we were unable to pool any data and the analysis is descriptive.\n\n【372】#### Transfusion triggers\n\n【373】The two transfusion strategy trials showed no clear difference in mortality between the liberal and restrictive intervention arms ( Cholette 2011; Willems 2010 ). Cholette 2011 and Willems 2010 also showed no significant difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or the duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms.\n\n【374】Willems 2010 showed no clear difference in the incidence of adverse cardiac events, acute lung injury and renal failure between intervention arms but showed an increase in the incidence of infection events in the liberal transfusion group. Both trials demonstrated no clear difference in postoperative haemorrhage rates between intervention arms ( Cholette 2011; Willems 2010 ). As expected, both trials showed the liberal transfusion groups received more red cell transfusions. However, neither trial showed any significant difference in the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or platelets between the two groups. Both trials showed the restrictive groups had a significantly lower haemoglobin concentration for the ICU period at the specific time points each trial measured.\n\n【375】The results suggest that restricting red blood cell transfusion is not detrimental to the survival of either acyanotic or cyanotic congenital cardiac patients. However, a restrictive transfusion trigger may prolong the ICU stay for the cyanotic population and a liberal transfusion trigger may increase the incidence of infection for the acyanotic population but both studies were inadequately powered to detect statistical differences in these clinical outcomes so conclusions are difficult.\n\n【376】#### Leukoreduction\n\n【377】Leukoreduction aims to reduce the deleterious effects of leukocytes from allogeneic red cell transfusions. For duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care, Komai 1998 (acyanotic population) showed a statistically non‐significant shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and a statistically significant shorter length of ICU stay for the leukoreduced group. In contrast, de Vries 2004 (mixed cyanotic and acyanotic population) showed no statistically significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay between groups. Most of the other main outcomes of interest were not reported by the two studies in this intervention ( de Vries 2004 ; Komai 1998 ).\n\n【378】There were only two studies in this intervention area and they gave contrasting results with respect to the impact of leukoreduction. In addition, the patient populations were different. Therefore, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions for this intervention.\n\n【379】#### Standard versus non‐standard bypass\n\n【380】The aim of processing (washing) red blood cells that are added to the cardiopulmonary prime and returned to the patient is to reduce or eliminate any potential adverse effects of the altered biochemistry of stored allogeneic red blood cells.\n\n【381】Washing (pre‐processing) red cells added to the CPB prime did not result in any clear difference in mortality for either of the two trials that reported mortality ( Cholette 2012 , early and late mortality; Liu 2007 , early mortality). Ultrafiltration ( Shimpo 2001 ) and cell salvage ( Ye 2013 ) did not result in any clear difference in mortality. Han 2004 (bloodless bypass prime) did not report mortality.\n\n【382】Washing bypass prime red cells did not result in any clear difference in adverse events of infection, thrombosis, arrhythmias and postoperative bleeding in the one trial that reported all of these outcomes ( Cholette 2012 ). Cell salvage did not result in any clear difference in respiratory morbidity but the incidence of an increase in serum creatinine more than two‐fold 72 hours after the operation was significantly lower in the cell salvage group ( Ye 2013 ). No patients in either group required dialysis postoperatively.\n\n【383】Unsurprisingly, a bloodless bypass prime showed lower haematocrit levels during bypass (statistical significance not reported; Han 2004 ). Processing prime red blood cells significantly increased haematocrit at 10 minutes during bypass and at the end of bypass ( Liu 2007 ). Cell salvage significantly increased the haematocrit level on the first postoperative day but not at any other time points at baseline, during bypass or just after bypass ( Ye 2013 ).\n\n【384】Washing bypass prime red cells did not result in any clear differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay ( Cholette 2012 ). Cell salvage did not result in any clear difference in duration of mechanical ventilation ( Ye 2013 ). The study did not report length of ICU stay. Ultrafiltration resulted in a significantly reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay ( Shimpo 2001 ).\n\n【385】The different methods of washing (processing) bypass prime red cells resulted in significant reductions in potassium levels at various time points in two studies; Liu 2007 before CPB and Swindell 2007 prior to red cell addition to the bypass prime, throughout bypass and immediately post bypass. Ultrafiltration also reduced potassium levels with Shimpo 2001 reporting ultrafiltrated priming blood had a significantly lower potassium level when compared with pre‐ultrafiltration.\n\n【386】Lactate levels were variably affected by the washing (processing) techniques. Liu 2007 showed processed packed red blood cells with continuous autologous transfusion system (CATS) had significantly higher lactate levels before CPB and lower lactate levels at 10 minutes during and at the end of CPB. However, Swindell 2007 showed significantly lower lactate levels in the washed packed red blood cells prior to addition to the bypass prime but no significant difference in lactate levels between the two groups during bypass apart from at 28°C re‐warming when the unwashed group showed a significantly higher lactate level. Cholette 2012 reported no significant difference in either ICU admission lactate or peak ICU lactate levels between the two groups.\n\n【387】Overall, the studies were too heterogeneous in terms of patient populations and exact intervention types to make accurate conclusions about the impact of washing (processing) red cells. It does appear that washing and ultrafiltration reduces potassium levels. The data on lactate are less clear.\n\n【388】The important outcome for a bloodless bypass prime was intraoperative cerebral oxygen saturations, as reported by one trial ( Han 2004 ). The crystalloid prime group showed significantly lower cerebral oxygen saturations when compared with blood containing prime three minutes after initiating bypass and 15 minutes after the start of re‐warming. This may suggest excessive haemodilution in the bloodless bypass prime but the clinical significance of this is unknown as the trial did not specifically report neurological outcomes post surgery.\n\n【389】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【390】The trials included in this review are insufficient to address the objectives of our systematic review. There are gaps in the evidence base in terms of patient population (we found no trials in adults), interventions (no trials examined the interventions of volumes of red cell transfusion, whole blood versus packed red cells or the age of red cells transfused), and the completeness of outcomes measured and reported by the included trials. Our primary outcome was reported by only five included trials. No trials reported data for two outcomes: stroke and re‐hospitalisation rates. The number of trials providing data for individual outcomes ranged from one (thromboembolism) to seven (duration of mechanical ventilation and biochemistry levels). The outcome of biochemistry levels was added post hoc as it became clear during data extraction (and following consultation with clinical colleagues) that the outcome was of clinical significance to this review question, but had been overlooked when we prepared the protocol.\n\n【391】The trials that do exist are not in sufficient numbers or homogeneity to pool results for any of the outcomes of interest to this review. This may limit the applicability of the evidence within this review.\n\n【392】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【393】Overall, it was difficult to assess the quality of the evidence accurately as much information was lacking; many elements of trial quality in each trial were marked as having an unclear risk of bias. Attrition was low across all included trials. We assessed five trials as having elements of high risk of bias on method of randomisation ( Komai 1998 ), method of allocation concealment ( de Vries 2004 ), blinding of study personnel ( Cholette 2011; Cholette 2012; Willems 2010 ), and blinding of outcome assessors ( Cholette 2012 ). Blinding would be difficult to achieve for some interventions within this review. Although, as none of the outcomes were patient reported, we did not deem blinding of participants to be an important risk of bias.\n\n【394】The sample size of the 11 included trials was generally small. Only four trials had greater than 50 patients in each treatment arm included in the analysis of outcome data ( Cholette 2012 ; Shimpo 2001 ; Willems 2010 ; Ye 2013 ). This may well reflect the nature of the condition of interest to this review, but does limit the statistical power of these trials to detect differences in outcomes of interest in this clinical area.\n\n【395】As has already been noted, the substantial clinical diversity in the included trials and the variability in outcome data reported has prevented any pooling of outcome data, thus the consistency (or inconsistency of results across the included trials is difficult to ascertain. Addressing such variability should be a key component of future research in this area.\n\n【396】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【397】We identified no biases in the review process. The strengths of this review lie in the robust and comprehensive methodology employed to find and assess all relevant trials. We have followed standard Cochrane methods for data extraction and results analysis with reference to the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (_ Higgins 2011 ), and have referred to a statistician where necessary. We have had a clinician and methodologist working on all stages, independently of each other to control any bias that ensues due to clinical or systematic review methodology knowledge. When we were limited by a lack of reporting data to allow inclusion and assessment of trials, we successfully contacted authors directly to obtain the necessary data.\n\n【398】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【399】To date, as far as we are aware, there have been no other systematic reviews specifically examining the effects of red cell transfusion on mortality and morbidity on the congenital heart disease population at the time of cardiac surgery ( Dorée 2010 ). Guzzetta 2011 reviewed the risks and benefits of red cell transfusion and concluded that the efficacy of red cell transfusion has never been equivocally shown even in well‐designed trials and further well‐designed trials are needed in this heterogeneous population. Our review would appear to agree with this conclusion.\n\n【400】Figures and Tables -\n\n【401】Figure 1\n\n【402】Study flow diagram.\n\n【403】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new

To compare the effects of group antenatal care versus conventional antenatal care on psychosocial, physiological and labour and birth outcomes for women and their babies.\n    \n2.  To compare the effects of group antenatal care versus conventional antenatal care on care provider satisfaction.\n    \n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】#### Antenatal care\n\n【7】Antenatal care is one of the key preventative health services used around the world. In most Western countries, antenatal care traditionally involves a schedule of one‐to‐one visits with a care provider (midwife, obstetrician or GP). It has been suggested that the effectiveness of conventional antenatal care and the scope and practice is based more on tradition and ritual than on evidence ( Villar 2001 ). Antenatal care in Western countries is often offered in a hospital or clinic setting, where women are often made to wait for long periods of time to receive fragmented antenatal care from a range of practitioners. In a large cohort study assessing satisfaction with conventional antenatal care, approximately one in five women reported being dissatisfied with the care they received ( Hildingsson 2005 ). Women who saw more than three health practitioners in their pregnancy were more likely to be dissatisfied. The overwhelming majority of women (97%) view continuity of caregiver as important or very important ( Hildingsson 2002 ), although access to these models of care are often limited. New and innovative models of antenatal care have the potential to improve outcomes for women and babies and increase maternal and care provider satisfaction with antenatal care.\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】#### Group antenatal care\n\n【10】A different way of providing antenatal care is through a group model rather than on a one‐to‐one basis. Group antenatal care has been tested extensively in the USA in a model known as CenteringPregnancy. Developed by Sharon Schindler Rising ( Rising 1998 ), CenteringPregnancy is an innovative approach to antenatal care by providing care in groups of eight to twelve women of similar gestational age. Groups meet eight to ten times during pregnancy (at the usual scheduled gestations for antenatal care) with sessions running for 90 to 120 minutes. All antenatal care is provided by a midwife or obstetrician in this group setting. Physical assessments such as fundal height and fetal heart rate take place in the group room, but are undertaken as an individual assessment beside the group to maintain privacy. The groups integrate the usual antenatal assessment with information, education and peer support. There is also an emphasis on engaging women more fully in their own health assessments. Women with high‐risk issues during pregnancy also receive concurrent care with a specialist obstetrician or physician in addition to attending CenteringPregnancy groups.\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】It is believed that providing antenatal care in groups will lead to greater social support by linking women with other pregnant women at similar gestational ages. Conventional models of antenatal care often have limited opportunities for women to make social contacts with other pregnant women. Social support during pregnancy has been associated with seeking antenatal care, intentions to breastfeed, fewer labour complications, increased infant birthweight, higher Apgar scores at birth, and a reduction in the risk of postnatal depression ( Logsdon 2003 ).\n\n【13】CenteringPregnancy, as one model of group antenatal care, allows for more time in antenatal care, with women receiving between 12 and 20 hours of care in a group setting compared with an estimated two to three hours (eight to ten visits of 15 to 20 minutes duration) during conventional antenatal care. This would likely result in greater education about pregnancy, childbirth and early parenting, which may in turn affect perinatal outcomes. Results from randomised and non‐randomised trials have shown that CenteringPregnancy is associated with a reduction in hospital emergency room visits during the third trimester ( Rising 1998 ), a decrease in prematurity ( Ickovics 2007 ), a reduction in risk of preterm birth and low birthweight babies ( Grady 2004 ; Ickovics 2003 ), an increase in pregnancy knowledge ( Baldwin 2006 ) and a high rate of satisfaction with care ( Rising 1998 ).\n\n【14】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【15】Many of the studies conducted on group antenatal care have been carried out in populations at high risk of premature birth or low birthweight due to age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Results from these studies may therefore be difficult to generalise to wider populations.\n\n【16】This systematic review of randomised controlled trials will test the hypothesis that group antenatal care improves outcomes for women and their babies compared with conventional antenatal care as well as increasing maternal and care provider satisfaction with antenatal care. This review will include models of CenteringPregnancy as well as other models that provide antenatal care in a group setting.\n\n【17】This review would be of interest to women and their families, health professionals, policy makers and administrators.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】1.  To compare the effects of group antenatal care versus conventional antenatal care on psychosocial, physiological and labour and birth outcomes for women and their babies.\n    \n2.  To compare the effects of group antenatal care versus conventional antenatal care on care provider satisfaction.\n    \n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】All identified published, unpublished and ongoing randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing group antenatal care with conventional antenatal care will be included. Randomised controlled trials using all types of designs (such as parallel group and cluster randomisation) will be considered for inclusion. Crossover randomised designs are not appropriate for this intervention and will not be included in the review.\n\n【24】Studies which address group antenatal education but do not provide antenatal care and assessment (i.e. assessment of fetal wellbeing, maternal blood pressure, urinalysis) in the group will be excluded as group antenatal education is an adjunct to standard antenatal care.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Pregnant women.\n\n【27】#### Types of interventions\n\n【28】Group antenatal care or CenteringPregnancy. This is defined as women receiving the majority of their antenatal care in a group rather than conventional one‐on‐one care. Group antenatal care differs from group antenatal education as all aspects of antenatal care are performed in the group setting, including assessment of fetal wellbeing. The comparison group will be women receiving conventional antenatal care, one‐on‐one with a care provider (midwife/obstetrician/GP).\n\n【29】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】1.  Gestational age at delivery (preterm birth defined as birth occurring before 37 completed gestational weeks; very preterm birth defined as birth occurring before 34 completed gestational weeks).\n    \n2.

Fetal/infant mortality.\n    \n\n【32】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【33】1.  Maternal satisfaction.\n    \n2.  Breastfeeding initiation (self‐reported).\n    \n3.

The Trials Search Co‐ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.\n\n【41】We will not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【42】#### Searching other resources\n\n【43】We will contact known investigators in the relevant area to obtain data from any unpublished work and review reference lists of retrieved articles for any further studies of relevance to the review.\n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】Two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. Data will be entered into Review Manager software ( RevMan 2008 ) and checked for accuracy.\n\n【49】When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.\n\n【50】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【51】Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2008 ). Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor.\n\n【52】##### (1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【53】We will describe for each included study the methods used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.\n\n【54】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【55】*   adequate (e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);\n    \n*   inadequate (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【56】##### (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【57】We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【58】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【59】*   adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);\n    \n*   inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【60】##### (3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)\n\n【61】Blinding of participants is not possible given the intervention. We will note where there has been outcome assessment blinding (e.g. where it has not been possible to blind participants but where outcome assessment is carried out without knowledge of group assignment).\n\n【62】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【63】*   adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.\n    \n\n【64】We will then make a separate judgement about whether any lack of blinding is likely to have introduced bias.\n\n【65】##### (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)\n\n【66】We will describe for each included study the completeness of outcome data for each main outcome, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and any re‐inclusions in analyses which we undertake.\n\n【67】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【68】*   adequate (e.g. where there was no missing data or where reasons for missing data are balanced across groups);\n    \n*   inadequate (e.g. where missing data are likely to be related to outcomes or are not balanced across groups, or where high levels of missing data are likely to introduce serious bias or make the interpretation of results difficult);\n    \n*   unclear (e.g. where there is insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit a judgement to be made).\n    \n\n【69】##### (5) Selective reporting bias\n\n【70】We will describe for each included study how the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was examined by us and what we found.\n\n【71】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【72】*   adequate (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre‐specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);\n    \n*   inadequate (where not all the study’s pre‐specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre‐specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【73】##### (6) Other sources of bias\n\n【74】We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias. For example, was there a potential source of bias related to the specific study design? Was the trial stopped early due to some data‐dependent process? Was there extreme baseline imbalance? Has the study been claimed to be fraudulent?\n\n【75】We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:\n\n【76】*   yes;\n    \n*   no;\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【77】##### (7) Overall risk of bias\n\n【78】We will make explicit judgements about risk of bias for important outcomes both within and across studies. With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.  We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses ‐ _see '_ Sensitivity analysis '.\n\n【79】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【80】We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software ( RevMan 2008 ). We will use fixed‐effect meta‐analyses for combining data where there is little unexplained heterogeneity. Where there is heterogeneity, where results are being pooled from studies examining different interventions, or where it is not clear that the same outcome is being measured in all studies, we will use random‐effects meta‐analyses.\n\n【81】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【82】For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【83】##### Continuous data\n\n【84】For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.\n\n【85】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【86】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【87】We will include cluster‐randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in Gates 2005 using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co‐efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster‐randomised trials and individually‐randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.\n\n【88】We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta‐analysis.\n\n【89】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【90】For included studies, levels of attrition will be noted. The impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis.\n\n【91】##### Intention‐to‐treat analysis\n\n【92】For all outcomes analyses will be carried out, as far as possible, on an intention‐to‐treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.\n\n【93】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【94】We will apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, using the I² statistic. If we identify substantial heterogeneity among the trials (I² > 50%) we will explore it by pre‐specified subgroup analysis and perform sensitivity analyses. A random‐effects meta‐analysis will be used as an overall summary if this is considered appropriate _._\n\n【95】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【96】Where we suspect reporting bias ( _see_ 'Selective reporting bias' above), we will attempt to contact study authors asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results will be explored by a sensitivity analysis **.**\n\n【97】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【98】We will conduct planned subgroup analyses classifying whole trials by interaction tests as described by Deeks 2001 .\n\n【99】We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【100】1.  a dose‐related response based on the number of groups sessions (less than four versus greater than or equal to four);\n    \n2.  specific groups versus all women (e.g. adolescent women, settings of antenatal care (community versus hospital), socioeconomic status, ethnicity).\n    \n\n【101】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【102】We will carry out sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of trial quality for important outcomes in the review.  Where there is risk of bias associated with a particular aspect of study quality (e.g. inadequate allocation concealment), this will be explored by sensitivity analyses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e7846afb-4222-4575-8d20-78570c61dae9", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】1.To assess the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents.\n\n【3】2.To evaluate the safety of acupuncture as a treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents.\n\n【4】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【5】Background\n----------\n\n【6】The defining features of Attention‐Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity ( APA 2000 ). In individuals with ADHD, these behaviours are present for at least six months “at levels higher than is typical for their stage of development, are present early in life (currently defined as before age 7), and cause impairment” ( Pelham 2006 ). DSM‐IV ( APA 1994 ) divides ADHD into three subtypes according to the nature of the symptoms: (1) predominantly inattentive type (ADHD‐I); (2) predominantly hyperactive‐impulsive type (ADHD‐HI); and (3) combined type (ADHD‐C).  The inattentive subtype consists of individuals who exhibit inattentive behaviours but not hyperactive/impulsive behaviours whereas the hyperactive/impulsive subtype consists of the reverse, and individuals with the combined subtype have both ( James 2008 , Pelham 2006 ).\n\n【7】### Description of the condition\n\n【8】In the 1970s, ADHD was known as hyperkinesis (Latin for 'superactive') or hyperactivity, and in the 1980s as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). ADD  could be diagnosed with or without hyperactivity.  Currently, the condition is referred to as ADHD, a term which includes various subtypes. Subtyping allows for the fact that in different people, presentation of inattention and hyperactivity may vary. “Thus,” as Brassett‐Harknett and Butler conclude “changes in nosology reflects the developments in research; ADHD better describes the clinical phenomena” ( Brassett‐Harknett 2007 ).\n\n【9】According to a recent review of aetiology, “prevalence figures for childhood ADHD, based on clinical populations, range from 3% to 10%, and the maximum age risk lies somewhere between 5 and 10 years” ( Brassett‐Harknett 2007 , citing APA 1994 ; Costello 1989 ; Parr 2003 ). Some epidemiological studies have claimed higher prevalence rates for ADHD, ranging from 9% to 19%( Paule 2000 ; Taylor 1991 ), suggesting that under‐diagnosis may be common. Figures vary according by the definition or diagnostic criteria used, the nationality, size and selection of the sample; and/or by the subtype under study.\n\n【10】Brassett‐Harknett writes further that “research into the etiology of ADHD has revealed genetic, biochemical, environmental, and social factors”. Both Hill 2001 and Taylor 1991 maintained that ADHD “is a syndrome caused by several different pathologies, among which a genetic susceptibility seemed to be the most common.” Although environmental factors cannot be ignored, research from family, twin and adoption studies points to a substantial genetic component in the aetiology of ADHD. Heritability estimates range from 0.50 to 0.98; in monozygotic twins, ADHD concordance rates are in the higher range of 0.80‐0.98 ( Faraone 2000a ; Faraone 2000b ; Faraone 2000d ; Gjone 1996 ; Pennington 1996 ). It has thus been proposed that “hyperactive‐impulsive type ADHD tends to 'breed true' but inattentive and combined subtypes do not ( Faraone 2000c )” ( Brassett‐Harknett 2007 ).\n\n【11】### Description of the intervention\n\n【12】#### Management of ADHD\n\n【13】##### Pharmacological treatments\n\n【14】Pharmacotherapy (as well as a variety of behavioral techniques) remains the “mainstay” of treatment options ( DeNisco 2005 ). The three primary types of pharmacological treatment used in AD/HD are: psychostimulants, nonstimulant‐noradrenergic reuptake blockers, and \\[alpha\\]‐agonist antihypertensive agents (Scheres 2005).  According to DeNisco et al., psychostimulants are the most prescribed psychotropic agent for children, especially for the treatment of AD/HD ( DeNisco 2005 ).  There are significant data to support the safety, efficacy, and reliability of stimulant agents in improving core symptoms of AD/HD( DeNisco 2005 ; Spencer 2000 ; AAP 2001a ).\n\n【15】Amphetamine preparations and methylphenidate preparations are still the first‐line agents in ADHD management ( AACP 1997 ). Over the past 30 years, the most common therapy for ADHD has been short‐acting immediate release stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Adderall), and pemoline (Cylert) ( Spencer 2000 ). All three stimulants increase synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, although the specific molecular mechanisms of action differ ( Spencer 2000 ). Many studies have reported the short‐term efficacy of these medications, especially methylphenidate, in the treatment of ADHD with positive effects on disruptive symptoms and academic activity ( Spencer 2000 ); however, adverse effects may include a decrease in appetite, headaches, abdominal discomfort, sleep difficulties, irritability, and social withdrawal. Other adverse effects may occur “in children on too high a dosage or those who are overly sensitive to stimulants and may appear emotionally flat or overly restricted” ( DeNisco 2005 ; also, Pliszka 2000 ).\n\n【16】Clonidine (Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are \\[alpha\\]‐2 agonists that are also occasionally used for the treatment of ADHD, especially if there are conduct issues present ( Spencer 2000 ; Pliszka 2000 ; Geenhill 2002 ). Clonidine has powerful sedative properties, useful for those with sleep difficulties.\n\n【17】##### Behavioral treatments\n\n【18】Behavior therapy can also be useful in the treatment of ADHD. It involves specific interventions “that aim to modify the physical and social environment to alter or change behavior. It is also important to incorporate changes such as more structure, closer attention, and limitations of distractions ( DeNisco 2005 ; AAP 2001b ). “Behavior therapy is different from psychological interventions directed to the child and designed to change the child's emotional status (play therapy) or thought patterns (cognitive therapy or cognitive‐behavior therapy). These have little documented efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, but parent training in behavior therapy and classroom behavior interventions have successfully changed the behavior of children with ADHD” ( DeNisco 2005 ).\n\n【19】Chan et al. have written of the difficulties both parents and clinicians have in choosing an acceptable therapy for the young child with ADHD and concluded that due to increases in psychotropic prescriptions (even for the very young) it may be “important for clinicians caring for children with ADHD to be familiar with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and its role in ADHD” ( Chan 2002 ).\n\n【20】##### Acupuncture\n\n【21】Acupuncture originated in ancient China approximately 2,500 years ago and is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Acupuncture techniques involve insertion of needles and the stimulation of the needles may involve manual, electrical, heat, laser or other forms of stimulation.\n\n【22】### How the intervention might work\n\n【23】The theory of channels (or meridians) and collaterals has directed the clinical practice of Chinese medicine for thousands of years and provides the theoretical basis for acupuncture. \"Physiologically, the channels and collaterals are considered to be a series of connecting passages through which qi and blood circulate to regulate the functions of the zang‐fu organs, tissues, and sense organs\" ( TCM Basics 2008 ).\n\n【24】In the main course of a channel, there are many key points called acupuncture points. They are not isolated points on the skin, but are also connected with the organs. According to the location where needling is carried out “acupuncture can also be classified into body acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, auricular acupuncture and ankle‐wrist acupuncture” ( Zhang 2006 ). Stimulation of acupuncture points can treat diseases by regulating organ function, promoting the flow of 'Qi' and blood (nutrient‐blood) through the channels and collaterals, and improving the body’s ability to resist diseases. Qi and blood are very important concepts in Chinese medicine: the meaning of nutrient‐blood within TCM's conception of Qi is related, but not identical to, the circulation of blood as understood in Western medicine. According to the channels theory, the meaning of Qi originates from the needle induced sensation passing through the channels during acupuncture ( Jiang 2008 ).\n\n【25】A wide range of conditions (including ADHD) are thought to benefit from treatment with acupuncture; however, the mechanism for acupuncture's potential effect on ADHD is still being researched.\n\n【26】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【27】Acupuncture is reported to be a relatively simple, inexpensive and safe treatment compared to other conventional interventions, is acceptable to Chinese patients and has been widely used to improve severity of the core symptoms in patients with ADHD ( Li 2004 ; Wang 2006 ). As a therapeutic intervention, acupuncture is also increasingly practiced in some Western countries ( Kemper 2001 ; NIH 1998 ); however, existing evidence may not be rigorous enough for acupuncture to be recommended for routine use.\n\n【28】There are a large number of studies of the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in ADHD published in the world, especially in China, but not all demonstrate a beneficial effect on ADHD ( Cai 1999 ; Li 2004 ; Regina 2002 ; Wang 2006 ).  To our knowledge, systematic reviews of trials of acupuncture in ADHD have not yet been conducted. Whether or not acupuncture is effective for ADHD in children and adolescents is therefore still unknown.\n\n【29】The aim of this review was to systematically analyse all the randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for children and adolescents with ADHD to provide the best available evidence to inform clinical practice and further research planning on ADHD management.\n\n【30】Objectives\n----------\n\n【31】1.To assess the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents.\n\n【32】2.To evaluate the safety of acupuncture as a treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents.\n\n【33】Methods\n-------\n\n【34】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【35】#### Types of studies\n\n【36】Randomised controlled trials and quasi randomised controlled trials will be used to investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for children and adolescents with ADHD or ADD.\n\n【37】1\\. Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT's) comparing acupuncture with at least one control group that used placebo, sham treatment or conventional treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD.\n\n【38】2\\. Quasi‐randomised controlled trials can be defined as trials in which the allocation of patients into different groups was undertaken by means of sequential assignment (such as alternate date of referral, alternate case record numbers, dates of birth, day of the week or alphabetical order).\n\n【39】#### Types of participants\n\n【40】Participants (under the age of 18) diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hyperkinetic disorders (HKD) according to established diagnostic criteria. ADHD or ADD as determined by DSM‐III ( APA 1980 ; APA 1987 ) or DSM‐IV criteria ( APA 1994 ; APA 2000 ), diagnoses of Hyperkinetic Disorder as determined by ICD‐9 or ICD‐10 criteria ( WHO 1993 ). Adults will be excluded.\n\n【41】#### Types of interventions\n\n【42】Studies must use acupuncture techniques involving insertion of needles. Stimulation of the needles may involve manual, electrical, heat, laser or other forms of stimulation.\n\n【43】Control interventions may be:  placebo acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or other conventional treatment . Placebo acupuncture refers to a needle attached to the skin surface (not penetrating the skin but at the same acupoints) ( Van Tulder 2000 ). Sham acupuncture refers to:\n\n【44】(1) a needle placed in an area close to but not in the acupuncture points ( Van Tulder 2000 );\n\n【45】(2) subliminal skin electrostimulation via electrodes attached to the skin ( SCSSS 1999 ).\n\n【46】Comparisons investigated may include, if data are available:\n\n【47】(1) acupuncture only compared with placebo or sham treatment;\n\n【48】(2) acupuncture in addition to baseline medication or treatment compared with placebo or sham treatment in addition to baseline medication or treatment;\n\n【49】(3) acupuncture in addition to baseline medication or treatment compared with baseline medication or treatment alone.\n\n【50】Trials that compared different forms of acupuncture only will be excluded.\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】Trials reporting at least one of the following outcome measures will be included.\n\n【53】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【54】**A.

Possible adverse effects** (any adverse events as reported in trials) **:**\n\n【105】Fainting: can be due to nervous tension, hunger, fatigue, improper position or manipulation, such as overly forceful manipulation;\n\n【106】Stuck needle: local muscle spasm due to nervousness, heavy manipulations that cause muscle fibers to tighten around the needle;\n\n【107】Bent needle: may arise from unskillful manipulation, imbalanced force, overly applied force, or changes in the patient’s posture after insertion;\n\n【108】Broken needle: may result from the poor quality of the needle or eroded base of the needle, from strong muscle spasm, or a sudden movement of the patient when the needle is in place, or from withdrawing a stuck needle;\n\n【109】Hematoma: may arise from injury of the blood vessels during insertion, or from not pressing the point after withdrawing the needle;\n\n【110】Unendurable pain: may arise from unskillful manipulation or manipulation which is too forceful.\n\n【111】Depending on availability of data, we will attempt to classify adverse events as serious or non‐serious. Serious adverse events will be defined as any outward medical occurrence that was life threatening, resulted in death or persistent or significant disability, or any medical event which may have jeopardised the patient or required intervention to prevent it ( ICH‐GCP 1997 ). All other adverse events will be considered non‐serious.\n\n【112】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【113】#### Electronic searches\n\n【114】Databases will be searched without language restrictions for any paper mentioning acupuncture and its synonyms (acupuncture, electro‐acupuncture, body acupuncture, acupuncture points, auricular acupuncture, scalp acupuncture,etc.), and ADHD, and children and young people.\n\n【115】The following sources will be searched:\n\n【116】Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n\n【117】MEDLINE\n\n【118】PreMedline\n\n【119】AMED\n\n【120】BIOSIS\n\n【121】Centre for Complementary Medicine Research (University of Munich, Germany)\n\n【122】CISCOM (Research Council for Complementary Medicine)\n\n【123】CINAHL\n\n【124】EMBASE\n\n【125】ERIC\n\n【126】PsycINFO\n\n【127】The search strategy for MEDLINE is as follows.\n\n【128】#1.Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/\n\n【129】#2.adhd\n\n【130】#3.addh\n\n【131】#4.adhs\n\n【132】#5.hyperactiv$\n\n【133】#6.hyperkin$\n\n【134】#7.attention deficit$\n\n【135】#8.brain dysfunction\n\n【136】#9.or/1‐8\n\n【137】#10.Child/\n\n【138】#11.Adolescent/\n\n【139】#12.(child$ or boy$ or girl$ or schoolchild$ or adolescen$ or teen$ or young person$\" or \"young people$ or youth$)\n\n【140】#13.or/10‐12\n\n【141】#14 acupuncture therapy/ or acupuncture, ear/ or electroacupuncture/\n\n【142】#15 accupunct$\n\n【143】#16 or/14/15\n\n【144】#17 9 and 12 and 16\n\n【145】This search strategy will be modified where necessary to search the other databases listed. No language or date restrictions will be used. Search filters designed to find controlled trials will be used.\n\n【146】#### Searching other resources\n\n【147】Handsearches will be considered following the electronic searches,particularly where abstracts from relevant neuropsychological and associated meetings are not available electronically.\n\n【148】The following journals that are published in Chinese will be searched:\n\n【149】_Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion_ (1961 to 1979),\n\n【150】_Journal of Clinical Acupuncture and Moxibustion_ (1965 to 1979),\n\n【151】_Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine_ (1960 to 1979),\n\n【152】_New Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine_ (1969 to 1979),\n\n【153】_Research of Acupuncture and Moxibustion_ (1976 to 1979)\n\n【154】Conference proceedings relevant to this topic will also be handsearched.\n\n【155】##### Additional searches\n\n【156】The reference lists of identified randomised clinical trials and review articles will be checked in order to find randomised trials not identified by the electronic or hand searches. Ongoing trials will be searched through Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled‐trials.com), and grey literature through the OPENSIGLE database.\n\n【157】##### Unpublished trials\n\n【158】We will request information on unpublished trials from authors of published studies, and experts and information groups in the areas of ADHD and acupuncture.\n\n【159】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【160】#### Selection of studies\n\n【161】Two reviewers (Shasha Li and Bo Yu) will independently screen the titles and abstracts obtained by the search strategies against the eligibility criteria stated above.\n\n【162】Verification of study eligibility will be done by Shasha Li and Bo Yu before data abstraction.\n\n【163】For articles that appear to be eligible RCT's, the full articles will be obtained and inspected to assess the relevance, based on the preplanned criteria for inclusion.\n\n【164】At all stages, reasons for inclusion and exclusion of articles will be noted. Disagreements will be resolved through consensus, or referred for arbitration by the editorial base of the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group (CDPLPG) if needed.\n\n【165】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【166】Data will be independently extracted by two reviewers (Shasha Li and Bo Yu) using a pre designed data collection form, and saved electronically with appropriate version control. The data collection form will be pilot tested for clarity, relevance to the study questions and completeness. The instruction for codings and meanings will be placed adjacent or near to the data field that is to be coded. The coding of the form with a revision date or version number will be applied to ensure ease of updating. Any unpublished information if used will be written and coded with a specified remark. The comparison of extracted data will be done by each author independently. Any disagreements will be discussed with a third reviewer (Lin Kang) and the decisions documented.\n\n【167】Where there are missing data, and where no information is provided about adverse events, we will contact the authors using every means available (email, formal letter, fax, telephone call).\n\n【168】All relevant data will be entered into RevMan 5.0 by Shasha Li and rechecked by Bo Yu for correctness. The reliability of data extraction and data entry will be examined throughout the process.\n\n【169】In case of trials using a cross over design, all data will be abstracted.\n\n【170】Data of the first phase of study will only be used for analysis.The data of the second phase after crossing over will be described in the characteristics of included study table, but not in the comparisons and data table .\n\n【171】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【172】For each included study, two reviewers (Shasha Li and Bo Yu) will independently complete the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2008 , section 8.5.1). We will assess the degree to which:\n\n【173】⋅ the allocation sequence was adequately generated ('sequence generation')\n\n【174】⋅ the allocation was adequately concealed ('allocation concealment')\n\n【175】⋅ knowledge of the allocated interventions was adequately prevented during the study ('blinding')\n\n【176】⋅ incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed\n\n【177】⋅ reports of the study were free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting\n\n【178】⋅ the study was apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias\n\n【179】Each domain was allocated one of three possible categories for each of the included studies: 'Yes' for low risk of bias, 'No' for high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' where the risk of bias was uncertain or unknown.\n\n【180】Disagreements will be resolved through consensus, or referred for arbitration by the editorial base of the CDPLPG if needed.\n\n【181】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【182】If the data are dichotomous, we will report relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. If data are continuous, we will report weighted mean difference (WMD and 95% CI) for continuous outcomes. The standardised mean difference (SMD) will be used where different outcome measures of the same construct were reported. We will test for heterogeneity by using the Chi‐square test. If the result is P<=0.10, we will use a random‐effects model. If not, we will use a fixed‐effect model. We will assess possible sources of heterogeneity by sensitivity and subgroup analyses as described below. We will test for publication bias by using the funnel plot or other corrective analytical methods depending on the number of included trials.\n\n【183】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【184】(a) Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【185】Where trials have used clustered randomization, we anticipate that study investigators would have presented their results after appropriately controlling for clustering effects (robust standard errors or hierarchical linear models). If it is unclear whether a cluster‐randomized trial has used appropriate controls for clustering, the study investigators will be contacted for further information. Where appropriate controls were not used, individual participant data will be requested and re‐analysed using multilevel models which control for clustering. Following this, effect sizes and standard errors will be meta‐analysed in RevMan using the generic inverse method ( Higgins 2008 ). If appropriate controls were not used and individual participant data is not available, statistical guidance will be sought from the Cochrane Method Group and external experts as to which method to apply to the published results in attempt to control for clustering. If there is insufficient information to control for clustering, outcome data will be entered into RevMan using individuals as the units of analysis, and then sensitivity analysis will be used to assess the potential biasing effects of inadequately controlled clustered trials ( Donner 2001 ).\n\n【186】(b) Crossover trials\n\n【187】When conducting a meta‐analysis combining the results of crossover trials, we will use the inverse variance methods recommended by Elbourne ( Elbourne 2002 ). Where data presented from a crossover trial is restricted (and more information was not available from the original investigators) we will use the presented data within the first phase only, up to the point of crossover.\n\n【188】(c) Multi‐arm trials\n\n【189】All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be included in this review.\n\n【190】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【191】Intention‐to‐treat analyses\n\n【192】For the included studies which used the intention‐to‐treat analysis by filling in or imputation of data for missing cases (such as last observation carried forward method or assumed no changes). The authors will be contacted for available data.\n\n【193】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【194】Heterogeneity can occur from many sources. An important aspect of every meta‐analysis is to consider and emphasise the existence of heterogeneity and to take account of this in the interpretation of results. Sources of heterogeneity (clinical heterogeneity) can be divided into two groups: biologic and methodological .\n\n【195】Biological:\n\n【196】1\\. Characteristic of patients: age, sex, socio‐economic status, education.\n\n【197】2\\. Subtype of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders etc.\n\n【198】3\\. Disorder severity and chronicity: mild, moderate, severe.\n\n【199】4\\. Comorbidity of emotional/psychiatric problems, speech/language problems, learning problems, psychosocial problems conduct disorder.\n\n【200】Methodological:\n\n【201】1\\. Type of acupuncture therapies\n\n【202】(a) Techniques:\n\n【203】\\* different types of acupuncture therapies (body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, acupressure);\n\n【204】\\* combination of different techniques of acupuncture therapies (body acupuncture and scalp acupuncture etc.)\n\n【205】(b) Intensity and frequency of practice: duration of acupuncture per treatment session, frequency of practice, duration of practice.\n\n【206】2\\. Different follow up period: at the end of trial, any specified period after trial, repeated follow up measure.\n\n【207】3\\. Multi‐component intervention: drugs, counselling, biofeedback, parent training, psychotherapy, family therapy etc.\n\n【208】Clinical heterogeneity will be assessed by noting the difference in the distribution of important participant factors between trials (age, gender, specific diagnosis/diagnostic subtypes, duration of disorder, associated diseases), and methodological heterogeneity will be assessed by noting different trial design factors (randomisation concealment, blinding, losses to follow‐up, treatment type, co‐interventions). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by examining <sup>2 </sup> ( Higgins 2008 ; section 9.5.2), a quantity that describes approximately the proportion of variation in point estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. In addition, a chi‐squared test of homogeneity will be employed to determine the strength of evidence that the heterogeneity is genuine.\n\n【209】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【210】If possible, a funnel plot ( Light 1984 ; Egger 1997 ) will be used to determine potential publication bias, by plotting the effect size against sample size. Publication bias may result when trials with negative results are under‐represented.\n\n【211】Any other types of bias of each studies (e.g. selection,measurement, attrition bias) will be reported in the results and discussion.\n\n【212】#### Data synthesis\n\n【213】We will undertake a quantitative synthesis of the data using both fixed and random effects models. Meta‐analysis should be performed where we consider studies to be sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, comparators and outcome measures to provide a meaningful summary. In carrying out meta‐analysis, the weight given to each study was the inverse of the variance so that the more precise estimates (from larger studies with more events) are given more weight. The analyses will be carried out using RevMan Analyses software in Review Manager (Cochrane software).\n\n【214】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【215】If sufficient studies are found, the data will be analysed in subgroups according to the following categories:\n\n【216】‐ childhood (under 13 years)\n\n【217】‐ adolescence (13‐18 years)\n\n【218】‐ different types of acupuncture therapies (body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, acupressure);\n\n【219】‐ different control interventions;\n\n【220】‐ treatment duration (less than two weeks or more than two weeks);\n\n【221】‐ duration of disease (less than one month, 1 to 12 months, more than one year);\n\n【222】‐ Chinese vs. non‐Chinese studies.\n\n【223】Strategies for exploring heterogeneity:\n\n【224】1\\. Identification of the methodological differences between studies.\n\n【225】2\\. Subgroup analysis\n\n【226】3\\. Meta‐regression if enough data are available (Meta‐regression should generally not be considered when there are fewer than 10 trials in a meta‐analysis) ( Higgins 2008 ).\n\n【227】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【228】If heterogeneity results from studies at high risk of bias, we will undertake sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of studies with poor ratings on dimensions described in the 'risk of bias table'. _A priori_ sensitivity analyses are planned for:\n\n【229】(1) concealment of allocation\n\n【230】(2) blinding of outcome assessors\n\n【231】(3) extent of dropouts", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives, which provide both progestin and estrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. An oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low estrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose oral contraceptives for contraception.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To review all randomized controlled trials comparing a combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone to a placebo or another combined oral contraceptive for effect on premenstrual symptoms.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】We searched for studies of drospirenone and premenstrual syndrome in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ ), MEDLINE, and POPLINE (20 Dec 2011); EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization (02 Mar 2011). We also examined references lists of relevant articles and wrote to known investigators to find other trials.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing drospirenone with a placebo or with another COC for effect on premenstrual symptoms. The primary outcome included affective and physical premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded. Adverse events related to combined oral contraceptive use were examined.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included five trials with a total of 1920 women. Two placebo‐controlled trials of women with PMDD showed less severe premenstrual symptoms after three months with drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 μg than with placebo (MD ‐7.92; 95% CI ‐11.16 to ‐4.67). The drospirenone group had greater mean decreases in impairment of productivity (MD ‐0.31; 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.08), social activities (MD ‐0.29; 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.04), and relationships (MD ‐0.30; 95% CI ‐0.54 to ‐0.06). Side effects more common with the use of the drospirenone COC contraceptive were nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and breast pain. The respective odds ratios were 3.15 (95% CI 1.90 to 5.22), 4.92 (95% CI 3.03 to 7.96), and 2.67 (95% CI 1.50 to 4.78). Total adverse events related to the study drug were more likely for the drospirenone COC group (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.44). Three trials studied the effect of drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 μg on less severe symptoms. A placebo‐controlled six‐month trial had insufficient data for primary outcome analysis. Another six‐month study used levonorgestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg for the comparison group but did not provide enough data on premenstrual symptoms. In a two‐year trial, the drospirenone COC group had similar premenstrual symptoms to the comparison group given desogestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22). The groups were also similar for adverse events related to treatment (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33).\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 μg may help treat premenstrual symptoms in women with severe symptoms, that is, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The placebo also had a large effect. We do not know whether the combined oral contraceptive works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other oral contraceptives. Larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to address these issues. Trials should follow CONSORT guidelines.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (2)\n\n【20】*   Premenstrual Tension Syndrome\n*   Premenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Drospirenone\n\n【23】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【24】*   Placebo\n*   Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill\n\n【25】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【26】*   Premenstrual Symptom\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

A severe form is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Birth control pills with the hormones progestin and estrogen have been studied for treating such symptoms. A birth control pill with the progestin drospirenone may work better than other such pills. A drospirenone pill with low estrogen was approved for treating PMDD, the severe form of PMS, in women who use birth control pills.\n\n【34】We did a computer search for trials that compared a birth control pill containing drospirenone and estrogen to a placebo ('dummy') or another birth control pill in treating premenstrual symptoms. We wrote to researchers to find other trials. We looked at whether the pills reduced symptoms and if side effects were reported. Women recorded their symptoms over time.\n\n【35】We found five trials with 1920 women. Two trials compared a dummy pill to a drospirenone pill with low estrogen. All the women had PMDD, the severe form of PMS, before the trial. After three months, women on the drospirenone pill with low estrogen had less severe premenstrual symptoms than the group taking the dummy pill. Women in the drospirenone group said they could do more and had more social activities and friends. Women on the drospirenone pill had more nausea, bleeding between periods, and breast pain. These side effects are common with birth control pills. Three trials studied a drospirenone pill with more estrogen for treating less severe symptoms. These women did not all have PMDD. One compared the drospirenone pill to a dummy pill but did not have enough data for our review. Two compared the study pill to another birth control pill. The two‐year study showed the groups were similar for premenstrual symptoms and side effects. The six‐month study did not give enough data on the symptoms.\n\n【36】A drospirenone pill with low estrogen seems to help premenstrual symptoms in women with severe symptoms (PMDD). The drospirenone pill worked a little better than the dummy pill, which also affected symptoms. We do not know if the birth control pill works longer than three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other birth control pills. Longer and better studies with more women are needed to address these issues. Trials reports should be clearer about how the study was done.\n\n【37】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【38】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We included randomised controlled trials, non‐randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series (ITS) analyses, repeated measures studies and controlled before‐after studies set in large care systems or jurisdictions.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. Quantitative re‐analysis of time series data was undertaken for studies with sufficient data.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included 29 ITS analyses (12 were controlled) investigating policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction. Participants were most often senior citizens or low income adult populations, or both, in publically subsidized or administered pharmaceutical benefit plans. Impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restrictions were implemented or relaxed. When policies targeted gastric‐acid suppressant and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug classes, decreased drug use and substantial savings on drugs occurred immediately and for up to two years afterwards, with no increase in the use of other health services (6 studies). Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug expenditures (2 studies). Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives and statins increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures. Two studies which measured health outcomes directly were inconclusive.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications can decrease third‐party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies). Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs used for secondary prevention can also remove barriers to access. Policy design, however, needs to be based on research quantifying the harm and benefit profiles of target and alternative drugs to avoid unwanted health system and health effects. Health impact evaluation should be conducted where drugs are not interchangeable. Impacts on health equity, relating to the fair and just distribution of health benefits in society (sustainable access to publically financed drug benefits for seniors and low income populations, for example), also require explicit measurement.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (5)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Pharmaceutical policy\n\n【23】###### Comparison (0)\n\n【24】###### Outcome (4)\n\n【25】*   Costs and Cost Analysis\n*   Health Services Utilization\n*   Clinical Outcome\n*   Medication taken\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Spending more on medications could mean less money for hospitals, doctors and even other public services such as education or infrastructure. Misuse, overuse or underuse of medications may also result in poor health outcomes and a waste of money. Publically funded drug benefit plans look for ways to ensure better use of medications and to control costs without limiting health benefits. Policies that restrict reimbursement of specific prescription drugs ‐‐ often called 'prior' or 'special authorization' policies ‐‐ are one type of policy that may be used. Physicians generally apply on behalf of the patient and supply information verifying the patient's need before authorization is granted. These policies provide a safety valve when restrictions are applied by allowing for reimbursement when there is a need for the specific drug. If authorization is not obtained, an alternative and often cheaper drug with the same or similar benefit is reimbursed, or a patient may have the means to pay out‐of‐pocket expenses. Medications targeted for reduction in use are often newer, expensive drugs with cheaper, effective alternatives.\n\n【33】This review found 29 studies that evaluated policies that restrict reimbursement of specific prescriptions drugs. Where drugs have cheaper, effective alternatives and they target symptoms, this review found that reimbursement restriction polices can ensure better use of the medications with reduced costs and without an increase in the use of other health services, as would be expected if there were negative health effects of the restriction policies. Evaluation is required if alternative drugs are not effective substitutes. Removing restrictions for drugs that prevent complications of disease can result in an intended increase in their use as well as cost savings. When restrictions to reimbursement policies are designed using the best available evidence on the health impact of the medications, they support equitable access to the drugs that best support health by supporting the sustainability of publically subsidized drug plans.\n\n【34】**A summary of this review for policy‐makers is available** here\n\n【35】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【36】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effect and safety of oxygen therapy in the treatment of pneumonia.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Pneumonia is defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection accompanied by new radiographic shadowing on chest X‐ray ( BTS 2001 ). Common clinical symptoms of pneumonia may include cough, sputum production, fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, night sweats and pleuritic chest pain. It is most common in young children and elderly people. However it can affect anyone. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, mycoplasma, chlamydia, fungi or parasites; almost 100 species have been identified as pathogens ( Donowitz 2000 ; Fine 2003 ). It may be called community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial (hospital‐acquired) pneumonia (NP or HAP). The clinical presentations are often similar in both. _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ ( _S. pneumoniae_ ) is responsible for CAP in 40% of patients. HAP is often caused by gram negative organisms. The annual incidence of CAP is 6/1000 in those aged 18 to 59 years old, 20/1000 for those aged 60 years and over, and rises to 34/1000 in people aged 75 years and over ( Jokinen 1993 ). Admission to hospital is needed in 20 to 40% of patients with CAP ( BTS 2001 ; Macfarlane 2004 ).\n\n【7】Both CAP and HAP are associated with a significant mortality ( Fagon 1993 ). HAP is the leading cause of mortality in hospital‐acquired infections ( Flanders 2006 ). In low‐income countries, pneumonia causes approximately two million deaths annually among children under five years of age ( Graham 1990 ; Jones 2003 ; Rudan 2004 ). In the USA, pneumonia is the sixth most common cause of death and the most common cause of infection‐related mortality ( Donowitz 2000 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Prescribed oxygen may be described in both volume (dosage) and delivery system terms. Low volume systems include nasal cannulae (NC), shields and masks. Drawbacks to low volume systems include drying of the nasal mucosa and eyes; discomfort, as masks can pinch and cause skin irritation; and their passive delivery system is dependent on the patient's ability to breathe. If the lungs cannot keep the body oxygenated using these methods, mechanical ventilation may be required. The most common respiratory support is non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). The disadvantages of mechanical ventilation are twofold: chest muscles can weaken through disuse and bacteria may better access the lungs.\n\n【10】Oxygen therapy is often only necessary in severe cases of pneumonia ('severe' defined as a \"confusion, urea > 7 mmol/l, respiratory rate >= 30/min, low systolic (< 90 mm Hg) or diastolic (<= 60 mm Hg) blood pressure, age >= 65 years score\", (or \"CURB‐65 score\") of 3 or more) ( Ewig 2006 ; Lim 2003 ) or in those patients with hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO <sup>2 </sup> ) less than 8 Kpa) or oxygen saturation (SaO <sup>2 </sup> ) less than 92% ( ATS 2001 ). It has been suggested that oxygen saturation should be maintained at a level above 90% in patients with pneumonia ( Alvin 2004 ). Mortality from pneumonia has been shown to be related to arterial blood oxygen saturation ( Onyango 1993 ), the presence of bacteremia, the serotype of the organism (in pneumococcal pneumonia) and the age of the patient ( Cecil 1927 ).\n\n【11】Oxygen was first isolated by Priestley in 1744 and used therapeutically by Beddoes in 1798 ( Boothby 1932 ). In 1885 George E. Holtzapple, MD, discovered that oxygen could be used to treat pneumonia. Stadie reported that the mortality in patients with pneumonia was 39% with oxygen and 74% without oxygen, after data were adjusted for the severity of the illness ( Stadie 1919 ; Stadie 1922 ). Clinical pathway treatment includes oxygen saturation monitoring and oxygen delivery, which can reduce hospitalization significantly ( Loeb 2006 ). There is consensus among scientists and clinicians of the life‐saving benefits of oxygen therapy for patients with severe pneumonia and signs of decreased oxygen saturation. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oxygen therapy for children with pneumonia ( WHO 1990 ). Inconsistent results on the effect of oxygen therapy for pneumonia were reported in some trials. Several studies have reported that provision of NIPPV in patients with severe CAP can lead to initial improvement ( Antonelli 2001 ; Domenighetti 2002 ; Jolliet 2001 ). NIPPV, as either CPAP or bi‐level pressure support, can improve patients' oxygenation and tachypnea in severe acute respiratory syndrome cases ( Chen 2003 ; Cheung 2004 ; Li 2003 ). A study from Hong Kong also draws the same conclusion ( Yam 2005 ). In contrast, a study indicated NIPPV for CAP should only be administered in an appropriate critical care setting, because over half of these patients later deteriorated and required intubation ( Kinnear 2002 ). Despite early physiologic improvements, CPAP neither reduced the need for intubation nor improved outcomes in patients with acute hypoxemic, nonhypercapnic respiratory insufficiency primarily due to acute lung injury, including pneumonia ( Delclaux 2000 ).\n\n【12】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【13】Oxygen therapy for individuals with hypoxemia is commonly prescribed. However, no systematic review has previously been conducted on patients with non‐hypoxemic pneumonia and looking at which oxygen therapy is the best for them.\n\n【14】Objectives\n----------\n\n【15】To assess the effect and safety of oxygen therapy in the treatment of pneumonia.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【18】#### Types of studies\n\n【19】Only randomized controlled trial (RCT) and quasi‐RCT will be included.\n\n【20】#### Types of participants\n\n【21】*   Patients with both CAP and HAP will be included in this review.\n    \n*   Patients aged 18 years and over, diagnosed with pneumonia, with or without lung cancer, immune deficiency, drug or systemic disease induced immunosuppression; and mechanically ventilated patients will all be included.\n    \n*   Trials on patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis will be excluded because of their very different prognoses. If the indication for treatment consists of multiple diagnoses (most commonly: acute bronchitis, exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and pneumonia) and the results are reported separately for each diagnostic group, these trials will be considered for inclusion.\n    \n\n【22】#### Types of interventions\n\n【23】Any oxygen therapy, regardless of dosage and delivery system. Oxygen therapy, either administered alone or as an adjunctive therapy (co‐interventions include antibiotic, mucolytic agents, fluid supplements, etc) will be compared with a placebo or one form of oxygen therapy with another form (for example, at different dosages or by delivery systems).\n\n【24】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】1.  Mortality from respiratory causes.\n    \n2.  Clinical response: improvement in signs and symptoms, and duration of clinical signs and symptoms. A clinical definition of cure will be used as the primary outcome since radiographic resolution lags behind clinical improvement.\n    \n\n【27】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【28】1.  All causes mortality.\n    \n2.  Dyspnea score.\n    \n3.  Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements.\n    \n4.  Duration of hospitalization.\n    \n5.  Requirement of ICU for patients treated initially outside the ICU.\n    \n6.  Mental status score: tests to assess mental status will be considered as acceptable. For example: abbreviated mental test (AMT) score 192.\n    \n7.  The incidence rate for ventilating patients who either have O <sup>2 </sup> alone or no O <sup>2 </sup> ; and the incidence rate for invasive ventilation in patients who have been treated with CPAP or NIPPV.\n    \n8.  Rate of complications of pneumonia (for example, parapneumonic effusions and empyema, lung abscess, septic shock, multiple organ failure).\n    \n9.  Any adverse events, including: drying of the nasal mucosa and eyes; discomfort (as masks can pinch and cause skin irritation); chest muscles weakness; bacterial lung infection.\n    \n\n【29】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【30】#### Electronic searches\n\n【31】We will search the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , latest issue), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialized trials register; MEDLINE (1966 to present); EMBASE (1974 to present); and LILACS (1982 to present).\n\n【32】CENTRAL and MEDLINE will be searched using the following terms and they will be adapted for EMBASE and LILACS as necessary.\n\n【33】**MEDLINE (Ovid)**  \n#1 exp Pneumonia  \n#2 \\*pneumon\\*  \n#3 exp Community‐acquired pneumonia  \n#4 exp Hospital‐acquired pneumonia  \n#5 CAP  \n#6 exp HAP  \n#7 exp Bronchopneumonia  \n#8 exp Pleuropneumonia  \n#9 exp Community‐Acquired Infections  \n#10 exp respiratory tract infection  \n#11 exp nosocomial pneumonia  \n#12 exp ventilator associated pneumonia  \n#13 #1 OR #2 OR #3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 OR #7 OR #8 OR #9 OR #10 OR #11 OR#12  \n#14 oxygen\\* AND therap\\*  \n#15 oxygen\\* AND inhal\\*  \n#16 O2\\* AND therap\\*  \n#17 O2\\* AND (inhal\\* or respiratory\\*)  \n#18 nasal cannula\\*  \n#19 nasal prong\\*  \n#20 NRM  \n#21 venture\\*  \n#22 Hudson\\*  \n#23 mask\\*  \n#24 non invasive positive pressure ventilation  \n#25 non invasive ventilation  \n#26 exp Mechanical ventilation  \n#27 #14 OR #15#16 OR #17 OR #18 OR #19 OR #20 OR #21 OR #22 OR #23 OR #24 OR #25 OR #26  \n#28 Randomized‐Controlled‐Trial  \n#29 controlled‐clinical‐trial  \n#30 exp Randomized‐Controlled‐Trials  \n#31 exp Random‐Allocation  \n#32 exp Single‐Blind‐Method  \n#33 exp Double‐Blind‐Method  \n#34 comparative study/  \n#35 exp evaluation studies/  \n#36 follow‐up studies/  \n#37 prospective studies/  \n#38 (control$ or prospectiv$ or volunteer$).tw.  \n#39 #28 or #29 or #30 or #31 or #32 or #33 or #34 or #35 or #36 or #37 or #38  \n#40 TG=human  \n#41 (TG=animal) not ((TG=animal) and (TG=human))  \n#42 #40 not #41  \n#43 adults  \n#44 children or infants  \n#45 #43 not #44  \n#46 #13 AND #39 AND #42 AND #45\n\n【34】We will search for on going trials in following registers: ClinicalTrial.gov (http://clintrial.gov/); Chinese Clinical Trial Register (www.chictr.org); Australian Clinical Trials Registry http://www.actgr.org.au/); ISRCTN (http://www.controlled‐trials.com/isrctn/); and WHO ICTRP.\n\n【35】#### Searching other resources\n\n【36】The references of all included trials will be scanned to identify other relevant trials. In addition, we plan to identify any other reviews or meta‐analyses on this topic. Appropriate journals will be handsearched. To identify any additional unpublished studies, we will contact ventilator‐manufacturing companies or authors of relevant unpublished articles. There will be no language or publication restrictions.\n\n【37】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【38】#### Selection of studies\n\n【39】Two review authors (YZ, ZX) will independently select relevant articles and assess their eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resolving any disagreements by discussion. Two other review authors (BD, TW) will be consulted if necessary. We will obtain the full text for those articles identified as either relevant or ambiguous from their titles and abstracts.  \n  \n**Quality assessment**  \nWe will assess the methodological quality of each trial in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow up; and classify them as 'adequate', 'inadequate', or 'unclear' according to the guidelines of Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2005 ) and described by Wu 2007 . Sensitivity analyses will then be undertaken on the basis of whether those quality factors are adequate, inadequate, or unclear. Differences will be resolved by discussion among the review authors.\n\n【40】The following characteristics will be assessed:\n\n【41】_Adequacy of the randomization process_  \nA ‐ adequate sequence generation is reported using one of following approaches: random number tables, computer‐generated random numbers  \nB ‐ does not specify one of the adequate methods outlined in (A) but only mentioned 'random'  \nC ‐ other methods of allocation that appear to be biased\n\n【42】_Adequacy of the allocation concealment process_  \nA ‐ adequate measures to conceal allocations, the key is the person who generate the allocation sequence do not recruit and allocate the participants, such as central randomization; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or another description that contains convincing elements of concealment  \nB ‐ unclearly concealed trials in which the author does not report an allocation concealment approach at all  \nC ‐ inadequately concealed allocation that reports an approach that does not fall into one of the categories in (A)  \nD ‐ does not conceal allocation\n\n【43】_Potential for attrition bias after allocation_  \nA ‐ trials where an intention‐to‐treat analysis is possible and few losses to follow up are noted  \nB ‐ trials which report exclusions (as listed in (A) but exclusions were less than 10%)  \nC ‐ no reporting on exclusions or exclusions of at least 10%, or wide differences in exclusions between groups\n\n【44】_Level of masking_  \nA ‐ blinding of patients (yes/no/unclear)  \nB ‐ blinding of caregivers (yes/no/unclear)  \nC ‐ blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear)\n\n【45】All of the quality issues will be reported in the 'Characteristic of included studies table'.  \n  \n**_Based on these criteria, studies will be broadly subdivided into the following three categories_**  \nA ‐ all quality criteria met: low risk of bias  \nB ‐ one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias  \nC ‐ one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias\n\n【46】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【47】Two review authors (YZ, ZX) will independently extract and cross‐check data for each trial. Discrepancies will be settled by discussion. If necessary, the trial authors will be contacted for clarification.\n\n【48】**Data analysis**  \nWe will analyze the data using Review Manager 4.2. Outcomes from the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) will be analyzed. We will perform a pooled analysis based on clinical heterogeneity. Tests for homogeneity will be carried out using a standard Chi square test with significance being set at P < 0.1. I‐square (I <sup>2 </sup> ) will be used to estimate total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance in percentage, less than 25% will be considered as low level heterogeneity; 25% to 50% as moderate level, and higher than 50% as high level heterogeneity ( Higgins 2003 ). If the trials have statistical homogeneity, the fixed‐effect model will be used for combination analysis. If statistical heterogeneity is found but without clinical heterogeneity, the random‐effects model will by used for the pooled data. If significant methodological heterogeneity is found only, we will perform the sensitivity analysis described below. The Mantel‐Haenszel relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be used for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) will be used for continuous outcomes. A level of P < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. In the case of statistical significance, the number need to treat (NNT) will be calculated. Publication bias will be estimated by a visual inspection of a funnel plot if more than nine studies were involved in one subgroup.\n\n【49】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【50】Subgroup analysis of the outcomes may include  \n1) disease severity of groups: non‐severe pneumonia and non‐hypoxemia; severe pneumonia or hypoxemia, based on data;  \n2) different types of oxygen therapy, based on the following data  \n‐ different oxygen concentrations with the same delivery systems differ in effect in patients with pneumonia but without severe pneumonia and hypoxemia: low concentration (< 35%); mid‐concentration (35% to 50%); high concentration (> 50%), based on data;  \n‐ different delivery oxygen systems with the same oxygen concentration differ in effect in patients with pneumonia but without severe pneumonia and hypoxemia, based on data;  \n‐ compare mechanical ventilation with non‐mechanical ventilation in patients with severe pneumonia or pneumonia with hypoxemia, based on data;  \n‐ compare one mechanical ventilation with another in patients with severe pneumonia or pneumonia with hypoxemia, based on data.\n\n【51】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【52】We will perform a sensitivity analysis with the aim to explore the influence of low quality studies on the results, for example, excluding the quasi‐RCTs and repeat the test, based on data.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the benefits and harmful effects of intracystic bleomycin in children aged 0 to 18 years with cystic CP.\n\n【3】Specific objectives are to assess:\n\n【4】(1) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to placebo (no treatment);  \n(2) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy);  \n(3) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to some other intracystic chemotherapies.\n\n【5】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【6】Background\n----------\n\n【7】Craniopharyngiomas (CP) are usually slow‐growing benign tumors that originate from epithelial nests or from areas of squamous metaplasia located in hypothalamic and pituitary regions. CP are the most common intracranial tumors of non‐glial origin in the pediatric population, constituting 6% to 13% of all childhood brain tumors and peaking at five to 10 years of age ( Sanford 1991 ; Bunin 1996 ). Although the tumor is of benign histological nature, there is considerable morbidity and disability even when the tumor can be resected completely.\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】Treatment of childhood craniopharyngioma is an ongoing controversy. Currently accepted therapies are radical tumor resection or partial resection followed by radiation therapy or other chemotherapies. However, surgery still remains challenging because the tumor is infiltrative to the tuber cinereum and the hypothalamus. Furthermore, even after total resection, the tumor's recurrence rate is high( Yasargil 1990 , Weiner 1994 ),especially in the residual cystic portion( Takahashi 1985 ). Some authors advocate external radiotherapy after partial resection of the tumors( Hetelekidis 1993 , Wara 1994 ). However, that may increase endocrine disturbance and mortality, especially in children( Gleeson 2003 )\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Bleomycin was first discovered by Hamao Umezawa in 1966 ( Umezawa 1966 ) and was launched in Japan by Nippon Kayaku in 1969. It was found to be effective on various types of epithelial tumors and benign squamous epithelial cells. Kubo 1971 confirmed the toxicity of bleomycin to cultured CP cells in 1971. In 1985, Takahashi 1985 published a paper concerning seven patients with CP treated with intratumoral bleomycin, and it indicated that the local injection of bleomycin was not as effective against CP of the mixed or solid type but was markedly effective against tumors of the cystic type. After that, other research confirmed that the intracystic bleomycin to treat cystic CP may eliminate cysts completely with few complications ( Broggi 1989 ; Mettolese 2001 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】Bleomycin is an antitumor antibiotic secreted by _Streptomyces verticillus_ . It is composed of two main glycopeptides, bleomycin A2 and B2. Its action was based on inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis through the formation of metal complexes with copper and iron serving as cofactors. These effects on the cell cycle are the G, M, and S phases.\n\n【14】Bleomycin is very effective in squamous cell carcinomas. The squamous epithelium associated with keratinization is characteristically found in the cyst walls of craniopharyngiomas and in its solid component. Therefore, it is believed that it can be used to treat cystic craniopharyngiomas.\n\n【15】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【16】To our knowledge there has been no previous systematic review of this subject. Although some researches advocated its effect in treating cystic CP, it is a neurotoxic drug and if leakage occurs, severe complications may develop, including death .The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing evidence on intracystic bleomycin in treating children with CP.\n\n【17】Objectives\n----------\n\n【18】To assess the benefits and harmful effects of intracystic bleomycin in children aged 0 to 18 years with cystic CP.\n\n【19】Specific objectives are to assess:\n\n【20】(1) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to placebo (no treatment);  \n(2) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy);  \n(3) comparison of intracystic bleomycin to some other intracystic chemotherapies.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomised trials or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) as defined by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2009 ) that compared intracystic bleomycin with placebo/no treatment or surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy) or some other intracystic chemotherapies. We will not consider any other uncontrolled observational trials.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】Participants should meet criteria below.\n\n【27】(1) Participants are between the ages of 0 to 18 years (age at onset of intracystic bleomycin treatment).\n\n【28】(2) Diagnosed as cystic craniopharyngioma by brain CT or MRI.\n\n【29】#### Types of interventions\n\n【30】Intracystic bleomycin. Procedure: the catheter was inserted inside the tumor with the help of a surgical microscope or stereotactically, and was connected to a subcutaneous reservoir. After catheter insertion, contrast agents were injected into the cyst to verify there was no fluid leakage. Intratumoral fluid was aspired and bleomycin was injected in it. The control group is given placebo/no treatment or surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy) or some other intracystic chemotherapy.\n\n【31】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【32】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【33】The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS) or event free survival (EFS) at the end of the follow‐up.\n\n【34】OS is defined as the time to death from any cause. EFS is defined as the time to recurrence or progression of primary disease or death from any cause.\n\n【35】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【36】We will group time‐points into \"short‐term\" (less than one year) or \"long‐term\" (more than one year) outcomes. We will evaluate the measurements as follows at pre‐specified time points.\n\n【37】(1) The response of cyst to treatment: sensitive or insensitive.\n\n【38】(2) The size of the cystic component: the rate of decrease in the size of the cystic component.\n\n【39】(3) Endocrine function: the comparison between pre‐ and post‐operative endocrine deficits include: hypopituitarism; short stature; weight alterations; diabetes insipidus. The change is classified as improved,stable,worsened and new cases.\n\n【40】(4) Neurological status: no disability; moderate disability; severe disability.\n\n【41】(5) Quality of life (QoL): measured using a scale that has been validated through reporting of norms in a peer‐reviewed publication.\n\n【42】(6) Adverse effects: such as death; new neurological deficit; new hypothalamic dysfunction; new visual dysfunction; the recurrence of craniopharyngioma; headache, nausea, and vomiting along with transient fever; arthralgia; chronic fatigue syndrome, etc.; number of patients who withdraw due to adverse events compared to placebo; no treatment; surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy); or some other intracystic chemotherapy groups.\n\n【43】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【44】#### Electronic searches\n\n【45】We will search the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Central Library of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , latest issue); MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to present); and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to present). We have presented the sensitive search strategies used for MEDLINE/PubMEd, EMBASE/Ovid and CENTRAL in Appendix 1 , Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 .\n\n【46】#### Searching other resources\n\n【47】We will locate information about trials not registered in MEDLINE, EMBASE or CENTRAL, either published or unpublished, by searching the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. We will scan the Proceedings abstracts of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2005 to 2009), and of the International Symposium of Pediatric Neuro‐Oncology (ISPNO) conferences and pediatric neurosurgical conferences (from 2005 to 2009), electronically or otherwise by handsearching. We will search the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register and the register of the National Institute of Health ( http://www.controlled‐trials.com ) for ongoing trials. We will not impose language restrictions. We will update the searches every two years.\n\n【48】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【49】#### Selection of studies\n\n【50】Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of studies identified through the searches and select trials that meet the inclusion criteria. We will then retrieve full articles (and translated into English where required) for further assessment. We will use discussion and consultation with a third reviewer to resolve any disagreement.\n\n【51】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【52】For included studies, two authors will independently extract the following information using a standard form:\n\n【53】General information: title, authors, published/unpublished, year of publication, language of publication, duplicate publications, study design, country, reference/source, contact address, urban/rural, sponsoring, setting.\n\n【54】Intervention: dose, route, timing, control intervention (placebo, no treatment, surgical treatment (with or without adjuvant radiotherapy), some other intracystic chemotherapies).\n\n【55】Participants: sampling, total number and number in comparison groups, sex, age, trial inclusion and exclusion criteria; withdrawals/losses to follow‐up (reasons/description), subgroups.\n\n【56】Outcomes: outcomes specified above, length of follow‐up, quality of reporting of outcomes.\n\n【57】If there are differences in data extraction, we will solve the differences by discussion, referring back to the original paper, or by consulting a third person. Also, we will contact authors about missing information in their trials if necessary.\n\n【58】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【59】Two authors will assess the methodological quality of included RCTs and CCTs using The Cochrane Collaboration 'Risk of bias' tool ( Higgins 2009 ). The tool considers six domains of bias: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues. For each domain, the study method is described using verbatim quotes and judged for adequacy (Yes, No, Unclear). A judgment of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, while 'No' indicates high risk of bias. We will add items for the assessment of risk of bias as described in the module of the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group ( Kremer 2010 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or using a third party arbitrator, and will present results in the ‘Risk of bias’ table and also in both graph and written summary form.\n\n【60】Quality assessment for non‐randomised clinical trials is a complex topic. In this review we will also use a modification of the Methodological Index for Non‐Randomised Studies (MINORS) ( Slim 2003 ). This tool is one of the few validated and tested methods specifically developed for the assessment of the quality of non‐randomised trials. The tool includes 12 domains: a clearly stated aim; inclusion of consecutive patients; prospective collection of data; endpoints appropriate to the aim of the study; unbiased assessment of the study endpoint; follow‐up period appropriate to the aim of the study; loss to follow‐up less than 5%; prospective calculation of the study size; an adequate control group; contemporary groups;  baseline equivalence of groups; adequate statistical analyses.\n\n【61】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【62】For time to event (e.g. the overall survival and event‐free survival) data, we will use the hazard ratio (HR). If HRs are not explicitly presented in the study, we will use Parmar's method ( Parmar 1998 ).\n\n【63】For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. the decrease rate of the size of the cystic component,the response of cyst to treatment, adverse events and the endocrine function), we will calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each trial.  \n  \nFor continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life), we will evaluate mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI.\n\n【64】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【65】We will consider each individual study that is included in the meta‐analysis as a unit for analysis.\n\n【66】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【67】We will analyse all data on an intention‐to‐treat principle. We will contact the authors of the respective trials directly by email, letter or fax to ask for the missing data.\n\n【68】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【69】We will construct a forest plot to display the results and to examine possible heterogeneity between the studies. We will use the I <sup>2 </sup> test to  \nmeasure the amount of heterogeneity, where I <sup>2 </sup> values of 50% and more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity ( Higgins 2009 ). If there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity, we will use a random‐effects model.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【71】We will use funnel plots ( Egger 1997 ) to assess the presence of publication bias.\n\n【72】#### Data synthesis\n\n【73】We will carry out data synthesis and analyses using the Cochrane Review Manager software, RevMan 5 ( RevMan 2008 ).\n\n【74】For time‐to‐event data, we will pool HRs using the generic inverse variance facility of RevMan 5.\n\n【75】For any dichotomous outcomes (e.g. rate of decrease in the size of the cystic component, the response of the cyst to treatment, adverse events), we will pool the RR.\n\n【76】For continuous outcomes (e.g. quality of life), we will pool the mean differences between the treatment arms at the end of follow‐up using the MD method if all trials measured the outcome on the same scale, or, if otherwise, the standardised mean difference method.\n\n【77】If there is no evidence of statistical heterogeneity and the pooling of results is clinically appropriate, we will calculate a combined estimate using the Mantel‐Haenszel method ( Mantel 1959 ) for fixed‐effect models and the methods of DerSimonian & Laird ( DerSimonian 1986 ) for random‐effects models. If pooling is not possible, then we will not do a meta‐analysis, but describe the trials narratively.\n\n【78】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【79】If possible, we will carry out the following subgroup analyses:\n\n【80】1\\. age at onset of intracystic bleomycin treatment;\n\n【81】2\\. gender;\n\n【82】3\\. dosage(or the concentration of the dose) of treatment;\n\n【83】4\\. multicystic craniopharyngioma.\n\n【84】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【85】We will perform sensitivity analyses excluding studies at high risk of bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta‐analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Twelve RCTs (n=545) with eight to 26 weeks follow‐up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: ‐1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐4.0 to 1.5, I <sup>2 </sup> \\=67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: ‐2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: ‐3.4 to ‐0.9, I <sup>2 </sup> \\=47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub‐group analyses and meta‐regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over‐estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double‐blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (7)\n\n【20】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Essential Hypertension\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【22】*   Magnesium supplement\n\n【23】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【24】*   Placebo\n\n【25】###### Outcome (8)\n\n【26】*   Withdrawn From Research Study\n*   Myocardial Infarction\n*   Stroke\n*   All Cause Mortality\n*   Blood Pressure Alteration\n*   Gastrointestinal Irritation\n*   Adverse Event\n*   Serum Magnesium\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

It reviewed 12 trials enrolling 545 people, which compared magnesium supplementation with a dummy drug (placebo) or no treatment, and measured blood pressure 8 weeks to 6 months later. The results of trials varied a lot: some trials found magnesium lowered blood pressure much more than placebo, while others found little difference between magnesium and placebo. On average, people receiving extra magnesium achieved slightly lower diastolic blood pressure at the end of trials. None of the studies reported any serious side effects of taking magnesium supplements.\n\n【34】However, most included trials were of poor quality, so their results may not be reliable. The trials were not long enough or large enough to measure whether extra magnesium can reduce possible consequences of high blood pressure: death, heart attack or stroke.\n\n【35】The review did not find robust evidence that oral magnesium supplementation reduces high blood pressure in adults.

{"seq_id": "9374bbb2-eef6-4dbd-84af-63aee56a40ac", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The objective of this review is to determine whether, for individuals with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy by haemodialysis, there are differences in the outcomes between synthetic and autologous A‐V fistulae.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】**Description of the condition**  \nThe incidence of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) is rising exponentially both in Europe ( van Dijk 2001 ), and in the USA ( USRDS 2001 ). Renal replacement therapy is a life saving treatment for patients with ESRD. There are three main types of treatment that can be offered to these patients: haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or transplantation. Kidney transplantation is the favoured option but due to the limited number of donor organs available, many patients remain on haemodialysis for prolonged periods. Haemodialysis entails the filtration of harmful products from the patient's blood with a dialysis machine, and may take up to four hours or more. For this filtration to be effective and to avoid the morbidity associated with indwelling venous catheters, an arterio‐venous (A‐V) fistula (a connection between an artery and a vein) is required. The fistula serves as an access site whereby blood can be removed, filtered and replaced conveniently. This access must be efficient, reliable and robust to facilitate dialysis that is often required three times a week. Vascular access complications are responsible for most morbidity in the chronic haemodialysis population, accounting for 16% to 25% of hospital admissions with an estimated annual cost in the United States of more than $US1 billion ( Feldman 1996 ).  \n  \n**Description of the intervention**  \nThe majority of fistulae are of two main types: autologous (utilising the individual's own tissue) A‐V fistulae, or synthetic A‐V fistulae. Autologous A‐V fistulae are constructed by the anastomosis (connection) of an artery with a vein and can be created in either a side‐to‐side, or an end‐to‐side fashion. The three most common configurations of autologous A‐V fistulae are the radio‐cephalic fistulae (anastomosis of the radial artery to cephalic vein in forearm), the brachio‐cephalic (anastomosis of brachial artery to cephalic vein around the elbow); and brachio‐basilic fistulae (anastomosis of the brachial artery with the basilic vein above the elbow). Autologous A‐V fistulae are disadvantaged by a long maturation period (often three to six months), or even failing to mature completely which may require a secondary intervention ( Conlon 2000 ).\n\n【6】In comparison, synthetic A‐V fistulae can be created in many areas including the arms, legs, or across the anterior chest wall. The commonest synthetic graft in use is the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) variety. It is an inert, low resistance, pliable polymer that allows tissue ingrowth. General advantages of using synthetic grafts are a shorter maturation period (three to four weeks), and increased range of sites for possible access. Disadvantages include an increased tendency to develop narrowing from anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (thickening of the inner blood vessel layer) ( Conlon 2000 ) and also increases the risk of morbidity associated with thrombosis, infection and 'steal' syndrome (symptoms of vascular insufficiency resulting from shunting of blood away from vasculature distal to the fistula ).  \n  \nGeographical variation phenomena exist for the selection of autologous or synthetic A‐V fistulae among patients with ESRD. While in Europe 83% of fistulae are autologous, the percentage of haemodialysis patients with autologous A‐V fistulae in the United States is only 21% ( Pisoni 2002 ). Within the USA itself there is a tenfold regional variation, with the South East Central region performing 2.7 times more synthetic A‐V fistulae than the national average, whereas in New England the ratio is only 0.2 ( Hirth 1996 ).\n\n【7】**Why it is important to do this review**  \nThe current dialysis outcomes quality initiative (National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative) guidelines ( DOQI 2001 ), recommend that autologous A‐V fistulae should be the vascular access of choice for haemodialysis. The guidelines are based on studies that suggest improved access survival and function with fewer complications for autologous A‐V fistulae compared with synthetic A‐V fistulae ( DOQI 2001 ). The quality of evidence cited by these guidelines is variable and includes a large number of case series and expert opinions.\n\n【8】Objectives\n----------\n\n【9】The objective of this review is to determine whether, for individuals with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy by haemodialysis, there are differences in the outcomes between synthetic and autologous A‐V fistulae.\n\n【10】Methods\n-------\n\n【11】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【12】#### Types of studies\n\n【13】All randomised controlled trials comparing synthetic A‐V fistulae with autologous A‐V fistulae will be considered.\n\n【14】#### Types of participants\n\n【15】All adults presenting with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) as defined by the trialist, of whatever aetiology, requiring an A‐V fistula for haemodialysis will be considered.\n\n【16】#### Types of interventions\n\n【17】Trials comparing autologous A‐V fistulae (wrist, forearm, antecubital fossa and transposed arm veins) with synthetic loop fistulae (arm, trunk and thigh).\n\n【18】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【19】The primary outcomes will be:\n\n【20】1.  primary patency of the fistula;\n    \n2.  time to initiation of haemodialysis;\n    \n3.  hospital admissions relating to fistulae problems.\n    \n\n【21】Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n【22】1.  assisted primary patency (patency resulting in re‐intervention after establishment of a primary fistula);\n    \n2.  secondary patency;\n    \n3.  technical problems related to fistulae function;\n    \n4.  complication of haemodialysis sites;\n    \n5.  mortality;\n    \n6.  quality of life;\n    \n7.  economic analysis.\n    \n\n【23】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【24】All publications describing (or which might describe) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or clinical controlled trials (CCTs) of autologous versus prosthetic arteriovenous fistulae for vascular access will be sought through the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases (PVD) Group Trials Register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The Trials Register of the PVD Group has been compiled from regular electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1980 onwards), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and through handsearching journals and conference proceedings. The full list of journals that has been handsearched, as well as the search strategies for the electronic databases, are described in the 'Search strategies for the identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane PVD Group in _The Cochrane Library_ . Additional trials will be sought through cross‐referencing and personal communication with colleagues. There will be no restrictions on language.\n\n【25】Further trial reports will be sought through examination of proceedings from vascular, surgical, radiological, and nephrology society meetings including: the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the European Vascular Surgical Society; the North American Society of Vascular Surgery; the Society for Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology; the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology Society of Europe, and the British Society of Interventional Radiology. Authors of published trials will be contacted requesting information about any eligible unpublished trials.\n\n【26】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【27】#### Selection of trials\n\n【28】One review author (RM) will identify possible trials, and the unblinded reports will be assessed independently by the other author (IM), to confirm eligibility for inclusion in the review. Additional information will be sought as necessary, from the authors of all trials that appear to meet the inclusion criteria.\n\n【29】#### Methodological quality of trials\n\n【30】The methodological quality of included trials will be assessed independently by both review authors. Quality will be based on the methods described by Jadad ( Jadad 1996 ), and Schulz ( Schulz 1995 ). The Schulz method is based on concealment of allocation only, whereas the Jadad scale measures three items: method of randomisation; blinding and withdrawals and drop‐outs from the study. These scales will not be used to exclude trials from the review, but to explore potential heterogeneity of method and quality. Studies will be excluded if they were not randomised, or if they made comparisons other than those pre‐specified by the review authors.\n\n【31】#### Data extraction\n\n【32】Data will be extracted independently by both review authors, using proformas designed by the PVD Group. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion and, where necessary, additional information will be sought from the authors.\n\n【33】#### Statistical analysis\n\n【34】Statistical analysis will be performed according to the statistical guidelines for review authors by the Cochrane PVD Group. Relative risk (RR) will be used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. Where there are sufficient data, a summary statistic for each outcome will be calculated using both a fixed‐effect model and a random‐effects model. Heterogeneity in the data will be noted and cautiously explored using previously identified characteristics of the studies, particularly assessments of quality. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to examine the stability of the results in relation to a number of factors including study quality, the source of the data (published and unpublished), and patient type. Where continuous scales of measurement have been used to assess the effects of treatment, these data will be analysed using weighted mean difference (WMD). If different scales have been used in different studies, where possible, the results will be standardised and then combined using standardised mean difference (SMD).\n\n【35】If there are sufficient trials to warrant subgroup analysis, some categories of patients may be considered separately e.g. patients with diabetes, patients who smoke, patients with different anastomotic techniques or patients with fistulae at different sites.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set of disease activity measures for RA clinical trials, radiographic, withdrawals and toxicity outcomes were analyzed.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Three trials were included in this review. Two trials compared an experimental group who were started on etanercept compared to a control group; both groups had the same ongoing background therapy of nonsteroidals in both trials plus in one trial one group was on stable methotrexate.\n\n【15】In these two trials the ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 response rates at 6 months were statistically significantly and clinically important with etanercept 25 mg subcutaneous injections (SC) twice weekly.

Thirty‐nine percent of those receiving etanercept achieved an ACR 50 response compared to 4% of taking control treatment and the NNT is three.  \nFifteen percent of people taking etanercept achieved an ACR 70 compared to 1% of controls with a NNT of 7 people.\n\n【16】In the third trial of starting etanercept compared to starting methotrexate the number of participants who achieved an ACR 20, 50 or response at 6 and 12 months were not statistically significant for either etanercept dose.\n\n【17】Etanercept treatment showed a statistically significantly and clinically important affect on joint damage as measured by the Sharp erosion score.

The studies tested over 900 people who had rheumatoid arthritis. People had either injections of etanercept at 10 mg to 25 mg two times a week, methotrexate (MTX) (pills or injections) or placebo injections. This Cochrane Review provides the best evidence we have today.\n\n【38】**What is etanercept (Enbrel) and why is it prescribed?**  \nRheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own healthy tissues. The attack happens mostly in the joints of the feet and hands and causes redness, pain, swelling and heat around the joint. Etanercept (Enbrel) is a \"biologic\" that is prescribed to decrease pain and swelling and slow the progress of rheumatoid arthritis. It is usually prescribed when other DMARDs (disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) do not work well, but can be expensive.\n\n【39】**How well does it work?**  \nAfter 6 months of treatment, a 50% improvement in symptoms occurred in 4 out of 100 people taking MTX or a placebo compared to 39 out of 100 people taking etanercept with or without MTX. This occurred in people with long standing rheumatoid arthritis in whom DMARDs (disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs) were not working.\n\n【40】After 12 months of treatment, about the same number of people with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis improved with etanercept injections or MTX pills. But etanercept slowed joint damage more than MTX: joint damage slowed in 72 out of 100 people taking etanercept compared to 60 out of 100 people taking MTX.  \n  \n**How safe is it?**  \nSide effects such as headache, common colds, nausea, dizziness, weakness, stomach upset, mouth ulcers and reactions at the site of the injection may occur. But the number of people who stopped taking etanercept due to side effects was the same or less than the number who stopped taking MTX or the placebo. Long term side effects, such as infections like tuberculosis, and cancer still need to be studied.\n\n【41】**What is the bottom line?**  \nThere is \"Gold\" level evidence that in people with long standing rheumatoid arthritis in whom DMARDs (disease modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs) are not working, injections of etanercept at 25 mg two times a week for 6 months with or without methotrexate decreases pain and swelling better than metotrexate alone or no DMARDs.\n\n【42】In people newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, injections of etanercept at 25 mg two times a week for 12 months works just as well as methotrexate pills and slows damage to the joints more than methotrexate.\n\n【43】Etanercept is safe and side effects are well‐tolerated. Rare and long‐term side effects are not yet known.\n\n【44】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【45】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of green and black tea consumption for the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Cardiovascular diseases are the result of complications in the heart and blood vessels ( WHO 2011 ), and include cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Around 29.6% of total global deaths can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) ( World Health Report 2003 ) and it is estimated that 17 million deaths per year are caused by CVD ( Mackay 2004 ).\n\n【7】One of the main mechanisms thought to cause CVD is atherosclerosis, where the arteries become clogged by plaques or atheromas ( NHS 2010 ). Atherosclerosis can cause CVD when the arteries are completely blocked by a blood clot or when blood flow is restricted by a narrowed artery limiting the amount of blood and oxygen that can be delivered to organs or tissue ( British Heart Foundation 2012 ). Whilst arteries may naturally become harder and narrower with age this process may be accelerated by factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and ethnicity ( NHS 2010 ).\n\n【8】A number of dietary factors have been found to be associated with CVD risk such as a low consumption of fruit and vegetables ( Begg 2007 ), a high intake of saturated fat ( Siri‐Tarino 2010 ) and a high consumption of salt ( He 2011 ). These factors are important since they can be modified in order to lower CVD risk making them a prime target for interventions aimed at primary prevention and management of CVD.\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】According to Deka ( Deka 2011 ), records show tea has been used largely due to its medicinal purposes from as far back as the 10 <sup>th </sup> Century and it is now consumed worldwide.Tea leaves come from the plant of _Camillia sinesis_ and there are three main types of tea: green, black and oolong. The type of tea produced from the leaves depends on how the leaves are processed. For instance, partly fermented leaves produce oolong tea, fermented leaves produced black tea whilst non‐fermented leaves create green tea ( Deka 2011 ).\n\n【11】All types of tea are rich in polyphenols, the majority of which are flavonoids. These are water‐soluble plant pigments which belong to the larger group of polyphenolic compounds ( Corradini 2011 ; Scalbert 2005 ). The main class of flavonoids found in tea are flavanols. These include epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epicatechin (EC) ( Kris‐Etherton 2002 ). Whilst total polyphenol content in green and black tea is similar, the individual components differ. For instance, in green tea catechin constitutes around 80‐90% of total flavonoids whereas in black tea they account for 20‐30% of total flavonoids. This is partly due to the degree of polyphenol oxidation during their manufacture ( Deka 2011 ). Green tea is also thought to have a high content of vitamins and minerals with five cups a day providing between 5‐10% of a person’s daily requirement of riboflavin, niacin, folic acid and pantothenic acid. Furthermore, this amount of  green tea a day provides 45% of the daily requirement of manganese, 25% of potassium and 5% of magnesium ( Shukla 2007 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】One dietary factor which may protect against CVD is tea. Observational, Epidemiological and experimental evidence have indicated that the consumption of green and black tea may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular function ( Deka 2011 ; Kuriyama 2008 ; Nagao 2007 ; Mineharu 2010 ; Sesso 1999 ). In particular, observational studies suggest that a high intake of both green and black tea is related to a reduction in CVD risk ( Kuriyama 2008 ; Sesso 1999 ). For example, de Koning Gans et al ( de Koning Gans 2010 ), in a prospective cohort study of 37,514 participants in the Netherlands, found that consuming three to six cups of tea (mainly black tea) a day was associated with a reduction in the risk of CHD mortality (HR = 0.55, 95% CI's of 0.31 to 0.97) (cup size was not stated in the article). This is supported by Mineharu et al ( Mineharu 2010 ) who reported a strong inverse relationship between the intake of more than six cups of green tea daily and CVD mortality in a cohort of 76,979 Japanese adults.These observational findings, however, must be cautiously interpreted because of the potential for confounding effects by factors commonly associated with tea drinking, such as healthier lifestyles, which might contribute to the observed inverse associations. Indeed, some studies have failed to show any relationship between the intake of tea and CVD risk ( Brown 1993 ; Hertog 1997 ).\n\n【14】Meta‐analyses of observational studies corroborate the findings from individual studies showing an inverse relationship between tea and CVD risk ( Arab 2009 ; Peters 2001 ). Peters et al. ( Peters 2001 ) investigated the association between tea and CVD by analysing 10 cohort studies and seven case‐control studies. They found an 11% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction when consuming three or more cups of tea a day. However, these authors suggest that their findings must be cautiously interpreted since there was evidence of publication bias of smaller positive studies.\n\n【15】Evidence from intervention studies also show the benefit of tea consumption in reducing the risk factors for CVD ( Brown 2009 ; Nagao 2007 ; Nantz 2009 ). Fujita et al. ( Fujita 2008 ), for instance, conducted a randomised double‐blind placebo‐controlled study to investigate the benefits of taking black tea extract in 47 Japanese patients with borderline hypercholesterolaemia. They found that black tea extract significantly lowered patients LDL cholesterol and blood total cholesterol levels. A systematic review that searched for RCTs until 2006 and included 12 trials of green tea, and 12 of black tea compared to control (all assessed as at moderate to high risk of bias) found little effect of either type of tea on systolic or diastolic blood pressure or HDL cholesterol. However, it was not stated in this review whether tea was caffeinated or decaffeinated. Nonetheless, there was some evidence from moderate to poor quality trials that green tea reduced LDL cholesterol (black tea had no effect) and black tea improved flow mediated dilatation, an emerging risk factor for CVD ( Hooper 2008 ). None of the included studies assessed mortality or cardiovascular events.\n\n【16】A more recent systematic review examined green tea consumption and its antioxidant effects in 31 RCT's published up to June 2010 ( Ellinger 2011 ). The findings indicated that there was some evidence that regular green tea consumption of at least 0.6‐1.5 l/day reduced lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant capacity. Ellinger et al ( Ellinger 2011 ) therefore concluded that there was evidence, although limited, for the antioxidant effects of green tea which are suggested to protect against CVDs.\n\n【17】The reduction of CVD risk by tea may be largely due to the high levels of polyphenols, in particular flavonoids, which tea contains. However, the exact mechanisms through which increased tea consumption reduces CVD risk are unknown. Some potential mechanisms through which tea and the flavonoids they contain may operate include reducing weight, improving insulin sensitivity, improving dyslipidemia, improving endothelial function by lowering oxidative stress, platelet inhibition and anti‐inflammatory effects ( Deka 2011 ). Furthermore, tea and their flavonoids have antioxidant properties which help in reducing CVD risk ( Deka 2011 ; Gardner 2007 ).\n\n【18】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【19】Tea is the second most consumed beverage after water ( Kris‐Etherton 2002 ) and due to such high frequency of intake worldwide, even a small impact of tea on human health could have large implications for public health ( Peters 2001 ). However, there is still inconclusive evidence from interventional and observational studies of tea consumption on clinical cardiovascular endpoints. An up‐to‐date systematic review is needed to clarify the association between tea consumption and CVD risk which will then provide guidance for national and international governments, local authorities, practitioners and members of the public.\n\n【20】With this in mind, we aim to update and expand the most recent systematic reviews ( Ellinger 2011 ; Hooper 2008 ) in the field and address some of the uncertainty around the role of tea in the primary prevention of CVD. The current review will provide an update to the systematic review by Ellinger et al ( Ellinger 2011 ) on green tea, and will further investigate the effects of black tea which are not covered in Ellinger's systematic review. What is more, this current review will address the imperfections of the review by Ellinger at al. For instance, the systematic review by Ellinger et al ( Ellinger 2011 ) only searched two databases to identify relevant trials and only included trials published in English. This means that relevant studies cited in other databases and published in languages other than English would have been missed. In this current review, many databases will be searched and trials in any language will be assessed for inclusion. Furthermore, we will focus on CVD risk factors and clinical outcomes which the review by Ellinger et al ( Ellinger 2011 ) did not investigate.\n\n【21】The current review differs also from the systematic review carried by Hooper et al ( Hooper 2008 ) by focusing solely on tea. The review by Hooper et al ( Hooper 2008 ) investigated the effectiveness of different flavonoid subclasses and flavonoid rich foods. What is more, by updating Hooper’s review, randomised controlled trials investigating tea that provide data for the endpoints of CVD  morbidity and mortality should be found. Such trials were not found for the systematic review by Hooper et al ( Hooper 2008 ).\n\n【22】Objectives\n----------\n\n【23】The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of green and black tea consumption for the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【26】#### Types of studies\n\n【27】All randomised controlled trials including cross‐over trials. Cross‐over trials will be included in this review by using data only from the first half as a parallel group design.\n\n【28】#### Types of participants\n\n【29】Adults of all ages from the general population and adults at high risk of CVD. This review will focus on the effects of green and black tea consumption on participants in primary prevention trials. We will exclude those in secondary prevention trials, for example those who have experienced a previous myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularisation procedure (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), those with angina, or angiographically defined coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n【30】#### Types of interventions\n\n【31】The intervention will be the consumption of green or black tea or the intake of tea extracts. No limit will be placed on the amount of tea consumed. Studies examining green tea and green tea extracts will be examined separately from those examining black tea and black tea extracts. Actual tea and tea extracts will be separated for each type of tea by subgrouping. If there are sufficient trials we will stratify results by “total flavonoid dose” of green or black tea consumption or tea extract intake.\n\n【32】Trials will only be considered where the comparison group is placebo or no intervention. We will focus on follow‐up periods of six months or more as these are most relevant for public health interventions.\n\n【33】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【34】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【35】1\\. Cardiovascular Mortality\n\n【36】2\\. All‐cause Mortality\n\n【37】3\\. Non‐fatal endpoints such as MI, CABG, PTCA, angina, or angiographically defined CHD, stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\n\n【38】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【39】1\\. Changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides)\n\n【40】2\\. Occurrence of type 2 diabetes as a major CVD risk factor\n\n【41】3\\. Quality of life\n\n【42】4\\. Adverse effects\n\n【43】5\\. Costs.\n\n【44】We will focus on follow‐up periods of six months or more as these are most relevant for public health interventions. There will be no minimal period for the duration of the intervention.\n\n【45】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【46】#### Electronic searches\n\n【47】The following electronic databases will be searched: the Cochrane Library \\[including the Cochrane central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evalustion Database (NEED)\\]; MEDLINE; EMBASE, and Web of Science \\[Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S)\\].\n\n【48】Medical subject headings (MeSH) or equivalent and text word terms will be used. The Cochrane sensitive‐maximising RCT filter will also be used ( Lefebvre 2011 ). Searches will be designed in accordance with the Cochrane Heart Group methods and guidance. There will be no language restrictions.\n\n【49】Searches will be tailored to individual databases. The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Appendix 1 .\n\n【50】#### Searching other resources\n\n【51】Reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles will also be checked for additional studies.\n\n【52】We will search the metaRegister of controlled trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct), Clinical trials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials and Google Scholar for additional studies. We will also search OpenGrey to identify any relevant grey literature.\n\n【53】Citation searches will be performed on key articles. Experts in the field will be contacted for unpublished and ongoing trials and authors will be contacted where necessary for any additional information.\n\n【54】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【55】#### Selection of studies\n\n【56】From the searches, the title and abstract of each paper will be reviewed by two reviewers (LH, NF) and potentially relevant references retrieved. The full text of potentially relevant studies will than be obtained and two reviewers (LH, NF) will independently select studies to be included in the review by using predetermined inclusion criteria. In all cases disagreements about study inclusion will be resolved by consensus and a third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements persist.\n\n【57】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【58】Data will be extracted by two reviewers independently (LH, NF) using a proforma. Chief investigators will be contacted to provide additional relevant information if necessary. Details of the study design, participant characteristics, study setting, intervention (including number of components, tea or extract, duration, flavonoid and caffeine dose), and outcome data (including details of outcome assessment, adverse effects and methodological quality (randomisation, blinding and attrition)) will be extracted from each included study. Disagreements about extracted data will be resolved by consensus with a third reviewer being consulted if disagreements persist.\n\n【59】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【60】Risk of bias will be assessed by examining the quality of the random sequence generation and allocation concealment, description of drop‐outs and withdrawals (including analysis by intention‐to‐treat), blinding (participants, personnel and outcome assessment) and selective outcome reporting ( Higgins 2011 ). The risk of bias in included studies will be assessed independently by two reviewers (LH, NF).\n\n【61】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【62】Data will be processed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2011 ). Dichotomous outcomes will be expressed as odds ratios or relative risks, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated for each study. For continuous outcomes net changes will be compared (i.e. intervention group minus control group differences) and a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs calculated for each study.\n\n【63】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【64】For each outcome tests of heterogeneity will be conducted (using the chi‐squared test of heterogeneity and I <sup>2 </sup> statistic). Where there is no heterogeneity a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis will be performed. If substantial heterogeneity is detected the reviewers will look for possible explanations for this (for example participants and intervention). If the heterogeneity cannot be explained, the reviewers will consider the following options: provide a narrative overview and not aggregate the studies at all or use a random‐effects model with appropriate cautious interpretation.\n\n【65】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【66】We will stratify results by the consumption of tea or tea extracts. If there are sufficient trials we will stratify results by “total flavonoid dose” of green or black tea consumption or tea extract intake. We will also examine the effects of caffeine intake.\n\n【67】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【68】Sensitivity analyses will be carried out excluding studies of low methodological quality. if there are sufficient trials, funnel plots and tests of asymmetry ( Egger 1997 ) will be undertaken to assess possible publication bias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, _The Cochrane Library_ (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost), four other sources, and clinical trials registers. We screened reference lists.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Eligible trials included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized intervention studies. We also evaluated nonrandomized studies (NRS), including controlled trials and cohort studies. Each study was required to have a GEMS comparison group. An Injury Severity Score (ISS) of at least 15 or an equivalent marker for injury severity was required. We included adults age 16 years or older.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We applied the Downs and Black quality assessment tool for NRS. We analyzed the results in a narrative review, and with studies grouped by methodology and injury type. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables in accordance with the GRADE Working Group criteria.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】This review includes 38 studies, of which 34 studies examined survival following transportation by HEMS compared with GEMS for adults with major trauma. Four studies were of inter‐facility transfer to a higher level trauma center by HEMS compared with GEMS. All studies were NRS; we found no RCTs. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge. We calculated unadjusted mortality using data from 282,258 people from 28 of the 38 studies included in the primary analysis. Overall, there was considerable heterogeneity and we could not determine an accurate estimate of overall effect.\n\n【15】Based on the unadjusted mortality data from six trials that focused on traumatic brain injury, there was no decreased risk of death with HEMS. Twenty‐one studies used multivariate regression to adjust for confounding. Results varied, some studies found a benefit of HEMS while others did not. Trauma‐Related Injury Severity Score (TRISS)‐based analysis methods were used in 14 studies; studies showed survival benefits in both the HEMS and GEMS groups as compared with MTOS. We found no studies evaluating the secondary outcome, morbidity, as assessed by quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs). Four studies suggested a small to moderate benefit when HEMS was used to transfer people to higher level trauma centers. Road traffic and helicopter crashes are adverse effects which can occur with either method of transport. Data regarding safety were not available in any of the included studies. Overall, the quality of the included studies was very low as assessed by the GRADE Working Group criteria.\n\n【16】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【17】Due to the methodological weakness of the available literature, and the considerable heterogeneity of effects and study methodologies, we could not determine an accurate composite estimate of the benefit of HEMS. Although some of the 19 multivariate regression studies indicated improved survival associated with HEMS, others did not. This was also the case for the TRISS‐based studies. All were subject to a low quality of evidence as assessed by the GRADE Working Group criteria due to their nonrandomized design. The question of which elements of HEMS may be beneficial has not been fully answered. The results from this review provide motivation for future work in this area. This includes an ongoing need for diligent reporting of research methods, which is imperative for transparency and to maximize the potential utility of results. Large, multicenter studies are warranted as these will help produce more robust estimates of treatment effects. Future work in this area should also examine the costs and safety of HEMS, since multiple contextual determinants must be considered when evaluating the effects of HEMS for adults with major trauma.\n\n【18】PICOs\n-----\n\n【19】### PICOs\n\n【20】###### Population (7)\n\n【21】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Trauma\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【22】###### Intervention (2)\n\n【23】*   Provision Of Helicopter Air Ambulance\n*   Accident And Emergency Department\n\n【24】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【25】*   Accident And Emergency Department\n*   Provision Of Emergency Ambulance\n\n【26】###### Outcome (5)\n\n【27】*   Disability\n*   Hospital discharge\n*   Quality of Life\n*   Death\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【28】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Helicopters offer several potential advantages, including faster transport, and care from medical staff who are specifically trained in the management of major injuries.\n\n【36】**Study characteristics**\n\n【37】We searched the medical literature for clinical studies comparing the transport of adults who had major injuries by helicopter ambulance (HEMS) or ground ambulance (GEMS). The evidence is current to April 2015.\n\n【38】**Key results**\n\n【39】We found 38 studies which included people from 12 countries around the world. Researchers wanted to find out if using a helicopter ambulance was any better than a ground ambulance for improving an injured person's chance of survival, or reducing the severity of long‐term disability. Some of these studies indicated some benefit of HEMS for survival after major trauma, but other studies did not. The studies were of varying sizes and used different methods to determine if more people survived when transported by HEMS versus GEMS. Some studies included helicopter teams that had specialized physicians on board whereas other helicopter crews were staffed by paramedics and nurses. Furthermore, people transported by HEMS or GEMS had varying numbers and types of procedures during travel to the trauma center. The use of some of these procedures, such as the placement of a breathing tube, may have helped improve survival in some of the studies. However, these medical procedures can also be provided during ground ambulance transport. Data regarding safety were not available in any of the included studies. Road traffic and helicopter crashes are adverse effects which can occur with either method of transport.\n\n【40】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【41】Overall, the quality of the included studies was low. It is possible that HEMS may be better than GEMS for people with certain characteristics. There are various reasons why HEMS may be better, such as staff having more specialty training in managing major injuries. But more research is required to determine what elements of helicopter transport improve survival. Some studies did not describe the care available to people in the GEMS group. Due to this poor reporting it is impossible to compare the treatments people received.\n\n【42】**Conclusions**\n\n【43】Based on the current evidence, the added benefits of HEMS compared with GEMS are unclear. The results from future research might help in better allocation of HEMS within a healthcare system, with increased safety and decreased costs.\n\n【44】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【45】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【46】available in\n\n【47】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【48】### Implications for practice\n\n【49】Due to the methodological weakness of the available literature, and the considerable heterogeneity of effects and study methodologies, we were unable to determine an accurate composite estimate of the benefit of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS). The question of which elements of HEMS are most beneficial for people with trauma has not been fully answered, and any HEMS‐associated benefit could be the result of some combination of crew expertise, decreased prehospital time, and the fact that HEMS are an integral part of organized trauma systems in many high‐income countries ( Thomas 2003 ). Moreover, HEMS‐associated benefits may include physician‐adjudicated launching criteria based on severity of injury and mechanism, centrally coordinated launching algorithms with selected HEMS deployment, trauma volumes at receiving trauma centers, and the ability of the helicopter to transport people in areas inaccessible by ground vehicles or prohibitively distant from trauma centers. This review stressed the importance of triage criteria since the benefits of HEMS may be greatest for people with serious but potentially survivable injuries. Ideal dispatch criteria and triage guidelines to ensure the efficient use of helicopters remain elusive.\n\n【50】### Implications for research\n\n【51】The results from this review will motivate future work in this area, including the ongoing need for diligent reporting of research methods, which is imperative for transparency and to maximize the potential utility of results. Given the infeasibility and ethical concerns about performing randomized controlled trial for HEMS, the use of advanced methods for observational research, such as propensity scores and instrumental variables, should be considered the standard for analyzing the data from future HEMS studies. Furthermore, correct specification of logistic regression models is vital since effect estimates will be biased if the assumptions for these models are violated. Other outcomes of interest including morbidity, disability, and health‐related quality of life after HEMS versus ground emergency medical service (GEMS) transport should be also be measured to assess potential HEMS‐associated benefits. Large, multicenter studies are warranted and this will help produce more robust estimates of treatment effects; it is likely that large numbers of participants will be required to quantify outcomes accurately. Finally, the costs and safety of HEMS cannot be ignored, and future studies need to consider multiple contextual determinants if the use of HEMS is to be supported.\n\n【52】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【53】Open in table viewer\n\n【54】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Trauma currently accounts for 12% of the world's burden of disease and annually there are more than five million deaths due to injuries worldwide ( CDC 2010 ; Krug 2002 ; Murray 1996 ). By 2020, it is estimated that 1 in 10 people will die from injuries ( CDC 2010 ; Murray 1996 ).\n\n【66】### Description of the intervention\n\n【67】Early reports from the Korean and Vietnam wars suggested a 2% increase in survival for casualties as the time to definitive care improved from five hours to one hour with prompt transport by helicopter to forward‐deployed surgical theaters ( Baxt 1983 ; Baxt 1985 ; Bledsoe 2006 ; Cowley 1973 ; McNabney 1981 ; Shatz 2004 ; Taylor 2010 ). Based on the results of these wartime experiences, civilian helicopters were used for the first time in the 1970s to transport traumatically injured people to trauma centers ( Kerr 1999 ; Wish 2005 ). In Germany, the _Christoph 1_ helicopter entered service in 1970, and services rapidly expanded to over seven rescue bases ( Seegerer 1976 ). Today, the use of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) for the transportation of people with trauma is common in most developed nations ( Butler 2010 ; Champion 1990 ; Kruger 2010 ; Ringburg 2009a ). Helicopters are capable of transporting people with major trauma significantly faster than ground units and the speed benefit is more pronounced as the distance from a trauma center increases. Nevertheless, research has questioned which traumatically injured people derive the greatest benefit from the utilization of this limited and resource‐intensive form of transportation ( Bledsoe 2005 ; Bledsoe 2006 ; Cunningham 1998 ; DiBartolomeo 2005 ; Ringburg 2009a ).\n\n【68】### How the intervention might work\n\n【69】The use of HEMS is largely predicated on the concept of the 'golden hour' ( Cowley 1979 ). Time may play a crucial role in the treatment of adults with major trauma, and delays in management could worsen prognosis. Helicopter transport can decrease transport times and may facilitate earlier, definitive treatment. Several studies have established that timely and advanced trauma care may help improve mortality figures by reversing hypoperfusion to vital organs ( Cowley 1979 ; Sampalis 1999 ). In one study, the risk of death was found to be significantly increased for every 10‐minute increase in out‐of‐hospital time ( Sampalis 1999 ). However, the origins and scientific evidence for the 'golden hour', while intuitively appealing, have been questioned as has the role of HEMS in the chain of survival for people who are critically injured ( Lerner 2001 ).\n\n【70】Mortality from motor vehicle crashes is reduced when an organized system of trauma care is implemented, of which HEMS is often an important component ( Nathans 2000 ). The risk of death may be reduced by 15% to 20% when care is provided in a trauma center ( MacKenzie 2006 ; MacKenzie 2007 ). A level I trauma center provides the highest level of surgical and critical care for people with trauma. Level I trauma centers have 24‐hour surgical coverage, including in‐house coverage by orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, and other specialists, in addition to an active research program and a commitment to regional trauma education. People with major trauma who require an operation may benefit from management at a level I trauma center, but it is unclear if earlier intervention and rapid assessment alone fully explain the survival benefit ( Haas 2009 ). The mortality benefits resulting from admission to a level I trauma center may be due to the definitive surgical expertise available at these centers ( Haut 2006 ), in addition to the advanced resources for critical care and rehabilitation services ( Haut 2009 ). Furthermore, speed may not be the only contributory effect of HEMS in terms of mortality benefits for adults with major trauma. HEMS crews are typically composed of highly trained personnel, including experienced paramedics, critical care nurses, respiratory therapists, and, in some cases, physicians. Hence, any HEMS‐associated outcome benefit is likely to be the result of some combination of speed, expertise, and the role that HEMS programs have as part of integrated trauma systems ( Thomas 2003 ). Transport of injured people remains a major goal for most HEMS programs ( Thomas 2002 ); beneficial effects of specialized trauma care regarding morbidity and mortality may be mediated by HEMS.\n\n【71】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【72】Results supporting mortality benefits for adults with major trauma transported by HEMS have been inconsistent ( Ringburg 2009a ; Thomas 2002 ; Thomas 2004 ; Thomas 2007 ), resulting in substantial controversy in both the medical literature and the transportation safety arena. Many HEMS outcome studies have the limitations of small sample sizes, important heterogeneity, and other inadequate statistical methodologies. Some overviews of the literature have pointed to a clear positive effect on survival associated with HEMS transport ( Ringburg 2009a ), while others have maintained persistent skepticism about the beneficial impact of HEMS ( Bledsoe 2006 ). The use of HEMS is not without potential risk. In addition to the risk to patients, HEMS flight crews have one of the highest mortality risks of all occupations ( Baker 2006 ). For these reasons, a systematic review of the literature is warranted so that structured evidence may be produced to inform and improve clinical interventions, triage decisions, and public policies regarding HEMS. The results from this review may inform the design of subsequent randomized or nonrandomized trials through the identification of relevant subgroups of people with trauma who may benefit from HEMS transport.\n\n【73】Objectives\n----------\n\n【74】available in\n\n【75】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【76】To determine if helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) transport, compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) transport, is associated with improved morbidity and mortality for adults with major trauma.\n\n【77】Methods\n-------\n\n【78】available in\n\n【79】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【80】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【81】#### Types of studies\n\n【82】Eligible trials include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized intervention studies.\n\n【83】Evidence for benefit or harm of HEMS was not hypothesized to be found with RCTs because HEMS has become a highly integrated component of many trauma systems; therefore, we also evaluated nonrandomized studies (NRS), which is in accordance with guidance from The Cochrane Collaboration for including NRS ( Reeves 2011 ). We excluded case‐control studies as they are susceptible to different types of biases than other observational studies and allocation to groups is by outcome, which introduces further bias. We did not combine evidence from RCTs with that from NRS.\n\n【84】As NRS cover a wide variety of fundamentally different designs, we included only studies utilizing the best available designs. Studies had to include a comparison group consisting of a GEMS group with or without a comparison via a Trauma‐Related Injury Severity Score (TRISS)‐based analysis. TRISS is a logistic regression model that compares outcomes to a large cohort of people in the Major Trauma Outcomes Study (MTOS) ( Champion 1990 ). As first utilized by Baxt in 1983, TRISS‐based comparisons are made with a three‐step process ( Baxt 1983 ). First, the actual mortality of people transported by HEMS is compared with TRISS‐predicted mortality. Second, the mortality of people transported by GEMS is compared with TRISS‐predicted mortality. Third, the null hypothesis that actual survival is no different than TRISS‐predicted survival is tested for the HEMS cohort versus the GEMS cohort. For non‐United States (US) TRISS‐based studies, use of the standardized _W_ statistic was required because the _M_ statistic for non‐US populations may be below the cutoff for nonstandardized TRISS ( Schluter 2010 ). An _M_ statistic of at least 0.88 is considered acceptable for comparing non‐US populations with the MTOS cohort, based on case‐mix and injury severity. A _W_ statistic indicates the number of survivors expected per 100 people treated. We tracked non‐US TRISS‐based studies that did not report the _W_ statistic and examined them in a subgroup analysis. We also included TRISS studies reporting the _Z_ statistic. A _Z_ statistic of at least 1.96 indicates a potential survival benefit when one population is compared with the MTOS cohort ( Champion 1990 ).\n\n【85】We included studies if other techniques, such as regression modeling or stratification, were used to control for confounding. Each included study had to provide a description of how the groups were formed. We excluded any study that did not compare two or more groups of participants. Groups were defined based on time or location differences or by naturally occurring variations in treatment decisions. For example, some studies examined groups with different crew configurations, different equipment, or different capabilities to perform invasive interventions.\n\n【86】We included both prospective and retrospective NRS. If parts of a retrospective study were conducted prospectively, we only included these studies if the study was described in sufficient detail to discern this. Included studies had to describe comparability between the groups assessed. For instance, the Injury Severity Score (ISS) varied between HEMS and GEMS groups in some studies.\n\n【87】There are many potential confounders that may be responsible for any positive or detrimental effect of HEMS. Potential confounders included:\n\n【88】*   different types of prehospital interventions (i.e. needle thoracentesis, cricothyrotomy, rapid‐sequence endotracheal intubation);\n    \n*   different levels of care at the receiving trauma center (e.g. integrated trauma system versus isolated rural hospital);\n    \n*   varying expertise of HEMS versus GEMS providers (i.e. different crew configurations);\n    \n*   age, gender of participants;\n    \n*   injury stratification (i.e. ISS or other score);\n    \n*   type of traumatic injury (i.e. blunt versus penetrating trauma; isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) versus other types of trauma);\n    \n*   scene transport versus interfacility transport.\n    \n\n【89】#### Types of participants\n\n【90】Adults with major trauma and age 16 years or older. We included studies that had less than 10% of children but controlled for age with regression or stratification methods.\n\n【91】We defined major trauma by an ISS of at least 15, which has been shown to be associated with a greater need for trauma care ( Baker 1976 ; Kane 1985 ). In the event that the ISS was not reported, we considered alternative scoring systems or other definitions for major trauma such as a New Injury Severity Score (NISS) of at least 15 ( Osler 1997 ). Since any individual Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) of at least four will result in an ISS of at least 15, this was also used to indicate major trauma if studies only reported AIS ( Wyatt 1998 ). We included participants reported to have sustained 'major trauma', or a similar description that was nearly equivalent to an ISS of at least 15.\n\n【92】Studies of burn patients are not eligible for inclusion in the review.\n\n【93】#### Types of interventions\n\n【94】Transport of people with major trauma by HEMS compared with transport by GEMS.\n\n【95】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【96】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【97】*   Survival, as defined by discharge from the hospital.\n    \n\n【98】Survival is the most consequential, most consignable, and least ambiguous variable used to express outcome in HEMS studies ( Ringburg 2009a ).\n\n【99】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【100】*   Quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs).\n    \n*   Disability‐adjusted life years (DALYs).\n    \n\n【101】Since the focus of this review was the evaluation of the benefits of HEMS in terms of morbidity and mortality, we did not consider economic outcomes. The financial costs and benefits associated with HEMS are complex and sufficiently important to warrant a separate study.\n\n【102】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【103】In order to reduce publication and retrieval bias, we did not restrict our search by language, date, or publication status.\n\n【104】#### Electronic searches\n\n【105】We searched the following:\n\n【106】*   Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (29 April 2015);\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 4 of 12, 2015);\n    \n*   MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to April week 3 2015);\n    \n*   Embase Classic + Embase (OvidSP) (1947 to 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED) (1970 to April 2015);\n    \n*   ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) (1990 to April 2015);\n    \n*   ZETOC (accessed 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   OpenSIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) ( opensigle.inist.fr/ ) (accessed 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   National Library of Medicine's Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRProj) ( wwwcf.nlm.nih.gov/hsr\\_project/home\\_proj.cfm ) (accessed 29 April 2015).\n    \n\n【107】We adapted the MEDLINE search strategy, where necessary, for use in other databases. Appendix 1 provides all search strategies.\n\n【108】#### Searching other resources\n\n【109】We screened reference lists in all relevant material found to identify additional published and unpublished studies and performed handsearches of secondary references.\n\n【110】We searched the following trials registries for published and unpublished studies:\n\n【111】*   Clinicaltrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) (accessed 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   Controlled Trials metaRegister ( www.controlled‐trials.com ) (accessed 29 April 2015);\n    \n*   World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ) (accessed 29 April 2015).\n    \n\n【112】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【113】We collated the search results and merged them into a single bibliographic database. We removed duplicates before screening the titles and abstracts.\n\n【114】#### Selection of studies\n\n【115】Two review authors (SG and RS) examined the electronic search results in order to reject material that did not meet any of the inclusion criteria. Three review authors (SG, CS, and RS) independently screened the remaining titles and abstracts for reports of possibly relevant trials. We marked each study as 'exclude', 'include', or 'uncertain'.\n\n【116】One of the other three review authors cross‐reviewed all titles or abstracts classified as 'exclude' and documented the reasons for exclusion. If a title was not clearly relevant, we retrieved the full‐text version. Reasons for exclusion included studies not pertaining to traumatically injured adults, studies with nonoriginal data, single case reports, lack of a control group or description of a comparison group, or other reasons, based on the rationale described above (see Characteristics of excluded studies table).\n\n【117】We retrieved all titles or abstracts classified as 'include' or 'uncertain' in full and assessed them using the recommendations provided in Chapter 13 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Reeves 2011 ).\n\n【118】We resolved disagreements by group consensus (SG, CS, RS, and ST). If further clarification was required, we attempted to contact the authors.\n\n【119】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【120】Three review authors (SG, CS, and RS) were each assigned one‐third of the included articles and they independently extracted information on study characteristics and the results. We resolved any uncertainty about study inclusion by group consensus. We developed, pilot tested, and used data extraction and study quality forms. Extracted data included: last name and first initial of the first author, publication year, study design, participants, duration of follow‐up, definition of participant population, data for each intervention‐outcome comparison, estimate of effect with confidence intervals (CI) and P values, key conclusions of study authors, and review author's comments. We entered data into Review Manager 5 software ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【121】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【122】Two review authors (SG and RS) planned to assess risk of bias for included RCTs. We planned to evaluate six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. The risk of bias in each category was to be judged as high risk, low risk, and unclear risk according to guidance in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We intended to resolve any disagreements by group consensus.\n\n【123】For NRS not conducted entirely prospectively, we assessed risk of bias with the Downs and Black quality assessment scale ( Downs 1998 ). This is considered an acceptable tool for evaluating NRS ( Deeks 2003 ). The Downs and Black assessment tool has five items for evaluating risk of bias in NRS and we used all five subscales. The total number of points for each subscale was 11 for reporting bias, 3 for external validity, 7 for internal validity, 6 for internal validity confounding and selection bias, and 5 for power. Thresholds were established to define 'low', 'unclear', and 'high' levels of bias. Scores met the definition for a 'low' risk of bias if the scores were: at least 8/11 for reporting bias, 3/3 for external validity, at least 5/7 for internal validity, at least 5/6 for internal validity confounding and selection bias, and at least 4/5 for power. Studies were at 'high' risk of bias if the scores were: 6/11 or less for reporting bias, 1/3 or less for external validity, 4/7 or less for internal validity, 3/6 or less for internal validity confounding and selection bias, and 2/5 or less for power. Scores between the 'low' and 'high' bias thresholds were scored as 'unclear'.\n\n【124】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【125】For the dichotomous outcome of mortality, we calculated summary risk ratios (RR) or log RRs using the generic inverse‐variance method, but only if the included studies had similar design features. For the continuous secondary outcomes (QALYs and DALYs), we planned to calculate mean differences (MD); however, no studies reporting these outcomes were found.\n\n【126】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【127】The unit of analysis was the individual participant.\n\n【128】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【129】We attempted to contact the authors of included studies to request missing data. If the authors did not respond, we considered the data missing.\n\n【130】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【131】We explored possible sources of heterogeneity between studies, and constructed a forest plot. We assessed the forest plot visually for heterogeneity by examining overlap of CIs. We calculated an I <sup>2 </sup> statistic to determine the proportion of variation due to heterogeneity; we considered a value greater than 50% as an indicator of significant statistical heterogeneity and a value greater than 90% as an indicator of considerable heterogeneity. We also calculated a Chi <sup>2 </sup> statistic for heterogeneity, with a P value < 0.05 suggestive of significant heterogeneity.\n\n【132】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【133】We generated a funnel plot and examined it visually to assess for potential publication bias. We anticipated difficulty in showing that all relevant studies could be identified because of poor indexing and inconsistent use of design labels by HEMS researchers. We read full papers to determine eligibility of studies that came into question.\n\n【134】#### Data synthesis\n\n【135】We presented a narrative synthesis of our review by summarizing the design characteristics, risk of bias, and results of the included studies. We commented extensively on how each study design or quality attribute affected the quantitative result. We discussed potential sources of bias in our review, in addition to our methods used to control for these potential biases.\n\n【136】We hypothesized that several factors relating to different study designs may have an important effect on the results from individual studies. We anticipated that some studies may have used a TRISS‐based analysis, which is based on a population from the MTOS, as a control group. The TRISS analysis, which is used extensively in trauma research, is the most commonly used tool for benchmarking trauma outcomes but the coefficients have not been updated since 2010 ( Schluter 2010 ). TRISS is a weighted combination of participant age, ISS, and Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and was developed to predict a person's probability of survival (Ps) after sustaining a traumatic injury. As trauma care may have improved over time, the data from which the original coefficients were derived may not reflect present day survival. Furthermore, TRISS‐based studies may not be wholly representative of all trauma injury populations ( Champion 1990 ). We considered these limitations in all of our interpretations and analyses of TRISS‐based studies. Since 1996, the Trauma Audit and Research Network in the UK has been used to collect and analyze data for people with trauma ( Gabbe 2011 ). The developers of this trauma registry have formulated a case‐mix adjustment model that addresses some of the limitations of the TRISS model ( TARN 2011 ). Like the TRISS, the Ps for each person can be accurately calculated using age, gender, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), ISS, and an interaction term for age and gender ( TARN 2011 ).\n\n【137】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【138】Any salutary effect of HEMS is likely to be the result of some combination of speed, crew configuration (i.e. medical expertise), and that HEMS programs are often an integral part of a comprehensive trauma system ( Thomas 2003 ). Therefore, in our narrative review, we described salient aspects of the different studies that may have contributed to a multifactorial outcomes benefit or detriment.\n\n【139】To investigate the effects of the interventions more precisely, we describe the results of studies according to the methods used for analysis: 1. studies that used multivariate regression methods, 2. studies that used TRISS‐based methods, and 3. studies that used other methods for analysis. We specified a priori that we would conduct a subgroup analysis based on ISS.\n\n【140】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【141】We were able to conduct three sensitivity analyses which were specified a priori: interfacility transfers, TBI, and blunt trauma.\n\n【142】Results\n-------\n\n【143】### Description of studies\n\n【144】See Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n【145】We scored each study according to the five domains of the Downs and Black risk of bias assessment tool ( Downs 1998 ). Domain scores for each study are reported as the numerator in the risk of bias tables, with the denominator representing the maximum score for each domain.\n\n【146】#### Results of the search\n\n【147】See Figure 2 .\n\n【148】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【149】Figure 2\n\n【150】* * *\n\n【151】* * *\n\n【152】Study flow diagram.\n\n【153】Thirty‐eight studies met the entry criteria for this review.\n\n【154】#### Included studies\n\n【155】All studies were NRS; we found no RCTS. The methods of analysis used in each study are summarised in Table 1 . Nineteen studies included in the primary analysis used logistic regression to control for known confounders ( Abe 2014 ; Andruskow 2013 ; Braithwaite 1998 ; Brown 2010 ; Bulger 2012 ; Cunningham 1997 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Frey 1999 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Koury 1998 ; Newgard 2010 ; Ryb 2013 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Stewart 2011 ; Sullivent 2011 ; Talving 2009 ; Thomas 2002 ; von Recklinghausen 2011 ). Eight studies in the primary analysis used TRISS methods ( Andruskow 2013 ; Biewener 2004 ; Buntman 2002 ; Frink 2007 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Nicholl 1995 ; Phillips 1999 ; Schwartz 1990 ). Two studies did not use TRISS methods or regression but relied on stratification to control for confounding factors ( Nardi 1994 ; Weninger 2005 ). In Nardi 1994 , all participants had an ISS of at least 15, and only data from people transported by HEMS and GEMS to level I centers were used. Weninger 2005 used extensive stratification by physiologic parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and AIS to evaluate people transported by HEMS and GEMS.\n\n【156】Open in table viewer\n\n【157】Table 1.

Four studies examined outcomes for people sustaining blunt trauma ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Thomas 2002 ). Of the four blunt trauma studies, two used TRISS‐based methods ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ) and two used logistic regression ( Desmettre 2012 ; Thomas 2002 ). Six studies focused on TBI ( Baxt 1987 ; Berlot 2009 ; Bulger 2012 ; Davis 2005 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Schiller 1988 ). Of these six studies, two were TRISS‐based ( Baxt 1987 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ), two used logistic regression ( Bulger 2012 ; Davis 2005 ), and two reported unadjusted mortality without stratification ( Berlot 2009 ; Schiller 1988 ).\n\n【160】Four studies examining the role of people transferred by HEMS versus GEMS met the inclusion criteria for a sensitivity analysis that was planned a priori ( Brown 2011 ; McVey 2010 ; Mitchell 2007 ; Moylan 1988 ). One transfer study used logistic regression ( Brown 2011 ), and two used TRISS‐based methods ( McVey 2010 ; Mitchell 2007 ). Another transfer study stratified people according to trauma score ( Moylan 1988 ).\n\n【161】#### Excluded studies\n\n【162】See Characteristics of excluded studies table.\n\n【163】Several HEMS studies examined the effect of physician‐based helicopter treatment teams (HTTs). HTTs, used extensively in European systems in Germany and the Netherlands, rarely transport the person in the helicopter and we excluded these studies since the main objective of this review was to determine the effect of HEMS versus GEMS transport for traumatically injured adults. Only one study examined people with burns, and we excluded this study. Some studies used TRISS to compare the outcomes of people transported by HEMS with the MTOS cohort, but not GEMS, and we excluded these studies since they violated the TRISS methods for comparing HEMS with GEMS as originally described by Baxt 1983 . Figure 2 describes additional study exclusions.\n\n【164】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【165】See Figure 3 and Figure 1 .\n\n【166】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【167】Figure 3\n\n【168】* * *\n\n【169】* * *\n\n【170】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【171】We assessed risk of bias with the Downs and Black assessment tool ( Downs 1998 ). The highest possible score for this instrument is 32. The mean overall quality score for all included studies was 15.9 (range 6 to 27). Overall, the majority of studies were of low methodologic quality and no study had an overall 'low' risk of bias. Only two studies included a valid power calculation ( Galvagno 2012 ; Thomas 2002 ). Thirteen studies (34.2%) had an overall quality score of at least 19 ( Abe 2014 ; Bulger 2012 ; Davis 2005 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Newgard 2010 ; Nicholl 1995 ; Ryb 2013 ; Stewart 2011 ; Thomas 2002 ; von Recklinghausen 2011 ).\n\n【172】#### Allocation\n\n【173】All studies had an unclear or high level of selection bias. This was not a surprising finding considering the nature of the included studies; selection bias is an inherent risk of NRS.\n\n【174】One potential source of selection bias was injury severity; not all studies used ISS of at least 15 as an inclusion criterion, and some studies used other measures of injury severity. In Phillips 1999 , participants were stratified by probability of survival (Ps) rather than ISS and, therefore, we only included people with a Ps less than 50% in our review. The study by Talving 2009 consisted of a participant population that had an ISS less than 15 in 74% of individuals; we only used data from the subgroup in this study with an ISS of at least 15. In Cunningham 1997 , the mean ISS was lower than 15 in the GEMS group, but participants were stratified by ISS and logistic regression was used to adjust for differences in injury severity. Although ISS was not used in Moylan 1988 , we included this study because participants were stratified by trauma score, and the mean trauma score was 8.7 for people transported by HEMS and 9.2 for people transported by GEMS (P value not reported).\n\n【175】Most studies attempted to control for confounding. Of the 28 studies in the primary analysis, including the four transfer studies in the prespecified sensitivity analysis, 14 studies (50%) used multivariable logistic regression. Only six studies reported regression diagnostics to ensure that the regression model was specified correctly ( Abe 2014 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Newgard 2010 ; Sullivent 2011 ; Thomas 2002 ). Four studies used advanced regression techniques including propensity scores ( Abe 2014 ; Davis 2005 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Stewart 2011 ), instrumental variables ( Newgard 2010 ), and techniques to control for clustering by trauma center ( Thomas 2002 ).\n\n【176】Fourteen studies relied on a TRISS‐based analysis to compare both HEMS and GEMS outcomes against the MTOS cohort; however, TRISS‐based statistics were not reported consistently. The validity of TRISS methods has been questioned because the MTOS was established over two decades ago ( Champion 1990 ), and changes in injury prevention and trauma care may preclude valid comparisons over time. Participants in the MTOS might have had a worse prognosis or different injury severity than contemporary trauma participants. To adjust for these potential differences, investigators using TRISS are encouraged to report an _M_ statistic to ensure that severity and case‐mix is comparable ( Schluter 2010 ). Only one study included in this review reported an _M_ statistic ( Buntman 2002 ). Eight TRISS studies were published after 2000 and it is possible that these populations might have differed significantly from the original MTOS cohort ( Andruskow 2013 ; Biewener 2004 ; Buntman 2002 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Frink 2007 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; McVey 2010 ; Mitchell 2007 ). Di Bartolomeo 2001 attempted to control for case‐mix differences by comparing participants with an Italian MTOS cohort. Four studies reported the _W_ statistic ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; McVey 2010 ; Mitchell 2007 ). Five studies reported a _Z_ statistic ( Baxt 1983 ; Biewener 2004 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Phillips 1999 ; Schwartz 1990 ), and four studies did not formally report any TRISS statistics ( Andruskow 2013 ; Baxt 1987 ; Frink 2007 ; Nicholl 1995 ).\n\n【177】Crew configuration varied widely between studies and this may have had an effect on mortality since people transported by HEMS or GEMS might have been preferentially exposed to potential life‐saving interventions. For example, in one of the earliest and best‐known HEMS studies, Baxt 1983 reported a 52% reduction in mortality for the HEMS group. In this study, the HEMS crews consisted of an acute care physician who could perform advanced airway interventions, while the prehospital interventions authorized for the GEMS group were limited to advanced first aid and placement of an esophageal obturator airway. HEMS and GEMS crew configurations were not described in all studies and fewer than half of all studies included in the primary analysis described the type and frequency of prehospital interventions. The Characteristics of included studies table describes the crew configurations for the studies that provided this information. Sixteen studies included in the primary analysis had physicians as part of the HEMS crew ( Abe 2014 ; Andruskow 2013 ; Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Baxt 1987 ; Berlot 2009 ; Davis 2005 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Frink 2007 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Nardi 1994 ; Nicholl 1995 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Thomas 2002 ; Weninger 2005 ). Twelve studies did not describe the crew configuration for HEMS or GEMS ( Biewener 2004 ; Brown 2010 ; Bulger 2012 ; Cunningham 1997 ; Frey 1999 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Newgard 2010 ; Rose 2012 ; Ryb 2013 ; Schiller 1988 ; Stewart 2011 ; Sullivent 2011 ). Fourteen studies described the frequency and types of prehospital interventions performed between the HEMS and GEMS groups ( Abe 2014 ; Andruskow 2013 ; Bartolacci 1998 ; Berlot 2009 ; Biewener 2004 ; Bulger 2012 ; Davis 2005 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Nardi 1994 ; Phillips 1999 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Weninger 2005 ), whereas two studies only described the frequency of endotracheal intubation ( Stewart 2011 ; Talving 2009 ).\n\n【178】#### Blinding\n\n【179】None of the included studies attempted to blind study participants to the intervention of HEMS versus GEMS. None of the included studies made an attempt to blind those measuring the main outcome of the intervention (HEMS versus GEMS). This resulted in either an 'unclear' or 'high' degree of bias, indicating poor levels of internal validity, for over 90% of the included studies. Detection bias was possible in the majority of included studies due to the retrospective nature of the study designs and because for people with an ISS of at least 15 mortality is more likely. It is also possible that deaths were recorded more frequently in the trauma registries that served as a primary source of data for most of the included studies. Survivors lost to follow‐up might not have been captured in the registries, biasing the results. Furthermore, mortality definitions differed among studies. Thirty‐day mortality may be different from 60‐day mortality, and this outcome is often difficult to assess. Most studies did not provide information on duration of follow‐up.\n\n【180】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【181】We did not include studies with incomplete outcome data in this review; however, attrition bias could not be accurately assessed due to the retrospective nature of the study designs. None of the studies adjusted the analyses for different lengths of follow‐up, and it is possible that not all outcomes were available. Losses to participant follow‐up were not taken into account in any of the included studies and this explains why over 80% of included studies were at high risk of bias in terms of internal validity. For the unadjusted analysis ( Analysis 1.1 ), data were available for 28 of the 38 studies in the primary analysis.\n\n【182】#### Selective reporting\n\n【183】None of the studies fully controlled for all known confounders; 50% of all included studies had a low level of reporting bias and the remaining 50% had a high level of reporting bias. We assessed publication bias with a funnel plot ( Figure 4 ). Trials were seen both to the right and left of the point of no effect, with no trials clustered around the line indicating no difference. There was an empty zone in the lower right quadrant of the plot. Therefore, it is possible that publication bias was present. This result might also be explained by the considerable clinical heterogeneity among the included studies. It is possible that smaller studies with results that were not statistically significant were never published.\n\n【184】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【185】Figure 4\n\n【186】* * *\n\n【187】* * *\n\n【188】Funnel plot of comparison: helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) versus ground emergency medical services (GEMS), outcome: 1.1 Overall unadjusted mortality.\n\n【189】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【190】Eleven studies had a minority of children included in the groups; however, the mean age in all of these studies was reported to be greater than 25 years. One study had 74% of people with an ISS less than 15 ( Talving 2009 ); we included only the results from the subgroup with an ISS at least 15.\n\n【191】Effect estimates, and associated CIs in studies using regression techniques, might be inaccurate based on the availability of the data used to specify the regression model. For instance, five studies use the National Trauma Data Bank (USA) ( Brown 2010 ; Brown 2011 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Ryb 2013 ; Sullivent 2011 ), and this data source is known to have a high proportion of missing data, especially for the physiological variables that the authors included as covariates ( Roudsari 2008 ).\n\n【192】### Effects of interventions\n\n【193】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Helicopter emergency medical services compared with ground emergency medical services for adults with major trauma\n\n【194】See summary of findings Table for the main comparison .\n\n【195】#### Primary outcome measure ‐ Survival (defined as discharge from the hospital)\n\n【196】Twenty‐eight of the included studies had extractable data on unadjusted mortality ( Analysis 1.1 ). Considerable heterogeneity was observed as indicated by an I <sup>2 </sup> value of 98% and a highly statistically significant Chi <sup>2 </sup> test for heterogeneity (P value < 0.00001). Combining the results from these unequally sized and heterogeneous studies in a meta‐analysis would be likely to lead to a Yule‐Simpson effect (i.e. Simpson's paradox) and flawed conclusions. For example, when certain groups are combined without accounting for injury severity and other confounders, a correlation may be present. This correlation may disappear when the groups are stratified or when analyzed with regression techniques. Such a phenomenon appears to be evident in Analysis 1.1 . Four studies that appeared to show a pronounced benefit for GEMS based on unadjusted mortality had opposite and statistically significant greater odds of survival for people transported by HEMS after adjusting for confounders with multivariable logistic regression ( Galvagno 2012 ; Stewart 2011 ; Sullivent 2011 ; Thomas 2002 ) ( Table 2 ). Another study that appeared to favor GEMS based on unadjusted mortality significantly showed no statistical difference between HEMS and GEMS after adjustment with regression ( Cunningham 1997 ). Similarly, based on the unadjusted mortality from Buntman 2002 and Giannakopoulus 2013 , one would infer that GEMS is superior to HEMS. However, after TRISS methods were applied, HEMS was shown to improve survival by 21.43% in Buntman 2002 , and Giannakopoulus 2013 calculated 5.4 additional lives per 100 HEMS transports. Alternatively, several studies that appeared to support clearly HEMS based on unadjusted mortality had small sample sizes and the results from these studies might have been biased ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Baxt 1987 ; Koury 1998 ; Nardi 1994 ).\n\n【197】Open in table viewer\n\n【198】Table 2.

Three of these studies were regression‐based and all three indicated a statistically significantly improved odds of survival ( Brown 2010 ; Frey 1999 ; Newgard 2010 ). Schwartz 1990 used a TRISS analysis to demonstrate an improvement in predicted survival for HEMS but not GEMS, a finding that was contrary to the results from an unadjusted analysis; a similar result was observed in a more recent study by Giannakopoulus 2013 . Due to the considerable clinical and methodological heterogeneity found in the included studies, a pooled estimate of effect is not presented.\n\n【213】##### Subgroup analyses\n\n【214】To investigate the effects of the interventions more precisely, we describe the results of studies according to the methods used for analysis: 1. studies that used multivariate regression methods, 2. studies that used TRISS‐based methods, and 3. studies that used other methods for analysis.\n\n【215】##### 1\\. Studies that used multivariate regression methods\n\n【216】Nineteen studies used multivariate regression techniques to adjust for known confounders ( Abe 2014 ; Andruskow 2013 ; Braithwaite 1998 ; Brown 2010 ; Bulger 2012 ; Cunningham 1997 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Frey 1999 ; Galvagno 2012 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Koury 1998 ; Newgard 2010 ; Ryb 2013 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Stewart 2011 ; Sullivent 2011 ; Talving 2009 ; Thomas 2002 ; von Recklinghausen 2011 ). Table 2 shows the effect estimates and 95% CIs from these 19 studies (effect estimates and CIs were not available for Cunningham 1997 , Giannakopoulus 2013 and Schwartz 1990 ). The results from three of these studies focused exclusively on people with blunt trauma ( Braithwaite 1998 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Thomas 2002 ), and these studies are summarized in the section below 'Sensitivity analysis, blunt trauma'. The results from Andruskow 2013 and Giannakopoulus 2013 are described in the section detailing the results from TRISS‐based studies since this was the primary analysis performed in these studies.\n\n【217】Abe 2014 utilized the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) to examine retrospectively 2090 HEMS transports and 22,203 GEMS transports between 2004 and 2011. The study used three different logistic regression techniques, adjusting for age, sex, type of trauma, ISS, and prehospital treatments. HEMS were staffed by a physician and nurse and GEMS were staffed by an emergency medical technician (EMT) and firefighter. In all three logistic regression models, HEMS was independently associated with statistically significantly improved survival to hospital discharge when compared with GEMS.\n\n【218】Brown 2010 analyzed 41,987 HEMS transports and 216,400 GEMS transports from the 2007 National Trauma Data Bank. When adjusting for ISS, age, gender, injury mechanism, vital signs, type of trauma center, and urgency of operation, HEMS was associated with a statistically significant greater odds of survival to hospital discharge (odds ratio (OR) 1.22; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.27; P value < 0.01).\n\n【219】Bulger 2012 and researchers from the North American Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium conducted a retrospective analysis from two RCTs that enrolled people with severe TBI or hypovolemic shock. The study analyzed 2049 people in both the shock and TBI cohorts. More people had penetrating trauma in the GEMS group (21.2%) compared with the HEMS group (6%). Mean ISS was higher in HEMS group (30.1) compared with the GEMS group (22.8; P value < 0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, mechanism, GCS, hypotension, heart rate, ISS, site of enrolment, and AIS, was used to calculate odds of 24‐hour and 28‐day survival. While the OR for overall survival was 1.11 favoring HEMS, this result was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.82 to 1.51). Nonsignificant results were found independently when the shock and TBI cohorts were analyzed separately. This study had a total number of people of 2049; yet, to detect up to a 5% survival advantage in either the HEMS or GEMS cohort, with 80% power at the 5% significance level, at least 2526 participants would have to be enrolled; a far greater number of participants would have to be enrolled to detect even smaller differences in survival. Of the 703 people transported by HEMS, 60% came from three trauma centers.\n\n【220】Cunningham 1997 found that HEMS was associated with statistically significant survival benefit for people with mid‐range, but not higher, acuity. People with an ISS of 21 to 30 had 56% survival in the HEMS group versus 37.4% survival in the GEMS group. For people with an ISS of 31 to 40, 80% of the HEMS group survived versus 62.8% of the GEMS group. However, for the most severely injured people with a Ps less than 90%, the HEMS group had 66.9% survival and the GEMS group had 81.9% survival.\n\n【221】Desmettre 2012 studied the impact of HEMS versus GEMS on mortality of people with severe blunt trauma. This French study included 1958 participants, of which 74% were transported by GEMS and 26% by HEMS. Although crew configurations both consisted of physicians, HEMS crews were staffed by a team that included an emergency physician from a regional University hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, controlling for several prehospital physiologic and injury‐specific variables. Interaction terms between mode of transport and other independent variables were assessed in the regression model. People treated by HEMS crews were more likely to be treated aggressively with interventions such as endotracheal intubation, administration of fluids, treatment with vasopressors, and blood product transfusion. After adjustment, the risk for survival was greater in the HEMS group (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; P value = 0.035).\n\n【222】Frey 1999 reported in an abstract on 12,233 people involved in motor vehicle crashes admitted to trauma centers in Pennsylvania, PA, USA. There was no difference in survival between transport by HEMS or GEMS (OR 1.34; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.80; P value not reported). Reasons for a lack of statistical significance may be due to residual confounding, transport of people with lower severity trauma, and the fact that this study included only people involved in motor vehicle crashes. Recent advances in vehicle safety may partially explain why no benefit was found when HEMS was compared with GEMS.\n\n【223】Galvagno 2012 used the National Trauma Data Bank to analyze 223,475 people transported by HEMS or GEMS to a level I or level II trauma center. Outcomes were assessed with multiple regression methods. After a propensity score matching was used in a logistic regression, and after outcomes were assessed in an analysis stratified by type of trauma center, people transported by HEMS were statistically significantly more likely to survive to hospital discharge compared with people transported by GEMS. The effect estimate (OR) was more conservative after propensity score matching as compared with two standard logistic regression and an analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to control for clustering by trauma center. The study did not account for crew expertise, distance, time, and prehospital interventions.\n\n【224】A retrospective cohort study by Koury 1998 found no difference in survival in people with an ISS of at least 25 and transported by HEMS (OR 1.6; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.34; P value = 0.24). This study controlled for confounding factors such as age, type of trauma, ISS, hospital length of stay, and length of emergency room stay. This study also included some children (14% to 16.7%) and interfacility transfers, although these factors were adjusted for in the regression model. The relatively small number of participants in Koury et al (n = 272) may explain the wide CI for the effect estimate. Moreover, a higher ISS cutoff was used (≥ 25) and the authors acknowledged that the study was likely to be underpowered to find a difference between HEMS and GEMS.\n\n【225】Newgard 2010 conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort registry study of adults with trauma transported by 146 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies to 51 level I and II trauma centers in North America. A multivariate regression model using instrumental variables was used to study the association of EMS intervals and mortality among people with trauma with field‐based physiologic abnormalities, using distance from a trauma center as the instrument. There was no difference in survival with the use of HEMS (OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.68 to 2.94; P value not reported) in the multivariate model. The primary objective of this study was to test the association of EMS intervals and mortality among people with trauma (e.g. the 'golden hour' concept) and HEMS was only analyzed as one independent variable that might have influenced outcome.\n\n【226】Ryb 2013 used data from 2007 available in the National Trauma Data Bank to examine the effect of HEMS on trauma survival across different subpopulations of people with trauma in relation to injury severity, degree of physiologic derangement, and transport time. The study analyzed 192,422 people with complete data. Using multiple logistic regression models adjusting for ISS, levels of physiologic derangement, and different transport times, HEMS was statistically significantly associated with improved survival (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.65 to 1.92). When stratified by RTS as a marker of physiologic instability, people transported by HEMS with worse scores had significantly higher adjusted odds of survival. The limitations of the National Trauma Data Bank must be considered when interpreting the results from this study (see Other potential sources of bias ).\n\n【227】Stewart 2011 calculated a propensity score based on prehospital variables (age, gender, mechanism of injury, respiratory rate, anatomic triage criteria, intubation, level of prehospital care, and road distance to a trauma center) and hospital variables (RTS on arrival at emergency room, ISS, time from receipt of EMS call to arrival at emergency room, time in minutes from receipt of the first EMS call to time of death). This study included 10,184 people in the state of Oklahoma, USA who were admitted to one level I trauma center or one of two level II trauma centers. The propensity score was used as a single confounding covariate in a Cox multivariable proportional hazards regression model to determine the association between mode of transport and mortality. Overall, people transported by HEMS had a statistically significantly higher HR for survival compared with people transported by GEMS (HR for improved survival 1.49; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.89; P value = 0.001). In the most severely injured people (RTS of 3 or less at the scene), the mode of transport was not associated with improved survival.\n\n【228】Sullivent 2011 used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between mortality and transportation between HEMS and GEMS. The 2007 National Trauma Data Bank was used for this study, with 148,270 records of people treated at 82 participating trauma centers in the USA. The authors stratified the regression analysis results by three age categories: 18 years and over, 18 to 54 years, and 55 years and over. Overall, HEMS transport conferred a statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.45 to 1.87; P value < 0.0001), although in the age category 55 years and over, there was no difference in survival between HEMS and GEMS (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.75; P value = 0.42).\n\n【229】Talving 2009 retrospectively examined data for 1836 people transported by HEMS or GEMS in a predominantly urban environment. In the subgroup of people with an ISS of at least 15, there was no difference in survival between people transported by HEMS or GEMS (OR 1.81; 95% CI 0.55 to 5.88; P value = 0.33). An analysis of four high‐risk subgroups was conducted in this study. People with ISS of at least 15, penetrating trauma, a head AIS of at least 4, or systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg did not experience a statistically significantly benefit from HEMS transport in a multivariable analysis adjusting for age, vital signs, injury mechanism, and injury severity. The lack of benefit in this study may be due to the geographical location of the HEMS program that was studied. The region serviced by HEMS was predominantly urban and HEMS was used when transport times exceeded 30 minutes. Thirty minutes may not be a clinically important cutoff to justify HEMS use, and patient over‐triage was likely in this study.\n\n【230】von Recklinghausen 2011 compared rural GEMS and HEMS in a retrospective cohort of 2164 participants at one level I trauma center in the northeastern USA. There was no difference in survival among people transported by HEMS or GEMS with ISS scores of 16 to 24 (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.2). Among people with ISS of 25 to 75, there was also no difference in survival (OR 1.87; 95% CI 0.94 to 3.66). Information about crew expertise and en route interventions was not available. With a low mortality in both the HEMS (6.46%) and GEMS group (5.5%; P value = 0.35), the study was not likely powered to find a statistically significant difference in survival.\n\n【231】##### 2\\. Studies that used Trauma‐Related Injury Severity Score‐based methods\n\n【232】Fourteen studies used TRISS‐based methods to compare survival for HEMS versus GEMS against the standard of the MTOS cohort ( Andruskow 2013 ; Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Biewener 2004 ; Buntman 2002 ; Frink 2007 ; Giannakopoulus 2013 ; Nicholl 1995 ; Phillips 1999 ; Schwartz 1990 ).\n\n【233】In Andruskow 2013 , outcomes from physician‐led HEMS and GEMS teams were compared using TRISS methodology. People transported by HEMS had higher ISS compared with people transported by GEMS (26.0 with HEMS versus 23.7 with GEMS; P value < 0.001). The people in the HEMS group were also treated more aggressively with more frequent endotracheal intubation, chest thoracostomy tube placement, and treatment with vasopressors. Predicted mortality according to TRISS was lower in both HEMS and GEMS groups. For people transported to level I trauma centers, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was significantly decreased in the HEMS group compared with the GEMS group (0.647 with HEMS versus 0.815 with GEMS; P value = 0.002). The authors performed a multivariable regression analysis and found an improved odds of survival for the HEMS group compared with the GEMS group when 11 confounding variables were included in the regression model (OR for survival in HEMS group: 1.33; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.57). The study reported neither the _M_ or _W_ statistics.\n\n【234】The results from Bartolacci 1998 are discussed in the preceding section ('Studies that used multivariate regression methods'). There was a significant difference between observed and expected survivors for people transported by HEMS ( _Z_ \\= 3.38; P value < 0.0001). The _W_ statistic reported in this study was 11.88, which suggests nearly 12 expected survivors for every 100 people flown; but the _M_ statistic was 0.52, which is less than the acceptable 0.88 threshold for comparing populations ( Schluter 2010 ). The nonsignificant _M_ statistic indicated that there was a higher proportion of people with a low Ps in the HEMS group compared with the MTOS cohort.\n\n【235】Baxt 1983 studied 300 consecutive HEMS and GEMS transports to a level I trauma center over a 30‐month period. Although the actual _Z_ statistic was not reported, a 52% reduction in predicted mortality occurred in the HEMS group (P value < 0.001). Overall, 20.62 people were predicted to die in the HEMS group based on a comparison with the MTOS cohort, but only 10 people died. In the GEMS group, 14.79 people were predicted to die but 19 died. Major improvements in survival were most pronounced for the more seriously injured participant groups. For people with a 24% or less chance of survival, four people transported by HEMS died when 7.03 were predicted to die; in the GEMS group, six people died when 7.03 were predicted to die.\n\n【236】Biewener 2004 assessed the impact of rural HEMS versus urban GEMS in 403 people with trauma in the Dresden region in Germany. The study used TRISS‐based methods only to compare HEMS versus GEMS for people transported directly from the scene to a level I trauma center. No TRISS statistics were reported. In the HEMS groups, the TRISS analysis identified 27 unexpected survivors and four unexpected deaths out of the 140 people transported. In the GEMS group there were 13 unexpected survivors and two unexpected deaths from the people transported. The TRISS evaluation did not identify any differences between the HEMS and GEMS groups in terms of survival. In a multivariate regression model, there was also no difference in survival (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.34; P value not reported).\n\n【237】Buntman 2002 reported the results from a prospective database analysis of 428 people transported by HEMS and GEMS in South Africa. Survival rates in the HEMS and GEMS groups were compared with TRISS‐predicted survival rates, and people with a Ps less than 65% were more likely to survive if transported by HEMS. Overall, 38.15 people in the HEMS group were expected to die and 39 actually died ( _Z_ \\= 0.223), and 38.96 people in the GEMS group were predicted to die and 51 actually died ( _Z_ \\= 2.939). The difference in the _Z_ statistic between the HEMS and GEMS groups was 1.921 (P value < 0.05) indicating a greater chance for survival in the HEMS group than the GEMS group. It should be noted that the _M_ statistic reported in this study was 0.618 for the HEMS group and 0.867 for the GEMS group; both groups did not meet the threshold for accurate comparison to the MTOS cohort.\n\n【238】Frink 2007 retrospectively evaluated 7534 people transported by HEMS and GEMS in Germany and used a TRISS prediction of survival to demonstrate a survival benefit for people transported by HEMS, though no specific TRISS statistics were reported in this study. Overall mortality was 34.9% in the HEMS group versus 40.1% in the GEMS group (P value < 0.01), but this difference was only found in people with an ISS less than 61.\n\n【239】Giannakopoulus 2013 analyzed 1073 people with an ISS of at least 16 and transported directly from the scene by HEMS or GEMS. HEMS crews consisted of a physician capable of providing advanced airway management and limited surgical interventions. The study did not describe the configuration of the GEMS crew. There was a longer on‐scene time in the HEMS group compared with the GEMS group (27.1 minutes with HEMS versus 20.7 minutes with GEMS, P value < 0.001), and the HEMS population was younger (mean age: 40.5 with HEMS versus 49.3 with GEMS; P value < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the types of injuries. Unadjusted analysis indicated a higher mortality in the HEMS group (28.7% with HEMS versus 12.3% with GEMS, P value < 0.001). However, people in the HEMS group had a significantly higher ISS. The _M_ statistic showed that the population in this study was not comparable to the original TRISS MTOS population, likely because of the higher ISS (> 16) used as an inclusion criteria for this study. The _Z_ statistic showed a positive difference between the observed and the estimated survival for the HEMS group (P value < 0.005) indicating that the actual survival for the HEMS group was higher than predicted by TRISS; there was no difference in the predicted and the actual survival in the GEMS group. When the RTS reached 9 or less, the difference in survival between the groups increased, demonstrating an increased chance of survival for people transported by HEMS. The authors concluded that 5.4 people with multiple traumatic injuries were saved for every 100 HEMS deployments.\n\n【240】Nicholl 1995 compared 337 people transported by HEMS and 466 people transported by GEMS in the UK using the TRISS methodology. The number of HEMS deaths exceeded the MTOS norms by 15.6%, compared with an excess of 2.4% in the GEMS group. No TRISS‐specific statistics were reported and overall mortality for people with an ISS of at least 15 was 51% in the HEMS group and 44% in the GEMS group (not statistically significant, P value not reported). There was no difference in survival between people transported by HEMS compared with GEMS, who had an ISS of 16 to 24 (OR for improved survival 1.25; 95% CI 0.44 to 3.33) or an ISS of 25 to 40 (OR for improved survival 1.11; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.43). In both of these ISS groups, there were fewer than 60 people in each group, thus the wide CIs are likely due to the relatively small number of people within each subgroup.\n\n【241】Phillips 1999 used the TRISS methodology to compare mortality rates of 792 people with trauma transported by HEMS or GEMS in Texas, USA. The _Z_ statistic was not significant for actual versus predicted deaths for HEMS ( _Z_ \\= 0.40) or GEMS ( _Z_ \\= 0.151). The HEMS group sustained 15 deaths compared with a TRISS‐predicted rate of 16.44 deaths; the GEMS group sustained 41 deaths compared with a TRISS‐predicted rate of 39.11 deaths; neither result was statistically significant.\n\n【242】Schwartz 1990 reported on a series of people with blunt trauma transported by HEMS or GEMS to a single level I trauma center in Connecticut, USA, during 1987 and 1988. This study used TRISS methodology, but did not report _W_ , _Z_ , and _M_ statistics. HEMS crews were comprised of highly trained providers, including a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist, while GEMS crews were comprised of an EMT and paramedic. People transported by HEMS had a Ps of 2.23 standard deviations better than the national norm, while people transported by GEMS had a survival ‐2.69 standard deviations below the national norm. More people in the HEMS group were intubated (42% with HEMS versus 3% with GEMS) and more people in the HEMS group were treated with a pneumatic antishock garment (56% with HEMS versus 30% with GEMS). There was no significant difference in the prehospital times for either HEMS or GEMS once crews had arrived at the scene.\n\n【243】##### 3\\. Studies using other methods to adjust for confounding\n\n【244】Three additional studies that did not use regression techniques or a TRISS‐based analysis met the inclusion criteria ( Nardi 1994 ; Rose 2012 ; Weninger 2005 ).\n\n【245】The results from Nardi 1994 are summarized in the 'Blunt trauma studies' section. This study did not utilize TRISS‐based methods or regression techniques.\n\n【246】In Weninger 2005 , people transported by HEMS and by GEMS were similar in age, sex, and injury severity. People in the HEMS group had more frequent administration of intravenous fluids, endotracheal intubation, and chest tube placement than people in the GEMS group. Twenty of 104 (19.2%) people transported by HEMS died (19.2%) versus 39 of 172 (22.7%) people transported by GEMS (P value not reported).\n\n【247】Rose 2012 performed a stratified analysis of 1028 HEMS and 1443 GEMS transports in Alabama, USA. The mode of transport was stratified only by ISS and mean miles to a trauma center. HEMS did not improve survival for people with high ISS (> 30) or in people with lower ISS (< 10) transported from rural areas. The study made no adjustments for crew expertise, prehospital interventions, types of injuries, physiologic data, or other variables. This study was limited by considerable low methodological quality, and did not employ descriptive statistics for between‐group comparisons.\n\n【248】###### Sensitivity analyses\n\n【249】**1\\. Traumatic brain injury studies**\n\n【250】Five studies focused on the role of HEMS versus GEMS transport for TBI ( Baxt 1987 ; Berlot 2009 ; Davis 2005 ; Di Bartolomeo 2001 ; Schiller 1988 ). These studies analyzed 11,528 people and data were available from all five studies to calculate unadjusted mortality. There was moderate heterogeneity in this subgroup (Chi <sup>2 </sup> \\= 6.80; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 41%). Based on the raw mortality data from these five trials, there was no association with improved survival (RR 1.02 in favor of HEMS; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23).\n\n【251】Davis 2005 studied 10,314 people transported by HEMS or GEMS. They used propensity scores to account for the variability in selection of people undergoing HEMS versus GEMS transport and used a multivariate regression model to adjust for age, sex, mechanism of injury, hypotension, GCS, AIS, and ISS. There was an improved odds of survival for people transported by HEMS after adjustment for potential confounders (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.25; P value < 0.0001). When stratified by GCS, there was a statistically significant survival benefit observed only for the GCS group with a score of 3 to 8 (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.23; P value < 0.001).\n\n【252】Di Bartolomeo 2001 utilized a population‐based, prospective cohort design to investigate the effect of two different patterns of prehospital care in the Fiuli‐Venezia Giulia region of Italy. The HEMS group was staffed by a physician and the GEMS group was staffed by a nurse. Significantly more people in the HEMS group received chest tube placement, placement of intravenous lines, and advanced modes of ventilation, including endotracheal intubation. After controlling for transport mode, gender, age, ISS, and RTS, there was no difference in survival between HEMS and GEMS (OR not reported; P value = 0.68). For people requiring urgent neurosurgery, there was no difference in survival between HEMS and GEMS (OR 1.56; 95% CI 0.38 to 6.25; P value not reported).\n\n【253】Schiller 1988 was a retrospective cohort of 606 people in a primarily urban setting in Phoenix, AZ, USA. Unadjusted mortality was statistically significantly higher for HEMS (18%) versus GEMS (13%) (P value < 0.05). All participants in this cohort had blunt trauma and 80% had a TBI. All participants had an ISS between 20 and 39. All participants were transported to a level I trauma center but the study did not describe crew configurations.\n\n【254】Baxt 1987 studied the impact of HEMS versus GEMS for 128 consecutive participants with TBI in San Diego, CA, USA. HEMS crews consisted of an attending physician and nurse, and GEMS crews consisted of EMTs capable of providing only basic life support. Overall unadjusted mortality was 31% in the HEMS group and 40% in the GEMS group (P value < 0.0001). For GCS scores of 5, 6, or 7 the GEMS group had improved mortality; however, for GCS scores of 3 or 4, mortality was statistically significantly lower for the HEMS group (52%) versus the GEMS group (64%) (P value not reported for this subgroup).\n\n【255】Berlot 2009 retrospectively compared HEMS versus GEMS outcomes in 194 people with an AIS‐head of 9 or greater and an ISS of 15 or greater. HEMS crews consisted of two nurses and an anesthesiologist. GEMS crews consisted of a physician capable of providing only basic life support and two nurses trained in emergency care. People in the HEMS group had an unadjusted mortality of 21% versus 25% in the GEMS group (P value < 0.05); 54% of people in the HEMS group survived with only minor neurologic disability compared with 44% of people in the GEMS group (P value < 0.05).\n\n【256】**2\\. Blunt trauma studies**\n\n【257】Seven studies consisted of a population of adults with blunt trauma ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Braithwaite 1998 ; Desmettre 2012 ; Nardi 1994 ; Schwartz 1990 ; Thomas 2002 ). Heterogeneity in this subgroup was considerable (Chi <sup>2 </sup> \\= 111.44, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 97%). All studies provided data to estimate unadjusted mortality but due to the heterogeneity, a reliable effect estimate and associated CI, could not be estimated. These data, when considered collectively, suggest an overall benefit of HEMS versus GEMS for adults with major trauma, although meta‐analysis could not be performed to provide a precise estimate of the effect size.\n\n【258】The results from Desmettre 2012 are discussed in the 'Traumatic brain injury studies' section describing studies that used regression to control for confounding variables.\n\n【259】In Bartolacci 1998 , people transported by HEMS were treated by an anesthesiologist and a paramedic whereas people transported by GEMS were treated by an acute care physician and a paramedic. All participants were transported to a level I trauma center in Sydney, Australia. Major blunt trauma was defined by the mechanism of injury and an ISS of at least 15. There was a _W_ statistic of 12.18 (95% CI 5.29 to 19.07). This indicated that there were 12 more survivors in the HEMS group than expected for every 100 people transported, based on a comparison with the MTOS cohort.\n\n【260】Thomas 2002 studied 16,699 people with blunt trauma treated in the New England, USA area from 1995 to 1998; 2292 people were treated by HEMS and 14,407 people were treated by GEMS. Although the unadjusted mortality was 9.4% for HEMS versus 2.0% for GEMS, after adjusting for age, sex, transport year, receiving hospital, ISS, mission type, and prehospital level of care, HEMS was associated with a lower odds of death compared with GEMS (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98; P value = 0.031). Some HEMS crews consisted of a physician and nurse, while others consisted of paramedics only or nurses only.\n\n【261】Baxt 1983 included 150 people transported by HEMS and 150 people transported by GEMS in the San Diego, CA, USA area who sustained major blunt trauma. The authors employed a TRISS analysis comparing expected versus actual survival based on comparison with the MTOS cohort. In the HEMS group, 20.6 people were predicted to die but only 10 died; in the GEMS group, 14.8 people were expected to die but 19 died. Although the actual _Z_ statistic was not reported, people in the HEMS group were 52% more likely to survive that people in the GEMS group when groups were stratified by injury severity (P value < 0.001).\n\n【262】Braithwaite 1998 performed a retrospective study of 16,699 people with blunt trauma with a categorization of the ISS into five groups: 0 to 15, 16 to 30, 31 to 45, 46 to 60, and greater than 60. There was no beneficial effect on survival for HEMS compared with GEMS. A statistically significant interaction between HEMS transport and mortality was found for the middle ISS group only (16 to 30, 31 to 45, 31 to 45), indicating a possible survival benefit for people with moderate‐to‐severe injuries.\n\n【263】Schwartz 1990 retrospectively analyzed data from an EMS system in Connecticut, USA comparing 126 people with blunt trauma transported by either HEMS or GEMS with TRISS methodology. People transported by HEMS were statistically significantly more likely to survive compared with the MTOS cohort ( _Z_ \\= 2.23) and people transported by GEMS had a lower survival rate than predicated by MTOS ( _Z_ \\= ‐2.69).\n\n【264】Nardi 1994 prospectively collected data on 222 people with blunt trauma, with mean ISS greater than 30, in Italy. People transported directly to a trauma center by HEMS had an unadjusted mortality rate of 12% versus a mortality rate of 32% for people transported directly to a trauma center by GEMS; 14% of people in the HEMS group had a chest tube placed and 81% were intubated, whereas no‐one in the GEMS group had a chest tube placement or intubation. The HEMS crew consisted of an anesthesiologist with at least 10 years' experience and two nurses with intensive care unit (ICU) experience. GEMS crews consisted of two nurses with basic trauma life support training and an occasional emergency room physician who was not allowed to intubate.\n\n【265】**3\\. Interfacility transfer**\n\n【266】Four studies that met inclusion criteria focused on the role of HEMS versus GEMS for interfacility transfers to higher levels of trauma care ( Brown 2011 ; McVey 2010 ; Mitchell 2007 ; Moylan 1988 ).\n\n【267】Brown 2011 examined 74,779 people transferred to trauma centers by either HEMS (20%) or GEMS (80%). The authors used multivariate regression to determine whether transport modality was an independent predictor of survival while adjusting for age, gender, mechanism of injury, ISS, hypotension, severe TBI, abnormal respiratory rate, mechanical ventilation, emergent operations, ICU admission, and trauma center designation. HEMS transportation for people with an ISS of at least 15, when used as the modality to transfer people to a higher level of trauma care, was independently associated with statistically significantly improved survival (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17; P value = 0.01).\n\n【268】Moylan 1988 examined the effect of HEMS versus GEMS on interhospital transportation to a level I trauma center for 330 severely injured people. People transported by HEMS were more likely to receive blood transfusions (32% with HEMS versus 10.5% with GEMS), be intubated (50% with HEMS versus 25% with GEMS), or have medical antishock trousers (MAST) applied (60.2% with HEMS versus 34.9% with GEMS). People in the HEMS group also received significantly more mean quantities of intravenous fluid (3.34 L per person) than people in the GEMS group (2.1 L per person). For people with a trauma score between 10 and 5, 54 of 101 (53.5%) people in the GEMS group survived compared with 53 of 64 (82.8%) people in the HEMS group. This result was statistically significant favoring HEMS in terms of a survival advantage (P value < 0.001).\n\n【269】Mitchell 2007 compared outcomes for 823 people with an ISS of at least 12 in Nova Scotia, Canada; 84% of people transported by HEMS and 43.5% of people transported by GEMS were transferred from a primary or distant trauma center to the equivalent of a level I trauma center. The authors performed a TRISS‐based regression analysis with reporting of the _Z_ statistic and _W_ score. For the HEMS group, the _Z_ statistic was 2.77 versus a _Z_ statistic of ‐1.97 for the GEMS group. The _W_ score for the HEMS group was 6.40 indicating that there were 6.4 more survivors than expected per 100 people, as compared with the MTOS cohort. In comparison, the _W_ score for the GEMS group was ‐2.40 indicating that there were 2.4 unexpected nonsurvivors per every 100 people. The authors did not describe crew configuration, in‐flight interventions, and stabilizing procedures at the primary and distant trauma centers. Mitchell 2007 did not report an _M_ statistic and, although this study was performed in a North American system, comparability with the original MTOS cohort may not be entirely valid.\n\n【270】In another Canadian study, McVey 2010 compared outcomes of people with trauma transported by HEMS or GEMS, with a mean ISS of at least 20. The authors described this study as a \"natural experiment\" since some of the people in the GEMS group consisted of people initially designated to be flown by helicopter but who were eventually transported by land due to weather or other aviation‐related reasons. The study performed a TRISS analysis, with calculation of _Z_ statistics and _W_ scores. The majority of HEMS missions in this study were interfacility transfers (79.6%). In the HEMS group, the _Z_ statistic was 3.37 and the _W_ score indicated 5.61 survivors for every 100 people transported. In the GEMS group, the _Z_ statistic was ‐2.71 and the _W_ score indicated that there were two additional unexpected nonsurvivors for every 100 people transported. McVey 2010 did not report an _M_ statistic and, although this study was performed in a North American system, comparability with the original MTOS cohort may not be entirely valid.\n\n【271】#### Secondary outcome measures\n\n【272】None of the included studies measured QALYs or DALYs.\n\n【273】#### Adverse events\n\n【274】Data regarding safety were not available in any of the included studies. Road traffic and helicopter crashes are adverse effects which can occur with either method of transport.\n\n【275】Discussion\n----------\n\n【276】available in\n\n【277】*   English\n*   Español\n\n【278】### Summary of main results\n\n【279】This review includes 38 studies, of which 34 studies examined survival following transportation by HEMS compared with GEMS for adults with major trauma. Four studies were of inter‐facility transfer to a higher level trauma center by HEMS compared with GEMS. Most of the available studies did not use methodology that allowed for the ability to assess whether HEMS gave people with trauma who were not in proximity to specialty care the same chance of survival as people for whom care was immediately available ( Floccare 2002 ). Due to the considerable heterogeneity of effects and study methodologies, we could not determine an accurate estimate of composite effect. The quality of evidence, which reflects the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct, was very low as assessed by the GRADE Working Group criteria, thus making comparisons difficult. However, in studies that employed advanced statistical techniques to control for known confounders, the OR, and 95% CI, was statistically significantly in favor of HEMS for improved survival ( Table 2 ). The largest studies that employed advanced regression techniques, and had a lower risk for bias as assessed with the Downs and Black instrument ( Figure 3 ), reported effect estimates in favor of HEMS compared with GEMS in terms of survival ( Abe 2014 ; Andruskow 2013; Brown 2010; Galvagno 2012; Desmettre 2012; Ryb 2013; Stewart 2011; Thomas 2002 ).\n\n【280】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【281】HEMS systems are predominantly located in high‐income countries. Thus, the findings from this review may only be generalizable for a number of settings. This review used a comprehensive search strategy that included non‐English articles. We used a formal protocol that omitted studies known to be more susceptible to bias, and we searched for, and included when appropriate, published abstracts as well as journal articles. We identified nine studies in Europe, 22 studies in the USA, two studies in Canada, and one each in Australia, Japan and South Africa. Seven additional European HEMS studies that we excluded were helicopter treatment team studies. Many European HEMS systems are different from North American systems. For instance, in most European HEMS programs physicians are mandatory crew members, whereas in the USA, most HEMS programs are staffed by critical care nurses and paramedics. Moreover, in Europe the helicopter is used in many systems to transport the treatment team to the scene of the injury, and in countries such as the Netherlands the helicopter is rarely used to transport injured and ill people. Finally, the majority of HEMS studies in this review did not isolate the strict benefit of HEMS. Any salutary effect of HEMS is likely due to some combination of crew expertise, prehospital interventions, and timely access to a high‐level trauma center.\n\n【282】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【283】The overall quality of studies in this review was low as assessed by the Downs and Black risk of bias tool and very low according to the GRADE Working Group guidelines for evaluating the impact of healthcare interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias across all domains. The majority of studies had either an unclear or high risk of bias due to selection bias, confounding, and failure to determine the amount of power required to estimate statistically significant effects. Furthermore, most studies did not report the validity of their measurement methods for assessing outcomes and relied on local or national trauma registries, where the quality of data from these sources is not well known. Not all studies provided data on prehospital interventions and, in some studies, HEMS groups were disproportionally comprised of more highly trained providers, including physicians. It should be noted that the relative effect for mortality calculated for the GRADE analysis reflects unadjusted mortality; it only included studies that reported data that enabled the calculation of a risk ratio.\n\n【284】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【285】Two of the review authors (SG and ST) were the primary author for two of the higher‐quality studies included in this review ( Galvagno 2012 ; Thomas 2002 ). Nevertheless, these studies were carefully subjected to the risk of bias assessment and the authors did not partake in the risk of bias assessment process. Several of the authors of this review maintain active roles as HEMS administrators and policy advisors (ST, DF, and JH).\n\n【286】It is possible that the studies which analysed data from the National Trauma Data Bank resulted in some patients being counted twice. Data were analyzed from different years (2007 data set was used for Brown 2010; 2007‐2009 data sets used for Galvagno 2012) but there was some overlap with 2007. Data were analyzed differently, and stricter inclusion criteria were used for Galvagno 2012.\n\n【287】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【288】Several different reviews have been published on HEMS since the early 2000s ( Bledsoe 2006 ; Butler 2010 ; Ringburg 2009b ; Taylor 2010 ; Thomas 2002 ; Thomas 2003 ; Thomas 2007 ). Thomas et al published a series of annotated reviews of the HEMS outcomes literature in 2002, 2003, and 2007 ( Thomas 2002 ; Thomas 2003 ; Thomas 2007 ). The goal of the 2002 and 2007 reviews was to provide a reference for outcomes‐based literature. Neither of these papers were formal systematic reviews. In 2003, Thomas and Biddinger authored a brief review that highlighted the problems in identifying people who will benefit from HEMS prospectively ( Thomas 2003 ). This study was not a formal systematic review and the goal of the paper was to address studies published since 2001; the brief review discussed only four studies.\n\n【289】Bledsoe 2006 published a meta‐analysis to determine the percentage of people with trauma transported from the scene by helicopter with nonlife‐threatening injuries. The authors included 22 studies in the final analysis, though the study was not, by definition, a meta‐analysis because effects were not pooled. Bledsoe 2006 evaluated five of the studies included in our review ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Baxt 1983 ; Braithwaite 1998 ; Cunningham 1997 ; Phillips 1999 ). Two of these studies had over 50% of people with an ISS less than 15 ( Bartolacci 1998 ; Cunningham 1997 ). In our study, we extracted data only from the subgroups of people in these studies with an ISS of at least 15. Furthermore, the studies used TRISS ( Bartolacci 1998 ) and logistic regression ( Cunningham 1997 ) to adjust for severity of injury. Bledsoe 2006 concluded that the majority of people with trauma transported from the scene have nonlife‐threatening injuries; 25.8% of all participants analyzed were discharged within 24 hours after arrival at the trauma center.\n\n【290】Ringburg 2009b performed a literature review in 2009, which reviewed 16 studies. This study was not a systematic review and the authors concluded that HEMS appeared to be beneficial, but only when rigorous statistical methodology was applied. In 2010, Taylor et al conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine the economic costs of HEMS and the relationship of costs to outcomes ( Taylor 2010 ). They employed a limited search strategy and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. This review also included people without trauma. It highlighted a lack of high‐quality studies. The authors concluded that the \"weight of observational evidence\" supports an association between HEMS and improved survival in selected people with trauma, but effects could not be pooled due to the considerable differences in the cost and effectiveness of HEMS between studies ( Taylor 2010 ).\n\n【291】One systematic review was conducted by Butler 2010 with the goal of determining whether HEMS is beneficial for people with trauma. There was no meta‐analysis due to the inconsistencies in participant inclusion criteria and outcome measures. Studies were limited to the English language and there was no cutoff for injury severity. The review included studies examining the effect of HTTs. An evidence table evaluated 23 eligible studies. Fourteen studies reported results that demonstrated a survival benefit for HEMS compared with GEMS. Butler et al attributed HEMS benefits to four potential factors: 1. transport of advanced airway skills to the scene, 2. transport of a team experienced in managing people with trauma to the scene, 3. expeditious transport of people from the scene to a hospital, and 4. triage to a definitive trauma center. All studies were moderate to low level evidence as assessed using the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine guidelines. The authors acknowledged that differences in study design, treatment protocols, triage guidelines, and crew configuration were limiting factors that barred the authors from establishing any resolutions about the role of HEMS for people with trauma. The authors recognized the importance of considering the benefits of a HTT separately from the benefits associated with HEMS transport.\n\n【292】With the exception of the review focused on nonlife‐threatening injuries ( Bledsoe 2006 ), there are no overall disagreements with any of the previous reviews. Our protocol used a comprehensive search strategy that was devised with the help of a methodologist from the Cochrane Injuries Group. In all previous studies, the use of electronic databases was more limited than our comprehensive search strategy. Our strategy was designed to identify as many relevant studies as possible in order to minimize bias and to estimate reliable effects ( Reeves 2011 ). Through the use of strict inclusion criteria, a thorough quality assessment, and a narrative synthesis we are confident that we identified and analyzed all pertinent HEMS studies of adults with major trauma at the time the available literature for this review was assessed as up‐to‐date.\n\n【293】Figures and Tables -\n\n【294】Figure 1\n\n【295】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of yoga for the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】The number one cause of death and disability worldwide is cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( WHO 2011 ). Around 29.6% of total global deaths can be attributed to CVD ( WHO 2003 ). Indeed, in the United Kingdom 88,000 deaths per year are attributable to coronary heart disease (CHD) and 43,000 deaths are caused by stroke ( BHF 2012 ). In The United States 35% of total deaths in 2010 were accounted for by CVD compared to 45% in Germany, 30% in Costa Rica, 31% in Denmark, 15% in Ethiopia, 48% in Greece, 32% in Japan, 26% in Mexico and 38% in China ( WHO 2011a ). It is estimated that by 2030 CVDs will account for almost 23.6 million deaths ( WHO 2011 ).\n\n【7】There are many risk factors which contribute to the development of CVD. Many of these are related to lifestyle choices such as physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use and an unhealthy diet ( WHO 2011 ). Whilst clinical treatments are effective in preventing and treating CVD, other strategies involving a healthy lifestyle and stress management have also been shown to be beneficial ( Frishman 2005 ). One such strategy that involves both stress management and exercise is yoga.\n\n【8】As yoga has become increasingly popular as a form of exercise it may be an important intervention for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD’s since high levels of physical activity play a major role in preventing obesity and CVDs ( Mendelson 2008 ). Indeed, there are a number of publications that show yoga to be beneficial for hypertension ( Murugesan 2000 ), dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis ( Singh 2004 ). The systematic review by Innes et al (2005) also demonstrated that yoga improved metabolic risk factors such as blood pressure and lipids ( Innes 2005 ). Furthermore, the psychological benefits of yoga have been established ( Saper 2004 ) with yoga being used in stress reduction, a determinant for CVD ( WHO 2011 ).\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Yoga is defined in the Oxford Handbook of Complementary Medicine as an \"ancient Indian practice involving postural exercises, breathing control and meditation\" ( Ernst 2008 ). It was was founded in India over 5,000 years ago and is believed to give the practitioner a union between their mind, body and spirit ( Kappmeier 2006 ). It has its foundations in three basic components: Asana (posture), Pranayama (breathing) and Dhyana (mediation and devotion) all of which are integrated with each other ( Riley 2004 ). There are six main branches of yoga: Bhakti yoga, Hatha yoga, Jnana yoga, Karma yoga, Mantra yoga and Raja yoga ( Feuerstein 2011 ). Jnana yoga is the path of knowledge in which enlightenment is developed through the philosophical investigation of traditional yogic texts and scriptures ( Carrico 2012 ). In Jnana yoga the practitioner contemplates life using rational thought which, it is believed, leads the mind towards higher levels of consciousness ( Simpkins 2003 ). Karma yoga, however, teaches practitioners how to maintain their focus in everyday life ( Simpkins 2003 ) by analysing their actions and thoughts in order to learn about different qualities of thinking and behaving. In doing this, the practitioner will learn how to channel their actions in the correct way and ultimately achieve an enlightened way of living ( Simpkins 2003 ). Mantra yoga influences the human consciousness through sound and vibration ( Simpkins 2003 ). It is thought that after many repetitions and practice the mantra will begin to recite itself within the practitioners mind leading them to enlightenment. Bhakti yoga is known as the yoga of devotion ( Koay 2009 ). It involves \"cultivating selfless love, pure giving and long devotion to God\" which is expressed through chants, prayers and also services to humanity ( Koay 2009 ). In Raja yoga, on the other hand, all three basic yoga components are used to so that the practitioner can seek enlightenment through the mind. In this type of yoga enlightenment is sought through using meditation and techniques of attention, concentration and contemplation ( Simpkins 2003 ). However, the most practised style of yoga in the West is Hatha ( Hewitt 2001 ). Hatha yoga seeks enlightenment not through the mind, as in Raja yoga, but through the body. It can be practised in many styles such as Bikram, Integral, Kundalini, Ashtanga, Iyengar all of which have unique characteristics ( YA 2011 ).\n\n【11】The physical and psychological benefits of yoga have been acknowledged ( Saper 2004 ). Evidence suggests that yoga can be applied to manage and reduce the symptoms of a number of conditions. For instance, yoga has been found to relieve perceived pain in those with rheumatoid arthritis ( Bosch 2009 ) and chronic back pain ( Groessl 2008 ) as well as aiding in the management of those with urological disorders ( Ripoll 2002 ). Yoga has also been found to be beneficial for depression, stress and insomnia ( Granath 2006 ; Khalsa 2004 ; Lavey 2005 ; Woolery 2004 ).\n\n【12】### How the intervention might work\n\n【13】High levels of exercise have been found to play a major role in preventing obesity, diabetes and CVD ( Mendelson 2008 ; Mittal 2008 ). Therefore, as yoga is considered a form of exercise it may help in CVD prevention. Evidence suggests that regular exercise can decrease the risk of dying from CVD ( USHHS 1996 ) and it has been found to be beneficial when included in primary and secondary prevention strategies ( Lavie 2009 ). This is because physical activity has favourable effects not only on CVD risk factors but also on CVD symptoms, a persons functional capacity, physiology and quality of life ( ACSM 2010 ; AHA 2011 ). Furthermore, yoga is a moderately safe, gentle choice for promoting general health and emotional well‐being, especially for those whose lifestyle is sedentary ( Lau 2011 ).\n\n【14】However, the benefits and degree of improvement in physical health from yogic practices will vary according to how the individual practices yoga. For instance, if the individual practices all poses intensely and continuously then cardiorespiratory fitness will improve, whereas if the individual only practices a single pose then improvements may be made in muscular strength, flexibility and posture ( Lau 2011 ). Furthermore, Hagins et al (2007) state that when the metabolic cost is averaged out across a whole session of Hatha yoga, it only represents a low level of exercise. This does not meet the recommendations for levels of physical activity developed for improving or maintaining general health and CVD fitness ( Hagins 2007 ). However, studies suggests that regular yogic training leads to significant improvements in cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic power and therefore is useful in improving exercise tolerance ( Bera 1993 ; Madanmohan 2004 ; Muralidhara 1982 ). As such, yoga can be used in patients who are sedentary to gradually improve exercise tolerance and, with regular practice, strengthening the cardiovascular system.\n\n【15】As well as being beneficial in terms of exercise, yoga may also help to reduce stress ( AHA 2011 ), a determinant of CVD ( WHO 2011 ). It does this by creating a physiological sequence of events in the body as a result of changes in posture and breathing which reduces the stress response ( Woodyard 2011 ). Proposed physiological mechanisms include reducing the reactivity of the sympathetic nervous system ( Innes 2007 ) and/or counteracting the activity of the aroused autonomic nervous system (ANS), reversing it back to a relaxed state ( Levine 2000 ; Michalsen 2005 ).\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Few randomised controlled trials have directly investigated the effectiveness of yoga on the primary prevention of CVD even though yoga has the potential to help in CVD prevention. Furthermore, few systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of yoga are available. Those that do exist mainly focus on secondary prevention ( Innes 2005 ; Lau 2011 ). Therefore, a comprehensive systematic review is needed which thoroughly examines the most up to date evidence to determine whether yoga is effective in preventing CVD in those who are healthy or who have CVD risk factors.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】The primary objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of yoga for the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Randomised controlled trials\n\n【24】#### Types of participants\n\n【25】Healthy adults (18 years old or over) of all ages from the worldwide general population and those at moderate to high risk of CVD ( Perk 2012 ). As the review will focus on the primary prevention of CVD we will exclude those who have experienced a previous myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularisation procedure (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)), those with angina, or angiographically defined CHD.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】Trials investigating any type of yoga. The definition of yoga is that provided by Ernst 2008 in which yoga is seen as involving three components: postural exercises, breathing control and meditation.\n\n【28】Studies will be stratified by type of yoga and also duration if sufficient trials are available. Multi‐factorial intervention studies (including dietary or other additional interventions) will not be included in this review in order to avoid confounding. In addition, we will focus on follow‐up periods of six months or more as these are the most relevant to public health interventions. Follow‐up is considered to be the time elapsed since the start of the intervention. Trials will also only be considered where the comparison group is either given no intervention or minimal intervention (for example leaflets with no person to person intervention or reinforcement).\n\n【29】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【30】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【31】1\\. Cardiovascular mortality\n\n【32】2\\. All‐cause mortality\n\n【33】3\\. Non‐fatal endpoints such as MI, CABG, PTCA, angina, or angiographically defined CHD, stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\n\n【34】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【35】1\\. Changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides)\n\n【36】2\\. Occurrence of type 2 diabetes as a major CVD risk factor\n\n【37】3\\. Quality of life\n\n【38】4\\. Adverse effects\n\n【39】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【40】#### Electronic searches\n\n【41】The following electronic databases will be searched: the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases: Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NEED)), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science (CPCI‐S)) and AMED,\n\n【42】Medical subject headings (MeSH) or equivalent and text word terms will be used. Searches will be designed in accordance with the Cochrane Heart Group methods and guidance. There will be no language restrictions.\n\n【43】Searches will be tailored to individual databases. The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Appendix 1\n\n【44】#### Searching other resources\n\n【45】Reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles will also be checked for additional studies.\n\n【46】OpenGrey will be searched for grey literature.\n\n【47】We will search the metaRegister of controlled trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com/mrct), Clinical trials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials.\n\n【48】Citation searches will be performed on key articles and Google Scholar will be used to search for further studies. Experts in the field will be contacted for unpublished and ongoing trials and authors will be contacted where necessary for any additional information.\n\n【49】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【50】#### Selection of studies\n\n【51】From the searches, the title and abstract of each paper will be reviewed by two reviewers (LH, MD) and potentially relevant references retrieved. The full text of potentially relevant studies will than be obtained and two reviewers (LH, MD) will independently select studies to be included in the review by using predetermined inclusion criteria. In all cases disagreements about study inclusion will be resolved by consensus and a third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements persist.\n\n【52】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【53】Data will be extracted by two reviewers independently (LH, MD) using a proforma. Chief investigators will be contacted to provide additional relevant information if necessary. Details of the study design, participant characteristics, study setting, intervention and outcome data (including details of outcome assessment, adverse effects and methodological quality (randomisation, blinding and attrition) will be extracted from each included study. Disagreements about extracted data will be resolved by consensus with a third reviewer being consulted if disagreements persist.\n\n【54】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【55】Risk of bias will be assessed by examining the random sequence generation and allocation concealment, description of drop‐outs and withdrawals (including analysis by intention‐to‐treat), blinding (participants, personnel and outcome assessment) and selective outcome reporting ( Higgins 2011 ) in each trial. The risk of bias of included studies will be assessed independently by two reviewers (LH, MD).\n\n【56】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【57】Data will be processed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins 2011 ). Dichotomous outcomes will be expressed as odds ratios or relative risks, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated for each study. For continuous outcomes net changes will be compared (i.e. intervention group minus control group differences) and a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs calculated for each study.\n\n【58】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【59】For each outcome tests of heterogeneity will be conducted (using the χ <sup>2 </sup> test of heterogeneity and I <sup>2 </sup> statistic). Where there is no heterogeneity a fixed‐effect meta‐analysis will be performed.

There are studies reporting that plasma glutamine levels are reduced in patients with critical illness or following major surgery, suggesting that glutamine may be a conditionally essential amino acid in situations of extreme stress. In the past decade, several clinical trials examining the effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness or receiving surgery have been done, and the systematic review of this clinical evidence has suggested that glutamine supplementation may reduce infection and mortality rates in patients with critical illness. However, two recent large‐scale randomized clinical trials did not find any beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】The objective of this review was to:\n\n【7】1\\. assess the effects of glutamine supplementation in critically ill adults and in adults after major surgery on infection rate, mortality and other clinically relevant outcomes;\n\n【8】2\\. investigate potential heterogeneity across different patient groups and different routes for providing nutrition.\n\n【9】### Search methods\n\n【10】We searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group (CARG) Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library_ (2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2013); EMBASE (1980 to May 2013) and Web of Science (1945 to May 2013).\n\n【11】### Selection criteria\n\n【12】We included controlled clinical trials with random or quasi‐random allocation that examined glutamine supplementation versus no supplementation or placebo in adults with a critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We excluded cross‐over trials.\n\n【13】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【14】Two authors independently extracted the relevant information from each included study using a standardized data extraction form. For infectious complications and mortality and morbidity outcomes we used risk ratio (RR) as the summary measure with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We calculated, where appropriate, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH). We presented continuous data as the difference between means (MD) with the 95% CI.\n\n【15】### Main results\n\n【16】Our search identified 1999 titles, of which 53 trials (57 articles) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The 53 included studies enrolled a total of 4671 participants with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We analysed seven domains of potential risk of bias. In 10 studies the risk of bias was evaluated as low in all of the domains. Thirty‐three trials (2303 patients) provided data on nosocomial infectious complications; pooling of these data suggested that glutamine supplementation reduced the infectious complications rate in adults with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87, P ＜ 0.00001, I² = 8%, moderate quality evidence). Thirty‐six studies reported short‐term (hospital or less than one month) mortality. The combined rate of mortality from these studies was not statistically different between the groups receiving glutamine supplement and those receiving no supplement (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, P = 0.10, I² = 22%, low quality evidence). Eleven studies reported long‐term (more than six months) mortality; meta‐analysis of these studies (2277 participants) yielded a RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12, P = 0.94, I² = 30%, moderate quality evidence). Subgroup analysis of infectious complications and mortality outcomes did not find any statistically significant differences between the predefined groups. Hospital length of stay was reported in 36 studies. We found that the length of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (MD ‐3.46 days, 95% CI ‐4.61 to ‐2.32, P < 0.0001, I² = 63%, low quality evidence). Slightly prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in the glutamine supplemented group from 22 studies (2285 participants) (MD 0.18 days, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29, P = 0.002, I² = 11%, moderate quality evidence). Days on mechanical ventilation (14 studies, 1297 participants) was found to be slightly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (MD ‐ 0.69 days, 95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.02, P = 0.04, I² = 18%, moderate quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups for side effects and quality of life, however results were imprecise for serious adverse events and few studies reported on quality of life. Sensitivity analysis including only low risk of bias studies found that glutamine supplementation had beneficial effects in reducing the length of hospital stay (MD ‐2.9 days, 95% CI ‐5.3 to ‐0.5, P = 0.02, I² = 58%, eight studies) while there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for all of the other outcomes.\n\n【17】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【18】This review found moderate evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced the infection rate and days on mechanical ventilation, and low quality evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced length of hospital stay in critically ill or surgical patients. It seems to have little or no effect on the risk of mortality and length of ICU stay, however. The effects on the risk of serious side effects were imprecise. The strength of evidence in this review was impaired by a high risk of overall bias, suspected publication bias, and moderate to substantial heterogeneity within the included studies _._\n\n【19】PICOs\n-----\n\n【20】### PICOs\n\n【21】###### Population (8)\n\n【22】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Elective Surgery\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Surgery\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Critical Illness\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n\n【23】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【24】*   Glutamine\n\n【25】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【26】*   Placebo\n\n【27】###### Outcome (7)\n\n【28】*   Serious Adverse Event\n*   Length Of Stay\n*   Death\n*   Complication\n*   Intensive Care\n*   Complicated Infection\n*   Mechanical ventilation\n\n【29】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

There are studies reporting that muscle and plasma glutamine levels are reduced in patients with critical illness, or following major surgery, suggesting that the body's demand for glutamine is increased in these situations. In the past decade, several clinical trials have examined the effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness or receiving surgery, and a systematic review of this clinical evidence suggested that giving glutamine to these patients may reduce infection and mortality rates. However, two recent large‐scale clinical trials, published in 2011 and 2013, did not find any beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation in patients with critical illness.\n\n【36】In this review, we searched the available literature until May 2013 and included studies which compared the outcomes with glutamine supplementation and without in adults with a critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We included 57 articles from 53 randomized controlled studies in this review. These 53 studies enrolled a total of 4671 patients with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. The risk of mortality, length of intensive care unit stay and the incidence of side effects were not significantly different between those given glutamine and those who were not. However, our findings showed that the risk of infectious complications in patients who were given glutamine was 79% of the risk for those who were not. In other words, 12 patients need to be supplemented with glutamine to prevent one case of infection. This result needs to be interpreted cautiously as the quality of evidence for infectious complications was moderate. The funnel plot for this outcome suggested that smaller studies with outcomes favouring non‐supplemented patients have not been published, and further research is likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect for this outcome. The findings from this review also suggested that the average length of hospital stay in critically ill or surgical patients supplemented with glutamine was 3.46 days shorter than for patients without glutamine supplementation. This result should also be treated with care as there was substantial heterogeneity between these studies. We found in this review that the mean number of days on mechanical ventilation was 0.69 days shorter in patients with glutamine supplementation than for patients without glutamine supplementation.\n\n【37】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【38】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【39】### Implications for practice\n\n【40】There is moderate evidence that glutamine supplementation could reduce the infection rate and days on mechanical ventilation, and low quality evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced the length of hospital stay for critically ill or surgical participants. However, it has no effect on the risk of mortality, length of ICU stay and risk of side effects in these participants. Subgroup analysis of infectious complications and mortality outcomes did not find any statistically significant difference between the predefined groups (elective surgical patients and critically ill patients, patients with enteral glutamine supplementation only and parenteral glutamine supplementation only, patients with malignant and non‐malignant disease).\n\n【41】### Implications for research\n\n【42】The strength of evidence in our review was reduced as there was a high risk of overall bias, suspected publication bias and moderate to substantial heterogeneity within the included studies. Future clinical trials on glutamine supplementation should be conducted strictly in accordance with the principles advised by the _Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement_ (CONSORT) to minimize the overall risk of bias in trials. Regarding the heterogeneity between the included studies, it is possible that glutamine's beneficial effects correlate with the types and severity of the disease. Hence future high quality RCTs should focus on the differences in the glutamine supplementation effects in critically ill patients with different characteristics. In this review no conclusions have been drawn on the difference in risk of infection and death between oncology and non‐oncology patients as very few trials have focused on this subject as a primary aim. Oncology patients are theoretically more likely to be glutamine deficient and thus large, quality trials that focus on oncology patients are still needed.\n\n【43】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【44】Open in table viewer\n\n【45】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

They are vulnerable to nosocomial infections as severe illness may bring about immunofunctional deficiency ( O'Leary 1996 ). In response to a severe condition the local inflammatory reaction of the body develops into systemic inflammation. Immunosuppression may be induced by the corresponding compensatory anti‐inflammatory response, which may increase the risk of infection and organ failure in critically ill patients ( Mizock 2010 ; Tschoeke 2007 ). Specific nutrients for the immune system, such as glutamine, can be administered enterally or parenterally to impact favourably on the immune response and thus reduce the complications associated with critical illness ( Mizock 2010 ; Novak 2002 ).\n\n【51】### Description of the intervention\n\n【52】Glutamine is a type of free amino acid which is abundant in the body. It accounts for approximately 30% of the plasma free amino acids. Most glutamine in the body is synthesized by skeletal muscle, while the brain and the lung synthesize the remainder ( Tjader 2007 ). Although glutamine is non‐essential in the diet of healthy human beings, endogenous glutamine biosynthesis may be insufficient to meet the needs of patients in situations of extreme stress ( Bongers 2007 ). In patients undergoing surgery or suffering trauma or sepsis the levels of free glutamine in muscle are decreased ( Gamrin 1996 ; Vinnars 1975 ). Plasma glutamine levels are also reduced in patients with critical illness or following major surgery ( Melis 2004 ; Parry‐Billings 1992 ). Clinical evidence has revealed that glutamine supplementation in critical illness may reduce infection and mortality rates ( Novak 2002 ).\n\n【53】Glutamine supplementation can be used to prevent a new infection in non‐infected patients or a subsequent infection in critically ill patients who have already had an infection. The latter situation is a far greyer area since the immune dysfunction associated with repeated infections and how these affect subsequent outcomes are far less clearly understood. In this systematic review we will focus on the effect of glutamine in preventing new infective complications in non‐infected participants ( Andrews 2011 ).\n\n【54】### How the intervention might work\n\n【55】There are many potential mechanisms which could account for the benefit of glutamine supplementation in critically ill patients. First, there is a depletion of free glutamine and a shortage in relation to needs under conditions of severe metabolic stress such that exogenous glutamine supplementation is required in order to maintain normal concentrations of plasma glutamine ( Tjader 2007 ). Second, both in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that glutamine could induce the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially HSP‐70 ( Kim 2013 ). Hsp‐70 expression could protect cells against cytotoxic mediators and reduce organ injury and mortality in critical illness settings ( Roth 2008 ). In critically ill patients it was reported that glutamine supplementation significantly increased serum HSP‐70 and the magnitude of the HSP‐70 enhancement in the glutamine group was correlated with improved clinical outcomes, further indicating that glutamine may play a protective role by inducing the expression of HSPs ( Ziegler 2005 ). Third, clinical trials revealed that glutamine supplementation attenuated hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in ICU patients ( Bakalar 2006 ; Déchelotte 2006 ) and it seems reasonable to speculate that glutamine may exert its effects through regulating glucose metabolism in the critically ill. Fourth, glutamine supplementation in patients has been shown to maintain the gastrointestinal structure ( Melis 2004 ), improve nitrogen balance ( Hammarqvist 1989 ), elevate immune cell function ( Ogle 1994 ) and reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines ( O'Riordain 1996 ). Fifth, glutamine is a precursor for glutathione and could play its role as an antioxidant by producing glutathione ( Melis 2004 ).\n\n【56】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【57】Although glutamine may play an important role in the treatment of critically ill patients in some countries (such as the UK) enteral or parenteral supplementation with glutamine has not been widely adopted for patients with critical illness or those who have had surgery ( Avenell 2006 ) due to a lack of good quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Also, when dealing with nutritional deficiency any effect on patient outcome is dependent on the prior and current states of nutrition and health, and the consequences of a deficiency depends on how well the patient's own endogenous system can meet that need. Some of the recently published, large sample size studies have tested the influence of glutamine supplementation given only for a few days on short‐term and long‐term outcomes ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ); few have studied long‐term glutamine supplementation. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and summarize the potential heterogeneity in the design of these studies and assess any association with their results.\n\n【58】Furthermore, there are differences in the use of exogenous glutamine by parenteral or enteral administration. There is controversy as to whether both total parenteral and enteral glutamine supplementation can reduce infection in patients with critical illness ( Avenell 2009 ). Some studies have assessed the influence of risk of bias in the RCTs that have compared parenteral or enteral nutrition with no nutritional intervention in critically ill patients ( Koretz 2007a ; Koretz 2007b ; Koretz 2007c ). The results show that in the trials with lower risk of bias parenteral nutrition appeared to cause infection, and the alleged benefits of enteral nutrition may actually have been due to bias. Therefore, even if the conclusion of our review is that the addition of glutamine results in fewer infections, we will need to interpret the results cautiously. Still, the inflammatory response accompanying critical illness was far more intense and complex than the response elective surgical patients had experienced ( Avenell 2009 ). Thus, the effects of glutamine supplementation may differ between patients undergoing surgery and patients who are critically ill. Like in the previous systematic reviews ( Avenell 2009 ; Novak 2002 ) we planned to examine the treatment effects of glutamine supplementation in surgical patients and critically ill patients separately. As heterogeneity may exist between critically ill patients and surgical patients the combined results of these two populations in our review must be interpreted cautiously.\n\n【59】Lastly, large sample multicentre RCTs examining the role of glutamine in critical illness have recently been completed ( Andrews 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ). Therefore a rigorous and objective systematic review is needed to evaluate the role of glutamine supplementation in preventing infections in critically ill adults.\n\n【60】Objectives\n----------\n\n【61】The objective of this review was to:\n\n【62】1.  determine the effects of glutamine supplementation in critically ill adults and in adults after major surgery on infection rate, mortality and other clinically relevant outcomes;\n    \n2.  investigate potential heterogeneity across different patient groups and different routes for providing nutrition.\n    \n\n【63】Methods\n-------\n\n【64】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【65】#### Types of studies\n\n【66】We included full reports of controlled clinical trials with random or quasi‐random allocation. We excluded cross‐over trials.\n\n【67】#### Types of participants\n\n【68】We included studies in adults with a critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery. We excluded participants receiving prophylactic supplementation of glutamine before surgery.\n\n【69】We included studies reporting mixed groups of participants (for example, combined data from critically ill and medical patients). We planned to treat these as separate groups in subgroup analyses (for example, medical, surgical, mixed).\n\n【70】#### Types of interventions\n\n【71】We examined glutamine supplementation delivered by the parenteral or enteral route versus no supplementation or placebo. The nutritional regime was determined by each of the included trials and the glutamine was given in addition to a standard nutritional regime.\n\n【72】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【73】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【74】1.

Mortality (measured at the follow‐up times closest to one and six months)\n    \n\n【75】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【76】1.  Length of hospital stay\n    \n2.  Length of ICU stay\n    \n3.  Days on mechanical ventilation\n    \n4.  Possible side effects, as described by the authors\n    \n5.  Quality of life\n    \n\n【77】With secondary outcomes 1, 2 and 3, for patients who died before discharge death was considered as discharge.\n\n【78】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【79】#### Electronic searches\n\n【80】We searched the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group (CARG) Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in _The Cochrane Library_ (2013, Issue 5), see Appendix 1 ; MEDLINE via OvidSP (1950 to May 2013), see Appendix 2 ; EMBASE via OvidSP (1980 to May 2013), see Appendix 3 ; and Web of Science (1945 to May 2013), see Appendix 4 .\n\n【81】We used the following text words: glutam\\* or dipeptide\\* or L‐glutamin\\*.\n\n【82】We developed a specific search strategy for each database based on that developed for MEDLINE. We did not apply any language restriction.\n\n【83】#### Searching other resources\n\n【84】Two authors (WFX, LQY) independently handsearched the following intensive care and nutrition journals (up to April 2013) as advised by the reviewers. These are available in our library:\n\n【85】*   _Clinical Nutrition;_\n    \n*   _Critical Care Medicine;_\n    \n*   _Intensive Care Medicine;_\n    \n*   _Proceedings of the Nutrition Society;_\n    \n*   _Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition;_\n    \n*   _Chest;_\n    \n*   _Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine._\n    \n\n【86】Two authors (YMS, ZJL) searched the references of all identified trials and previous reviews.\n\n【87】One author (KMT) searched the following websites for ongoing clinical trials and unpublished studies (up to June 2013):\n\n【88】*   http://www.controlled‐trials.com/\n    \n*   http://clinicaltrials.gov/\n    \n\n【89】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【90】#### Selection of studies\n\n【91】Two authors (KMT, XQL) independently screened the abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy. We obtained the full texts of articles that seemed to meet our inclusion criteria and independently re‐assessed them. We resolved any disagreements by discussion until a consensus was achieved.\n\n【92】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【93】Two authors (KMT, XQL) independently extracted the relevant information from each included study using a standardized data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. One author (KMT) entered data into Review Manager software ( RevMan 5.2 ) and re‐checked the data for accuracy. If we needed further information to enable us to reach a decision then we attempted to contact the study authors.\n\n【94】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【95】Based on the recommendations in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Handbook 2011 ), two authors (LQY and ZJL) assessed the risk of bias for each included trial by using the domain‐based evaluation. We assessed the following seven domains: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias) and other bias. We also gave reasons for our judgements. Three authors (LQY, ZJL and WFY) resolved disagreements by reviewing the data together.\n\n【96】We judged an included trial to be a trial with low risk of bias if the risk of bias was evaluated as 'low' in all of the domains. If the risk of bias was judged as 'high', then we listed the trial as having a high risk of bias. Those trials that we judged 'unclear' were listed as having an unclear risk of bias. Using the content of the included studies and the 'risk of bias' tables, we presented the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, giving particular attention to the limitations of study design and heterogeneity of results.\n\n【97】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【98】For dichotomous data, we used the risk ratio (RR) as the summary measure. We calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) where appropriate. We presented continuous data as the difference between means. Data reported as median and range were converted into mean (standard deviation) before meta‐analysis by using the formula from Hozo 2005 , and the estimated standard deviation was calculated from the interquartile range based on the assumption that the width of the interquartile range will be approximately 1.35 standard deviations ( Handbook 2011 ).\n\n【99】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【100】The unit of analysis was the participating adult in individually randomized trials.\n\n【101】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【102】We contacted the authors of the included trials to obtain relevant missing data. If data were obtained from the trial authors, then we performed an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis. We investigated attrition, for example from dropouts, losses to follow‐up and withdrawals. We critically appraised issues of missing data according to the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Handbook 2011 ).\n\n【103】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【104】We identified heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots and by using a standard Chi <sup>2 </sup> test with a significance level of α = 0.1. We also specifically examined heterogeneity with the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, quantifying inconsistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta‐analysis, where an I <sup>2 </sup> statistic of 50% and more indicates a substantial level of inconsistency ( Handbook 2011 ). When statistical heterogeneity was found, we attempted to determine the potential reasons for it by examining the individual trials and the subgroup characteristics.\n\n【105】We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of any included studies that were assessed as having clinical diversity (for example, different types of patients, enteral or parenteral glutamine supplementation) and methodological diversity.\n\n【106】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【107】We tried to minimize the impact of publication bias through a thorough review of all the published data. As the review included more than 10 studies, we assessed publication bias and small study effects in a qualitative manner using a funnel plot. If significant asymmetry was found in the funnel plot, we reported it in our results and in the summary of findings table.\n\n【108】#### Data synthesis\n\n【109】On the basis that no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found between trials, we performed the analysis using RevMan software ( RevMan 5.2 ). We performed meta‐analysis of the included trials by using a fixed‐effect model if the P value of the heterogeneity test was more than 0.1, otherwise we used a random effects model. We expressed dichotomous data as the risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We calculated the NNTB for the infectious complications outcome by combining the overall RR with an estimate of the prevalence of the event in the control groups of the trials. We analysed continuous outcomes according to the difference in the mean treatment effects and the 95% CI. We assumed a P value of < 0.05 to be of statistical significance.\n\n【110】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【111】As the treatment effect of glutamine supplementation may be different in surgical patients compared with critically ill patients, and it may also be affected by different routes of administration and different disease status, we performed subgroup analysis for the primary outcomes by:\n\n【112】1.  elective surgical patients and critically ill patients,\n    \n2.  enteral glutamine supplementation only and parenteral glutamine supplementation only,\n    \n3.  patients with malignant and non‐malignant disease.\n    \n\n【113】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【114】We performed sensitivity analysis for trials with a low risk of bias, for all the outcomes. We compared random‐effects and fixed‐effect estimates for each outcome variable. In the case of any missing data, we planned to use the best case, worst case for imputation of missing data. We excluded and included any study that appeared to have a large effect size (often the largest or earliest study) in order to assess its impact on the meta‐analysis.\n\n【115】##### Summary of findings\n\n【116】We used the principles of the GRADE system ( Guyatt 2008 ) to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with the following specific outcomes in our review:\n\n【117】*   number of infectious complications;\n    \n*   mortality (mortality closest to at one and six months);\n    \n*   length of hospital stay;\n    \n*   length of ICU stay;\n    \n*   days on mechanical ventilation;\n    \n*   serious adverse events.\n    \n\n【118】We constructed a 'summary of findings' (SoF) table using the GRADE software. The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of evidence based on the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the item being assessed. The quality of a body of evidence takes into consideration within‐study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of the evidence, heterogeneity of the data, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias.\n\n【119】Results\n-------\n\n【120】### Description of studies\n\n【121】See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies ; Characteristics of studies awaiting classification ; Characteristics of ongoing studies .\n\n【122】#### Results of the search\n\n【123】We identified a total of 1999 citations. Through reading the titles and then abstracts, we obtained the full texts of 89 citations that were potentially eligible for inclusion in our review. Of those 89 citations, 25 did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded for the reasons described in the table Characteristics of excluded studies . Six ongoing clinical trials were identified through searching the websites clinicaltrials.gov and controlled‐trials.com ( Characteristics of ongoing studies ). One study ( Hallay 2002 ) is waiting assessment as we were unable to obtain the full text. Finally, we included 57 articles from 53 studies (four articles were secondary publications) in this review ( Figure 1 ).\n\n【124】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【125】Figure 1\n\n【126】* * *\n\n【127】* * *\n\n【128】Study flow diagram.\n\n【129】#### Included studies\n\n【130】These 53 studies enrolled a total of 4671 patients. All participants were adults with a critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery; they were allocated to either a glutamine supplementation group or control group. All studies reported at least one of the outcomes which we had predefined in our protocol. The studies fell broadly into the following groups.\n\n【131】##### Studies in intensive care unit (ICU) patients\n\n【132】We included 19 studies in this category. Of these 19 studies, 12 included participants admitted to ICU with varying diagnoses ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Luo 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Tjäder 2004 ; Tremel 1994 ; Wernerman 2011 ; Zhang 2007 ). Two studies included trauma patients ( Eroglu 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ). One study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( Conejero 2002 ). One study included aged patients ( Chai 2006 ). One study included patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( Tian 2006 ). One study included patients requiring mechanical ventilation ( Hall 2003 ), and a further study included mechanically ventilated adult patients with two or more failed organs ( Heyland 2013 ).\n\n【133】##### Studies in surgical patients\n\n【134】We included 18 studies in this category. Of these 18 studies, 14 included patients receiving abdominal surgery ( Dong 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Jiang 1999 ; Kłek 2005 ; Kumar 2007 ; Lin 2002 ; Lu 2011 ; Morlion 1998 ; Neri 2001 ; O'Riordain 1994 ; Qiu 2009 ; Spittler 2001 ; Yao 2007 ; Zhu 2000 ). Two studies included patients receiving thoracic or abdominal surgery ( Estívariz 2008 ; Mertes 2000 ). One study included patients undergoing aortic abdominal aneurysm reconstruction ( Karwowska 2001 ). One study included patients receiving laryngectomy ( Wang 2006 ).\n\n【135】##### Studies in burns patients\n\n【136】Eight trials investigating the impact of glutamine supplementation in burns patients were included in the review ( Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Garrel 2003 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Peng 2004 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Zhou 2002 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ).\n\n【137】##### Studies in patients with acute pancreatitis\n\n【138】Seven trials were included in this category ( Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Sahin 2007 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ).\n\n【139】The remaining one study included patients both from ICU and other departments ( Powell‐Tuck 1999 ).\n\n【140】#### Excluded studies\n\n【141】We excluded 25 clinical studies for the reasons described in the Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【142】##### _Studies awaiting classification_\n\n【143】One study that examined the effects of enteral glutamine supplementation in patients receiving subtotal oesophagectomy for malignancy ( Hallay 2002 ) is waiting classification as we were unable to obtain the full text (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification ).\n\n【144】##### _Ongoing studies_\n\n【145】Six ongoing studies enrolling trauma, ICU, burns and acute pancreatitis participants were identified (see Characteristics of ongoing studies ).\n\n【146】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【147】See: Characteristics of included studies ; Figure 2 ; Figure 3 .\n\n【148】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【149】Figure 2\n\n【150】* * *\n\n【151】* * *\n\n【152】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【153】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【154】Figure 3\n\n【155】* * *\n\n【156】* * *\n\n【157】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【158】We analysed seven domains of potential risk of bias for the included studies; 42, 48 and 51 studies were rated at low risk of attrition bias, selective reporting bias and other bias respectively. Eighteen studies were rated at low risk of selection bias. We rated 25 studies each at low risk of performance bias and detection bias. Blinding of participants and personnel and incomplete outcome data were rated at high risk in six and nine included studies respectively.\n\n【159】#### Allocation\n\n【160】Eighteen studies clearly described the process for adequate generation of a randomized sequence and concealment of allocation and were classified as low risk of bias. Random sequence generation or allocation concealment was rated as having an unclear risk of bias in the remaining 35 studies due to not reporting sequence generation or allocation details. No study was rated as high risk of bias ( Figure 3 ).\n\n【161】#### Blinding\n\n【162】##### Performance bias\n\n【163】Six studies were at high risk for performance bias. In four studies patients were not blinded ( Kumar 2007 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ). One study was performed in an unblinded fashion ( Goeters 2002 ) and in another study treatment was not blinded for the attending physicians ( Tjäder 2004 ). Twenty‐two studies gave insufficient information to assess performance bias and 25 studies were at low risk for performance bias as blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured in these studies ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ).\n\n【164】##### Detection bias\n\n【165】One open randomized trial was rated as high risk for detection bias ( Goeters 2002 ) and 27 included studies were rated at an unclear risk of detection bias ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ).\n\n【166】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【167】In nine studies the number of patients withdrawn after randomization was high (4 to 49) and the studies were judged as having a high risk for attrition bias ( Conejero 2002 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Goeters 2002 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Kłek 2005 ; Luo 2008 ; Mertes 2000 ; Yang 2008 ). Two studies were rated at unclear risk: one study planned to exclude the patients who died within 72 hours of admission but did not report the number of patients excluded ( Pattanshetti 2009 ), another study withdrew five patients without giving reasons ( Wernerman 2011 ). For the remaining 42 studies the risk of attrition bias was low ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ).\n\n【168】#### Selective reporting\n\n【169】We judged two studies as high risk for reporting bias. One study did not report the length of hospital stay outcome completely ( Qiu 2009 ), the other study did not report the length of ICU stay and all‐cause six‐month mortality outcomes completely ( Wernerman 2011 ). We were, therefore, unable to enter these two studies in a meta‐analysis. Three studies were judged as having an unclear risk for reporting bias. One study only reported the average length of stay and mortality outcomes in the subgroup of patients treated for longer than nine days, and whether this was pre‐specified was unclear ( Goeters 2002 ). Two other studies either did not report baseline infection associated blood test results ( Pattanshetti 2009 ) or did not report organ function tests ( Zhu 2000 ) and were therefore judged at unclear risk. The remaining 48 studies were free from selective reporting bias ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ).\n\n【170】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【171】One study had baseline bias and was rated at high risk. This was because the patients in the treatment group were younger than those in the control group ( Kumar 2007 ). In another study, patients that were clinically accepted for parenteral nutrition were included in the trial, it was unclear whether the patients were all critically ill. This study was rated at unclear risk ( Powell‐Tuck 1999 ). No other significant potential sources of bias were identified in the remaining trials ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ).\n\n【172】### Effects of interventions\n\n【173】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Glutamine‐supplemented nutrition compared to non‐supplemented nutrition for critically ill patients\n\n【174】See: summary of findings for the main comparison glutamine supplementation for critically ill adults, summary of findings Table for the main comparison .\n\n【175】#### Infectious complications\n\n【176】Thirty‐three trials (including 2303 patients) provided data on the nosocomial infectious complications (see Characteristics of included studies ). The absolute risk for infectious complications was 39.9% (458/1148) in the control group and 31.8% (367/1155) in the intervention group. Pooling of these data suggested that glutamine supplementation reduced the infectious complications rate in adults with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87, P ＜ 0.00001, I² = 8%) ( Analysis 1.1 ). By setting the assumed control risk at 40%, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome as 12. The funnel plot for this outcome was asymmetrical, suggesting that smaller studies with outcomes favouring non‐supplemented patients appeared to be lacking. One newly published large sample, randomized blinded trial ( Heyland 2013 ) provided data on the infectious outcome in glutamine supplementation patients together with patients on antioxidant supplementation. We were told by the author that the detailed infectious incidence in glutamine supplementation patients will be published in the future ( Heyland 2013 \\[pers comm\\] ). This study was not included in the analysis. We also used the trim and fill method for this outcome to identify and correct for funnel plot asymmetry arising from publication bias. The method suggested that 13 studies are missing. Using a fixed‐effect model (inverse variance method) the original point estimate (RR) and 95% CI for the combined studies was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.92). Using trim and fill the imputed point estimate was 0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Using the random‐effects model the RR was 0.83 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.92). Using trim and fill the imputed point estimate was 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99). These results suggested that the combined results were not changed after adding the missing studies.\n\n【177】Sensitivity analysis showed that the risk of infectious complications in the low risk of bias studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Grau 2011 ; Hall 2003 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ) was not different between the groups (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01, P = 0.06, I² = 9%). The difference in combined effect size between the main analysis and the sensitivity analysis could be explained by the reduced sample size but more importantly the change in RR from 0.79 in the main analysis to 0.85 in the sensitivity analysis suggested that the effect size could have been partly explained by within study biases.\n\n【178】#### Infectious complications: elective surgery patients versus critically ill patients\n\n【179】Eleven trials ( Dong 2008 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Jiang 1999 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Kłek 2005 ; Lu 2011 ; Neri 2001 ; O'Riordain 1994 ; Spittler 2001 ; Wang 2006 ; Zhu 2000 ) included 456 patients who were enrolled for elective surgery. The pooled RR was 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.86, P = 0.005, I² = 0%). Twenty‐two trials ( Andrews 2011 ; Conejero 2002 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Grau 2011 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Hall 2003 ; He 2004 ; Kumar 2007 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Sahin 2007 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Zhao 2013 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ) that enrolled 1847 critically ill patients were pooled to give a RR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.91, P = 0.001, I² = 18%) ( Analysis 2.1 ).\n\n【180】#### Infectious complications: enteral glutamine supplementation versus parenteral glutamine supplementation\n\n【181】Twenty‐eight studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Grau 2011 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Jiang 1999 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Kłek 2005 ; Lu 2011 ; Neri 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; O'Riordain 1994 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Sahin 2007 ; Spittler 2001 ; Wang 2006 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Zhao 2013 ; Zhou 2004 ; Zhu 2000 ) examined the effects of parenteral glutamine supplementation on infection. Meta‐analysis showed a lower risk of infectious complications in patients receiving parenteral glutamine supplementation than those without glutamine supplementation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.87, P ＜ 0.00001, I² = 0%). Five studies ( Conejero 2002 ; Garrel 2003 ; Hall 2003 ; Kumar 2007 ; Zhou 2003 ) tested the effects of enteral glutamine supplementation on the infection rate. There was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02, P = 0.07, I² = 50%) ( Analysis 3.1 ). The test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (P = 0.61).\n\n【182】#### Infectious complications: patients with malignant disease versus patients with non‐malignant disease\n\n【183】Six studies ( Kłek 2005 ; Lu 2011 ; Neri 2001 ; O'Riordain 1994 ; Wang 2006 ; Zhu 2000 ) included surgical patients with malignant disease and the pooled RR was 0.45 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.90, P = 0.02, I² = 0%). Seventeen studies ( Conejero 2002 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Sahin 2007 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Zhao 2013 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ) enrolled patients with non‐malignant disease. The pooled analysis showed that the risk of infectious complications was lower in the glutamine supplemented patients than in the patients that did not receive the supplement (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78, P < 0.00001, I² = 0%). The remaining 10 studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Grau 2011 ; Hall 2003 ; Jiang 1999 ; Kumar 2007 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Spittler 2001 ) enrolled patients with uncertain or mixed disease. The pooled RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.03, P = 0.15, I² = 0%) ( Analysis 4.1 ).\n\n【184】#### Mortality\n\n【185】Thirty‐seven studies (3494 patients) reported on mortality. Of these 37 studies, 36 ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Chai 2006 ; Conejero 2002 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Hall 2003 ; He 2004 ; Heyland 2013 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Kumar 2007 ; Lin 2002 ; Neri 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Qiu 2009 ; Sahin 2007 ; Tian 2006 ; Wang 2006 ; Wernerman 2011 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ) reported short‐term (hospital or closest to one month) mortality. The combined rate of mortality from these studies was not statistically different between the group which received a glutamine supplement and the group which did not (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, P = 0.10, I² = 22%) ( Analysis 1.2 ). Eleven studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Qiu 2009 ; Tjäder 2004 ; Wernerman 2011 ) reported long‐term (closest to six months) mortality. Meta‐analysis of these 11 studies yielded an RR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12, P = 0.94, I² = 30%) ( Analysis 1.3 ). The funnel plot for the short‐term mortality outcome was asymmetrical, suggesting that smaller studies with outcomes favouring non‐supplemented patients appeared to be lacking; while the funnel plot for the long‐term mortality outcome was symmetrical. The trim and fill method suggested that 10 studies were missing for the short‐term mortality outcome, and results indicated that the combined results were not changed after filling in these missing studies. Using the fixed‐effect model (inverse variance method) the original point estimate (RR) for the combined studies was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07). Using the trim and fill method the imputed point estimate was 1.00 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.14). Using the random‐effects model the RR for the combined studies was 0.83 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.00). Using trim and fill the imputed RR was 0.93 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.15).\n\n【186】Sensitivity analysis showed that both the short‐ and long‐term mortality rates in low risk of bias studies were not different between the groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30, P = 0.29, I² = 21%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23, P = 0.96, I² = 46% respectively).\n\n【187】#### Short‐term mortality: elective surgery patients versus critically ill patients\n\n【188】Twenty‐nine studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Chai 2006 ; Conejero 2002 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Hall 2003 ; He 2004 ; Heyland 2013 ; Kumar 2007 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Sahin 2007 ; Tian 2006 ; Wernerman 2011 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ) enrolling 3157 critically ill patients reported short‐term mortality. The pooled RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.04, P = 0.15, I² = 19%). The mortality outcome was reported in seven studies ( Dong 2008 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Lin 2002 ; Neri 2001 ; Qiu 2009 ; Wang 2006 ) enrolling patients for elective surgery. No deaths occurred during the study period in six of the seven studies so the data could not be combined ( Analysis 2.2 ).\n\n【189】#### Short‐term mortality: enteral glutamine supplementation versus parenteral glutamine supplementation\n\n【190】Five clinical trials ( Conejero 2002 ; Garrel 2003 ; Hall 2003 ; Kumar 2007 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ) examined the effects of enteral glutamine supplementation on short‐term mortality. Pooling of these studies suggested no difference in mortality rate between the intervention and control groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.30, P = 0.61, I² = 48%). Thirty trials ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Chai 2006 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Lin 2002 ; Neri 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Qiu 2009 ; Sahin 2007 ; Tian 2006 ; Wang 2006 ; Wernerman 2011 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ) used parenterally supplemented glutamine. We pooled the data on the 2207 patients enrolled in these studies, which yielded a RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.90, P = 0.002, I² = 0%) ( Analysis 3.2 ). Only one study ( Heyland 2013 ) supplemented glutamine both parenterally and enterally but this study could not be entered into a subgroup analysis.\n\n【191】#### Short‐term mortality: patients with malignant disease versus patients with non‐malignant disease\n\n【192】Three studies ( Lin 2002 ; Neri 2001 ; Wang 2006 ) included 120 surgical patients with malignant disease. No deaths occurred during the study period in these three studies, so the RR could not be estimated. Nineteen studies ( Chai 2006 ; Conejero 2002 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Sahin 2007 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ) enrolled 921 patients with non‐malignant disease. The pooled analysis of these studies showed a lower mortality risk for participants receiving glutamine supplementation compared with those receiving placebo (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.79, P = 0.002, I² = 0%). The remaining 14 studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Kumar 2007 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Qiu 2009 ; Tian 2006 ; Wernerman 2011 ) enrolled 2413 patients with uncertain or mixed disease, and the pooled RR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.20, P = 0.78, I² = 26%) ( Analysis 4.2 ).\n\n【193】#### Long‐term mortality\n\n【194】Data on 124 patients with non‐malignant disease from two studies comparing nutrition with glutamine supplementation to nutrition without glutamine supplementation ( Griffiths 1997 ; Tjäder 2004 ) were pooled to give a RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.00, P = 0.05, I² = 0%). The remaining subgroup analysis did not find a mortality difference between the groups ( Analysis 2.3 ; Analysis 3.3 ; Analysis 4.3 ).\n\n【195】#### Length of hospital stay\n\n【196】Hospital length of stay was reported in 36 studies (see Characteristics of included studies ). Of these 36 studies, 25 ( Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Dong 2008 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Goeters 2002 ; He 2004 ; Jiang 1999 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Mertes 2000 ; Morlion 1998 ; Neri 2001 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Peng 2004 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Sahin 2007 ; Spittler 2001 ; Wang 2006 ; Yang 2008 ; Yao 2007 ; Zhao 2013 ; Zhou 2002 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ) reported the outcome as mean (standard deviation or standard error of mean). Pooled analysis of these studies showed that the length of hospital stay was shorter in the glutamine supplementation group than in the control group (mean difference (MD) ‐4.14, 95% CI ‐5.46 to ‐2.81, P < 0.0001, I² = 70%). In the remaining 11 studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Grau 2011 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Kumar 2007 ; Kłek 2005 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ) the data were reported as the median (interquartile range) or median (range). The median (range) in each study was converted into mean (standard deviation) by using the formula from Hozo 2005 , while the estimated standard deviation was calculated from the interquartile range based on the assumption that the width of the interquartile range was approximately 1.35 standard deviations ( Handbook 2011 ). All 36 studies were included in the meta‐analysis after conversion and the results suggested that the length of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (MD ‐3.46, 95% CI ‐4.61 to ‐2.32, P < 0.0001, I² = 63%) ( Analysis 1.4 ). The funnel plot for this outcome was symmetrical.\n\n【197】Sensitivity analysis, including eight low risk of bias studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Grau 2011 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ), also showed that glutamine supplementation had beneficial effects in reducing the length of hospital stay (MD ‐2.9, 95% CI ‐5.3 to ‐0.5, P = 0.02, I² = 58%).\n\n【198】The substantial heterogeneity between studies for this outcome may have been because these studies included participants with different categories of disease. Hence we did the following subgroup analysis according to types of diseases. Among the 36 trials, seven trials included burns patients ( Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Garrel 2003 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Peng 2004 ; Zhou 2002 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ) and seven trials included acute pancreatitis patients ( Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Hajdú 2012 ; He 2004 ; Ockenga 2002 ; Sahin 2007 ; Yang 2008 ; Zhao 2013 ). Meta‐analysis of these two subgroups suggested beneficial effects of glutamine in reducing the length of hospital stay, with mild to moderate heterogeneity between studies (MD ‐7.24, 95% CI ‐11.28 to ‐3.21, P = 0.0004, I² = 49% for burn patients; MD ‐1.75, 95% CI ‐2.42 to ‐1.08, P < 0.00001, I² = 0% for acute pancreatitis patients). However, combining the data from nine trials that included critically ill patients other than burns and acute pancreatitis patients ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ) revealed that there was no difference between the treatment and control groups, with moderate heterogeneity between studies (MD ‐1.16, 95% CI ‐4.05 to 1.72, P = 0.43, I² = 25%). A meta‐analysis of 13 trials including surgical patients ( Dong 2008 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Jiang 1999 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Kumar 2007 ; Kłek 2005 ; Mertes 2000 ; Morlion 1998 ; Neri 2001 ; Spittler 2001 ; Wang 2006 ; Yao 2007 ) showed that there was still substantial heterogeneity among these studies (MD ‐4.04, 95% CI ‐5.44 to ‐2.64, P < 0.00001, I² = 56%). This may have been because patients received different types of surgery in these studies.\n\n【199】#### Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay\n\n【200】We analysed 22 studies (see Characteristics of included studies ) which reported the length of stay in ICU. The data were combined using the fixed‐effect model and revealed slightly prolonged ICU stay in the glutamine supplemented group (MD 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29, P = 0.002, I² = 11%) ( Analysis 1.5 ). Using the random‐effects model there was no significant difference in ICU days between the treatment and control groups (MD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.62 to 0.37, P = 0.63, I² = 11%). The funnel plot for this meta‐analysis was symmetrical.\n\n【201】Of the 22 studies, eight studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Conejero 2002 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ) reported the days in ICU as the median (range) or median (interquartile range). They were changed into mean (standard deviation) as described above ( Measures of treatment effect ). A sensitivity analysis, excluding these studies by using the fixed‐effect model, reported the same result (MD 0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30, P = 0.001, I² = 22%). A sensitivity analysis including seven low risk of bias studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Çekmen 2011 ) and using the fixed‐effect model or the random‐effects model showed that glutamine supplementation had no effect on reducing the length of ICU stay (MD ‐0.54, 95% CI ‐1.48 to 0.4, P = 0.26, I² = 25%; MD ‐0.6, 95% CI ‐1.98 to 0.79, P = 0.40, I² = 25%, respectively).\n\n【202】#### Days on mechanical ventilation\n\n【203】Eleven studies with 455 patients ( Chai 2006 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Zhang 2007 ) reported this outcome as the mean (standard deviation). The combined MD of these studies was ‐1.54 days (95% CI ‐2.44 to ‐0.65, P = 0.0008, I² = 0%) suggesting that glutamine supplementation reduced the number of days on mechanical ventilation in critically ill and surgical patients. In three studies ( Déchelotte 2006 ; Grau 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ) the original data were reported as the median (interquartile ranges) or median (range). These studies were included in the meta‐analysis after they were converted into the mean (standard deviation) and the combined MD of all 14 studies was ‐0.69 days (95% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.02, P = 0.04, I² = 18%) ( Analysis 1.6 ). The funnel plot for this outcome was symmetrical, suggesting no evidence of publication bias for this outcome.\n\n【204】Sensitivity analysis including three low risk of bias studies ( Déchelotte 2006 ; Grau 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ) showed that glutamine supplementation did not reduce the number of days on mechanical ventilation (MD 0.37, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 1.38, P = 0.47, I² = 32%).\n\n【205】#### Side effects\n\n【206】Eleven studies ( Estívariz 2008 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Goeters 2002 ; Grau 2011 ; Lin 2002 ; Morlion 1998 ; Neri 2001 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Yao 2007 ; Zhu 2000 ) reported that glutamine supplementation was well tolerated and no adverse events related to the administration of glutamine were observed. In two large sample, clinical trials ( Andrews 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ) with 856 patients the serious adverse events outcome was reported and the pooled analysis of these two studies revealed that there was no significant difference in the risk of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.57, P = 0.27, I² = 0%) ( Analysis 1.7 ). In one trial ( Heyland 2013 ) it was also found that the frequency of high urea levels (> 50 mmol/L) was higher among patients who received glutamine than for those that did not (13.4% versus 4.0%, P < 0.001). However, meta‐analysis of biological markers of liver and kidney function, such as alanine aminotransferase ( Analysis 1.8 ), aspartate aminotransferase ( Analysis 1.9 ) and creatinine ( Analysis 1.10 ), did not find any difference between the groups during the treatment period. A further three studies reported on side effects. Two studies ( Conejero 2002 ; Hall 2003 ) that supplemented glutamine enterally in critical ill patients reported gastrointestinal complications. The incidence of gastrointestinal complications was similar between the two groups. One study ( Déchelotte 2006 ) of parenterally supplemented glutamine for ICU patients found that the number of adverse events per patient was significantly lower in the alanyl‐glutamine group than in the placebo group (2.0 versus 2.8, P < 0 .01).\n\n【207】#### Quality of life\n\n【208】This outcome was recorded in four studies. One study ( Griffiths 1997 ) used the Whiston Health Questionnaire ( Jones 1993 ) to assess patients' pre‐morbid health status and found that the morbidity of the participants at six months was similar between the glutamine supplemented and control groups. One study ( Hall 2003 ) described the functional status of surviving patients at six months, and no differences were detected between the two groups. In one study ( Powell‐Tuck 1999 ) patients were asked to score their mood, sleep, energy, appetite, pain, and mobilization on a 10‐point scale with 0 = 'perfect' and 10 = 'as bad as it can be'. No statistical difference was found between the intervention and control groups at the end of the treatment. In another study ( Andrews 2011 ) quality of life measures (SF‐12 and EQ‐5D questionnaires) were collected at three and six months by post; the results have not been published.\n\n【209】Discussion\n----------\n\n【210】The results of our meta‐analysis provided moderate evidence that glutamine supplementation could reduce the infection rate and days on mechanical ventilation, and low quality evidence that glutamine supplementation reduced length of hospital stay in critically ill or surgical participants. However, the differences in risk of mortality, length of ICU stay and quality of life were not significant between the intervention and control groups. According to the results of predefined subgroup analyses, our review also suggests that the effects of glutamine supplementation in reducing the risk of infectious complications and mortality were not different between elective surgical patients and critically ill patients, patients receiving enteral supplementation and parenteral supplementation, and patients with malignant and non‐malignant diseases respectively.\n\n【211】Enteral nutrition is the preferred way of feeding the critically ill patient ( Kreymann 2006 ), however our review suggested that parenteral glutamine had the same effect in reducing the risk of infectious complications and mortality in critically ill patients. Considering the biologically plausible reasons for this result, there is a clinical study suggesting that the intestinal absorption of glutamine was impaired during critically ill conditions ( Salloum 1991 ). Still, in a clinical trial in which glutamine was enterally supplemented at a dose of 26 g/day in burns patients it was found that there was no difference in plasma glutamine levels between the supplemented and non‐supplemented groups, suggesting that most of the glutamine that is administered is consumed by the gut. The immune system outside the gut would not have been affected by the glutamine supplementation ( Garrel 2003 ).\n\n【212】Several meta‐analyses had been undertaken to examine the effects of perioperative glutamine supplementation in surgical patients ( Wang 2010 ; Yue 2013 ; Zheng 2006 ). These meta‐analyses all found that perioperative glutamine supplementation is safe in reducing the morbidity of postoperative infectious complications in surgical patients. In this review we have included 18 studies on surgical patients. For the short‐ and long‐term mortality outcomes, deaths were reported in only one trial for each ( Estívariz 2008 ; Qiu 2009 ). This prohibited further analysis. For infectious complications, our subgroup analysis revealed that glutamine supplementation had beneficial effects in reducing the risk of infection in both critically ill and surgical participants. This result suggests that participants with critical illness or undergoing elective major surgery may have similar glutamine deficiencies. Further research focusing on the different effects of glutamine supplementation in these two groups of patients may not be required.\n\n【213】In this systematic review we also predefined a subgroup analysis to compare the treatment effects of glutamine in participants with malignant and non‐malignant disease. Cancer patients included in this meta‐analysis were all surgical patients, hence we found that the results in cancer patients were the same as those in surgical patients. Still, the studies that we included mostly focused on non‐oncology or mixed disease patients. Few trials have focused on oncology patients but their results showed an infection benefit in this population. No conclusions can be drawn on the differences in risk of infection and death between oncology and non‐oncology patients given the limited data available. There is still a lack of large, quality trials that focus on oncology patients.\n\n【214】### Summary of main results\n\n【215】This meta‐analysis found moderate evidence that glutamine supplementation could reduce the infection rate and days on mechanical ventilation in critically ill or surgical participants. However, it seems to have little or no effect on the risk of mortality and length of ICU stay. Although there is substantial heterogeneity within the included studies, our review also suggests that glutamine supplementation may reduce the length of hospital stay in these participants ( summary of findings Table for the main comparison ).\n\n【216】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【217】We investigated 53 controlled clinical trials that met our predefined inclusion criteria for the participants, intervention and outcomes. The pre‐specified objectives and outcomes of the review are sufficiently addressed, except for the quality of life outcome. Quality of life was only descriptively analysed in this review as there were few included studies that reported on this outcome, and they used different measurement scales.\n\n【218】In recent guidelines on nutrition support, parenteral supplementation with glutamine was supported in critically ill patients, while enteral glutamine supplementation in surgical or critically ill patients was not recommended because of lack of evidence ( Clinical Evaluation Research Unit 2013 ; Kreymann 2006 ; Singer 2009 ). Our review further classified and analysed this evidence and will provide guidance for clinical nutrition therapy.\n\n【219】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【220】We identified 10 low risk of bias studies ( Andrews 2011 ; Çekmen 2011 ; Déchelotte 2006 ; Dong 2008 ; Grau 2011 ; Griffiths 1997 ; Hall 2003 ; Heyland 2013 ; Zhou 2003 ; Zhou 2004 ); 16 high risk of bias studies ( Conejero 2002 ; Estívariz 2008 ; Garrel 2003 ; Goeters 2002 ; Hajdú 2012 ; Kłek 2005 ; Kumar 2007 ; Luo 2008 ; Mertes 2000 ; Pattanshetti 2009 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2008 ; Pérez‐Bárcena 2010 ; Qiu 2009 ; Tjäder 2004 ; Wernerman 2011 ; Yang 2008 ); and 27 studies with an unclear risk of bias ( Chai 2006 ; Cucereanu‐Badica 2013 ; Eroglu 2009 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2004 ; Fuentes‐Orozco 2008 ; He 2004 ; Jiang 1999 ; Karwowska 2001 ; Lin 2002 ; Lu 2011 ; Morlion 1998 ; Neri 2001 ; Ockenga 2002 ; O'Riordain 1994 ; Peng 2004 ; Powell‐Tuck 1999 ; Sahin 2007 ; Spittler 2001 ; Tian 2006 ; Tremel 1994 ; Wang 2006 ; Wischmeyer 2001 ; Yao 2007 ; Zhang 2007 ; Zhao 2013 ; Zhou 2002 ; Zhu 2000 ).\n\n【221】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【222】Firstly, the risk of overall bias in our review is probably high as four‐fifths of the included studies were judged as having unclear or high risk of bias ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ). Secondly, we converted continuous outcomes that were reported as the median (range) or median (interquartile range) into the mean (SD), this will introduce bias in the final results of the meta‐analysis. Thirdly, although efforts were made to retrieve all relevant trials, there is still one article that is awaiting classification ( Hallay 2002 ). Fourthly, the meta‐analysis of infection and short‐term mortality outcomes included studies with no events in one arm and excluded studies where there were no events in both arms, this may introduce bias in the combined treatment effect estimates. Fifthly, funnel plots for infection and short‐term mortality suggest that smaller studies with outcomes favouring non‐supplemented patients appear to be lacking, our analysis is therefore at risk of publication bias. Finally, we could not include the detailed infectious complications results from Heyland's study ( Heyland 2013 ), and there is time lag between the search and publication of the review dates; they are likely to introduce bias into the review process.\n\n【223】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【224】The results of our review are comparable to previous meta‐analyses ( Avenell 2006 ; Avenell 2009 ; Bollhalder 2013 ; Novak 2002 ). There are several differences between our review and the other published reviews. First, we included recently published RCTs ( Andrews 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ) and more clinical trials were analysed with the rigorous Cochrane methods in our review. Second, we added side effects and quality of life as our secondary outcomes. Third, we undertook subgroup analysis to investigate the heterogeneity between patients with malignant and non‐malignant disease.\n\n【225】In this review we observed a significant effect on infection complications, which is in contrast with the results from two recently published large‐scale, high quality RCTs ( Andrews 2011 ; Heyland 2013 ) that did not find any beneficial effects of glutamine supplementation for reducing the rates of mortality and infection complications in critically ill patients. On the one hand, this may have been due to the fact that we could not include in this review the detailed infectious complications reported in the Heyland study ( Heyland 2013 ). We will include this study in the updated review when the results are published. On the other hand, the uniqueness and limitations of these two studies should be noted. Heyland's study ( Heyland 2013 ) was distinct from other traditional glutamine trials supplementing complete parenteral nutrition in that it administered glutamine (and antioxidants) independent of any nutrition support. The average nutritional delivery for the entire study period was about 50% of the prescribed delivery, so not meeting the prescribed patient needs. In addition, more then 30% of patients in the Heyland study were found to have baseline renal failure at admission, which universally was an exclusion criterion in other traditional nutrition‐based glutamine trials. Further, all patients that were enrolled were in multi‐system organ failure at enrolment, which was an exclusion criterion in most of the previous trials using parenteral glutamine as a supplement to parenteral nutrition. Hence the Heyland study may indicate that glutamine should not be supplemented in patients early in the acute phase of critical illness, when patients are shown to have multiple organ failure or to be in unresuscitated shock requiring significant vasopressor support; and patients with renal failure who are not receiving dialysis should receive supplemental glutamine cautiously. In the Andrews trial ( Andrews 2011 ) concerns including lack of availability of some key data regarding missing values, dropouts, protocol violations and complete follow‐up data have been raised. The actual values for the glutamine doses based on body weight have not been published and this should be noted.\n\n【226】Figures and Tables -\n\n【227】Figure 1\n\n【228】Study flow

A number of treatments have been introduced to treat the condition but it is unclear which intervention improves maternal and fetal outcome.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】The objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of treatment modalities in twin‐twin transfusion syndrome.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( _The Cochrane Library_ 2007, Issue 4). We also searched conference proceedings and made personal contact with experts active in the area of the review.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised and quasi‐randomised studies of amnioreduction versus laser coagulation, septostomy versus laser coagulation or septostomy versus amnioreduction.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】One review author assessed eligibility and extracted data, which were checked by a second author. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Two studies (213 women) were included. This review shows that laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels results in less death of both infants per pregnancy (relative risk (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.79, one trial), less perinatal death (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.0.40 to 0.87 adjusted for cluster, one trial) and less neonatal death (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.61 adjusted for cluster, one trial) than in pregnancies treated with amnioreduction. There is no difference in perinatal outcome between amnioreduction and septostomy. A third study is awaiting assessment.\n\n【13】More babies were alive without neurological abnormality at the age of six months in the laser group than the amnioreduction groups (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.35 adjusted for clustering, one trial). This difference did not persist beyond six months of age. There was no significant difference in the babies alive at six months with neurological abnormality treated by laser coagulation or amnioreduction (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.86 adjusted for clustering, one trial).\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Endoscopic laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels should be considered in the treatment of all stages of twin‐twin transfusion syndrome to improve perinatal outcome. Further research on the effect of treatment on milder forms of twin‐twin transfusion syndrome (Quintero stage 1 and 2) are required. The long‐term outcomes of survivors from the studies included in this review are required.\n\n【16】PICOs\n-----\n\n【17】### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Population (9)\n\n【19】*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Monochorionic Twin Pregnancy\n*   Fetus Normal\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Oligohydramnios\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Twin-to-twin Blood Transfer\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n*   Hydramnios\n\n【20】###### Intervention (3)\n\n【21】*   Ultrasonography Guided Percutaneous Amniotic Septostomy\n*   Endoscopic Laser Ablation Of Placental Arterio-venous Anastomosis\n*   Serial Drainage Of Amniotic Fluid\n\n【22】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【23】*   Ultrasonography Guided Percutaneous Amniotic Septostomy\n*   Endoscopic Laser Ablation Of Placental Arterio-venous Anastomosis\n*   Serial Drainage Of Amniotic Fluid\n\n【24】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【25】*   Stillbirth\n*   Neurodevelopmental Delay\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Sometimes identical twins share the same placenta and blood flow, and the proportion of blood shared between the twins is usually equal. Twin‐to‐twin transfusion syndrome happens when the blood flow is uneven and passes from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient). This can happen when the placenta has deep artery‐to‐vein connections. The donor twin usually has very little amniotic fluid, and frequently does not grow well and is very small. The recipient twin has excessive amniotic fluid, and often has a distended bladder and other medical problems. The risk of death for both twins is high, around 80% if there is no treatment. There is also risk of physical or neurological damage to both twins if they survive. Various options for treatment exist. These include (1) the repeated removal of excessive amniotic fluid (amnioreduction); (2) laser treatment of the abnormal vessels in the placenta (endoscopic laser surgery); (3) puncture of the membrane between the twins (septostomy); and (4) the selective ending of one twin's life (selective feticide). The review found two trials, involving 213 women and 430 babies. There were no studies on laser treatment versus puncturing the membrane, nor on selective feticide. The evidence showed that laser treatment was associated with fewer babies dying when compared to removing the excess amniotic fluid. However, where there is insufficient expertise to perform laser surgery, amnioreduction is then the treatment of choice. None of the studies assessed morbidity for the mother. Further research is needed on mild forms of the problem.\n\n【32】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【33】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the benefits and harms of the expression and storage of breast milk during pregnancy by women with diabetes.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Numerous health benefits to both the mother and baby can be ascribed to breastfeeding, in addition to the substantial cost savings it affords to families and health services ( Renfrew 2012 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed, whether directly from the breast or as expressed breast milk, for the first six months, that is, without any supplements, artificial formula or solid food ( WHO 2011 ).\n\n【7】Infants born to mothers who have diabetes in pregnancy (gestational or pre‐existing) are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) compared to other infants ( Hanson 1993 ). This can be explained by their exposure to higher glucose levels in utero than usual, with subsequent increased insulin secretion. These infants may then need to adjust their insulin secretion to deal with postnatal glucose intake levels. It is for this reason that, in the first few days of life, many of these infants become hypoglycaemic and will require additional glucose, provided by donor human milk, artificial formula or via an intravenous infusion, as well as the intake from breastfeeding or breast milk expressed after birth. Because euglycaemia (normal levels of glucose in the blood) appears to be an important influence on the onset of lactogenesis II (the copious flow of milk 30 to 40 hours after giving birth), women with diabetes in pregnancy with hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia may be at increased risk of delaying this progression ( Arthur 1994 ; Neubauer 1993 ). Thus, the infant who is already at increased risk of morbidity related to his/her mother’s diabetes, may also be exposed to artificial formula and separation from the mother if transferred to a nursery facility for intravenous fluid administration and glucose monitoring.\n\n【8】Further, avoidance of dietary exposure to some proteins found in cow's milk and the potential for a stronger immune system in exclusively breastfed infants may decrease the likelihood of these children subsequently developing B‐cell autoimmunity and Type 1 diabetes ( Ip 2007 ; Newburg 2005 ; Silverman 1995 ).\n\n【9】### Description of the intervention\n\n【10】Antenatal breast milk expression has historically been proposed as a means of breast preparation ( Chapman 2012a ), although its popularity declined when the evidence emerged demonstrating no benefits in doing this (for example, Brown 1975 ). However, the practice has since been utilised as a means of building up a store of colostrum antenatally. The advantage of doing this is that, following birth, should additional nutrition be required, maternal colostrum can be given instead of artificial formula ( Cox 2006 ). A survey of lactation consultants in Australia reported a growing awareness of antenatal breast milk expression, even when the practice was not promoted by the individual lactation consultants who responded to the survey ( Chapman 2012b ).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】The storage of expressed colostrum to be given (if required) in addition to breast milk obtained directly from the breast or expressed after birth, may avert the need for artificial formula or intravenous fluid administration if correction of hypoglycaemia is required. Some clinical guidelines (e.g. NICE 2008 ) recommend close monitoring of the baby's blood sugar level in the postnatal period, with the mother and baby remaining together for care. Should the infant become hypoglycaemic (often defined as a true blood glucose (TBG) of < 2.6 mmol/L), a prescribed series of escalating interventions is followed, which may include separation of the baby from the mother through admission to a special or intensive care nursery if an additional feed of breast milk or formula does not result in euglycaemia within an hour, or by the time of the next feed ( NETS 2009 ). Some hospitals mandate the infant's automatic admission to the special or intensive care nursery following birth, rather than mother and baby being cared for together, for example, for the infant of a woman with Type 1 diabetes, or an infant of a woman with gestational diabetes who required in excess of a specified number of units of insulin daily (e.g. Southern Health 2011 ). Moreover, there are substantial economic and social costs attributable to such admissions and to separation of the mother and her baby ( Argus 2009 ; Figueiredo 2009 ). The limited expenses involved in educating women to express and the provision of sterile containers and freezer storage would be likely to be considerably less than the costs of specialised nursery admission and treatment.\n\n【13】#### Potential concerns arising from breast/nipple stimulation\n\n【14】Uterine contractions may result from the release of the hormone, oxytocin, that accompanies nipple stimulation ( Christensson 1989 ). Therefore, the potential for this intervention to cause harm by bringing on labour early raises concern. Specifically, breast stimulation may be utilised as a means of inducing labour, as reported in a systematic review of six trials (719 women) comparing breast stimulation with no intervention in women from 37 weeks of gestation ( Kavanagh 2005 ). The review reported a significant reduction in the proportion of women not in labour within 72 hours (62.7% versus 93.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74). Although these findings were only significant in women who entered the study with a favourable cervix (that is, ready for labour), other randomised trials have demonstrated an improvement in the Bishop's score, which gauges cervical preparedness for labour ( Damania 1992 ; Di Lieto 1989 ; Salmon 1986 ). To address this concern, Soltani 2012 reported a retrospective cohort study of 94 diabetic women. Infants of mothers who had expressed antenatally were more likely to be born a week earlier than infants whose mothers had not undertaken antenatal breast milk expression.\n\n【15】Further concerns include the potential for earlier birth to contribute to neonatal nursery admission and/or for hypoglycaemia to develop or persist despite being given the colostrum. The study by Soltani 2012 reported that more babies were admitted to the special care nursery in the group that expressed milk antenatally. Forster 2011 enrolled 43 women with diabetes in a prospective non‐randomised study of antenatal breast milk expression twice a day for 10 minutes from 36 weeks' gestation. Outcomes for this group were compared with those from a retrospective audit of 89 women with diabetes who had not expressed during pregnancy. The study reported that five women experienced uterine tightening or Braxton Hicks contractions after expressing and did not continue this activity. Forty per cent of infants of women who had expressed milk received artificial formula within 24 hours of birth compared with 56% of the comparison group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09). The finding of potentially increased rates of admission to the special care nursery in the expressing group were of concern even though they did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.33). The wide confidence interval suggests that more participants would be required to confirm or refute this concern.\n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Despite the concerns for the potential of earlier birth or neonatal nursery admissions for interventions to correct hypoglycaemia, antenatal breast milk expression and storage is emerging within clinical practice on the basis of its theoretical benefits to infants of women with diabetes in pregnancy (for example, Cox 2010 ; Ramsay Health Care 2011 ). The observational evidence that suggests the potential for an increased risk to the mother of premature labour and to the baby of premature birth and nursery admission following such practice ( Forster 2011 ; Soltani 2012 ), needs to be followed through with a systematic review of randomised controlled trial evidence to determine the benefits and harms of antenatal breast milk expression, to then inform clinical practice. When it is determined that this practice is, or is not, beneficial to infants, there will be implications for promoting successful breastfeeding in the mother to reduce her risk of diabetes later in life and for the child's potential for developing diabetes.\n\n【18】Objectives\n----------\n\n【19】To evaluate the benefits and harms of the expression and storage of breast milk during pregnancy by women with diabetes.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【22】#### Types of studies\n\n【23】Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised trials and cluster‐randomised trials. Cross‐over trials are unlikely to be appropriate for this research question and will therefore be excluded.

The Trials Search Co‐ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.\n\n【46】We will not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【47】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【48】#### Selection of studies\n\n【49】At least two review authors will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person.\n\n【50】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【51】We will design a form to extract data. For eligible studies, at least two review authors will extract the data using the agreed form. We will resolve discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person. We will enter data into Review Manager software ( RevMan 2011 ) and check for accuracy.\n\n【52】When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.\n\n【53】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【54】Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) _._ We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.\n\n【55】##### (1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【56】We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.\n\n【57】We will assess the method as:\n\n【58】*   low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (any non‐random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【59】##### (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【60】We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【61】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【62】*   low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【63】##### (3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)\n\n【64】We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.\n\n【65】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【66】*   low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;\n    \n*   low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.\n    \n\n【67】##### (3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)\n\n【68】We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.\n\n【69】We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:\n\n【70】*   low, high or unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【71】##### (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)\n\n【72】We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re‐include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.\n\n【73】We will assess methods as:\n\n【74】*   low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【75】##### (5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)\n\n【76】We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.\n\n【77】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【78】*   low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre‐specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);\n    \n*   high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre‐specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre‐specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);\n    \n*   unclear risk of bias.\n    \n\n【79】##### (6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)\n\n【80】We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.\n\n【81】We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:\n\n【82】*   low risk of other bias;\n    \n*   high risk of other bias;\n    \n*   unclear whether there is risk of other bias.\n    \n\n【83】##### (7) Overall risk of bias\n\n【84】We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the _Handbook_ ( Higgins 2011 ). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses ‐ _see_ Sensitivity analysis .\n\n【85】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【86】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【87】For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【88】##### Continuous data\n\n【89】For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.\n\n【90】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【91】##### Cluster‐randomised trials\n\n【92】We will include cluster‐randomised trials in the analyses along with individually‐randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the _Handbook_ using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co‐efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster‐randomised trials and individually‐randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.\n\n【93】We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of the randomisation unit.\n\n【94】##### Cross‐over trials\n\n【95】As it unlikely that cross‐over designs will be appropriate for this research question, we will exclude them.\n\n【96】##### Other unit of analysis issues\n\n【97】We will exclude multiple pregnancies in order to avoid the related issues with the unit of analysis.\n\n【98】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【99】For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.\n\n【100】For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention‐to‐treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.\n\n【101】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【102】We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta‐analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if the I² is greater than 30% and either T² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.\n\n【103】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【104】If there are 10 or more studies in the meta‐analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess  \nfunnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.\n\n【105】#### Data synthesis\n\n【106】We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software ( RevMan 2011 ). We will use fixed‐effect meta‐analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random‐effects meta‐analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random‐effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials.\n\n【107】If we use random‐effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T² and I².\n\n【108】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【109】If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random‐effects analysis to produce it.\n\n【110】We plan to carry out the following subgroup analysis.\n\n【111】*   Type of diabetes: gestational versus Type 1 versus Type 2.\n    \n\n【112】The following outcome will be used in subgroup analysis.\n\n【113】*   Exclusive breastfeeding during the period of hospital‐based care following birth.\n    \n\n【114】We will assess subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan ( RevMan 2011 ). We will report the results of subgroup analyses quoting the χ <sup>2 </sup> statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.\n\n【115】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【116】We will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of trial quality assessed by allocation concealment and other risk of bias components, by omitting studies rated as 'high risk of bias' for these components. This will be restricted to the primary outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral hygiene interventions for people with intellectual disabilities (ID).\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Dental plaque has been shown to have a major role in the development of periodontal disease and dental caries, the two most common oral diseases. Oral hygiene is the process of cleaning the hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity (teeth, gums, and tongue) and fixed dental prostheses, oral appliances, and dentures. Failure to perform regular and effective oral hygiene will result in increased levels and varieties of the dental bacteria that make up dental plaque.\n\n【7】Poor oral hygiene can affect a person’s quality of life because of pain and discomfort when eating, poor self esteem, or sleep disturbance as a result of dental caries ( Bonetti 2015 ). Evidence also exists linking levels of oral hygiene and periodontal status to diabetes, aspiration pneumonia, and rheumatoid arthritis, and evidence is emerging of a link with other systemic diseases and conditions such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and obesity ( Borgnakke 2015 ; Horwitz 2000 ).\n\n【8】People with an intellectual disability (ID) have a higher prevalence and greater severity of periodontal disease than the general population ( Anders 2010 ; Campanaro 2014 ). The prevalence of dental caries in children with ID is similar to those of the general population ( Whelton 2009 ). However, their oral health deteriorates at a faster rate as they move into adulthood. There are more untreated dental caries, more missing teeth, and fewer restorations found in adults with ID than in the general population ( Anders 2010 ; Catteau 2011 ; Crowley 2005 ; De Jongh 2008 ; Hennequin 2008 ; Morgan 2012 ; Oliveira 2013 ).\n\n【9】In the general population, brushing regularly with fluoridated toothpaste has been shown to play an important role in preventing dental caries and periodontal disease ( Axelsson 2004 ; Broadbent 2011 ; Chestnutt 1998 ; Löe 1965 ; Löe 2000 ; Van der Weijden 2011 ; Zimmermann 2015 ). Whether this also applies to people with an ID is less clear, as many research studies on oral health exclude people with disabilities ( Glassman 2009 ).\n\n【10】The removal of dental plaque can reduce the prevalence of periodontal disease and dental caries ( Axelsson 1978 ; Axelsson 2004 ; Löe 1965 ; Löe 2000 ). However, the plaque must be removed thoroughly and regularly to achieve this effect. This health‐related behaviour requires an individual to have the relevant capabilities, opportunities, and motivation to perform the necessary routines ( Broadbent 2011 ; Stewart 1996 ; Watt 2005 ). For people with an ID, understanding the importance of removing dental plaque and developing the skills to do so requires more effort, and achieving the standard of oral hygiene necessary for good oral health may require the support of others ( Crowley 2005 ).\n\n【11】When considering the issues possibly influencing oral hygiene practices for the population with ID, it is important first to have a clear definition of ID; second to consider the specific barriers to regular oral hygiene practices that might exist for people with ID; and third to consider facilitators to promoting regular oral hygiene practices that might exist for people with ID.\n\n【12】#### Definition of intellectual disability\n\n【13】The current definition of disability comes from the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), which incorporates the complex interactions between health conditions, environmental factors, and personal factors. Regarding a person with an ID, this definition would consider how their personal factors, health condition, and environment affect their lives ( WHO 2001 ). Three elements are common for people with ID: a significant impairment of intelligence; a resultant significant reduction in adaptive behaviour/social functioning; and the development of the condition before the age of 18, which persists throughout life ( Schalock 2010 ).\n\n【14】The WHO has also developed an operational definition of ID, which focuses mostly on the functional elements of ID, in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th version (ICD‐10) ( WHO 2011 ). The ICF definition of disability is designed to complement the ICD‐10 definition.\n\n【15】The ICD‐10 describes the four levels of ID as follows:\n\n| Mild intellectual disability (ICD‐10 F70): IQ range 50 to 69  | “Ability to use speech in everyday situations; usually full independence in self care; Difficulties in identification of this population arise, as those with borderline disability may not be in contact with service providers.”  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moderate intellectual disability (ICD‐10 F71): IQ between 35 and 49  | “Slow in comprehension; supervision of self care, retarded motor skills.”  |\n| Severe intellectual disability (ICD‐10 F72): IQ between 20 and 34  | “Marked impairment of motor skills; clinically significant damage to Central Nervous System (CNS).”  |\n| Profound intellectual disability (ICD‐10 F73): IQ less than 20  | “Severely limited understanding; Immobility or restricted mobility; Incontinence; requires constant supervision; usually organic aetiology.”  |\n\n【17】We acknowledge that other terms and definitions have been used to describe people with ID, both historically and currently. Whilst we acknowledge that the ICF is currently accepted as the most holistic definition of disability, it is unlikely to be used in the studies that are potentially eligible for this review. We therefore plan to use the ICD‐10 definition as the reference to determine the inclusion or exclusion of studies, as it provides a detailed nomenclature of diseases ( Kurbasic 2008 ).\n\n【18】#### Barriers to oral hygiene practice for people with ID\n\n【19】Capability, opportunity, and motivation are required to achieve adequate oral hygiene. Oral hygiene tasks are more difficult for people with ID; they may lack the manual dexterity or cognitive skills to carry out or understand the need for effective oral hygiene ( Anders 2010 ; Löe 2000 ). There may be other commonly associated conditions such as sensory impairment, anxiety, or chronic medical or behavioural conditions that militate against carrying out oral hygiene effectively ( Gordon 1998 ; Minihan 2014 ; Prangnell 2008 ). In a 2003 Irish study, carers of people with ID identified some of the physical barriers caused by the disability such as an inability to rinse, difficulty getting a toothbrush into someone's mouth, an oversensitive mouth, and a tendency to gag ( Taylor‐Dillon 2003 ). Nearly 10% of people with ID have dysphagia, which is associated with increased tendency to choke or gag during toothbrushing ( Chadwick 2009 ).\n\n【20】People with ID have been shown to have chronic, poor oral hygiene and to require more support with their oral hygiene. Carers for people with ID are often poorly trained ( Crowley 2005 ). Oral hygiene is not seen as a priority for overstretched carers, particularly if it is not a personal priority ( Kaye 2005 ; Rawlinson 2001 ). Lack of co‐operation and challenging behaviour on the part of the person with ID may add to this burden.\n\n【21】#### Facilitators for oral hygiene practice for people with ID\n\n【22】Behaviour management techniques may improve the co‐operation of individuals with ID when performing oral hygiene. Education may change carers’ attitudes and improve their skills ( Faulks 2000 ; Mac Giolla Phadraig 2013 ). Management support and guidance, stakeholder engagement, policy documents, and increased resources may improve levels of oral hygiene provision in community and institutionalised settings ( Glassman 2003 ; Glassman 2006 ; Glassman 2009 ). Specially designed or adapted oral hygiene aids may improve the oral hygiene skills of people with ID or their carers ( Dougall 2008 ).\n\n【23】### Description of the intervention\n\n【24】The interventions to be evaluated in this Cochrane Review will focus on two distinct groups: people with an ID, and the carers supporting, assisting, or providing oral hygiene care for them. The range of carers involved is likely to be diverse, that is formal and non‐formal personal carers with and without relevant training, with and without dental qualifications, and with and without psychology or related qualifications.\n\n【25】We will define oral hygiene in this review as the mechanical removal of plaque with either manual or electric toothbrushes, interdental aids, or other mechanical aids. Interventions designed to impact on levels of oral hygiene tend to group outcomes into clinical outcomes such as reductions in plaque levels, periodontal diseases, or dental caries, and psychological outcomes such as changes in comprehension, self efficacy, or motivation ( Cooper 2013 ; Cooper 2014 ). This review will include interventions that measure clinical and behavioural/psychological outcomes, or both. We will consider any intervention that may impact on the duration, frequency, and/or effectiveness of oral hygiene practices.\n\n【26】### How the intervention might work\n\n【27】Behavioural change models have been shown to relate to oral hygiene behaviour and to be effective when used in interventions for people with ID ( Renz 2007 ; Willems 2017 ). In a systematic review, Newton 2015 looked at using the constructs of changing behaviour rather than the models themselves and found this to be a more reliable way of predicting behavioural change. Michie 2013 has identified a taxonomy of 93 behavioural change techniques (BCTs) that provides a standardisation of the terminology used. In order to make the taxonomy of BCTs more accessible for clinicians, the BCTs can be grouped into 16 labeled clusters ( Cane 2015 ; Michie 2011 ; Michie 2013 ). These labels provide a means to identifying the elements in an intervention that are likely to improve adherence and make routines easier to establish in relation to oral hygiene, even if they are not formally identified as BCTs. To further assist the analysis of interventions, Michie 2011 developed the Behavioural Change Wheel, which characterises the elements at three levels: a “behaviour system” at the hub, encircled by intervention functions, and then by policy categories.\n\n【28】We will consider interventions under the “behaviour system” elements of **C** apability (which includes knowledge and skills), **O** pportunity, and **M** otivation, as outlined by Michie as the COM‐B framework for understanding behaviour and behavioural change ( Michie 2011 ).\n\n【29】Capability‐based interventions, defined as the psychological and physical capacity to engage in the activity concerned, might be a knowledge‐based intervention in relation to the comprehension and reasoning around why oral hygiene is required or a skills‐based intervention that trains a person with ID in the physical skills of toothbrushing or that trains carers in how to brush the teeth of a person with ID.\n\n【30】Opportunity‐based interventions, which include both physical and social opportunities, should consider the elements beyond the individual, that is contexts such as the variety of settings in which the intervention is delivered or undertaken, for example home, school, dental clinic, day care, or residential care setting, or the influences of the families or carers' attitudes regarding oral hygiene practices.\n\n【31】Motivation‐based interventions, which include both automatic and reflective processes, might result in conscious decision‐making where a goal or reward is identified to instigate or perpetuate a daily oral hygiene routine.\n\n【32】An intervention may change one or more of these elements resulting in the desired behaviour of performing regular oral hygiene.\n\n【33】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【34】The difficulties of providing dental care for those with disabilities have been acknowledged ( Al Kindi 2016 ). Access to care is known to be more difficult; resources are stretched for parents, carers, and healthcare professionals ( Dougall 2008 ; Kaye 2005 ; Prabhu 2010 ; Sagheri 2013 ). The consequences of oral diseases for people with ID are more profound. Interventions designed to suit people with disabilities must show benefit ( WHO 2011 ). Whilst an increasing number of good‐quality systematic reviews of oral health interventions for the general population have been produced ( Agnihotry 2016 ), Cochrane has not specifically reviewed the effectiveness of oral health interventions for people with disabilities ( Cochrane 2016 ).\n\n【35】A recent scoping review of interventions aimed at the wider disability population has identified those with ID as being the most common target subpopulation ( Waldron 2016 ). Oral hygiene status is one of the most common targets of oral health intervention for those with disabilities. Our systematic review of oral hygiene interventions for people with ID will allow us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these types of interventions. Furthermore, the review may increase dental professionals' understanding of behavioural change principles, inform the training of the dental team, and have an impact on the design and implementation of future oral health interventions for this population.\n\n【36】Cochrane Oral Health undertook an extensive prioritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were the most clinically important ones to maintain on the Cochrane Library ( Worthington 2015 ). This exercise identified prevention and maintenance as priorities, which included oral hygiene adherence and caries prevention. Whilst not specifically identifying people with disabilities, the exercise also prioritised oral health promotion, specifically in institutionalised settings ( Worthington 2015 ).\n\n【37】Objectives\n----------\n\n【38】To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral hygiene interventions for people with intellectual disabilities (ID).\n\n【39】Methods\n-------\n\n【40】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【41】#### Types of studies\n\n【42】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs, evaluating interventions targeted at groups such as parents, carers, and other healthcare professionals caring for people with ID.\n\n【43】As the number of RCTs is likely to be low, we will include some types of non‐randomised studies (NRS); however, we will report RCTs and NRS separately. The types of NRS eligible for this review will include: non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies, and repeated measures studies.\n\n【44】We will apply no language restrictions.\n\n【45】#### Types of participants\n\n【46】People with an ID, living either at home, in day care, in hospital, or in a residential care setting. We will consider all intellectual disabilities as defined by the ICD‐10.\n\n【47】#### Types of interventions\n\n【48】We will consider all oral hygiene interventions, which may include but are not limited to the following components.\n\n【49】1.  Oral hygiene‐related knowledge‐based interventions for participants or their carers, e.g. education in the care of the teeth and gums, diseases of the teeth and gums, and prevention of diseases of the teeth and gums.\n    \n2.  Oral hygiene‐related behavioural interventions for participants or their carers that result in a behavioural change that can be observed and is replicable, e.g. goal setting or positive reinforcement.\n    \n3.  Oral hygiene‐related skills training for participants, e.g. interventions related to toothbrushing skills or other oral hygiene routines.\n    \n4.  Oral hygiene‐related skills training for carers, e.g. interventions related to assessing toothbrushing skills or assisting participants with toothbrushing or other oral hygiene routines, or providing oral hygiene care to participants.\n    \n\n【50】To be eligible, controlled studies must include a comparison with at least one of the following: usual care, no care, or a similar alternative intervention. Examples of studies comparing similar alternative interventions might be a study comparing education provided in different formats, for example, face to face versus an information leaflet, or a study comparing oral hygiene care provided after a training session versus oral hygiene care provided without training.\n\n【51】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【52】Outcome measures will include both behavioural and clinical measures.\n\n【53】We will base the behavioural outcomes measured on the Capabilities, Opportunities, and Motivation elements of COM‐B method and include indicators such as improved toothbrushing skills, changes in knowledge of participants and carers with regard to oral health, and increased episodes and duration of toothbrushing. We will accept any reasonable instrument used in the included studies such as questionnaires, interviews, observational outcomes, video recordings, diaries, self reported outcomes, or observational measures such as measuring toothpaste weight to check adherence with toothbrushing.\n\n【54】The clinical outcomes measured will include indicators such as the prevalence/incidence of dental plaque, prevalence/incidence of periodontitis (gum disease), and prevalence/incidence of dental caries. We will use only published or validated assessments of the clinical outcomes or those using a measure that can be compared to one of these measurements. For example, dental plaque may be measured using the Plaque Index, in Silness 1964 , or Quigley and Hein's Plaque Index as modified by Turesky and colleagues ( Turesky 1970 ). Gingivitis may be measured using an index such as the Gingival Index, in Löe 1963 and Löe 1967 , or the Modified Gingival Index ( Lobene 1986 ). Dental caries may be measured using the Decayed, Missing or Filled Teeth/Surface Index (dmft/s; DMFT/s) ( Petersen 2013 ).\n\n【55】We will consider all time frames for the delivery and follow‐up of the intervention. The follow‐up time frames may be grouped for analysis into short, medium, and long term, based on the outcomes being measured. A systematic review of the effects of oral hygiene on chronic periodontitis in the general population excluded studies lasting less than nine months, in order to differentiate between gingivitis and periodontitis. Of the three RCTs included in that review, all were followed up for over three years ( Hujoel 2005 ). Mombelli 1998 reflected on the limitations of longitudinal studies of periodontal disease when considering the issues of measurement error in periodontal probing and the impact of concepts such as bursts of disease activity versus a continuous disease process in relation to the progression of periodontal disease. Mombelli 1998 concluded that studies of 20 years or more in length would be required to achieve sufficient confidence in the results ( Mombelli 1998 ). A recent systematic review on the effects of toothbrushing frequency on the prevention of dental caries showed that the eligible interventions were all followed up for between 11 months and 15 years ( Kumar 2016 ). The following division of time frames for this current review was guided by a review of the literature on the effects of oral hygiene practices on oral health.\n\n【56】*   Short‐term follow‐up (< 6 weeks) may allow for some clinically visible signs of early changes in gingival health to become apparent, permitting the impact of possible differences in the microbial load, immune responses, and environmental factors in this population group to manifest in clinically observable signs ( Garmyn 1998 ). It may also be useful to observe the clinical changes resulting from an intervention without confounding the result with other variables, e.g. the effect of oral hygiene following skills training without the variable of adherence to oral hygiene practices over time ( Egelberg 1994 ). The early, clinically visible signs would include changes in plaque prevalence/incidence and changes in gingival bleeding or inflammation ( Löe 1965 ).\n    \n*   Medium‐term follow‐up (6 weeks to 12 months) may allow for some additional signs of changes in the gingival health to be recorded compared to the baseline status, depending on the success of the intervention, such as gingival pocket probing depths, as well as consistent changes in knowledge and behaviour.\n    \n*   Long‐term follow‐up (> 12 months) would allow some for assessment of those measures that require a longer time frame to show change, such as dental caries prevalence/incidence or clinical attachment loss or bone loss in relation to gingival disease, as well as continued follow‐up on all other measurements. Long‐term studies would also allow for follow‐up on any short‐ or medium‐term success regarding changes in oral hygiene behaviour that is crucial to maintaining oral health ( Schou 1998 ). It must be accepted that any findings from these long‐term interventions will be confounded by factors outside the study setting.\n    \n\n【57】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【58】1.  Gingival health of people with an ID.\n    \n\n【59】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【60】1.  Oral hygiene skills acquisition by people with an ID, or the acquisition of skills by their carers in providing or supporting oral hygiene care.\n    \n2.  Oral hygiene knowledge acquisition by people with an ID or the acquisition of knowledge by their carers with regard to oral hygiene.\n    \n3.  Adherence to oral hygiene routines by people with an ID or their carers.\n    \n4.  Quality of life changes or long‐term, patient‐centred outcomes for people with an ID (e.g. tooth retention).\n    \n5.  Dental caries levels of people with an ID.\n    \n6.  Any unintended (positive or negative) effects of the interventions.\n    \n\n【61】Outcome measures relating to clinical outcome must be published or validated or comparable to measurements such as dental plaque levels (i.e. Plaque Score), gingival health (i.e. Gingival Index), or dental caries prevalence/incidence (i.e. DMFT/S). Behavioural outcome assessments with regard to changes in capability, opportunity, or motivation of the patient or carer for oral hygiene practices will include any reasonable instrument used in the included studies (i.e. questionnaires or interviews).\n\n【62】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【63】Cochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist will conduct systematic searches for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. Because of the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials on the database and add them to the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), we will search only recent months of the Embase database. Please see the searching page on the Cochrane Oral Health website for more information. We will place no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.\n\n【64】#### Electronic searches\n\n【65】We will search the following electronic databases:\n\n【66】*   Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register;\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library;\n    \n*   MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 onwards);\n    \n*   Embase Ovid (previous six months to date);\n    \n*   PsycINFO Ovid (from 1806 onwards).\n    \n\n【67】We will model the subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for MEDLINE Ovid, shown in Appendix 1 .\n\n【68】#### Searching other resources\n\n【69】We will search the following trials registries:\n\n【70】*   US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov/ );\n    \n*   World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( apps.who.int/trialsearch ).\n    \n\n【71】We will also handsearch the specialist conference abstracts from the International Association of Disability and Oral Health (2000 to 2016).\n\n【72】We will check the bibliographies of included studies and any relevant systematic reviews identified for further references to relevant trials ( Horsley 2011 ).\n\n【73】We will consider any unpublished studies discovered using the search methods described above if they meet the inclusion criteria for this review.\n\n【74】We will consider adverse effects described in included studies only.\n\n【75】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【76】#### Selection of studies\n\n【77】Five review authors will independently examine studies identified by the searches and ensure that each study is examined by at least two review authors, firstly by the titles and abstracts and then by obtaining and reading the full text if the study is considered potentially relevant. We will use specific inclusion criteria in our decision‐making including the participants and interventions as outlined below. A sixth review author will be the arbiter.\n\n【78】Inclusion criteria:\n\n【79】*   Participants must have an intellectual disability as defined by the ICD‐10, or be a carer of a person with an intellectual disability.\n    \n*   The intervention must relate to oral hygiene.\n    \n*   Complex interventions with an oral hygiene element will be considered if the outcome from the oral hygiene component can be appraised separately.\n    \n\n【80】Details such as keywords, authors, publication, and institutions will be available to the review authors. Any disagreements will be discussed by the review authors and an arbiter. We will record justifications for all decisions. If we identify multiple reports of the same study, we will link these together in so far that this is possible. We will contact study authors to clarify details regarding eligibility where necessary. We will attempt to identify all relevant studies irrespective of language. Relevant non‐English language papers will be translated. Any studies identified by the searches, involving any of the review authors, will be examined by other review authors.\n\n【81】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【82】Two review authors will independently extract data using a standardised data collection sheet and enter the data into Review Manager 5 software ( RevMan 2014 ). We will extract data under the following headings: profile of the participants, number of participants, settings, details of interventions including details of the carers and/or personnel delivering or supporting the intervention and any behavioural change techniques identified within the interventions, outcomes measured, duration of intervention and follow‐up, and study design.\n\n【83】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【84】Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias for each study, discussing any disagreements with the arbiter. We will record justifications for decisions. To avoid any conflict of interest, we will exclude team members who are authors of included studies from the 'Risk of bias' assessment of those studies, and alternative review authors will undertake this assessment.\n\n【85】We will consider bias for RCTs for the following domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias, as per the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ). We will consider bias for cluster‐RCTs under the two different units of measurement, the cluster and the participant, if provided and under for the same domains as the RCTs ( Campbell 2012 ).\n\n【86】We will consider bias for non‐randomised controlled trials using the Risk Of Bias In Non‐randomised Studies ‐ of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) assessment tool, which has similar but slightly broader domains and ratings than the 'Risk of bias' tool for RCTs or the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria for assessing risk of bias ( EPOC 2016 ; Sterne 2016 ). We will rate each study as either high risk, low risk, or unclear risk of bias for the separate domains. We will report objective and subjective outcomes separately. We will complete a 'Risk of bias' table for each included study and will also present results graphically.\n\n【87】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【88】For continuous data, we will use the mean difference (MD) when the same scale is used or standardised mean difference (SMD) if more than one scale is used to measure the same outcome, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). An example of likely continuous data is plaque levels as measured by plaque indices between the baseline and all other measured time frames, and between the control and intervention groups if a control was used. Another example is a self efficacy scale for carers measured before and after an intervention. We will use the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% CI for dichotomous data, for example toothbrushing undertaken or not, before or after the intervention.\n\n【89】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【90】We will consider the unit of analysis with regard to whether the intervention was targeted at an individual or at a group level, if there was more than one element to the intervention, or if there were different time points measured in the intervention. Where possible, we will adjust for clustering if participants were allocated to the same intervention in groups (e.g. family members or care homes) for example in cluster‐RCTs. To account for the effect of clustering, we will estimate inflated standard errors (SEs)( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【91】With regard to RCTs and other comparative studies, we will consider adjustments to avoid multiple use of participants in multi‐arm studies. If multiple arms are to be included in the meta‐analysis in such a way that one intervention arm is to be included in more than one treatment comparison, we will divide the number of participants (in that arm) and the number of events by the total number of treatment comparisons. This approach retains original information but reduces the precision of the pooled estimates.\n\n【92】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【93】We will make all reasonable efforts to contact authors for details and reasons for any missing outcome data ( Young 2011 ). If data are missing and no information is available in the paper or is not obtainable by contacting the authors, we will assume for dichotomous data that drop out was due to the intervention being unsuccessful. We will perform sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of these assumptions, for example missing data for intervention studies can be dealt with by using intention‐to‐treat numbers. For continuous data, we may use this information if we are able to calculate the data from other data provided, for example, calculating SD from SE and P value ( Higgins 2011b ). We will reflect on the overall effect of missing data in the final discussion.\n\n【94】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【95】We will assess levels of statistical heterogeneity by observing the confidence interval within studies and to a lesser extent, statistically by use of the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test to determine whether observed differences in results are compatible with chance alone. Interpretation of the Chi <sup>2 </sup> will take into consideration the sample size and number of studies included in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【96】We will quantify heterogeneity with the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, using the following guide. Some level of heterogeneity is expected ( Higgins 2011a ).\n\n【97】*   0% to 40%: might not be important\n    \n*   30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity\n    \n*   50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity\n    \n*   75% to 100%: very substantial (\"considerable\") heterogeneity.\n    \n\n【98】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【99】Thorough searching of multiple databases should limit general reporting biases. We will keep reporting biases due to such things as time lag bias, Hopewell 2007 , selective outcome reporting, Dwan 2014 , and publication bias, Hopewell 2009 , to a minimum by inclusion of prospective trial registers; if we identify at least 10 studies, we will use funnel plots to explore publication bias and other biases related to study size. We will contact authors for results of outcomes included in their study objectives but not reported.\n\n【100】#### Data synthesis\n\n【101】We will only undertake meta‐analyses when studies are sufficiently homogeneous in their participants, interventions, and outcomes. We will combine RRs for dichotomous data, and MDs or SMDs for continuous data, using random‐effects models if at least four studies are included in a meta‐analysis. We will use fixed‐effect models if there are fewer than four studies and if heterogeneity is reasonably low.\n\n【102】Where we do not undertake meta‐analysis, we will present a narrative synthesis.\n\n【103】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【104】We may consider subgroup analysis for topics such as the following if sufficient data are available, but will do so cautiously if the amount of data is small ( Bender 2008 ).\n\n【105】*   Level of intellectual disability\n    \n*   With versus without support of dental professionals\n    \n*   Non‐formal carers (i.e. parents or siblings) versus formal carers\n    \n*   Setting of the intervention (i.e. home‐based versus residential/institutional/school‐based interventions)\n    \n*   Behavioural change technique used based on the COM‐B method\n    \n*   Short‐term interventions versus long‐term interventions\n    \n\n【106】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【107】Providing there are sufficient included studies, we will undertake sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias.\n\n【108】##### Summarising findings and assessing the quality of the evidence\n\n【109】We will create one or more 'Summary of findings' tables to show the effects of different interventions on different outcome measures, using GRADEpro software ( Schünemann 2013 ). We will supplement this with information on participant and study characteristics where appropriate. We will assess the quality of the body of evidence with regard to the overall risk of bias of the included studies, directness of the evidence, consistency of the results, precision of the estimates, and risk of reporting bias. We will categorise the quality of the body of evidence for each of the main outcomes for each comparison as high, moderate, low, or very low.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Administering the appropriate analgesia to children is a complex process and it is unclear whether children's postoperative pain is more successfully treated by using 'as required' (when pain occurs) (termed ' _pro re nata_ ' or PRN) or fixed scheduled 'around the clock' (ATC) analgesic administration (irrespective of pain at the time of administration).\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To assess the efficacy of as required versus fixed schedule analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】On 2 July 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. We reviewed the bibliographies of all included studies and of reviews, and searched two clinical trial databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to identify additional published or unpublished data.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years who had undergone any surgical procedure requiring postoperative pain relief, in any setting.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】Two review authors (AH, PW) independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias as recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions._\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included three RCTs (four reports) of 246 children aged under 16 years undergoing tonsillectomy. Children were given weight‐appropriate doses of the study medication, either PRN or ATC, by a parent or carer at home for up to four days following surgery. We did not identify any studies assessing the management of postoperative pain in children in any other setting (i.e. as an inpatient). All studies included in this review were based on the use of paracetamol, and an opioid was added to paracetamol in two studies. Analgesics were administered either orally (tablet or elixir) or rectally (suppository). Reporting quality was poor and there were fewer than 50 children in each arm. Mean pain intensity scores decreased over time, as did medication use. However, children were still reporting pain at the final assessment, suggesting that no administration schedule provided adequate analgesia. There were no significant differences in pain intensity scores at any time point. The studies reported adverse events that may have been related to the study medication, such as nausea and vomiting, and constipation, but no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups. There were too few data from only three small studies and meta‐analysis was not possible. One study reported that a higher amount of analgesics was consumed in the ATC group compared with the PRN group: it would have been helpful to show that the higher volume in the ATC group led to better analgesia but we were not able to demonstrate this.\n\n【15】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【16】There was limited evidence available to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children.\n\n【17】PICOs\n-----\n\n【18】### PICOs\n\n【19】###### Population (6)\n\n【20】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Postoperative Pain\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【21】###### Intervention (3)\n\n【22】*   Analgesics\n*   Fixed schedule\n*   Pro re nata\n\n【23】###### Comparison (3)\n\n【24】*   Analgesics\n*   Fixed schedule\n*   Pro re nata\n\n【25】###### Outcome (3)\n\n【26】*   Adverse Event\n*   Pain Relief\n*   Pain Intensity\n\n【27】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Children tend to rely on a parent or carer to give medication to help relieve the pain. Medication can either be given when the child complains of pain (as required), or 'around the clock' (fixed schedule, e.g. every four hours).\n\n【34】In July 2014, we found three studies (randomised controlled trials) of 246 children under the age of 16 years. All studies compared the two ways of giving medicine for pain relief after tonsillectomy (an operation to remove the tonsils). The studies were small, and generally of low quality.\n\n【35】One study showed that the children in the 'around the clock' group took more medication, but they did not have better pain relief. There were no differences in pain relief or side effects between the two groups. There was not enough evidence to be sure which method is better for a child's pain relief after surgery. More high quality, large studies are needed.\n\n【36】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【37】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【38】### Implications for practice\n\n【39】1.  For children under the age of 16 years with postoperative pain, we could not determine whether the 'around the clock' method was any different from the 'as required' method, for outpatients given oral or rectal analgesics.\n    \n2.  For clinicians, at present there is insufficient evidence to recommend one approach over another. Around the clock would appear to be a logical approach based on adult studies but we have not been able to demonstrate superiority.\n    \n3.  For policy‐makers and funders, there can be no implications for policy‐makers making recommendations on the management of postoperative pain based on this review.\n    \n\n【40】### Implications for research\n\n【41】1.  General: there is an urgent need for the adoption of a sensible pain assessment outcome for use by children that can be used both in clinical trials and in clinical practice. The outcome of mild or no pain has been suggested as being a target important to (adult) patients. It has the advantage of being useful as a dichotomous outcome to determine efficacy. Failure to attain the outcome is a marker of poor treatment.\n    \n2.  Design: there is a need for randomised controlled trials of large size, and using robust methods and reporting useful outcomes. These should use analgesic efficacy with known endpoints, and take into account concerns about safety and serious adverse events such as postoperative bleeding.\n    \n3.  Measurement (endpoints): we recommend that future studies aim to measure patient self report of pain relief or pain intensity, or both, using validated scales appropriate for use in children, ideally as a primary outcome. Parent‐reported pain (such as the Parents' Post‐operative Pain Measure (PPPM)) could also be a helpful secondary outcome, particularly in younger children as parents may have a better sense of their child's state than the child is able to report. Observer‐reported pain scores could be a primary outcome measure if self report is not available. Investigators in future studies could also consider measuring the timing of pain ratings, whether pain is provoked or not, and the location and the spread of pain.\n    \n4.  It is recommended that funding bodies work on three levels. First to generate agreement, based on evidence, of outcomes to be used in clinical trials of pain in children. Second, to generate agreement, based on evidence, of interventions that should be both effective and safe, and with protocols concerning how they may be used. Third, based on this, to commission several large studies in a number of different painful surgical interventions in children of various ages.\n    \n\n【42】Background\n----------\n\n【43】### Description of the condition\n\n【44】Acute pain occurs as a result of tissue damage either accidentally due to an injury or as a result of surgery. Acute postoperative pain is a manifestation of inflammation due to tissue injury or nerve injury, or both. The management of postoperative pain and inflammation is a critical component of patient care ( Derry 2013 ), and if treated inadequately can significantly affect recovery ( Apfelbaum 2003 ).\n\n【45】The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's pain acknowledge that pain in children is a public health concern of major significance in most parts of the world ( WHO 2012 ). These guidelines state that the principle for treating pain at regular intervals is to administer analgesics 'around the clock' (ATC) rather than on an 'as required' (termed ' _pro re nata_ ' or PRN) basis. It has also been suggested that ATC dosing should be used when pain itself is continuous or present for 12 hours or more each day, since postoperative pain will most likely be continuous for at least 24 hours following surgery ( Pasero 2010 ). However, there is a need to understand the risks and benefits of time‐contingent (ATC) dosing because of fears of over‐medication or unwanted adverse effects ( Sutters 2005 ). It is unclear whether PRN or ATC analgesic administration is more successful at preventing or reducing postoperative pain in children.\n\n【46】A report for the Department of Health (DoH) in the UK stated that approximately half a million children and young people undergo anaesthesia and surgery each year in England and Wales ( Cochrane 2007 ). In the US, tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years ( Baugh 2011 ). In the early 1980s, a survey on the incidence of postoperative pain in children showed that on the first postoperative day, 17% reported severe pain ( Mather 1983 ). More recent evaluations of the prevalence of acute pain in hospitalised children have shown that children on surgical units, for example, reported higher rates of moderate to severe pain (44%) than children on medical units (13%) ( McGrath 2013 ). Another survey of 290 medical and surgical inpatients in Canada concluded that pain was infrequently assessed, yet occurred commonly across all age groups and services, and was often moderate or severe; analgesic therapy was largely single‐agent and intermittent ( Taylor 2008 ). A range of postoperative analgesic techniques have been developed to recognise, minimise, and control pain in children ( Lönnqvist 2005 ). However, it is still reported that children remain under‐treated and that more research in this area is needed ( Lee 2014 ; Schechter 2003 ).\n\n【47】### Description of the intervention\n\n【48】Self report is the primary source of information for measuring pain intensity in children ( McGrath 2013 ), and analgesic doses can be adjusted in response to reports of intensity ( von Baeyer 2009 ).\n\n【49】Cognitive developmental factors can impact children's understanding of pain and their ability to describe it effectively, and a good measure \"should accurately reflect the individual's subjective experience\" ( Schechter 2003 ). Age‐appropriate measurement tools are used to assess a child's self report, and can assist the person administering the analgesics in selecting and evaluating treatments. The numerical rating scale (NRS) and the visual analogue scale (VAS) are validated measurement scales commonly used by children over the age of eight years, whereas the Faces Pain Scale ‐ Revised (FPS‐R) or the Poker Chip Tool (PCT) may be implemented for much younger children. NRS and VAS require the individual to be able to estimate quantities along a numerical or spatial dimension, hence are more appropriate for older children ( von Baeyer 2013 ).\n\n【50】Administering appropriate analgesia to paediatric patients is a complex process and multiple strategies may be required ( Smyth 2011 ). Participation of the parents and carers, or proxy measures (e.g. observational, behavioural or physiological), may be utilised in order to manage children's postoperative pain ( APA 2012 ; Lee 2014 ; Lönnqvist 2005 ). Behavioural measures may be helpful when the child is sedated, in distress, or believed to be under‐reporting their pain ( MacLaren Chorney 2013 ). Physiological biomarkers of pain, such as cortisol levels or heart rate, may also be utilised, but the process of identifying and measuring biomarkers for such a diverse and subjective experience as pain is still under development and may be neither possible or practical ( Brummelte 2013 ).\n\n【51】PRN analgesic administration can be used to manage children's postoperative pain. It provides flexible dosing that can be adapted to the needs of an individual ( Gordon 2008 ). Self administration is not always possible, especially in very young children, and the patient may need to signal to the person administering the analgesic (e.g. a parent or nurse) to indicate that they are in pain and require another dose.\n\n【52】ATC analgesia is also used to manage children's postoperative pain, and this can provide continuous relief by preventing the pain from recurring ( Chiaretti 2013 ). The website for the Great Ormond Street Hospital in the UK describes planned pain relief for children after surgery, indicating that the effects of analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, or oral morphine last for four to six hours ( GOSH 2014 ). For most people receiving scheduled analgesia for postoperative pain, a supplemental dose is also offered on a PRN basis, although the route of administration and time to peak effect will dictate how often the rescue dose can be offered ( Chiaretti 2013 ). Clinical concerns for the people administering analgesics can include whether to wake children up in order to maintain ATC dosing, and whether the child's self report makes sense and can be accurately interpreted.\n\n【53】Regardless of the means of administering pain relief, it is acknowledged that good communication between the child, the parents and carers, and the healthcare team is vital in helping to manage a child's postoperative pain ( APA 2012 ).\n\n【54】This review compared PRN analgesia and scheduled analgesic administration for postoperative pain as two distinct intervention arms.\n\n【55】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【56】This review was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK in response to a National Health Service (NHS) 'decision problem' regarding outpatient management of postoperative pain in children. This topic was identified in September 2013 during consultation with the NIHR. This review aimed to assess the comparative benefits of PRN analgesia and scheduled analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children who have recently undergone surgery, in both inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【57】The NIHR commission stated: \"Guidelines on postoperative management of paediatric pain recommend time‐contingent analgesic dosing to reduce or prevent pain before it begins. Potential benefits of this approach include the maintenance of therapeutic levels of opioids, the facilitation of routine postoperative activities (e.g., oral intake, activity, sleep), and the avoidance of delays in analgesic administration because of inaccurate parental assessment of children's pain behaviours. However, many clinicians and parents fear that regularly scheduled administration of analgesics may result in the administration of unnecessary and/or excessive amounts of analgesics, which may cause undesirable and potentially harmful adverse effects. As a result, children are often not given enough pain control in the post‐operative period. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the current evidence to determine the benefits and/or harms of regular dosing of analgesics versus 'when needed' following surgery in children.\"\n\n【58】This review assessed analgesic administration for children, and has been directly commissioned for completion by March 2015.\n\n【59】Objectives\n----------\n\n【60】To assess the efficacy of as required versus fixed schedule analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain in children under the age of 16 years.\n\n【61】Methods\n-------\n\n【62】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【63】#### Types of studies\n\n【64】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing participant outcomes based on validated age‐appropriate pain scales.\n\n【65】#### Types of participants\n\n【66】Children under the age of 16 years, who had undergone any surgical procedure requiring postoperative pain relief, in any setting.\n\n【67】#### Types of interventions\n\n【68】Interventions of interest included:\n\n【69】1.  the use of as required or ' _pro re nata_ ' (PRN) analgesia administered by any route, in any dosage, and prescribed to treat pain postoperatively;\n    \n2.  fixed analgesic administration schedules for postoperative pain management.\n    \n\n【70】We did not plan to include studies of patient‐controlled analgesia as these are not 'PRN' in the true sense of the term and this topic will be considered for a separate review.\n\n【71】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【72】We planned to include a 'Summary of findings' table as set out in the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Review Group's author guide ( AUREF 2011 ), and recommended in Chapter 4 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【73】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【74】1.  Pain intensity and pain relief, assessed using validated tools such as NRS, VAS, FPS‐R, Colour Analogue Scale (CAS), or any other validated NRS. We searched for participant‐reported pain, but accepted observer‐reported outcomes if no data were available for participant‐reported pain.\n    \n2.  Any reported adverse events.\n    \n\n【75】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【76】We identified the following outcomes with reference to the PedIMMPACT (Pediatric Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) recommendations, which suggest core outcome domains and measures for consideration in paediatric acute and chronic/recurrent pain clinical trials ( PedIMMPACT 2008 ).\n\n【77】1.  Participant global impression, measured using the Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale ( Hurst 2004 ).\n    \n2.  Carer global impression; see point 1 above.\n    \n3.  Medication use.\n    \n4.  Requirement for rescue analgesia.\n    \n5.  Length of postoperative stay.\n    \n6.  Sleep duration and quality.\n    \n7.  Acceptability of treatment.\n    \n\n【78】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【79】#### Electronic searches\n\n【80】We searched the following electronic databases:\n\n【81】1.  the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; on _The Cochrane Library_ ) Issue 6 of 12, 2014;\n    \n2.  MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process 1946 to 29 July 2014;\n    \n3.  EMBASE 1947 to 29 July 2014;\n    \n4.  CINAHL 1982 to July 2014.\n    \n\n【82】We used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) or equivalent and text word terms. There were no language restrictions. We tailored searches to individual databases. Appendix 1 shows the search strategies.\n\n【83】#### Searching other resources\n\n【84】We searched ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( apps.who.int/trialsearch/ ) for ongoing trials, on 1 December 2014. We planned to search the _meta_ Register of Controlled Trials ( _m_ RCT) ( www.controlled-trials.com/mrct ), but the website was unavailable. In addition, we checked reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for additional studies and performed citation searches on key articles.\n\n【85】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【86】#### Selection of studies\n\n【87】Two review authors (AH, PW) independently assessed the abstract of each study identified by the search. We eliminated studies that clearly did not satisfy the inclusion criteria. Disagreements would have been resolved by discussion with the third review author if necessary (JC). We documented the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flowchart ( Liberati 2009 ) ( Figure 1 ), and Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies tables.\n\n【88】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【89】Figure 1\n\n【90】* * *\n\n【91】* * *\n\n【92】Study flow diagram.\n\n【93】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【94】We obtained full copies of 11 studies and assessed them against the inclusion criteria. We extracted data on study design, participants, interventions, reported postoperative pain intensity and pain relief, adverse events, participant and carer global impressions, medication use, requirement for rescue analgesia, length of hospital stay, sleep duration and quality, and acceptability of treatment. We used a template data extraction form and checked for agreement before entry into The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical software Review Manager 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【95】We included three RCTs. Rømsing 1998 had two study arms, where the study group received analgesics ATC and the control group received them PRN. The other two included studies had three arms, of PRN or ATC with or without nurse coaching ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ). We did not utilise the data from the ATC with nurse coaching group. We only included intervention groups and control groups that met the eligibility criteria.\n\n【96】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【97】Two review authors (AH, PW) independently assessed risk of bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ), and adapted from those used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.\n\n【98】We assessed the following for each study.\n\n【99】1.  Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (i.e. any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); or unclear risk of bias (when the method used to generate the sequence was not clearly stated). We excluded studies at high risk of bias that used a non‐random process (e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); or unclear risk of bias (when the method was not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation and therefore were at a high risk of bias (e.g. open list).\n    \n3.  Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). For this review, it was unlikely that these studies would be blinded to the investigators or participants. We assessed any methods used to blind the outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a child received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (e.g. study stated that it was single‐blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding of the outcome assessor); unclear risk of bias (study stated that outcome assessors were blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved); or high risk of bias (outcome assessors were not blinded). We excluded studies at a high risk of bias that were not single‐blind.\n    \n4.  Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data). We assessed the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk of bias (i.e. less than 10% of children did not complete the study or the study used 'baseline observation carried forward' (BOCF) analysis, or both); unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) analysis); or high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis).\n    \n5.  Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small‐study size). We assessed studies as being at low risk of bias (200 children or more per treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 children per treatment arm); or high risk of bias (fewer than 50 children per treatment arm).\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias).\n    \n\n【100】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【101】Where dichotomous data were available, we planned to calculate a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and meta‐analyse the data as appropriate. We would have used a fixed‐effect model unless we found significant statistical heterogeneity. We planned to calculate numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate ( McQuay 1998 ); for unwanted effects, the NNTB becomes the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and is calculated in the same manner. Where continuous data were reported, we had planned to use appropriate methods to combine these data in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【102】We did not identify any data for analysis.\n\n【103】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【104】We planned to identify and measure heterogeneity as recommended in Chapter 9 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We would have dealt with clinical heterogeneity by combining studies that examined similar conditions. We planned to undertake and present a meta‐analysis only if we judged children, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes to be sufficiently similar to ensure a clinically meaningful answer. We planned to assess statistical heterogeneity visually ( L'Abbé 1987 ), and with the use of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. Where I <sup>2 </sup> was greater than 50%, we would have considered the possible reasons.\n\n【105】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【106】We used The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of reporting bias, as recommended in Chapter 8 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). The aim of this review was to use dichotomous data of known utility ( Moore 2013a ). The review did not depend on what authors of the original studies chose to report or not, though clearly difficulties may have arisen in studies not reporting any dichotomous results. We had planned to extract and use continuous data, which probably poorly reflect efficacy and utility, if useful for illustrative purposes only, but there were no data available for analysis.\n\n【107】#### Data synthesis\n\n【108】We planned to use a fixed‐effect model for meta‐analysis, but there were no data available for analysis. We planned to use a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis if there was significant clinical heterogeneity and we considered it appropriate to combine studies. We planned to conduct our analysis using the primary outcomes of pain and adverse events, and to calculate the NNTHs for adverse events.\n\n【109】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【110】We planned to perform subgroup analyses, where data were available, according to age (two to five years, five to 12 years) and types of surgery (e.g. tonsillectomy versus other surgery).\n\n【111】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【112】We did not intend to carry out any sensitivity analyses.\n\n【113】Results\n-------\n\n【114】### Description of studies\n\n【115】See Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies tables.\n\n【116】#### Results of the search\n\n【117】The searches identified 1289 reports after duplicates were removed ( Figure 1 ). We examined 11 full‐text articles in detail and assessed them for eligibility. We subsequently included three studies (four reports) and excluded seven studies.\n\n【118】#### Included studies\n\n【119】We included three studies (four reports) with 246 children undergoing tonsillectomy ( Rømsing 1998 ; Sutters 2004; Sutters 2010 ). Sutters 2005 provided additional information for the study by Sutters 2004 . Children were aged five to 15 years in one study ( Rømsing 1998 ), and aged six to 15 years in the remaining two studies ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ). The Characteristics of included studies table provides details.\n\n【120】Rømsing 1998 was conducted in Denmark; Sutters 2004 and Sutters 2010 took place in the US. Neither Rømsing 1998 nor Sutters 2004 declared a funding source; Sutters 2010 was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Nursing Research, USA.\n\n【121】Boys and girls were evenly assigned to the randomisation groups for all three studies.\n\n【122】Rømsing 1998 examined the outpatient management of post‐tonsillectomy pain in 53 children randomly assigned to two groups. Children were given paracetamol (acetaminophen) in weight‐appropriate doses for the first three days following discharge from hospital. The study reported that in Denmark, recommended dose ranges for this population were 60 mg/kg per 24 hours orally or 90 mg/kg per 24 hours rectally divided into four to six daily doses. The children in both groups were able to choose the route of administration, either oral (tablet (125 or 500 mg) or elixir (120 mg/5 mL)) or rectal (suppository (125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg)). The study group followed an ATC analgesic administration. The control group used paracetamol PRN (i.e. when the child complained of pain or was thought to be in pain by the parent or carer).\n\n【123】Sutters 2004 randomised 88 children to one of three groups. All children received elixir of paracetamol with codeine in weight‐appropriate doses (paracetamol 120 mg/5 mL with codeine 12 mg/5 mL) for three days after surgery. The first group ('PRN group') received analgesics every four hours PRN, without nurse coaching; parents were given instructions on dose measurement. The second group ('ATC group') received analgesics every four hours ATC, without nurse coaching. The third group ('ATC + coaching group') received analgesics every four hours ATC with nurse coaching. Children in all three groups were provided with a teaching booklet. Nurse coaching involved reviewing the pain management guidance in the booklet, and providing further information about postoperative pain (e.g. rationale for combining opioids and non‐opioids, and strategies for improving the participants' adherence to analgesic consumption).\n\n【124】Sutters 2010 randomised 123 children to one of three study groups as described above in Sutters 2004 . All children received elixir of paracetamol with hydrocodone in weight‐appropriate doses (maximum daily paracetamol dose approximately 73 mg/kg and hydrocodone approximately 0.2 mg/kg/dose) for three days after surgery.\n\n【125】#### Excluded studies\n\n【126】We excluded seven studies after reading the full reports ( Bean‐Lijewski 2007 ; Higgins 1999; King 1967; Najafi 2010; Patterson 2002; Smyth 2004; Tubbs 2007 ). Four studies were not RCTs, two did not assess PRN versus ATC analgesic administration, and one included a different population. The Characteristics of excluded studies table provides details.\n\n【127】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【128】Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the summary graphs.\n\n【129】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【130】Figure 2\n\n【131】* * *\n\n【132】* * *\n\n【133】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【134】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【135】Figure 3\n\n【136】* * *\n\n【137】* * *\n\n【138】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【139】#### Allocation\n\n【140】All three included studies were randomised.\n\n【141】Two studies were at low risk of random sequence generation (selection) bias, as they used an SPSS software‐generated random selection process ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ). Rømsing 1998 was at unclear risk of bias as the sequence was only described as 'randomly assigned'.\n\n【142】Allocation concealment (selection) bias was low for Sutters 2010 , but it was unclear for the remaining two studies.\n\n【143】#### Blinding\n\n【144】It was not possible to assess the included studies for blinding of the investigators or participants. We assessed any methods used to blind the outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a child received. Parents were asked to record the child's pain scores in a home diary or medication log; the studies did not report how these documents were assessed or whether the assessors were blinded to the intervention.\n\n【145】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【146】All three included studies were at low risk of attrition bias: in Rømsing 1998 , 13/53 children or parents 'did not complete the forms'; in Sutters 2004 , 8/88 children withdrew due to intolerable adverse effects; in Sutters 2010 , 10/123 children became ineligible or parents withdrew consent.\n\n【147】#### Size of study\n\n【148】We assessed the size of the study as a potential source of bias. All studies were at high risk of bias due to size: there were fewer than 50 children in total in Rømsing 1998 , and fewer than 50 children per treatment arm in Sutters 2004 . More than 123 children were randomised in Sutters 2010 , but there were fewer than 50 children in one arm, and a combined total of 81 children randomised to the other two arms; therefore, we assumed the children were divided evenly between arms two and three, hence the high risk of bias assessment.\n\n【149】#### Selective reporting\n\n【150】All included studies were at low risk of reporting bias.\n\n【151】### Effects of interventions\n\n【152】#### Pain intensity and pain relief\n\n【153】Rømsing 1998 : pain intensity was measured by the children using the poker chip tool (PCT), where one chip was 'a little piece of hurt' and four chips were 'the most hurt a child could have'. The scores were given on a 5‐point scale of 0 to 4, with scores of 3 and 4 classified as severe pain. Pain intensity scores were recorded by the parents based on child self report twice a day for three days following surgery.\n\n【154】For both ATC and PRN groups, mean pain intensity scores tended to be higher in the morning than the evening, except on day one where the mean pain scores were lower in the morning. A higher pain score in the morning is expected due to the length of time between doses overnight. A lower pain score on the morning after surgery is also expected due to the effects of preoperative analgesia given on the day of surgery.\n\n【155】On day two, the study authors stated that the ATC group reported lower mean pain scores than the PRN group both in the morning and the evening, but this was not statistically significant. These data were derived from tables 2 and 3 on page 237.\n\n【156】Pain relief was not reported.\n\n【157】Sutters 2004 : pain intensity, with and without swallowing, was measured by the children using a descriptive NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), prior to bedtime and upon awakening, on the evening of the day of surgery and twice a day for the following three days. Pain relief was rated using a 0 (no change) to 10 (pain gone) NRS at the same time. Mean pain intensity scores ranged from approximately 5 to 8 on the evening of the day of surgery, and had reduced to a range of approximately 2 to 5 on the evening of day three. There were no differences in pain intensity or pain relief scores between groups. There were no differences between pain intensity with swallowing and without swallowing. These data were derived from figure 2 on page 54.\n\n【158】Sutters 2010 : pain intensity, with and without swallowing, was measured by the children using a descriptive NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), prior to bedtime and upon awakening, on the evening of the day of surgery and twice a day for the following three days. Pain intensity scores were higher for both ATC and PRN groups in the morning than in the evening for all three days. The mean pain intensity scores were numerically but not significantly higher in the PRN group than the ATC group, both with swallowing (3.9 with PRN versus 3.0 with ATC) and without swallowing (4.2 with PRN and 3.2 with ATC). Pain relief was not reported.\n\n【159】Both Sutters 2004 and Sutters 2010 also assessed the impact of nurse coaching of parents. Although not a critical part of this review, they showed that compliance with the ATC regimen was high and not improved by nurse coaching. These data were derived from table 2 on page 16.\n\n【160】No data were available for analysis.\n\n【161】#### Adverse events\n\n【162】Rømsing 1998 : two children experience nausea and vomiting (one in each group). Two children reported otalgia (one in each group). One child reported a sore tongue (control group).\n\n【163】Sutters 2004 reported adverse events in the secondary paper Sutters 2005 : assessed frequency of adverse events; believed that increased analgesics according to an ATC regimen, would mean increased adverse effects.\n\n【164】There were no differences between groups in the following symptoms: lightheadedness, feeling dizzy (approximately 4% to 32% of children across groups); nightmares (occurred infrequently); nausea (12% to 43%); vomiting (2% to 29%); doses of antiemetics (30%); and constipation (6% to 24%). There was no difference for sedation, and across groups there were significant decreases in sedation over the four postoperative assessments; 14% to 37% of children experienced daytime sedation. However, on day three, the ATC groups experienced significantly more sedation (7/52 with ATC versus 0/52 with PRN).\n\n【165】The study authors reported that nausea and vomiting may have been related to the study medication.\n\n【166】Sutters 2010 : assessed sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nightmares, nausea, vomiting, and constipation: there were no significant between‐group differences, except that children in the ATC group did experience increased constipation. Adverse events were rated by the child before bedtime and upon awakening, using a 0 (did not have) to 4 (very severe) NRS.\n\n【167】#### Child and carer global impression\n\n【168】Not reported.\n\n【169】#### Medication use\n\n【170】Rømsing 1998 : reported the mean cumulative dose in milligrams per kilogram of paracetamol (acetaminophen) administered orally and rectally during the first three days following discharge.\n\n【171】Oral administration: on day two, the mean cumulative dose (for days one and two) was reported as 120.5 mg/kg (standard deviation (SD) 20.9) with ATC (study group) and 48.6 mg/kg (SD 22.9) with PRN (control group). On day three, the mean cumulative dose (for days one to three) was reported as 180.7 mg/kg (SD 31.8) with ATC and 69.7 mg/kg (SD 24.6) with PRN.\n\n【172】For rectal administration: on day two, the mean cumulative dose was reported as 172.3 mg/kg (SD 22.8) with ATC and 69.8 mg/kg (SD 26.5) with PRN. On day three, the mean cumulative dose was reported as 253.8 mg/kg (SD 32.7) with ATC and 81.8 mg/kg (SD 37.4) with PRN.\n\n【173】The study authors reported that the dose administered orally to the PRN group represented 39% of the dose administered to the ATC group, and that the dose administered rectally to the control group represented 32% of the dose administered to the study group.\n\n【174】In Sutters 2004 and Sutters 2010 , the parents or nurses recorded the volume in millilitres when administering medication. Sutters 2004 reported that medication use decreased over time for both groups. It was not clear to the study investigators what criteria were used by parents in the PRN group when decreasing the amount of analgesic given to their child over time. There were no differences in the total amount of analgesic administered over time for the ATC groups (with and without coaching). Sutters 2010 reported that a higher amount of analgesics was consumed in the ATC group compared with the PRN group.\n\n【175】#### Requirement for rescue analgesia\n\n【176】Not reported.\n\n【177】#### Length of postoperative stay\n\n【178】All children were discharged home on the day of surgery.\n\n【179】#### Sleep duration and quality\n\n【180】Only Sutters 2010 reported night‐time doses, sedation, and nightmares. There were no differences between groups for sedation and nightmares. Across the three postoperative days, children in the ATC group received a mean nine night‐time doses of the analgesic, whereas the PRN group received only four on average. Both groups reported pain on waking.\n\n【181】#### Acceptability of treatment\n\n【182】No study specifically reported acceptability of treatment.\n\n【183】In Rømsing 1998 , parents reported that children experienced nausea and vomiting (two children, one from each group), sore tongue (one child from control group), and otalgia (two children, one from each group). The study authors did not comment on whether these symptoms may have been caused by the study medication.\n\n【184】In Sutters 2004 , eight children developed intolerable adverse effects (i.e. persistent nausea and vomiting); these children were withdrawn from the study and given different medication. Nausea and vomiting were also measured each evening on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe). There were no between‐group differences for severity of nausea and vomiting reported.\n\n【185】Discussion\n----------\n\n【186】The process of reviewing the question of whether ATC analgesia is more beneficial than PRN raised important issues that need careful consideration.\n\n【187】Assessing whether ATC is better than PRN for treating pain after surgery in children is not straightforward. The assessment is of methods that can be used in everyday clinical situations, which is very different from the efficacy of a particular intervention.\n\n【188】All studies included in this review were based on the use of paracetamol, despite there being a poor evidence base for paracetamol as an analgesic ( Moore 2014 ).\n\n【189】An opioid was added to paracetamol in two studies ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ). Sutters 2004 used codeine, which is now contraindicated for use in children ( FDA 2013 ). We could find no systematic reviews on the comparison of effective analgesic administration for tonsillectomy in children. Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs might be an option but concern has been expressed about the risk of increased bleeding with these drugs. One review of 15 randomised studies and 1100 children by Lewis 2013 showed that there was a non‐significant increase in bleeding. The authors stated that an increased risk of bleeding could not be ruled out. Other interventions, such as dexamethasone, have been variously reported to increase bleeding or have little effect ( Czarnetzki 2008 ; Gallagher 2012; Bellis 2014 ).\n\n【190】A second concern is linked to the use of mean pain data. Mean data hides the true picture in terms of how many participants achieved mild pain or less and how many had moderate pain or more ( Moore 2013b ). Of concern is that mean pain scores indicated that participants were generally still in moderate pain at the end of the studies, and several days after the surgery. This suggests that paracetamol was insufficient to control pain post tonsillectomy, and is in accord with the poor performance of paracetamol compared with other analgesics in postoperative pain in adults ( Moore 2011 ).\n\n【191】A third and major concern is the paucity of the evidence base. The question posed is very important, and yet we identified only three small studies. While it is appreciated that ethical concerns are always greater in paediatric studies, children will continue to have inadequate pain relief unless questions are answered by randomised trials of large size, and using robust methods and reporting useful outcomes.\n\n【192】### Summary of main results\n\n【193】We cannot draw any conclusions from the included studies. We noted the following points.\n\n【194】Pain intensity scores decreased over time, as did medication use. However, children were still reporting pain at the final assessment, suggesting that no administration schedule provided adequate analgesia.\n\n【195】There were no significant differences in pain intensity scores at any time point between the groups receiving analgesics administered ATC versus PRN.\n\n【196】Mean pain intensity scores were generally higher in the morning than in the evening regardless of the method, route, or type of analgesics administered. This is explained in part due to the longer gap between doses while the children slept during the night compared with the dose interval in the daytime.\n\n【197】A higher dose of analgesics was consumed by the ATC groups compared with the PRN groups. The studies reported adverse events that may have been related to the study medication, such as nausea and vomiting, and constipation, but there were no numerically significant differences noted between the groups. It would have been helpful to show that the higher volume in the ATC group led to better analgesia but we were unable to demonstrate this. It should be noted that Rømsing 1998 reported that children in the PRN group received 'inadequate' doses of analgesics. The authors reported that many parents were reluctant to treat their children even when they recognised that they were in significant pain.\n\n【198】An increase in many surgical procedures being performed as day cases (at least in the UK ( NHS 2008 )) may restrict the opportunities for staff to educate parents in analgesic administration and the interpretation of pain scores. As a result, pain intensity scores may be higher at home due to the lack of supervision by trained staff. Two studies provided nurse coaching for parents in one of the ATC arms, but the authors reported that this did not impact parents' adherence to ATC dosing schedules ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ).\n\n【199】Two of the three included studies reported pain intensity and pain relief scores with and without swallowing ( Sutters 2004 ; Sutters 2010 ): while this is important in tonsillectomy studies, it was not important for this review.\n\n【200】All three included studies were of small size with fewer than 50 children in each arm, and therefore were at a high risk of bias. All children were administered analgesics for the management of postoperative pain following tonsillectomy. Children were given weight‐appropriate doses of the study medication, either ATC or PRN, by a parent or carer at home for up to four days following surgery.\n\n【201】The initial report by NIHR and NHS (see Why it is important to do this review ) highlighted the concerns of clinicians and parents regarding the frequency of analgesic administration, and associated adverse effects, when treating postoperative pain in children. Specifically there was a concern that \"many clinicians and parents fear that regularly scheduled administration of analgesics may result in the administration of unnecessary and/or excessive amounts of analgesics, which may cause undesirable and potentially harmful adverse effects.\" There were too few data from only three small studies to address these concerns adequately.\n\n【202】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【203】Overall completeness and applicability of evidence were inadequate. We identified only three small RCTs comparing PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children, and all three focused on post‐tonsillectomy pain.\n\n【204】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【205】All included studies were randomised, but reporting quality was poor. Only mean pain intensity scores were available, either in graphs or tables. All three included studies were of small size with fewer than 50 children in each arm. It was not stated whether the outcome assessors were blind to the children's group allocation. The complexity of children's self reports of pain intensity is widely accepted, as these self reports are potentially influenced by various social and developmental factors ( von Baeyer 2009 ). The tendency of young children to use the bottom and top extremes rather than the middle of rating scales is well known ( von Baeyer 2009 ).\n\n【206】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【207】We carried out a broad search of studies, in line with The Cochrane Collaboration's policy, and we consider it is unlikely that significant amounts of relevant data remain unknown to us.\n\n【208】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【209】We did not identify any other similar studies or reviews comparing PRN versus ATC analgesic administration for postoperative pain in children. However, there are a number of reviews on postoperative pain in children, typically following tonsillectomy ( Hamunen 2005; Wiggins 2007 ; Lönnqvist 2005 ; Sutters 1997 ; Howard 2014 ; Dorkham 2014 ; Wilson 2006 ; Martin 2014 ). All reviews agreed that children experience significant pain after surgery and that continuing adequate pain control at home is essential.\n\n【210】Some reviews also identified the issue of under‐treating pain in this population, and that parents often gave fewer doses of analgesics than were prescribed. Unlike Sutters 2004 and Sutters 2010 , Wilson 2006 found that pain scores were higher with swallowing than without swallowing. Martin 2014 reported that the most serious adverse effect of opioids, as prescribed for paediatric pain, was respiratory depression; none of the included studies in this review reported this outcome.\n\n【211】Figures and Tables -\n\n【212】Figure 1\n\n【213】Study flow diagram.\n\n【214】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【215】Figures and Tables -\n\n【216】Figure 2\n\n【217】Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【218】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【219】Figures and Tables -\n\n【220】Figure 3\n\n【221】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【222】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative hypersensitivity is sometimes still an issue. Dental cavity liners have historically been used to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2016.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 12 November 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library (searched 12 November 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12 November 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 November 2018) and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 12 November 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of the use of liners under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent teeth (in both adults and children). We included both parallel and split‐mouth designs.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We utilized standard methodological procedures prescribed by Cochrane for data collection and analysis. Two review authors screened the search results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion against the review inclusion criteria. We conducted risk of bias assessments and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Where information was unclear we contacted study authors for clarification.\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】Eight studies, recruiting over 700 participants, compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations.\n\n【15】Seven studies evaluated postoperative hypersensitivity measured by various methods. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or patient‐reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points (low‐quality evidence).\n\n【16】Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates were shown at 1 year follow‐up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00) (low‐quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years follow‐up and, again, no failures were shown in either group.\n\n【17】No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.\n\n【18】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【19】There is inconsistent, low‐quality evidence regarding the difference in postoperative hypersensitivity subsequent to placing a dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth in adults or children 15 years or older. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in the longevity of restorations placed with or without dental cavity liners.\n\n【20】PICOs\n-----\n\n【21】### PICOs\n\n【22】###### Population (11)\n\n【23】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Dental Restoration Present\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【24】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【25】*   Dental Cavity Liner\n\n【26】###### Comparison (1)\n\n【27】*   Usual Care\n\n【28】###### Outcome (2)\n\n【29】*   Tooth Restoration Failure\n*   Tooth Sensitivity To Pressure\n\n【30】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

If left untreated, acid produced by bacteria in the dental plaque or biofilm forms cavities or holes in the teeth. A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of these materials is tooth‐colored, resin‐based composite or RBC. This material is increasingly used as an alternative to amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles).\n\n【40】Since the 19th century liners have often been placed in cavities in the teeth under the filling material. The liners are thought to protect the living pulp of the tooth from filling materials themselves and also from their potential to allow more heat or cold through than the natural tooth would. Although RBC filling materials are thought to be similar to the natural material of teeth in terms of how they conduct heat, sensitivity to temperature change is sometimes still an issue for people after treatment.\n\n【41】**Study characteristics**\n\n【42】The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from Cochrane Oral Health, is up to date as of 12 November 2018.\n\n【43】Eight studies, with over 700 participants, were included. Two studies were conducted in the USA, two in Thailand, two in Germany and one each in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The studies compared the use of liners under tooth‐colored resin fillings (RBC) in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth to no liners for Class I and Class II fillings. One of the two studies in the USA took place in dental practices, the others in university‐based dental schools. All participants were over 15 years of age.\n\n【44】**Key results**\n\n【45】Very little evidence was found to show that a liner under Class I and II RBC fillings in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth reduced sensitivity in adults or children 15 years or older. No evidence was found to show that there was any difference in the length of time fillings lasted when placed with or without a cavity liner. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.\n\n【46】**Quality of evidence**\n\n【47】The body of evidence identified in this review does not allow for robust conclusions about the effects of dental cavity liners. The quality of the evidence identified in this review is low and there is a lack of confidence in the effect estimates. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in how long restorations last when placed with or without dental cavity liners.\n\n【48】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【49】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【50】### Implications for practice\n\n【51】There is inconsistent evidence regarding the difference between resin‐based composite restorations placed with liners and those placed without liners when considering postoperative hypersensitivity. There is no evidence of a difference between the use of liners or not with regard to restoration failure. Despite the low quality of the evidence, we feel that this evidence is applicable when placing routine composite‐based restorations in adult posterior teeth and that placing a liner is an unnecessary step. Any cost savings can be passed along to the public. Even without any cost savings, the evidence does not currently support including the unnecessary step of placing any lining material underneath routine composite‐based restorations in adult posterior teeth.\n\n【52】### Implications for research\n\n【53】If new liner materials are developed then future clinical trials should be undertaken to determine if the new liner materials are of any benefit in terms of postoperative hypersensitivity and restoration failure. Any additional research on calcium hydroxide or resin‐modified glass ionomer liners should focus on their use as pulp capping materials rather than on their use as dental cavity liners under routine composite‐based restorations.\n\n【54】Future trials should be well‐designed randomized controlled trials (with adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment methods, blinding of participants and outcome assessors) reported according to the CONSORT Statement ( www.consort‐statement.org ).\n\n【55】The trials included in the current review used a variety of methods for assessing postoperative hypersensitivity that precluded pooling in some instances. It would be helpful if future studies use agreed, standardized outcome assessment methods, as recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative ( www.comet‐initiative.org ), to allow for greater comparison of results across studies. Better reporting of adverse events is required and the planning and conducting of an economic analysis alongside future clinical trials would also be beneficial.\n\n【56】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【57】Open in table viewer\n\n【58】Summary of findings for the main comparison.\n\n| **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Illustrative comparative risks \\* (95% CI)**  | **Illustrative comparative risks \\* (95% CI)**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Assumed risk \\***  | **Corresponding risk**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **No liner**  | **Liner**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) (Patient‐reported Y/N)** **Follow‐up: 1 week**  | 100 per 1000  | 56 per 1000(26 to 117)  | RR 0.56(0.26 to 1.17)  | 299(3 studies)  | ⊕⊕⊝⊝ 1**low**  | POH was also measured at 24 hours (1 trial at high risk of bias) and 1 month (3 trials at high/unclear risk of bias).

Dental caries is currently the most prevalent disease in the world, affecting 60% to 90% of the school‐aged population in low‐income, middle‐income and high‐income countries and almost all of the adults in most countries ( Petersen 2003 ; Petersen 2005 ). Caries prevalence varies significantly from country to country with some of the low‐income countries having the lowest caries rates ( Edelstein 2006 ). This is thought to be due to the maintenance of a traditional diet with lower sugar consumption and lower levels of urbanization in the poorest, low‐income countries ( Diehnelt 2001 ). As these poorest countries begin to develop, urbanization and sugar consumption increase and a rise in caries prevalence is seen ( Diehnelt 2001 ). Caries prevalence also varies significantly within individual low‐income, middle‐income and high‐income countries with people having the lowest education levels, the lowest socioeconomic status and those living in poverty having the highest prevalence ( Selwitz 2007 ).\n\n【64】Dental caries can be classified by location and extent of the lesions produced by the demineralization. The most common classification system is the one created by GV Black that assigns a classification to the lesion based on its location on the tooth. In this system, a lesion located in the pits and fissures (grooves) of the occlusal (biting) surface of a tooth is considered a Class I lesion, and a lesion located on a proximal (in between) surface of a posterior tooth is considered a Class II lesion ( Black 1924 ). Once a carious lesion has developed to the point where it must be restored, the traditional method of restoring the lesion is to surgically remove the caries using a dental drill and filling the resulting cavity with a restorative material. The most common materials currently in use for the permanent restoration of carious lesions in posterior teeth are dental amalgam and resin‐based composite.\n\n【65】### Description of the intervention\n\n【66】Resin‐based composite (RBC) is currently accepted as a viable material for the restoration of caries for posterior permanent teeth requiring surgical treatment ( Demarco 2012 ). These materials are formulated to be placed into the prepared tooth cavity in a soft, viscous state, and then made to harden through a process known as polymerization. Polymerization can be initiated by one of two methods. In the first method, a catalyst is mixed with a base, and chemical activation hardens the material. In the second method, the material is formulated to harden via light activation. The light‐activated materials have the advantages of setting more quickly, of not having to be mixed and of giving the operator control over when the material will harden. Since the 19th century, dental materials have been developed and used to protect the pulp by being placed between the tooth structure and the restorative material ( Harris 1863 ). Liners are purported to protect the pulp from the toxic effects of some dental restorative materials and to prevent the pain of thermal conductivity by placing an insulating layer between restorative material and the remaining tooth structure ( Roberson 2006 ). Like liners, sealers are sometimes advocated to reduce thermal sensitivity under metallic restorations. However, while it is possible to place a resin‐based composite without a liner, sealers are an integral part of the technique of placing an RBC restoration, since the sealer is used to bond the material to the tooth structure. Both liners and sealers can also be light cured or chemically cured.\n\n【67】Despite the fact that the thermal conductivity of the RBC restorative material closely approximates that of natural tooth structure, postoperative thermal sensitivity is sometimes still an issue ( Briso 2007 ). The liners most commonly used in restorative dentistry include calcium hydroxide and glass ionomer cements, both of which are available in either chemical or light‐cured formulations. Current evidence indicates that posterior composite restorative dental materials are likely to be very well tolerated by the pulp, and that significant adverse reactions are most likely the result of the presence of bacteria and their by‐products ( Summitt 2006 ). Even when the placement of liners is limited to the deeper restorations, their clinical benefits may not live up to their theoretical value ( Unemori 2007 ).\n\n【68】### How the intervention might work\n\n【69】Current theories regarding postoperative tooth sensitivity following the placement of RBC restorations are based on microleakage as the cause either directly by hydrodynamic flow of fluid through the dentinal tubules or from bacterial by‐products reaching the pulp through the tubules ( Summitt 2006 ). Liners are advocated to provide a better seal of the tubules in order to reduce or eliminate postoperative sequelae ( Murray 2001 ). Liners are also sometimes advocated to stimulate favorable pulpal reactions underneath restorations in close proximity to the pulpal tissue ( Murray 2002 ). However, overall there is little clinical evidence linking the use of liners to a reduction in postoperative sensitivity ( Wegehaupt 2009 ). Liners placed for the purpose of pulpal protection are thought to medicate the pulpal tissue, causing sedation and hopefully stimulation of reparative dentin formation ( Roberson 2006 ). Calcium hydroxide liners are most frequently advocated for the deepest restorations due to their high pH, which stimulates the formation of reparative dentin ( Murray 2002a ). Zinc oxide eugenol liners are most frequently advocated due to their sedative effect on pulpal tissue but are not commonly used under RBCs ( Murray 2001 ). Liners placed for the purpose of reducing postoperative sensitivity are thought to better seal the dentinal tubules than bonding the RBC restoration directly to tooth structure. The improved seal would reduce microleakage and prevent or reduce the hydrodynamic flow of fluid through the tubules, subsequently preventing or reducing the by‐products of bacterial activity from reaching the pulp ( Summitt 2006 ).\n\n【70】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【71】Dentists frequently choose the materials and the techniques they use in practice based on the education and clinical experiences they receive while in school ( Lynch 2006 ). However, survey results show that there is significant variation in what is being taught in dental schools, both within and among different countries across the globe, regarding the placement of liners underneath RBC restorations ( Castillo‐de Oyagüe 2012 ; Gordan 2000 ; Hayashi 2009 ; Liew 2011 ; Lynch 2006 ; Lynch 2006a ; Lynch 2006b ; Lynch 2007 ; Lynch 2007a ; Lynch 2011 ; Sadeghi 2009 ; Wilson 2000 ). All of the surveys reviewed asked similar questions, and responses were obtained for preparations that were shallow (outer one‐third of dentin), moderate (middle one‐third of dentin), and deep (inner one‐third of dentin). The surveys revealed that for shallow preparations dental school faculty members do not typically recommend a liner. Approximately half of the respondents advocated the placement of liners for moderate preparations. The majority of respondents did advocate the placement of liners for deep preparations, but some controversy remains. In fact, some dental educators contend that the placement of liners (as opposed to the direct bonding of the RBC to the tooth) is not beneficial, and may be detrimental, even in the restoration of deep caries ( Castillo‐de Oyagüe 2012 ; Gordan 2000 ; Hayashi 2009 ; Lynch 2006 ; Lynch 2006a ; Lynch 2006b ; Lynch 2007 ; Lynch 2007a ; Lynch 2011 ; Sadeghi 2009 ; Wilson 2000 ). There is some evidence that the placement of a liner underneath an RBC restoration shortens the life expectancy of that restoration significantly ( Demarco 2012 ). This may be due to the fact that the lining material does not bond to tooth structure or does not bond well to RBC allowing greater microleakage. The liners reported on in these surveys were exclusively calcium hydroxide and glass ionomer cement. In 2002 Deliperi and Bardwell suggested the use of flowable composite as a cavity liner in order to \"reduce marginal discoloration, recurrent caries and postoperative sensitivity, and potentially improve longevity of these Class I and Class II RBC restorations\" ( Deliperi 2002 ). The surveys revealed that no dental school curricula incorporated the use of flowable composite as a liner. One of the few clinical studies conducted on the subject showed no improvement in restoration performance by placing a flowable composite liner under a Class II RBC ( Efes 2006 ).\n\n【72】Whenever possible, the most biocompatible, longest lasting restorations should be utilized in the restoration of defective or missing tooth structure. While much time, effort and expense is spent researching, developing, manufacturing, testing, marketing, and placing dental cavity liners, little evidence exists as to whether or not these materials are effective. This review has compiled the evidence regarding the effects of cavity liners for the translation into practice, thus assisting in the creation of an evidence‐based rationale for the use of cavity liners. This version is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2016 ( Schenkel 2016 ).\n\n【73】Objectives\n----------\n\n【74】To assess the effects of using dental cavity liners in the placement of Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults.\n\n【75】Methods\n-------\n\n【76】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【77】#### Types of studies\n\n【78】All studies included were randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the use of liners under Class I and Class II posterior resin‐based composite restorations in permanent teeth. We included both parallel and split‐mouth designs.\n\n【79】We excluded studies examining:\n\n【80】*   bases;\n    \n*   amalgam or any other metallic restorations;\n    \n*   any indirect restorations;\n    \n*   anterior restorations;\n    \n*   liners in vitro.\n    \n\n【81】#### Types of participants\n\n【82】Adults or children with at least one restoration in a posterior permanent tooth/teeth undergoing a Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restoration(s).\n\n【83】#### Types of interventions\n\n【84】Any type of dental cavity liner placed under a Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restoration on a posterior tooth was considered, including but not limited to calcium hydroxide, glass ionomer, resin‐modified glass ionomer, flowable composite, zinc phosphate cement, zinc, and eugenol cement . The comparison group in included trials received Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restoration on a posterior tooth directly bonded to the tooth without the use of a dental cavity liner.\n\n【85】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【86】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【87】1.  Postoperative hypersensitivity to hot, cold, biting, chewing, and/or sweets experienced by the patient within 1 month following the intervention. Postoperative hypersensitivity could be measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) or by hypersensitivity present or absent as tested by dentist or patient self‐report.\n    \n2.  Restoration failure. Survival time of the resin‐based composite restoration (in months) from the time of placement with a minimum follow‐up of 1 year.\n    \n\n【88】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【89】1.  Cost of materials.\n    \n2.  Adverse events: pulpal involvement, tooth fracture, hypersensitivity reactions to the materials, etc. or any other adverse event described in any of the studies.\n    \n\n【90】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【91】#### Electronic searches\n\n【92】Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist conducted systematic searches in the following databases for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. There were no language, publication year or publication status restrictions:\n\n【93】*   Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (searched 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 1 );\n    \n*   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library (12 November 2018) ( Appendix 2 );\n    \n*   MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 3 );\n    \n*   Embase Ovid (1980 to 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 4 );\n    \n*   LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; 1982 to 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 5 ).\n    \n\n【94】Subject strategies were modelled on the search strategy designed for MEDLINE Ovid. Where appropriate, they were combined with subject strategy adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ Chapter 6 ( Lefebvre 2011 ).\n\n【95】#### Searching other resources\n\n【96】We searched the following trial registries for ongoing studies:\n\n【97】*   US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov ( clinicaltrials.gov ; searched 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 6 );\n    \n*   World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( apps.who.int/trialsearch ; searched 12 November 2018) ( Appendix 6 ).\n    \n\n【98】The reference lists of relevant articles were checked and we contacted known experts in the field.\n\n【99】We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of interventions used. We considered adverse effects described in included studies only.\n\n【100】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【101】#### Selection of studies\n\n【102】In the original review, two review authors (Andrew Schenkel (AS) reviewed all and Ivy Peltz (IP)) and Analia Veitz‐Keenan (AVK) each reviewed some) screened titles and abstracts from the electronic searches to identify potentially eligible studies, which required further evaluation to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria for this review. No language restrictions were imposed. The third review author moderated any disagreement as appropriate (either IP or AVK). Full‐text copies of all eligible and potentially eligible studies were obtained and these were further evaluated in detail by two review authors (AS reviewed all and IP or AVK reviewed some) to identify those studies which actually met all the inclusion criteria. The third review author moderated any disagreement (AVK or IP as appropriate). From this group, we recorded those studies not meeting the inclusion criteria in the excluded studies section of the review and the reasons for exclusion were noted in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.  A PRISMA flow chart was created to summarize this process. In the current update of this review, two review authors (AS and AVK) screened all the titles and abstracts from the updated electronic searches to identify potentially eligible studies, some of which required further evaluation to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria for this review. No additional studies have been added to this review as a result of the updated search but much information has been added to the discussion as a result of additional systematic reviews having been published subsequent to our original review.\n\n【103】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【104】A form was created for data extraction in the original review. The form included the author, the date, the journal, the type of trial, the type of randomization (sample size, allocation concealment, masking, and dropouts), the type of intervention, the comparison, outcomes reported, duration of the trial, and funding details. Two review authors extracted the data independently from each study (AS from all and IP or AVK from some). The third review author (AVK or IP as appropriate) moderated any disagreements.\n\n【105】The form also included the following categories.\n\n【106】*   Conducted in: (country).\n    \n*   Number of centers.\n    \n*   Setting.\n    \n*   Number of participants recruited.\n    \n*   Recruitment period.\n    \n*   Inclusion criteria.\n    \n*   Exclusion criteria.\n    \n*   Number of participants randomized.\n    \n*   Number of patients evaluated.\n    \n*   Study design.\n    \n    *   Parallel‐group.\n        \n    *   Split‐mouth study.\n        \n*   Type(s) of treatment(s) and control intervention(s).\n    \n*   Type of liner(s).\n    \n*   Treatment and control interventions.\n    \n*   Mode of administration of intervention(s) and control(s).\n    \n*   When were outcomes measured.\n    \n*   Duration of follow‐up.\n    \n*   Were groups comparable at baseline.\n    \n*   Were there any co‐interventions.\n    \n*   Any other issues.\n    \n\n【107】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【108】We followed the assessment of risk of bias suggested by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) and utilised the two‐part tool, addressing the seven specific key domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and 'other bias') as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . For each domain in the tool we included one or more specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool described what was reported to have happened in the study in sufficient detail to support a judgment about the risk of bias. The second part of the tool assigned a judgment of 'low risk' of bias, 'high risk' of bias, or 'unclear risk' of bias regarding the risk of bias for that domain.\n\n【109】The domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, selective outcome reporting and 'other bias' were each addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. For blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment and for incomplete outcome data, two or more entries could be used because assessments generally need to be made separately for different outcomes (or for the same outcome at different time points). We made an overall judgment of 'low risk' of bias for a study when any plausible bias across all seven domains was unlikely to have altered the results. We made an overall judgment of 'unclear risk' of bias for a study when any plausible bias across one or more of the key domains raises some doubt that it may have altered the results. We made an overall judgment of 'high risk' of bias for a study when any plausible bias across one or more of the key domains seriously weakened our confidence in the results reported in that study.\n\n【110】Two review authors conducted the assessment of risk of bias independently and in duplicate (AS for all studies and IP or AVK for some studies). The third review author (AVK or IP as appropriate) moderated any disagreements. For each included study we presented a 'Risk of bias' table as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ . We also included a 'Risk of bias summary' graph as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【111】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【112】For dichotomous outcomes, we presented the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as a risk ratio (sensitivity present/not present) together with the 95% confidence interval. For continuous outcomes (such as mean VAS scores), we used mean differences and standard deviations to summarize the data for each trial. We considered each category of sensitivity separately if there were enough data from included studies or pooled together as one category if there were not enough separate data. We standardised VAS scales of different lengths as a result.\n\n【113】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【114】Where the unit of randomization was a tooth, a trial participant was permitted to contribute more than one tooth to the study. This clustering of teeth within an individual was accounted for in the analysis of the outcomes in order to avoid unit of analysis errors. If it had been unclear from the reports of included trials whether clustering had been considered, we would have contacted authors to clarify how this dependence had been accounted for in the analysis.\n\n【115】Where repeated measures were made (e.g. sensitivity measurements over weeks), we considered time points of up to 30 days after restoration placement likely to provide the most clinically meaningful data for postoperative hypersensitivity.\n\n【116】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【117】In cases of missing or incomplete data, we attempted to contact the study authors.\n\n【118】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【119】We assessed heterogeneity by inspection of the point estimates and confidence intervals on the forest plots. We assessed the variation in treatment effects by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. We considered heterogeneity statistically significant if the P value was < 0.1. A rough guide to the interpretation of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic given in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ is: 0% to 40% might not be important, 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity, and 75% to 100% may represent considerable heterogeneity ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【120】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【121】If there had been more than 10 studies in one outcome we would have constructed a funnel plot in order to look for evidence of publication bias.\n\n【122】#### Data synthesis\n\n【123】Where studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures were included, we combined these in a meta‐analysis. We combined risk ratios for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using random‐effects models, provided there were more than three studies in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【124】Treatment effects from split‐mouth trials were combined with those from parallel‐group trials where appropriate using the generic inverse variance method incorporated in Review Manager (RevMan) ( Review Manager 2014 ). Where this was not appropriate we have presented a narrative synthesis.\n\n【125】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【126】The following subgroups would have been investigated, if data had allowed.\n\n【127】*   Different types of liners.\n    \n*   Different depths of caries.\n    \n\n【128】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【129】Had sufficient trials been identified, we would have conducted sensitivity analysis including only those trials at low risk of bias.\n\n【130】##### Presentation of main results\n\n【131】We developed a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcomes of this review following GRADE methods ( GRADE 2004 ) and using GRADEproGDT software ( GRADEproGDT 2015 ). The quality of the body of evidence was assessed with reference to the overall risk of bias of the included studies, the directness of the evidence, the inconsistency of the results, the precision of the estimates, the risk of publication bias, and the magnitude of the effect. We categorised the quality of the body of evidence for each of the primary outcomes as high, moderate, low or very low.\n\n【132】Results\n-------\n\n【133】### Description of studies\n\n【134】See ' Characteristics of included studies ' and ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' tables.\n\n【135】#### Results of the search\n\n【136】The electronic searches conducted for this review on 10 April 2015 and 12 November 2018 identified a total of 1599 references of which 555 proved to be duplicates. Other sources identified three additional references to make a total of 1047 records that were screened. Two review authors independently screened these titles and abstracts (where available). From these, we identified 28 reports of trials as potentially eligible according to the defined inclusion criteria for this review with regard to study design, participants, and interventions. We obtained full‐text copies of 27 reports, and after further evaluation, we excluded 18 of these studies. We recorded the reasons for exclusion of these 18 studies in the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table. Eight studies (nine reports) met the inclusion criteria for this review ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). We attempted to contact the investigator of the identified report of a clinical trial ( NCT03286959 ) to see if there were any data available that we could include in this review but we obtained no response. The stated aim of this trial was \"to determine the effectiveness of cavity liners regarding survival of restoration beneath composite restoration after partial caries removal in permanent teeth with deep caries and to evaluate and compare the pulp vitality outcome both clinically and radiologically with and without liners..... After partial excavation of caries, patients were randomly allocated into three groups ‐ RMGIC \\[resin‐modified glass ionomer cement\\], CH \\[calcium hydroxide\\] and DIRECT COMPOSITE \\[no liner\\] groups and were restored according to standard protocol.\" The trial started in November 2016 and was completed in January 2018 but no data have been published as of the submission of this update as far as we could determine and the report is awaiting classification (see ' Characteristics of studies awaiting classification ' table for further details).  \nThe search process and results are presented as a flow chart in Figure 1 .\n\n【137】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【138】Figure 1\n\n【139】* * *\n\n【140】* * *\n\n【141】Study flow diagram.\n\n【142】#### Included studies\n\n【143】##### Characteristics of the trial settings and investigators\n\n【144】Three of the eight included studies were designed as split‐mouth studies ( Akpata 2001 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Efes 2006 ). The remaining five were parallel‐group studies ( Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). Of the eight included studies, two were conducted in the USA ( Browning 2006 ; Strober 2013 ), two in Thailand ( Banomyong 2013 ; Burrow 2009 ), two in Germany ( Boeckler 2012 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ), and one each in Saudi Arabia ( Akpata 2001 ) and Turkey ( Efes 2006 ).\n\n【145】Only two studies provided funding information ( Boeckler 2012 ; Strober 2013 ). Boeckler 2012 was conducted in a university‐based dental school setting and funding was provided by Ivoclar Vivadent. Strober 2013 was conducted in 28 private dental practices that were part of a practice‐based research network in the USA, and funding was provided by grant U01‐DE016755, which was awarded to the College of Dentistry, New York University, New York City, by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA. The other six studies ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ) were conducted in university‐based dental school settings. It is possible that these studies may have received institutional funding.\n\n【146】Sample size calculations were reported in only one of the included trials ( Strober 2013 ).\n\n【147】##### Characteristics of the participants\n\n【148】All included trials were conducted in patients with solely adult dentition. Trials recruited between 44 and 351 participants, with a mean of 99 participants per trial. However, the largest study ( Strober 2013 ) considerably skews this mean. Removing the largest study from this calculation yields a mean of 64 participants for the remaining seven studies.\n\n【149】The participants all needed restorations placed due to primary or secondary carious lesions in one or more permanent teeth. Six studies specified moderate to large sized lesions ( Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ), one study included small or moderately large (bucco‐lingual dimension up to half the inter‐cuspal width) sized lesions ( Akpata 2001 ) and one study included lesions of any size without limitations ( Boeckler 2012 ). One study ( Akpata 2001 ) included only male participants while all other studies including both males and females.\n\n【150】##### Characteristics of outcome measures\n\n【151】###### Primary outcomes\n\n【152】Seven of the included trials evaluated postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) measured by various methods ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). Five studies measured POH via a yes/no patient report ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). Two studies measured POH via a cold response measurement (CRM) on a visual analog scale (VAS) ( Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ). One study ( Akpata 2001 ) measured POH via CRM in time (seconds) and one study ( Burrow 2009 ) measured POH via a yes/no CRM. One study ( Boeckler 2012 ) measured POH via CRM using subjective descriptive patient response criteria at baseline, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. This study found two restorations in the intervention group (liner) and two restorations in the control group (no liner) exhibiting significant POH at baseline but no subjects reported any POH at 6 months, 1 year or 2 years. No discussion of these results was included in this study. These data were not included in any analyses in this review since this review is limited to POH measured up to 1 month postoperatively.\n\n【153】Four of the included trials measured restoration longevity ( Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Efes 2006 ).\n\n【154】###### Secondary outcomes\n\n【155】We listed cost of materials and adverse events (pulpal involvement, tooth fracture, hypersensitivity reactions to the materials, etc. or any other adverse event described in any of the studies) as secondary outcomes that we would include in this review. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors of one study indicated that they would report adverse events but no adverse events were reported ( Strober 2013 ). Strober 2013 stated that an adverse event was considered to be \"lingering pain upon removal of the stimulus.\" None of the other included studies made any mention of any adverse events. Only one study ( Strober 2013 ) included cost. (See ' Effects of interventions ' section for their analysis.)\n\n【156】#### Excluded studies\n\n【157】See ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table for information on each excluded study.\n\n【158】We obtained full‐text copies of the following 18 studies, which appeared from their titles and abstracts to be eligible for inclusion. Evaluation of these trials resulted in their exclusion from this review for the following reasons.\n\n【159】*   No control or comparison group included in the trial (one report: Huth 2003 ).\n    \n*   Inappropriate study design in the trial (two reports: Rasmusson 1998 <sup>a </sup> ; Whitworth 2005 <sup>b </sup> ).\n    \n*   Liners were not studied in the trial (four reports: Akpata 2006 ; Fagundes 2009 ; Loguercio 2001 ; Shi 2010 ).\n    \n*   Not actually a randomized controlled trial (five reports: Ernst 2002 ; Ernst 2003 ; Kaurani 2007 ; Noro 1983 ; Unemori 2001 ).\n    \n*   Restorative 'sandwich' technique <sup>c </sup> utilized in the trial (six reports: Andersson‐Wenckert 2002 ; Andersson‐Wenckert 2004 ; Grogono 1990 ; Knibbs 1992 ; van Dijken 1999 ; Vilkinis 2000 ).\n    \n\n【160】<sup>a </sup> This study compared one brand of resin‐based composite placed without a liner to a second brand of resin‐based composite placed with a flowable composite as a liner.  \n<sup>b </sup> The decision of which restoration to place (composite or amalgam) was left to the discretion of the operator, and information regarding how this decision was made was not provided.  \n<sup>c </sup> The placement of a restoration utilizing the 'sandwich' technique has many similarities to the placement of a restoration utilizing a cavity liner under a resin‐based composite material. The techniques differ significantly, however, in that the resin‐modified glass ionomer (RMGI) placed under the resin composite in the 'sandwich' technique is much thicker and extends out to the cavo‐surface margin at the gingival margin of the Class II restoration ('open sandwich' technique). This requires the RMGI material to perform the same function as the resin‐based composite in this area. This is a much different function from RMGI liners (or any liners) placed entirely beneath a resin‐based composite restoration and not exposed to the oral cavity. Even in the 'closed sandwich' technique, where the RMGI is not brought out to the cavo‐surface margin, the extra thickness of RMGI alone does not qualify it to be considered a liner.\n\n【161】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【162】We assessed five studies as being at overall high risk of bias ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ). The remaining three studies were at unclear risk of bias ( Boeckler 2012 ; Efes 2006 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ) ( Figure 2 ).\n\n【163】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【164】Figure 2\n\n【165】* * *\n\n【166】* * *\n\n【167】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【168】#### Allocation\n\n【169】##### Random sequence generation\n\n【170】We deemed four studies to have adequate sequence generation and therefore we classified them as being at low risk of bias for this domain ( Boeckler 2012 ; Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). We judged the remaining four studies as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain because they gave no information other than that they were 'randomized' ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Efes 2006 ).\n\n【171】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【172】Two studies employed adequate methods of allocation concealment. We therefore classified them as being at low risk of bias for this domain ( Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ). The remaining six studies did not mention allocation concealment, so we classified them as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Efes 2006 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ).\n\n【173】#### Blinding\n\n【174】##### Performance bias ‐ Blinding of participants and personnel\n\n【175】Four studies were deemed to have adequate blinding of participants ( Banomyong 2013 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). The remaining four studies gave no information regarding blinding of the participants ( Akpata 2001 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ).\n\n【176】It is important to note that blinding of personnel was not possible for the types of trials included in this review. In all cases, the operator placing the restoration was aware of whether or not a liner had been placed under the restoration. The impact of this lack of blinding was felt to be unclear in all studies. In those studies in which the operators and the outcome assessors were the same persons, the risk of bias was considered to be high for detection bias, but not necessarily for performance bias.\n\n【177】##### Detection bias ‐ Blinding of outcome assessors\n\n【178】We deemed four studies to have adequate blinding of outcome assessors and therefore we classified them as being at low risk of bias for this domain ( Akpata 2001 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Efes 2006 ). Three studies were judged as being at high risk of bias for this domain because the outcome assessor and the operator placing the restoration were the same person ( Banomyong 2013 ; Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ). As previously stated, there is no way to blind the operator in this type of study. Since the operator and the outcome assessor were the same person and the operator could not be blinded, the outcome assessor also could not have been adequately blinded since she or he might have remembered which restoration had the liner and which restoration did not. The remaining study did not provide any information regarding blinding of outcome assessors so we classified it as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain ( Wegehaupt 2009 ). Additionally, we judged Strober 2013 to be at high risk of bias for this domain because we question the protocol of the study regarding data collection and recording. Practice‐based network studies are typically conducted in an actual dental office setting as opposed to an artificially controlled clinical setting such as a dental school. Often, a single dentist in the practice serves as the 'practitioner‐investigator' (P‐I). The P‐I is frequently the only dentists in the practice and must perform all the tasks required for the study, providing no opportunity for blinding of the outcome assessor. In these cases, the P‐I would examine and evaluate each subject and his/her carious lesions for exclusion or inclusion and would also place the restorations, with or without the liner, and evaluate all the restorations at all intervals and record all data. In Strober 2013 it was specifically reported that this was the case. This protocol may affect the risk of bias for this and all practice‐based network studies.\n\n【179】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【180】We deemed six studies to have adequate outcome data and therefore we classified them as being at low risk of bias for this domain ( Akpata 2001 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). We judged the remaining two studies as being at high risk of bias for this domain, one because of a high number of dropouts ( Banomyong 2013 ) and the other because the authors gave no information regarding how the missing data were treated ( Browning 2006 ).\n\n【181】#### Selective reporting\n\n【182】All eight studies were deemed to have adequate outcome data reported and therefore we classified all eight studies as being at low risk of bias for this domain.\n\n【183】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【184】We deemed seven studies to have no other potential sources of bias and therefore classified them as being at low risk of bias for this domain ( Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Strober 2013 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ). We judged one study as being at high risk of bias for this domain because that study did not utilize a validated instrument to measure patient‐reported sensitivity ( Akpata 2001 ).\n\n【185】### Effects of interventions\n\n【186】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison**\n\n【187】#### Liner versus no liner\n\n【188】##### Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) ‐ Patient‐reported\n\n【189】Five studies, three of which were at high risk of bias, measured POH using a dichotomous yes/no patient report ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Burrow 2009 ; Efes 2006 ; Wegehaupt 2009 ).\n\n【190】In one study (n = 88; high risk of bias) patient‐reported dichotomous data on POH at 24 hours showed a reduced risk of hypersensitivity in the liner group (risk ratio (RR) 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.64) ( Analysis 1.1 ). This difference was not shown at 1 week or 1 month follow‐up ( Analysis 1.1 ) ( Akpata 2001 ).\n\n【191】One study (n = 344), at high risk of bias, presented visual analog scale (VAS) results for patient‐reported POH at 1 week and 1 month ( Strober 2013 ). A lower mean VAS score was shown in favour of the liner group at both time points (mean difference (MD) ‐0.33; 95% CI ‐0.43 to ‐0.23 and MD ‐0.20; 95% CI ‐0.31 to ‐0.09 respectively) ( Analysis 1.2 ).\n\n【192】An additional study ( Wegehaupt 2009 ) instructed patients to record \"whether any hypersensitivity, pain, or discomfort occurred following treatment.\" Nine of 75 patients in the liner group and 12 of 48 patients that did not receive a liner responded \"yes\" when asked if any hypersensitivity, pain, or discomfort occurred after the restoration was placed. Based on these data they concluded that the occurrence of pain or hypersensitivity does not depend on the remaining dentin thickness, calcium hydroxide lining, or the restorative system used. There was no information regarding when this POH occurred.\n\n【193】##### Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) ‐ Cold response measurement (CRM)\n\n【194】One study (n = 88; high risk of bias) measured POH via CRM in time (seconds) ( Akpata 2001 ). While a beneficial effect was seen in favor of cavities prepared using a liner at 1 week assessment (MD 6.00; 95% CI 1.36 to 10.64), this difference was not seen at any other time point (24 hours or 1 month) ( Analysis 1.3 ).\n\n【195】Two studies (n = 447; high risk of bias) measured POH via a cold response measurement on a VAS ( Burrow 2009 ; Strober 2013 ). No difference between cavities prepared with and without liners were shown at either 1 week (MD ‐0.20; 95% CI ‐0.67 to 0.26) or 1 month follow‐up (MD ‐0.33; 95% CI ‐0.76 to 0.11) ( Analysis 1.4 ).\n\n【196】Burrow 2009 also measured POH via a yes/no CRM. Again, no difference between cavities prepared with and without liners were shown at either 1 week or 1 month ( Analysis 1.5 ).\n\n【197】An additional study ( Boeckler 2012 ) measured POH via CRM using subjective descriptive patient‐response criteria at baseline, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. This study found two restorations in the intervention group (liner) and two restorations in the control group (no liner) exhibiting significant POH at baseline but no subjects reported any POH at 6 months, 1 or 2 years. No data for POH measured up to 1 month postoperatively were reported.\n\n【198】##### Restoration failure\n\n【199】Four of the included trials measured restoration longevity ( Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Browning 2006 ; Efes 2006 ). Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates was shown at 1 year follow‐up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 15.00). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years follow‐up and, again, no failures were shown in either group ( Analysis 1.6 ).\n\n【200】##### Cost\n\n【201】Only one study ( Strober 2013 ) included cost. Strober 2013 concluded that dentists in the United States could save approximately USD 4.50 per filling in materials and office overhead costs by eliminating a resin‐modified glass ionomer lining under resin composite restorations. The authors calculated that this would result in a saving of approximately USD 2000 per dentist per year for an annual saving of approximately USD 82.8 million in the United States.\n\n【202】##### Adverse events\n\n【203】No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Only one study indicated that adverse events would be reported; however, no such report was included in the findings ( Strober 2013 ). Strober 2013 stated that they considered an adverse event to be \"lingering pain upon removal of the stimulus.\" None of the other included studies made any mention of any adverse events.\n\n【204】Discussion\n----------\n\n【205】### Summary of main results\n\n【206】Eight studies, recruiting over 700 participants compared the use of dental cavity liners to no liners for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations. All studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. There was inconsistent evidence regarding postoperative hypersensitivity (either measured using cold response or patient‐reported), with a benefit shown at some, but not all, time points (low‐quality evidence).\n\n【207】Four trials measured restoration longevity. Two of the studies were judged to be at high risk and two at unclear risk of bias. No difference in restoration failure rates was shown at 1 year follow‐up, with no failures reported in either group for three of the four studies; the fourth study had a risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.00) (low‐quality evidence). Three studies evaluated restoration longevity at 2 years follow‐up and, again, no failures were shown in either group.\n\n【208】No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.\n\n【209】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【210】There is limited available evidence on the effects of using a dental cavity liner beneath Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations. The evidence identified is applicable when placing composite‐based restorations in posterior teeth of adult patients. None of the trials evaluated the effects of using a dental cavity liner in the permanent teeth of children under the age of 15. Thus, it may not be appropriate to apply this evidence to permanent teeth in younger children.\n\n【211】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【212】The body of evidence identified in this review does not allow for robust conclusions about the effects of dental cavity liners. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was considered to be of low quality due to only single studies reporting certain outcomes/time points, a high/unclear risk of bias in the individual studies, and imprecision in the pooled estimate. A GRADE rating of low‐quality evidence can be interpreted as meaning that there is a lack of confidence in the effect estimates. Further research is very likely to change these estimates, and our confidence in them.\n\n【213】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【214】Searching of multiple databases, with no language or date restrictions, was intended to limit bias by including all relevant studies. Some studies did not have usable data, and this introduces bias into the review as it distorts our overall view of the effects of dental cavity liners.\n\n【215】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【216】To the best knowledge of these review authors, no studies have been conducted showing any significant benefit to the placement of any dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in permanent teeth in children and adults, either in terms of postoperative hypersensitivity reduction, restoration longevity or any other benefit. To our knowledge, three other systematic reviews have been published on this topic and our findings are similar to all three. One systematic review investigated the effects of a dental cavity liner under Class I and Class II resin‐based composite posterior restorations in primary teeth in children ( Schwendicke 2015 ). The authors concluded that the use of a liner \"is not supported by sufficient clinical evidence.\" A second systematic review investigated the effects of a flowable composite liner under resin‐based composite restorations ( Boruziniat 2016 ). This review contained an in vitro arm and a clinical arm and the authors concluded that \"Application of flowable composite as a liner in composite restorations cannot reduce microleakage or improve clinical performance. All of the clinical studies included in this research showed that the application of flowable composite as liner did not improve the clinical success of restoration in comparison with the control \\[no liner\\] group.\" Six studies were included in the clinical arm of this systematic review with five of them evaluating Class I or Class II restorations or both and one evaluating Class V restorations ( Reis 2006 ). Two of the five studies ( Boeckler 2012 ; Efes 2006 ) evaluating Class I or Class II restorations or both were included in our review but the other three did not meet our inclusion criteria. One of these three studies is listed as a randomized clinical trial but no information regarding the randomization is included in the report ( Ernst 2003 ). The other two studies were performed utilizing the 'open sandwich' technique ( Stefanski 2012 ; van Dijken 2011 ) which we did not include in our review for methodological reasons. The third published systematic review also investigated the effects of a flowable composite or glass ionomer liner or base under Class I and II resin‐based composite posterior restorations ( Nguyen 2015 ). The authors performed this review to answer the following clinical question: \"In patients receiving adhesive restorative treatment for caries, do RC \\[resin composite\\] restorations with a FRC \\[flowable resin composite\\] or GIC \\[glass ionomer cement\\] lining or base (open‐ or closed‐laminate) result in better long‐term performance than RC restorations with no lining or base?.\" This systematic review included 13 studies, four of which are included here in our review ( Akpata 2001 ; Banomyong 2013 ; Boeckler 2012 ; Burrow 2009 ). The remaining nine studies were not included in our review because they investigated sandwich technique restorations ( Grogono 1990 ; Stefanski 2012 ; van Dijken 2011 ), or they were not actually randomized trials despite being labeled as such ( Ernst 2002 ; Ernst 2003 ), or despite not being revealed in the searches performed for our review they have now not been included for the following reasons: Kaurani 2007 was a sensitivity study but the interventions were not randomized; Aboush 2000 and Grogono 1991 were sandwich technique studies not included for methodological reasons; and Burgess 1999 was an abstract reporting on 180 Class II restorations placed randomly with either no liner, resin‐modified glass ionomer (RMGI) liner or flowable composite liner (open sandwich) under resin‐based composite restorations evaluated after 3 years. It \"showed no significant differences between groups\" evaluated on marginal integrity, anatomic form, marginal discoloration, retention, fracture, and recurrent caries. The data presented in this abstract were never reported in any peer reviewed journal as far as we can ascertain. Thus, we cannot include these data in our review because a thorough appraisal of this trial is methodologically impossible even though the data presented agree with our conclusions.\n\n【217】Additionally, the search that forms the basis for this update also provided us with two additional references that specifically support our findings and conclusions and no references that demonstrate or claim any benefits for the use of dental cavity liners under resin‐based composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth. The first such reference was an 18‐year retrospective study that had the stated aim \"to investigate the influence of glass ionomer cement base \\[liner\\] in the survival of posterior composite restorations.\" This matches one of our exact review questions. The hypothesis tested was that \"the use of glass ionomer cement as intermediate material would have no effect in restoration survival, when compared to restorations without a base \\[liner\\] material.\" After performing the retrospective look of 632 restorations in 97 patients, the authors concluded that \"under the limits of this retrospective evaluation, the use of glass ionomer cement as base \\[liner\\] did not affect the survival of resin composite restorations. Acceptable annual failure rates of about 2% after 18 years can be achieved with both techniques, leading to the perspective that a glass ionomer cement layer, placed during treatment may be maintained without clinical detriment, but no improvement in survival should be expected based on such measure\" ( van de Sande 2015 ). We would note that the authors of this report use the term 'base' to describe what we would call a liner, stating in their report that \"the term base will be used to describe the placement of intermediate layers covering most of the dentin part of the cavity.\" No mention was made in the report of any minimum or maximum thickness of the material. This exactly matches our use of the term liner.\n\n【218】The second such reference was a 6‐year retrospective study that reported on the 3‐year survival of restorations placed in primary teeth. The stated aim of this study was \"To evaluate the longevity and factors associated with failure of primary teeth restorations placed in high caries‐risk children.\" While the authors pooled data from anterior and posterior restorations, and from glass ionomer and resin‐based composite restorations, 82% of the restorations evaluated were posterior and 87% received resin‐based composite restorations. The authors concluded that \"the use of a calcium hydroxide liner in deep cavities may have constituted a confounding factor that could have influenced the shorter survival of restorations\" and \"Current evidence does not support \\[the use of\\] cavity liners to maintain pulpal vitality after excavating caries lesions and before restoring cavities of primary teeth. On the contrary, the synthesized data suggests potential advantages of not using liners before filling the cavity\" ( Dalpian 2018 ).\n\n【219】Figures and Tables -\n\n【220】Figure 1\n\n【221】Study flow diagram.\n\n【222】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【223】Figures and Tables -\n\n【224】Figure 2\n\n【225】Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【226】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【227】Figures and Tables -\n\n【228】Analysis 1.1\n\n【229】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 1 Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) by patient report (Y/N).\n\n【230】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【231】Figures and Tables -\n\n【232】Analysis 1.2\n\n【233】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 2 Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) by patient report (VAS).\n\n【234】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【235】Figures and Tables -\n\n【236】Analysis 1.3\n\n【237】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 3 Cold response measurement (CRM) (time it took in seconds for patient to feel cold sensation).\n\n【238】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【239】Figures and Tables -\n\n【240】Analysis 1.4\n\n【241】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 4 Cold response measurement (CRM) (VAS).\n\n【242】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【243】Figures and Tables -\n\n【244】Analysis 1.5\n\n【245】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 5 Cold response measurement (CRM) (Y/N).\n\n【246】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【247】Figures and Tables -\n\n【248】Analysis 1.6\n\n【249】Comparison 1 Liner versus no liner, Outcome 6 Restoration failure at 1 year follow‐up.\n\n【250】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n| **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  | **Liner versus no liner for Class I and Class II resin‐based composite restorations**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  | **Patient or population:** patients requiring Class I or Class II resin‐based composite restorations **Settings:** general practice **Intervention:** liner **Comparison:** no liner  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Illustrative comparative risks \\* (95% CI)**  | **Illustrative comparative risks \\* (95% CI)**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **Assumed risk \\***  | **Corresponding risk**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Outcomes**  | **No liner**  | **Liner**  | **Relative effect(95% CI)**  | **Number of restorations(studies)**  | **Quality of the evidence(GRADE)**  | **Comments**  |\n| **Postoperative hypersensitivity (POH) (Patient‐reported Y/N)** **Follow‐up: 1 week**  | 100 per 1000  | 56 per 1000(26 to 117)  | RR 0.56(0.26 to 1.17)  | 299(3 studies)  | ⊕⊕⊝⊝ 1**low**  | POH was also measured at 24 hours (1 trial at high risk of bias) and 1 month (3 trials at high/unclear risk of bias).

{"seq_id": "a111dfad-e825-456a-aaf0-836817ffbc56", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To determine the effectiveness of interventions to reduce medication errors in hospitalised adults.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】An adverse drug event is an unwanted occurrence after exposure to a drug that is not necessarily caused by the drug. Adverse drug events (ADEs) include adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and preventable adverse drug events, which are adverse drug events associated with a medication error. An adverse drug reaction is defined as any response to a drug which is noxious and unintended. These reactions occur at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of the disease.\n\n【7】Medication errors are broadly defined as any error in the prescribing, dispensing or administration of a drug, irrespective of whether such errors lead to adverse consequences or not ( Williams 2007 ). The Council of Europe ( Council of Europe 2005 ) and the UK Department of Health ( Smith 2004 ) define medication errors as any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, patient or consumer. However, a better definition may be 'the failure to complete a planned action as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim'. Errors can include problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems. ( Kohn 2000 ).\n\n【8】The severity of ADEs has been classified by the Frederick Memorial Healthcare System in its Policy for A Non‐Punitive, System‐Based Adverse Drug Event Reporting Program as described in Pathways for Medication Safety ( AHA 2002 ) in seven categories as follows:\n\n【9】1.  Circumstances or processes that have the potential to cause an adverse drug event.\n    \n2.  An event occurred but the patient was not harmed.\n    \n3.  An event occurred that resulted in the need for increased patient assessments but no change in vital signs and no patient harm.\n    \n4.  An event occurred that resulted in the need for treatment and/or intervention and caused temporary patient harm.\n    \n5.  An event occurred that resulted in initial or prolonged hospitalisation, affected patient participation in an investigational drug study, and/or caused temporary patient harm.\n    \n6.  An event occurred that resulted in permanent patient harm or a near death event, such as anaphylaxis.\n    \n7.  An event occurred that resulted in patient death.\n    \n\n【10】Such events may be related to professional practice, healthcare products, procedures and systems, including prescribing; order communications; product labelling, packaging and nomenclature; compounding; dispensing; distribution; administration; education and monitoring ( Nebeker 2004 ). However, most of the literature on medication errors suggests that prescribing errors are the most prevalent cause ( Kohn 2000 ; World Alliance for Patient Safety 2008 ).\n\n【11】The burden of medication errors and adverse drug events in hospitals is especially important. Medication errors and adverse drug events are associated with substantial death and injury ( Kohn 2000 ). More than half a million patients are injured or die each year in hospitals from adverse drug events (ADEs), which may cost up to USD 5.6 million annually per hospital ( Classen 2005 ).\n\n【12】The Canadian Adverse Events Study showed an adverse event rate of 7.5 per 100 hospital admissions, of which 37% were judged to be preventable ( Baker 2004 ). Another multicenter study in the USA found that medication errors occurred in 5.3 of each 100 medication orders written, half of which were caused by missing medication dosages, 15% involved dose errors and 13% involved route or frequency errors ( Bates 1995 ). Five of the 25 adverse drugs events (20%) identified during the study period were directly associated with medication errors, all of them judged as preventable. A recent systematic review of studies on adverse events in hospitalised patients showed that one of every 10 hospitalised patients is affected by an adverse event, with a median percentage of 43% being preventable. This systematic review estimates the rate of lethal events to be 7.4 per 100 adverse events ( de Vries 2008 ). Other studies suggest that medication errors and adverse drug events are associated with 140,000 deaths annually, and occur in one of every 16 hospitalised patients ( Classen 1997 ; World Alliance for Patient Safety 2008 ). The economic burden associated with this issue is attributed additional costs of hospitalisation of USD 2000 per patient with an adverse drug event ( Classen 1997 ).\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】Attention has been paid to this patient safety issue and the literature has grown in an attempt to identify the causes, frequency and consequences of adverse events and medication errors, as well as to assess the effects of interventions to prevent them ( World Alliance for Patient Safety 2008 ). Most reviews of the evidence about interventions to improve medication safety have identified the following key practices to reach this objective ( de Vries 2008 ; Hodgkinson 2006 ; Ioannidis 2001 ; Shojania 2001 ).\n\n【15】*   Computerised physician ordering entry (CPOE) and clinical decision support systems (CDSS)\n    \n*   Electronic prescription (EP)\n    \n*   Automated dispensing\n    \n*   Bedside terminal systems\n    \n*   Computer‐generated medication administration records\n    \n*   Computer alert systems\n    \n*   Bar codes\n    \n*   Individual patient medication supply\n    \n*   Education and training\n    \n*   Pharmacists\n    \n*   Dedicated nurses\n    \n*   Double‐checking\n    \n*   Partners in patient care\n    \n*   Medication administration review and safety\n    \n*   Utilisation of protocol by triage nurse\n    \n*   Multidisciplinary approach\n    \n*   Syringes marked with doses\n    \n*   Self medication programmes\n    \n*   Illumination in the workplace\n    \n\n【16】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【17】Some authors have called for the implementation of evidence‐based practices to find solutions to this patient safety problem ( Brennan 2005 ). Other systematic reviews have been published, however further research has been reported since the date of their literature searches ( de Vries 2008 ; Hodgkinson 2006 ; Ioannidis 2001 ; Shojania 2001 ). Another recent systematic review only included cohort or simple before after studies conducted in a hospital setting ( Wong 2010 ).\n\n【18】Our systematic review will provide an exhaustive and updated analysis of the available evidence for interventions devoted to preventing medication errors in hospital settings.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】To determine the effectiveness of interventions to reduce medication errors in hospitalised adults.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】The following study designs will be included where they meet the explicit criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group: randomised controlled trials (RCT), quasi‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCT), controlled before and after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies.\n\n【25】#### Types of participants\n\n【26】##### Healthcare professionals\n\n【27】We will consider a study for inclusion if it involves healthcare professionals responsible for prescribing, dispensing or administering medications, in charge of care of adult (> 18) hospitalised patients.\n\n【28】##### Setting\n\n【29】We will include studies based in any settings that provide clinical care to adults in hospital. We will classify the included studies depending on the setting: i) inpatient care (secondary or tertiary units, intensive care units, operating theatres), ii) outpatient care and iii) accident and emergency departments. We will exclude studies based in geriatric, institutional settings caring for the elderly and psychiatric institutions.\n\n【30】We will exclude studies based in settings that provide care to children since this is the focus of another Cochrane review ( Soe 2006 ).\n\n【31】#### Types of interventions\n\n【32】We will categorise interventions applied at the hospital care level to improve patient safety in terms of medication errors according to the updated 2011 EPOC taxonomy of interventions aimed at achieving practice change ( EPOC 2011 ):\n\n【33】##### Delivery arrangements taxonomy\n\n【34】Health service delivery arrangements include changes in who receives care and when, who provides care, the working conditions of those who provide care, co‐ordination of care amongst different providers, where care is provided, the use of information and communication technology to deliver care, and quality and safety systems.\n\n【35】##### Financial arrangements taxonomy\n\n【36】Health financing arrangements comprise the collection of funds, insurance schemes, the purchasing of services, and the use of targeted financial incentives or disincentives.\n\n【37】##### Governance taxonomy\n\n【38】The term ‘governance’ can be defined in several, sometimes overlapping, ways. Its use differs within the social sciences, especially between economics and political science. We have defined governance here as: rules or processes that affect the way in which powers are exercised, particularly with regard to authority, accountability, openness, participation, effectiveness and coherence.\n\n【39】##### Implementation strategies taxonomy\n\n【40】Implementation strategies include interventions designed to bring about changes in healthcare organisations or the behaviour of healthcare professionals or recipients. Quality improvement and safety systems (i.e. structures or organisational arrangements) are included as delivery arrangements.\n\n【41】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【42】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【43】1.  Proportion of patients with a medication error\n    \n2.  Incidence of medication errors\n    \n3.  Proportion of patients with serious adverse drug events defined as categories 6 to 7 ( AHA 2002 )\n    \n4.  Proportion of preventable ADEs defined as undesired reaction to medication that may have been prevented by appropriate drug selection or management ( Hodgkinson 2006 )\n    \n\n【44】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【45】1.  Mortality\n    \n2.  Morbidity\n    \n3.  Cost (resource utilisation)\n    \n4.  Total number of adverse drug events\n    \n5.  Side effects of assessed interventions\n    \n6.  Incidence of serious adverse drug events\n    \n\n【46】Medication errors will include any errors that occur during any of the processes involved in medicines management (e.g. prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administration, documentation and monitoring). We will consider serious adverse drug events as those that are permanently disabling, require or prolong hospitalisation or are lethal or potentially life‐threatening ( AHA 2002 ).\n\n【47】Comparison groups will be another intervention, no intervention or usual care.\n\n【48】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【49】Primary studies will be identified using the following bibliographic databases, sources, and methods. Related systematic reviews will be identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), and the databases listed below.\n\n【50】**Databases**\n\n【51】MEDLINE, OVID (1950‐, In‐Process and other non‐indexed citations)\n\n【52】EMBASE, OVID (1947‐)\n\n【53】The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of the Cochrane Library\n\n【54】CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), EbscoHost (1980‐)\n\n【55】EPOC Group, Specialised Register, Reference Manager\n\n【56】Web of Science, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science, Web of Knowledge\n\n【57】Science Citation Index, Web of Knowledge\n\n【58】Dissertations and Theses, ProQuest \\[1861‐\\]\n\n【59】The OVID Medline strategy provided in Appendix 1 is a draft developed by the author team in consultation with M. Fiander, EPOC Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC). The TSC will assist in finalizing this draft strategy in order to better develop synonyms for medication errors and terms describing the hospital environment. The finalized strategy will be presented in the review.\n\n【60】Search results will be restricted using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity‐ and precision‐maximizing version (2008 revision); and an EPOC Filter to identify CBA, ITS, and non‐RCT designs.\n\n【61】#### Searching other resources\n\n【62】We will also:\n\n【63】a)     Review reference lists of relevant systematic reviews or other publications.\n\n【64】b)     Contact authors of relevant studies or reviews to clarify reported published information or seek unpublished results/data.\n\n【65】c)     Contact researchers with expertise relevant to the review topic or EPOC interventions.\n\n【66】d)     Conduct cited reference searches in ISI Web of Science/Web of Knowledge.\n\n【67】**Trial Registries**\n\n【68】WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/\n\n【69】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【70】#### Selection of studies\n\n【71】Grouped in pairs, the authors will independently screen all titles and abstracts retrieved from the search strategy to assess which studies fit the inclusion criteria. We will obtain copies of all references considered potentially relevant. We will solve any disagreement between the pairs of authors by discussion. If agreement cannot be reached, we will involve an EPOC Group editor to resolve it.\n\n【72】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【73】Two review authors will undertake data abstraction using a modified and piloted version of the EPOC Group data collection checklist. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion between the review authors.\n\n【74】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【75】For randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials we will use ‘Risk of bias’ tables ( Higgins 2008 ), paying special attention to the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and incomplete outcome data. For the other eligible designs we will assess their quality using pre‐established criteria used by the EPOC Group.\n\n【76】We will assess criteria as 'Yes', 'No' or 'Unclear'. We will resolve any discrepancies in quality ratings by discussion and involvement of an arbitrator where necessary.\n\n【77】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【78】##### Reporting\n\n【79】We will tabulate data in natural units for each study. We will report pre‐intervention and post‐intervention means or proportions where baseline results are available for both study and control groups from RCTs, quasi‐RCTs and CBAs. We will calculate the absolute change from baseline with 95% confidence limits. For ITS studies, we will report the main outcomes in natural units with two indicators of the effects of the intervention being documented: the change in the level of outcome immediately after the intervention and the change in the slope of the regression lines.\n\n【80】##### Analytical approach\n\n【81】###### Primary analyses\n\n【82】We will base the primary analyses on consideration of dichotomous process measures (for example, proportion of patients experiencing an adverse reaction). When studies report more than one measure for each endpoint, we will extract the primary measure (as defined by the authors of the study) or the median measure identified. We will present the results for all comparisons using a standard method of presentation where possible. For comparisons of RCTs, quasi‐RCTs and CBAs we will report (separately for each study design):\n\n【83】*   median effect size across included studies;\n    \n*   inter‐quartile ranges of effect sizes across included studies;\n    \n*   range of effect sizes across included studies.\n    \n\n【84】###### Secondary analyses\n\n【85】Secondary analyses will explore consistency of primary analyses with other types of endpoints. We will calculate standardised effect sizes for continuous measures by dividing the difference in mean scores between the intervention and comparison group in each study by an estimate of the (pooled) standard deviation.\n\n【86】###### Methods for reanalysis\n\n【87】We will re‐analyse RCTs, quasi‐RCTs and CBAs with potential unit of analysis errors where possible by recalculating results using the appropriate unit of analysis; otherwise we will contact the authors of such studies for clarification. We will re‐analyse ITS studies using time series regression (where possible). We will estimate the best fit pre‐intervention and post‐intervention lines using linear regression and autocorrelation adjusted for using the Cochrane‐Orcutt method where appropriate ( Draper 1981 ).\n\n【88】Where appropriate, we will use the standard statistical methods of The Cochrane Collaboration for pooling of data from randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials. For categorical and continuous data, we will calculate the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) respectively with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We will use a random‐effects model to take into account the heterogeneity of the various studies.\n\n【89】We will report data in individual tables comparing effect sizes of interventions grouped according to EPOC Group taxonomy (structural, professional and organisational) ( EPOC 2011 ). We will examine data from interrupted time series studies and cluster trials with unit of analysis errors according to the EPOC Group guidelines and use absolute risk differences.\n\n【90】We will use 'Summary of findings' tables for the main comparisons in the review to interpret the results and draw conclusions about the effects (benefits, potential harms and costs) of different interventions, including the size of effects and quality of the evidence for outcomes for which there is evidence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for treatment of patients with unexplained chronic cough.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Cough is defined as an airway defensive reflex comprising an inspiratory phase, followed by a forced expiratory effort initially against a closed glottis ( Fontana 2008 ). The duration of cough can be acute (less than three weeks), subacute (between three and eight weeks), or chronic (longer than eight weeks) ( Irwin 2006 ). Details regarding the theory and treatment of cough can be found in several different clinical fields, including otolaryngology, respiratory medicine, speech and language therapy, respiratory physiology, and physiotherapy ( Vertigan 2016a ).\n\n【7】Unexplained (idiopathic/refractory) chronic cough (UCC) is a cough that persists after common causes have been evaluated and ruled out and medical management options have not offered any convincing relief from symptoms. This condition is a diagnosis of exclusion following a careful diagnostic workup to exclude other causes of cough such as underlying lung/airways disease, gastro‐oesophageal reflux, drugs (such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)), and rhinosinusitis ( Gibson 2016a ; Morice 2006 ; Morice 2007 ; Morice 2007a ; Vertigan 2016a ).\n\n【8】Evidence suggests that UCC may be caused by neural hyper‐responsiveness. Patients with this condition describe an 'irritation' or 'tickle' within the throat and a heightened urge or need to cough ( Hilton 2015 ). In addition, lower concentrations of tussive agents are required to induce cough in patients with UCC compared with healthy controls ( Prudon 2005 ). It is known that vagal afferent bronchopulmonary C‐fibres are important in cough regulation ( Canning 2014 ). Novel drugs targeting C‐fibre receptors have been recently trialed in humans. An oral transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) antagonist had no effect on cough frequency in patients with UCC ( Belvisi 2016 ). However, another trial demonstrated a 75% reduction in cough reflex sensitivity in patients with UCC using a novel P2X3 antagonist ( Abdulqawi 2015 ), supporting the hypothesis of neural hyper‐responsiveness and hypersensitive central cough reflex in UCC.\n\n【9】Furthermore, an overlap has been postulated between chronic cough and other upper airway dysfunction presentations, such as inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO), globus pharyngeus, hyperfunctional muscle tension, voice disorders, and dysphagia symptoms ( Ryan 2009 ; Vertigan 2006 ; Vertigan 2016a ). It has been suggested that these entities may represent different manifestations of an underlying hypersensitive and hyper‐responsive upper airway ( Vertigan 2007; Vertigan 2010 ; Vertigan 2016a ).\n\n【10】### Description of the intervention\n\n【11】Speech and language therapy (SLT) offers a non‐pharmacological intervention for people with UCC who may have exhausted medical treatment for their condition, or who wish to pursue a non‐pharmacological treatment option ( Ryan 2010; Ryan 2014 ; Vertigan 2006 ; Vertigan 2016a ). SLT has been incorporated into the Treatment of Unexplained Chronic Cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report ( Gibson 2016a ), a report detailing treatment of UCC, and the Australian cough guidelines summary statement ( Gibson 2010 ). The aim of SLT intervention is to improve an individual's control over cough, as well as to address symptoms associated with dysphonia and ILO ( Vertigan 2016a ).\n\n【12】Stemple 2009 states that speech and language therapists possess the correct skill set to treat chronic cough via a combination of detailed knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the upper airway, experience in education and training on respiratory physiology and clinical voice disorders, and proven ability to modify laryngeal behaviour ( Altman 2000 ; Stemple 2009 ). As there is a hypothesised and clinically recognised overlap between cough and other upper airway and laryngeal disorders, such as ILO, globus pharyngeus, muscle tension dysphonia, and dysphagic symptoms, SLT professionals have the skills required to identify, assess, and manage these overlapping conditions effectively by applying techniques traditionally used to treat muscle tension voice disorders ( Blager 1998; Blager 2000 ; Carney 1997; Chhetri 2014 ; Dunn 2015 ; Estill 2009 ; Estill 2009a; Ryan 2010; TitzeI 2006 ; Vertigan 2007 ). SLT assessment can also investigate patient‐reported symptoms of dysphagia to identify clinical signs of aspiration that may warrant further investigation.\n\n【13】Furthermore, the trained SLT professional can provide biovisual feedback with videolaryngoscopy, which has been found to be useful for assisting patients in applying techniques and in helping to monitor response to SLT ( Balkissoon 2012 ; Belafsky 2001 ; Christopher 2010 ; Hull 2016 ; Olin 2017 ).\n\n【14】During assessment, the SLT professional evaluates cough characteristics, the urge to cough, and indicators suggestive of ILO ( Ryan 2014 ; Traister 2014 ). Phonation is often cited as a trigger for coughing episodes, and, given the overlap with dysphonia, a clinical voice assessment can use recognised descriptive rating scales of perceptual voice characteristics, such as rough, breathy, and strained vocal qualities. Hyperfunction in the larynx during phonation can signify laryngeal dysfunction and can serve as a contributory factor to cough reflex sensitivity ( Hirano 1981; Omori 2011; Ryan 2014; Vertigan 2007 ).\n\n【15】When available, the SLT professional can assess instrumental voice ( Ryan 2010 ; Zelcer 2002 ), for example, by using the multi‐dimensional voice analysis programme (Computerised Speech Lab; Pentax Medical, Montvale, NJ, USA) or visualising the larynx via videolaryngoscopy during voice use according to a recognised protocol ( RCSLT 2008 ). Manual assessment of tension in the extrinsic laryngeal musculature is a useful tool for assessing hyperfunction, which can be detected in muscle tension voice disorders ( Rubin 2000; Vertigan 2016a ).\n\n【16】Vertigan 2012 and Vertigan 2016 outlined a multi‐dimensional SLT intervention for chronic cough management consisting of the following elements.\n\n【17】#### Education\n\n【18】Education is identified as a crucial element of the SLT approach with focus on encouraging adherence, with the aim of acceptance that patients can control their cough and take ownership of implementing strategies to ignore the urge to cough and stop themselves from coughing. Educators provide information on the importance of sustained application of cough suppression techniques ( Vertigan 2012 ).\n\n【19】Education on the perpetuating nature of the cough is provided, potentially leading to increased sensitivity, laryngeal trauma, and tension. Specific goals for therapy are planned with the patient. The ultimate goal of SLT is for the patient to control the cough, even in the presence of the sensation/urge to cough.\n\n【20】#### Symptom control techniques\n\n【21】The aim of these strategies is to ask the patient to prevent, stop, or interrupt the cough despite having the triggering sensation. The patient is then asked to substitute the cough with a competing response (e.g. distraction, cough suppression swallow, relaxed throat breathing, a sip of fluids, laryngeal deconstriction) ( Estill 2009 ; Vertigan 2007 ). Laryngeal control techniques for any coexisting inducible laryngeal obstruction are also included in the SLT therapy intervention ( Blager 2000; Boone 1993; Chhetri 2014; Kotby 1993 ).\n\n【22】A hierarchy for applying control techniques is devised with the patient; this can include graded exposure to desensitise the patient to particular triggers ( Gibson 2015 )\n\n【23】##### Reducing laryngeal irritation via vocal hygiene\n\n【24】Vocal hygiene advice is commonly used in the SLT approach to clinical voice disorders ( Blager 1988 ), and it may be beneficial in the treatment of UCC ( Vertigan 2012 ). Vocal hygiene consists of advice on effects of smoking, mouth breathing (up to 50% of people with UCC habitually mouth‐breathe), caffeine, and alcohol on laryngeal mucosa. Easy voicing and adequate hydration are emphasised and demonstrated to reduce the risk of phonotrauma ( Boone 1993 ; Kotby 1993 ; Murry 2004 ; Solomon 2014 ; Vertigan 2007 ). Information on diet and behavioural management of gastroesophageal and laryngopharyngeal reflux is provided ( Koufman 2011 ).\n\n【25】#### Psychoeducational counselling\n\n【26】The therapist assesses readiness to engage in SLT, as this may impact the efficacy of therapy ( Prochaska 1982 ). Acceptance that the patient can control the cough (internal locus of control), self‐efficacy ( Bandura 1986 ), and the effort required of the patient are made explicit, with emphasis on treatment being \"hard work\". Realistic, targeted goal setting helps the therapist to direct interventions and monitor progress ( Murry 2004 ; Ryan 2010 ; Vertigan 2012 ).\n\n【27】Overall goals of speech and language therapy interventions can be summarised as follows ( Gibson 2015 ).\n\n【28】1.  Reduce the sensitivity of the cough reflex.\n    \n2.  Encourage improvement in voluntary control of cough.\n    \n3.  Reduce irritation of the larynx.\n    \n\n【29】Whilst previous studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for UCC have involved input from other allied health professionals (e.g. Chamberlain Mitchell 2017 ), it has been noted that the added benefit of contributions of other professionals, in addition to SLTs, is unclear (e.g. Smith 2017 ).\n\n【30】### How the intervention might work\n\n【31】SLT interventions aim to improve individuals' control over cough and symptoms associated with any overlapping dysphonia and ILO ( Vertigan 2016a ), but the mechanism by which the above‐detailed, multi‐modal SLT intervention may reduce cough severity and frequency, leading to improvement in health‐related quality of life, is poorly understood.\n\n【32】It has been postulated that SLT interventions may reduce cough sensitivity in patients with UCC ( Smith 2005 ; Vertigan 2006 ). However, a multi‐centre randomised controlled study demonstrated no differences between intervention and control groups with capsaicin cough challenge ( Chamberlain Mitchell 2017 ). The psychoeducational and control strategies component may support subjective improvement in chronic cough management techniques and may reduce upper airway muscle tension ( Canning 2006 ; Gibson 2009 ). Improved laryngeal hygiene attained via hydration and education on reduction of laryngeal injury may support lower phonation threshold pressure, thereby reducing stimulation of cough receptors ( Casper 2003 ; Solomon 2014) .\n\n【33】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【34】Chronic cough is a significant unmet need. Cough is the most common reason why patients seek medical advice ( Morice 2006 ), and for chronic cough, most patients seek advice three or more times ( Chamberlain Mitchell 2017 ). The prevalence of UCC in the population varies in the most recent studies from 4% ( Colak 2017 ) to 9.6% ( Song 2015 ). Cough presents a considerable financial burden, with acute cough costing approximately £979 million in the UK, including £875 million in loss of productivity and £104 million in healthcare costs ( Morice 2006 ). The cost of chronic cough to the economy remains unclear.\n\n【35】The negative impact of chronic cough on quality of life is far reaching and has been well described ( Decalmer 2007 ; French 1998 ). Urinary incontinence associated with chronic cough is a particularly distressing symptom ( Hrisanfow 2013 ).\n\n【36】Few effective medical treatments for individuals with UCC are known. For this group, current guidelines advocate the use of gabapentin ( Gibson 2016a ; Vertigan 2016a ). One study demonstrated a reduction in subjective cough scores in response to slow‐release morphine sulphate ( Morice 2007 ; Morice 2007a) . Another study examined amitriptyline in patients with postviral vagal neuropathy and cough, but guidelines do not currently recommend this treatment ( Jeyakumar 2006 ). SLT has been advocated as an attractive non‐pharmacological option for managing UCC without the risks and side effects associated with pharmacological agents; SLT is the focus of this review ( Krakowiak 2017 ) _._\n\n【37】Objectives\n----------\n\n【38】To evaluate the effectiveness of speech and language therapy for treatment of patients with unexplained chronic cough.\n\n【39】Methods\n-------\n\n【40】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【41】#### Types of studies\n\n【42】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We will include studies reported in full text, those published as an abstract only, and unpublished data. We will include cluster trials and first period data from cross‐over trials, if available.\n\n【43】#### Types of participants\n\n【44】We will include participants with a diagnosis of chronic unexplained (idiopathic/refractory) cough who have undergone a full diagnostic workup to exclude an underlying cause, as per published guidelines or local protocols. If we identify eligible studies in children (17 years of age and younger), we will analyse them separately from adult studies.\n\n【45】#### Types of interventions\n\n【46】We will include studies that use recognised speech and language therapy techniques for UCC, such as the multi‐dimensional SLT intervention described in the Background section (education, symptom control or vocal hygiene, psychoeducational counselling), and/or other recognised SLT laryngeal control techniques as defined by trialists.\n\n【47】We will include other co‐interventions, provided they are not part of the randomised treatment.\n\n【48】We will include studies comparing speech and language therapy and usual care versus usual care, such as reassurance, lifestyle advice, and background medications. We will also include studies that have compared SLT versus an 'active' control such as non‐prescribed/over‐the‐counter cough products (e.g. lozenges). We will exclude from this review studies in which participants received angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis). We will include trials that deliver any number of sessions but will investigate in subgroup analyses the number of sessions provided ( Ryan 2010 ).\n\n【49】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【50】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【51】1.  Health‐related quality of life (assessed via a validated measure)\n    \n2.  Serious adverse events.\n    \n\n【52】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【53】1.  Objective cough counts (e.g. using the Leicester cough monitor)\n    \n2.  Symptoms (preferentially assessed on validated symptom scales)\n    \n3.  Clinical improvement (as defined by trialists)\n    \n4.  Subjective measures of cough (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS)/numerical cough scale score)\n    \n5.  Cough reflex sensitivity (as measured by cough challenge)\n    \n6.  Adverse events/side effects\n    \n\n【54】Reporting in the study one or more of the outcomes listed is not an inclusion criterion for this review.\n\n【55】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【56】#### Electronic searches\n\n【57】We will identify studies from the following sources.\n\n【58】1.  Cochrane Airways Trials Register.\n    \n2.  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), via the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS‐Web).\n    \n3.  MEDLINE Ovid SP 1946 to date.\n    \n4.  Embase Ovid SP 1974 to date.\n    \n\n【59】We have presented the search strategy for MEDLINE in Appendix 1 . We will adapt this for use in other databases.\n\n【60】In addition, we will search the following trials registries.\n\n【61】1.  US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).\n    \n2.  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch).\n    \n\n【62】We will search all sources from inception to the present, with no restriction on language of publication.\n\n【63】#### Searching other resources\n\n【64】We will check the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We will search for errata or retractions from included studies published in full text on PubMed and will report within the review the date this was done.\n\n【65】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【66】#### Selection of studies\n\n【67】Two review authors (CS and PM) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of the search results and will code them as 'retrieve' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. We will retrieve the full‐text study reports of all potentially eligible studies, and two review authors (CS and PM) will independently screen them for inclusion, while recording reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion; if required, we will consult a third person/review author (AV). We will identify and exclude duplicates and will collate multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' tables ( Moher 2009 ).\n\n【68】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【69】We will use a data collection form that has been piloted on at least one study in the review to record study characteristics and outcome data. Two review authors (SM and JB) will extract the following study characteristics from included studies.\n\n【70】1.  Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of any 'run‐in' period, number of study centres and locations, study setting, withdrawals, and dates of study.\n    \n2.  Participants: N, mean age, age range, gender, severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, baseline lung function, smoking history, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.\n    \n3.  Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, and excluded medications.\n    \n4.  Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and time points reported.\n    \n5.  Notes: funding for studies and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors.\n    \n\n【71】Two review authors (SM and JB) will independently extract outcome data from included studies. We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving a third person/review author (PM). One review author (SM) will transfer data into the Review Manager file ( RevMan 2014 ). A second review author (CS) will double‐check that study characteristics and data are entered correctly by comparing data presented in the systematic review against the study reports.\n\n【72】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【73】Two review authors (SM and JB) will assess risk of bias independently for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by consultation with another review author (PM). We will assess risk of bias according to the following domains.\n\n【74】1.  Random sequence generation.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment.\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel.\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment.\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting.\n    \n7.  Other bias.\n    \n\n【75】We will judge each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear and will provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes when necessary (e.g. for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of bias for all‐cause mortality may be very different than for use of a patient‐reported pain scale). When information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【76】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account risk of bias for studies that contribute to that outcome.\n\n【77】##### Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review\n\n【78】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and will justify any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.\n\n【79】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【80】We will analyse dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). If data from rating scales are combined in a meta‐analysis, we will ensure that they are entered with a consistent direction of effect (e.g. lower scores always indicate improvement).\n\n【81】We will undertake meta‐analyses only when this is meaningful, that is, when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense.\n\n【82】We will describe skewed data narratively (e.g. as medians and interquartile ranges for each group).\n\n【83】When multiple trial arms are reported in a single study, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. intervention A vs usual care and intervention B vs usual care) are combined in the same meta‐analysis, we will either combine the active arms or halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【84】If adjusted analyses are available (ANOVA or ANCOVA), we will use these as a preference in our meta‐analyses. If both change from baseline and endpoint scores are available for continuous data, we will use change from baseline unless there is low correlation between measurements in individuals. If a study reports outcomes at multiple time points, we will use change in baseline and endpoint scores.\n\n【85】When both per‐protocol/completer and intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses are provided in a single report, we will use the latter.\n\n【86】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【87】For dichotomous outcomes, we will use participants, rather than events, as the unit of analysis (i.e. number of people admitted to hospital, rather than number of admissions per person). However, if rate ratios are reported in a study, we will analyse them on this basis. We will meta‐analyse data from cluster‐RCTs only if available data have been adjusted (or can be adjusted) to account for the clustering.\n\n【88】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【89】We will contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data when possible (e.g. when a study is identified as an abstract only). When this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will take this into consideration when determining the GRADE rating for affected outcomes.\n\n【90】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【91】We will use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the studies in each analysis. If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will report this and explore possible causes by performing prespecified subgroup analysis.\n\n【92】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【93】If we are able to pool more than 10 studies, we will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small‐study and publication biases.\n\n【94】#### Data synthesis\n\n【95】We will use a random‐effects model and will perform a sensitivity analysis with a fixed‐effect model.\n\n【96】##### 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【97】We will create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following outcomes.\n\n【98】###### Primary outcomes\n\n【99】1.  Health‐related quality of life (assessed with a validated measure)\n    \n2.  Serious adverse events\n    \n\n【100】###### Secondary outcomes\n\n【101】1.  Symptoms\n    \n2.  Clinical improvement (as defined by trialists)\n    \n3.  Subjective measures of cough (e.g. VAS/numerical cough score)\n    \n4.  Cough reflex sensitivity (as measured by cough challenge)\n    \n5.  Objective cough counts\n    \n6.  Adverse events/side effects\n    \n\n【102】Reporting one or more of the outcomes listed here in the study is not an inclusion criterion for the review.\n\n【103】We will use the five GRADE considerations (risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to studies that contribute data for the prespecified outcomes. We will use the methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ), using GRADEpro software ( GRADEpro GDT ). We will justify all decisions to downgrade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review when necessary.\n\n【104】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【105】We plan to carry out the following subgroup analysis on our two primary outcomes (health‐related quality of life and serious adverse events).\n\n【106】1.  Number of sessions of SLT (one to three sessions vs four to six sessions vs seven or more sessions).\n    \n2.  Speech and language therapist delivered intervention versus intervention delivered by other healthcare professionals.\n    \n\n【107】We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager ( RevMan 2014 ).\n\n【108】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【109】We plan to conduct sensitivity analyses by removing studies when the method of randomisation is judged as unclear or high in the risk of bias assessment. We also plan to conduct sensitivity analyses by removing studies with an active control arm.\n\n【110】We will compare the results from a fixed‐effect model with those from the random‐effects model.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】This review aims to look at the benefits and harms of LESS‐N compared with the current standard of laparoscopic nephrectomy for patients undergoing organ donation.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign kidney conditions was first performed in 1991 ( Clayman 1991 ) and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was successfully initiated in 1995 ( Ratner 1995 ). In the years since, laparoscopic nephrectomy for both benign disease and organ donation has become the technique of choice in most major academic centres worldwide ( Canes 2010 ; Kaouk 2011 ; Kurien 2011 ; Ramasamy 2011 ). Laparoscopic nephrectomy has gained popularity due to decreased morbidity, better quality of life, shorter hospital stay, rapid recovery period and return to normal daily activities, better cosmetic results, and reduced postoperative pain when compared with open nephrectomy ( Kok 2006 ; Kurien 2011 ; Tugcu 2010 ).\n\n【6】### Description of the condition\n\n【7】Simple nephrectomy procedures are being conducted for benign conditions such as renovascular hypertension, chronic pain syndromes (symptomatic acquired renal cystic disease, loin pain/haematuria syndrome), chronic infection processes (chronic pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, renal tuberculosis), in addition to live donor nephrectomy for kidney transplantation ( Walsh 2012 ). Because nephrectomy for transplantation involves live donors, reducing postoperative morbidity is paramount; hence, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has become the preferred technique in many transplant units ( Walsh 2012 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Laparoendoscopic surgery is the natural evolution of laparoscopic surgery and has been made possible by the development of laparoscopic technology and instruments, in addition to increasing surgical skills ( Granberg 2010 ). This was made possible by the development of multichannel single ports and curved articulating instruments ( Canes 2010 ; Granberg 2010 ). Though various terms have been used to describe this method, the LaparoEndoscopic Single Site Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research has agreed on 'laparoendoscopic single‐site surgery' (LESS) ( Tugcu 2010 ). Several centres have published their results of LESS nephrectomy (LESS‐N), partial nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, and many other urological procedures ( Canes 2010 ; Kaouk 2011 ; Kurien 2011 ; Park 2011 ; Tugcu 2010 ; Walsh 2012 ). Rane 2007 first described a single port nephrectomy in 2007 which could potentially replace standard laparoscopy.\n\n【10】### How the intervention might work\n\n【11】LESS‐N has been reported to be a safe and effective alternative to laparoscopic nephrectomy with better cosmetic results and less postoperative pain ( Canes 2010 ; Kurien 2011 ; Ramasamy 2011 ; Tugcu 2010 ). However, these advantages have only been reported from small cohort studies. While its benefit might be greater for cosmetic results, as shown in a survey conducted by Park 2011 , other studies of patients who underwent LESS‐N compared to laparoscopic and open kidney surgery found that there was a significant overall benefit of LESS‐N over these two modalities ( Desai 2011 ; Kaouk 2011 ). However, a comparison of complications of LESS‐N versus laparoscopic nephrectomy using the modified Clavien grading system found that LESS‐N was as safe as laparoscopic nephrectomy with similar postoperative outcomes and low morbidity ( Ramasamy 2011 ).\n\n【12】The reduced morbidity of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has encouraged more potential donors to be evaluated for surgery and, if LESS‐N can be shown to safely offer significant benefits, then more patients might benefit from the further expansion of the live donor pool ( Canes 2010 ). Furthermore, LESS‐N can provide a safe and effective alternative to laparoscopic nephrectomy for patients suffering from benign kidney disease such as xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, symptomatic renal cysts, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction, as the resection specimen can be easily removed through a single port ( Permpongkosol 2011 ).\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】Though dialysis is an alternative in patients with end‐stage kidney disease, the accompanying increase in morbidity and mortality greatly reduces the long term survival of these patients ( Gajdos 2013 ; Suzuki 2012 ; Unsal 2012 ). Therefore, kidney transplantation is vital for these patients to allow for a potentially longer survival. To ensure live donor organs are available, methods for reducing convalescence, postoperative complications, and improving cosmetic results are essential. This might lead to more willing donors ( Canes 2010 ; Soliman 2011 ). These methods include laparoscopic surgery and potentially more so single‐site laparoscopic surgery. The quicker recovery period and reduced pain attributed to these surgical techniques (LESS‐N and laparoscopic nephrectomy) can improve the immediate postoperative quality of life for both donor patients and those who undergo the procedure for benign disease. Evaluating the difference between LESS‐N and laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients undergoing the procedures for both benign disease as well as live kidney donation will indicate which procedure is optimal in improving these factors.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】This review aims to look at the benefits and harms of LESS‐N compared with the current standard of laparoscopic nephrectomy for patients undergoing organ donation.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparisons of LESS‐N and laparoscopic nephrectomy.\n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】##### Inclusion criteria\n\n【23】All adult patients undergoing nephrectomy for live organ donation.\n\n【24】##### Exclusion criteria\n\n【25】Studies on children, patients undergoing a nephrectomy for cancer, or a comparison of LESS‐N to any other procedure other than laparoscopic nephrectomy will be excluded. In addition to abstract publication and reports from meetings will also be excluded.\n\n【26】#### Types of interventions\n\n【27】The intervention is LESS‐N compared to laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, conducted by the same surgical team with an experience laparoscopist (who has surpassed their learning curve for the procedure) leading the procedure.\n\n【28】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【29】1.  Patient demographics (age, sex, body mass index, ASA score)\n    \n2.

The Cochrane Renal Group’s Specialised Register contains studies identified from the following sources.\n\n【39】1.  Monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\n    \n2.  Weekly searches of MEDLINE OVID SP\n    \n3.  Handsearching of renal‐related journals and the proceedings of major renal conferences\n    \n4.  Searching of the current year of EMBASE OVID SP\n    \n5.  Weekly current awareness alerts for selected renal journals\n    \n6.  Searches of the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.\n    \n\n【40】Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE based on the scope of the Cochrane Renal Group. Details of these strategies, as well as a list of handsearched journals, conference proceedings and current awareness alerts, are available in the Specialised Register section of information about the Cochrane Renal Group .\n\n【41】See Appendix 1 for search terms used in strategies for this review.\n\n【42】#### Searching other resources\n\n【43】1.  Reference lists of clinical practice guidelines, review articles and relevant studies.\n    \n2.  Letters seeking information about unpublished or incomplete studies to investigators known to be involved in previous studies.\n    \n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】The search strategy described will be used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts will be screened independently by three authors who will discard studies that are not applicable; however, studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies will be retained initially. Three authors will independently assess retrieved abstracts and, if necessary the full text, of these studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria.\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】Data extraction will be carried out independently by three authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals will be included if translation is possible (e.g. via web‐based translation tools) and the data can be extracted. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports will be grouped together and only the publication with the most complete data will be used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data will be used. Any discrepancy between published versions will be highlighted. Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus or arbitration by two authors.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】The following items will be independently assessed by three authors using the risk of bias assessment tool ( Higgins 2011 ) (see Appendix 2 ).\n\n【51】*   Was there adequate sequence generation (selection bias)?\n    \n*   Was allocation adequately concealed (selection bias)?\n    \n*   Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study (detection bias)?\n    \n    *   Participants and personnel\n        \n    *   Outcome assessors\n        \n*   Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed (attrition bias)?\n    \n*   Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting (reporting bias)?\n    \n*   Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias?\n    \n\n【52】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【53】Dichotomous outcomes, such as patient demographics, complications, blood transfusion rates, conversion rates, and graft survival, will be expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous outcomes, such as operative times, blood loss, postoperative pain scores, length of hospital stay, length of time to return to normal activities, and cost analysis will be expressed as mean difference (MD) or SMD if different scales (e.g. pain scores) have been used.\n\n【54】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【55】Only simple parallel group designs are available for this surgical technique comparison.\n\n【56】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【57】Any further information required from the original author will be requested by written correspondence (e.g. emailing the corresponding author) and any relevant information obtained in this manner will be included in the review. Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, randomised patients as well as intention‐to‐treat, as‐treated and per‐protocol population will be carefully performed. Attrition rates, for example drop‐outs, losses to follow‐up and withdrawals will be investigated. Issues of missing data and imputation methods (e.g. last‐observation‐carried‐forward) will be critically appraised ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【58】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【59】Heterogeneity will be analysed using a Chi² test on N‐1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test ( Higgins 2003 ). I² values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity.\n\n【60】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【61】If possible, funnel plots will be used to assess for the potential existence of small study bias (study effects versus study size) ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【62】#### Data synthesis\n\n【63】Data will be pooled using the random‐effects model but the fixed‐effect model will also be used to ensure robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to outliers.\n\n【64】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【65】A subgroup analysis will be used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants, analyses of the impact of studies with poor methodology on the final result). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to demographics such as age and weight. Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to experience of the operating surgeon or assisting staff. Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI will be calculated for each outcome.\n\n【66】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【67】We will perform sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size:\n\n【68】*   repeating the analysis taking account of risk of bias\n    \n*   repeating the analysis excluding any very long or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results\n    \n*   repeating the analysis excluding studies using the following filters:\n    \n    *   diagnostic criteria\n        \n    *   language of publication\n        \n    *   source of funding (industry versus other)\n        \n    *   country\n        \n    *   conversion rate\n        \n    *   donation versus kidney disease nephrectomy\n        \n    *   extraction site", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the effective management of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for reducing fatigue in patients with a primary brain tumour (PBT).\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Cancer‐related fatigue is 'a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning' ( NCCN 2014 ). Cancer‐related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatment ( Roscoe 2002 ), occurring across various cancer types ( Stone 2000 ) and in disease‐free survivors ( Servaes 2007 ). As the scientific knowledge about cancer‐related fatigue expands, the importance of its effective management is increasingly recognised by oncologists ( Goedendorp 2009 ).\n\n【7】#### Prevalence of fatigue in primary brain tumours\n\n【8】Within the entire cancer population, fatigue is often particularly experienced by patients with a primary brain tumour (PBT). Fatigue in PBT has been studied both as a primary outcome ( Armstrong 2010 ; Lovely 1999 ) and as a secondary outcome to related symptoms such as anxiety and depression ( Rooney 2011 ), quality of life ( Kvale 2009 ) and sleep‐wake disturbances ( Miaskowski 2011 ). Prevalence estimates range from 25% to over 90%. At the highest, 96% of high‐grade glioma patients reported moderate or severe fatigue in one study ( Fox 2007 ). Studies with mixed high‐grade and low‐grade tumour populations estimate 42% of PBT patients suffer from fatigue ( Pelletier 2002 ). Additionally, although many studies focus on the initial phases of diagnosis and treatment, fatigue remains troublesome throughout the course of survivorship. For example, fatigue can be prevalent across the 12 months following PBT diagnosis ( Molassiotis 2010 ), with fatigue reported in 39% of low‐grade glioma patients sampled more than eight years after diagnosis ( Struik 2009 ).\n\n【9】#### Associated clinical variables\n\n【10】The clinical variable most frequently associated with fatigue in PBT is cranial radiation therapy, with an estimated report of fatigue in 80% of patients undertaking radiation therapy ( Lovely 1999 ). One mechanism by which radiation therapy may exacerbate fatigue is via endocrine dysfunction, when the irradiated area includes the hypothalamus, or pituitary gland, or both. The hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis feedback system is responsible for controlling the secretion of many hormones that regulate many body processes, including sleep ( Arlt 1997 ; Taphoorn 1995 ). Fatigue is also a recognised side effect of many of the medications taken by PBT patients, including anticonvulsant drugs ( Lu 2009 ; Maschio 2008 ; Struik 2009 ), and corticosteroids ( Drappatz 2007 ; Hinds 2007 ).\n\n【11】Fatigue is further associated with sleep disturbance, cognitive complaints, depression, and anxiety ( Armstrong 2010 ; Fox 2007 ; Pelletier 2002 ), and this cluster of symptoms may significantly influence patients' quality of life ( Fox 2007 ). Symptom clustering can make the presence of fatigue hard to distinguish from other symptoms, like anxiety or depression ( Rooney 2011 ). Therefore, fatigue is perhaps best investigated as a multifactorial symptom, alongside other related reported issues ( Armstrong 2010 ).\n\n【12】The influence of tumour grade on fatigue remains unclear. Some authors find fatigue to be more common in high‐grade than in low‐grade tumours ( Salo 2002 ), while others do not ( Armstrong 2010 ; Pelletier 2002 ).\n\n【13】#### Methods of measuring fatigue\n\n【14】Many tools have been developed to measure fatigue in patients with cancer ( Jean‐Pierre 2007 ). The Brief Fatigue Inventory detailed in Mendoza 1999 , has been used in several studies including brain tumour correlational studies ( Kim 2012 ), and clinical trials ( Gehring 2012 ). Other measurement tools validated for use in cancer include the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Fatigue ( Yellen 1997 ), the Cancer‐Related Fatigue Distress Scale ( Holley 2000 ), the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire ( Glaus 1998 ), the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale ( Piper 1998 ), and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory ( Stein 2004 ). Several general and brain tumour‐specific quality of life measures also assess fatigue, such as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Brain (FACT‐Br) ( Cella 1993 ), the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumour Module (MDASI‐BT) ( Armstrong 2006 ), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL) ( WHOQOL Group 1995 ). The large number of different tools available, and the fact that each instrument relies on subjective patient reporting of one or several fatigue domains, highlights the need for both a systematic review, and caution when combining study data to summarise findings.\n\n【15】### Description of the intervention\n\n【16】The review will include all interventions for fatigue in PBT patients. These may include pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions, and general strategies for the specific management of fatigue. We define pharmacological interventions as a drug, given by any route, at any therapeutic dose, with the primary intention of treating fatigue in persons with a PBT. Such drugs may include psychostimulants and antidepressants. Non‐pharmacological interventions will be defined as any psychological or behavioural treatment, given with the primary aim of improving fatigue in PBT, including physical activity, physically‐based therapies, and psychosocial interventions.\n\n【17】### How the intervention might work\n\n【18】Recent studies have started to explore interventions aimed at improving and alleviating symptoms of fatigue, by targeting pharmacological or non‐pharmacological pathways.\n\n【19】#### Pharmacological Interventions\n\n【20】Pharmacological treatments might reduce fatigue by acting on critical neurotransmitter pathways. For example, the central nervous system stimulant, methylphenidate, is suggested to enhance neural signal processing by increasing concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine ( Volkow 2002 ). Similarly, the central nervous system stimulant, modafinil, has been associated with enhancing the effect of dopamine, associated with improved wakefulness and motivation ( Young 2010 ).\n\n【21】#### Non‐Pharmacological Interventions\n\n【22】Psychological interventions may improve fatigue by introducing and reinforcing coping strategies, activity planning, and fatigue education ( Armstrong 2012 ). This approach has been shown to be effective through the use of cognitive behavioural therapy, an approach that identifies the negative or maladaptive thoughts/beliefs of patients about fatigue, challenging and replacing them with more helpful and realistic alternatives ( Beck 1979 ).\n\n【23】These strategies can be used alongside the promotion of behavioural changes such as exercise. Exercise may improve fatigue in PBT patients by increasing mental and physical stamina. Winningham's Psychobiological‐Entropy model proposes, for example, that a reduction in fatigue can be achieved through a balance between activity and rest ( Winningham 1992 ). Previously, rest was recommended for cancer patients with fatigue, however, rest could promote muscle wasting and decreasing cardiorespiratory fitness further, adding to the perception of fatigue ( Dimeo 2001 ). By increasing functional capacity, exercise could improve the patient's perception of fatigue ( NCCN 2014 ). Additionally, exercise can also relieve the emotional and mental components of fatigue by alleviating anxiety and improving mood ( Dimeo 2001 ).\n\n【24】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【25】There is a pressing need for a high quality review of studies for interventions for managing fatigue in patients with PBT, as fatigue is consistently the single most frequently reported symptom in studies of patients with PBT. With survival times for low‐grade PBT typically measured in years, and survival times for certain subgroups of high‐grade PBT patients gradually increasing, there is great potential benefit in establishing which interventions are effective for fatigue. Effective interventions could improve quality of life, yet the multifactorial nature of fatigue (potentially including genetic, neuroendocrine, immune and psychosocial causes) makes it a symptom that can be particularly difficult to treat ( Bowe 2012 ).\n\n【26】A clear synthesis of the evidence for the effectiveness of managing fatigue in PBT is currently lacking. This review will answer a clinically useful research question: what are the effective interventions for managing fatigue in adults with a primary brain tumour?\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】To assess the effective management of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions for reducing fatigue in patients with a primary brain tumour (PBT).\n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) for the management of fatigue in adults with PBT, where fatigue is (one of) the primary or secondary therapeutic outcome(s). Due to the prediction that there may currently be few RCTs that satisfy the inclusion criteria, we will include a narrative description of relevant non‐RCTs in the 'Excluded studies' section. This will provide valuable information about interventions that may warrant further investigation. Consequently, we will not include an ‘RCT‐only’ filter in the initial search, but will only include RCTs in the meta‐analysis.\n\n【33】#### Types of participants\n\n【34】We will include studies that evaluate the effect of interventions for adults (aged 16 years or older) who have self reported fatigue (via a questionnaire, validated measure, or presence/absence report), and have a histological diagnosis of PBT at any stage in their illness, regardless of sex, tumour stage, tumour type and cancer treatment received. We will exclude studies evaluating the treatment of fatigue in children, and studies that include non‐fatigued participants in the treatment group.\n\n【35】#### Types of interventions\n\n【36】##### Pharmacological interventions\n\n【37】For pharmacological interventions, we will investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of any drug, given by any route, and at any therapeutic dose, with the intention of treating fatigue in PBT. Such drugs are likely to include psychostimulants, and may include antidepressants. For ethical reasons, RCTs of psychoactive drugs may not automatically include a placebo arm. In order to increase the relevance of the review we will include studies without a placebo arm, provided that participants have been randomised to a control group of some kind (e.g. treatment as usual, another active drug, or allocation to a waiting list).\n\n【38】##### Non‐pharmacological interventions\n\n【39】For psychological interventions, we will study any cognitive treatment given with the aim of improving fatigue in PBT. For behavioural interventions, we will investigate the efficacy of any behavioural or social treatment given for the improvement of fatigue in PBT; this may include exercise and energy management techniques. We will include RCTs where the control group is allocated to treatment as usual, or to a waiting list.\n\n【40】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【41】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【42】The primary outcome will be fatigue at primary study endpoint. Due to potential differences in efficacy endpoints between the different interventions we will analyse both short‐term and long‐term effects of these interventions, when the data are available.\n\n【43】Fatigue may be summarised categorically as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ (e.g. in response to a clinical interview), or else quantified ordinally on a rating scale assessing fatigue. Such rating scales can be specific to fatigue, or may assess fatigue as part of a wider symptom screen (e.g. as part of quality of life). We will include studies where fatigue is self reported, using any validated method. Due to the subjective nature of fatigue, we will not include studies using clinician‐reported or relative‐or carer‐reported measures, as these may not be a true reflection of the patients' symptoms.\n\n【44】Where fatigue is measured by a rating scale, we will quantify its improvement with respect to the recommended scale threshold for ‘caseness’. Where possible, we will also record total number of patients reaching 'non‐fatigued' status.\n\n【45】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【46】*   General functioning, including quality of life measurements, and depression and cognitive outcomes according to validated measures.\n    \n*   Adverse events, as reported by studies (e.g. insomnia).\n    \n\n【47】Where possible and appropriate, we will combine these outcomes in a meta‐analysis. The secondary outcomes are not criteria for eligibility for this review, but are outcomes that will be noted and reviewed if recorded.\n\n【48】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【49】#### Electronic searches\n\n【50】We will search the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , current issue), MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), PsycINFO (1974 to present), and CINAHL (1982 to present). The MEDLINE search strategy is listed in Appendix 1 . For databases other than MEDLINE, we will adapt the search strategy accordingly. We will not apply any language restrictions in any of the searches.\n\n【51】#### Searching other resources\n\n【52】##### Unpublished and grey literature\n\n【53】We will search online databases of registered clinical trials to identify ongoing trials. We will also approach the major co‐operative trial groups active in this area.\n\n【54】##### Handsearching\n\n【55】We will handsearch the reference lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews. We will handsearch journal and conference materials over the past year from the following sources.\n\n【56】*   Annual Meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)\n    \n*   Annual meeting of the European Association of Neuro‐Oncology (EANO)\n    \n*   Annual meeting of the World Federation of Neuro‐Oncology (WFNO)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuro‐Oncology (SNO)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the Society for Behavioral Medicine (SBM)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the International Psycho‐Oncology Society (IPOS)\n    \n*   Annual Meeting of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)\n    \n\n【57】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【58】#### Selection of studies\n\n【59】We will download all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching to the reference management database EndNote. We will remove duplicates and three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) will independently examine the remaining references. The review authors will not be blinded to the authors or affiliations of the studies. We will exclude those studies that clearly do not meet the inclusion criteria, and we will obtain copies of the full text of potentially relevant references. Three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) will independently assess the eligibility of retrieved papers. We will resolve disagreements by discussion and document reasons for exclusion.\n\n【60】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【61】##### Data Extraction\n\n【62】For included trials, we will extract data as recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). Three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) will independently extract data onto a data extraction form specially designed for the review.\n\n【63】We will extract data on the following.\n\n【64】*   Article details (author, year of publication, journal citation, country and language).\n    \n*   Intervention (characteristics and duration).\n    \n*   Study design and methodology (including inclusion and exclusion criteria, assignment process, timing of measurements, concealment).\n    \n*   Population demographics and total number involved.\n    \n*   Details of participants' health status (including tumour pathology and treatment details).\n    \n*   Dichotomous and continuous outcome measures (fatigue, cognitive functioning, quality of life, depression, overall survival, progression‐free survival, and adverse events).\n    \n*   Risk of bias.\n    \n\n【65】Where possible, we will extract all data relevant to an intention‐to‐treat analysis, in which participants are analysed in groups to which they are assigned.\n\n【66】##### Data Management\n\n【67】We will collate and enter data into Review Manager 5 ( RevMan 2014 ). For continuous outcomes (e.g. fatigue and quality of life measures), we will extract the final value and standard deviation of the outcome of interest, and the number of patients assessed at endpoint in each treatment arm at the end of follow‐up, in order to estimate the mean difference between treatment arms and its standard error. We will note the time points at which outcomes were collected and reported.\n\n【68】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【69】We will assess the risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool ( Higgins 2011 ). This will include assessment of:\n\n【70】*   selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment;\n    \n*   performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel (patients and treatment providers);\n    \n*   detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment;\n    \n*   performance bias: similar care to patient out with the intervention they received;\n    \n*   attrition bias: incomplete outcome data;\n    \n*   reporting bias: selective reporting of outcomes; and\n    \n*   other possible sources of bias.\n    \n\n【71】Three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) will apply the 'Risk of bias' tool independently and differences will be resolved by discussion. We will summarise results in both a 'Risk of bias' graph and a 'Risk of bias' summary. We will interpret the results of the meta‐analyses in light of the findings with respect to risk of bias (see Appendix 2 for the 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We will judge and report all bias criteria in terms of 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias. We will classify criteria as having an unclear risk of bias when insufficient information is provided, or when there is uncertainty over the potential for bias.\n\n【72】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【73】##### Continuous data\n\n【74】For continuous outcomes (e.g. fatigue scales, cognitive tests and measures, depression measures, quality of life measures), we will express the treatment effect as a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), if trials measure these outcomes on the same scale. We will extract post intervention data to calculate MD, the final value and standard deviation (SD) of the outcome of interest, and the number of participants assessed in each treatment arm at the end of follow‐up. If trials measure outcomes on different scales, we will express treatment effect as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between treatment arms, with 95% CIs.\n\n【75】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【76】For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. fatigue) we will extract the number of patients in each treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest, at baseline and at study endpoint. We will dichotomise fatigue using validated thresholds.\n\n【77】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【78】Unit of analysis issues will be reviewed by three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) according to _The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,_ and differences will be resolved by discussion ( Higgins 2011 ). These may include reports where:  \n\n【79】*   groups of individuals are randomised together to the same intervention (i.e. cluster‐randomised trials);  \n    \n*   there are multiple observations for the same outcome (e.g. repeated measurements, recurring events).\n    \n\n【80】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【81】We will not impute missing outcome data for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, if data are missing, or only imputed data were reported, we will contact trial authors to request data on the outcomes among participants who were assessed. We will include details of missing data in the narrative summary and 'Risk of bias' table, alongside an assessment of the extent to which the missing data could have altered the results of the review.\n\n【82】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【83】We will assess heterogeneity between studies by visual inspection of forest plots (including the presence of outliers and a poor overlap of confidence intervals), and by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity ( Deeks 2001 ). We will investigate and report heterogeneity according to Higgins 2011 .\n\n【84】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【85】Three review authors (JD, SYK, DC) will review and record reporting biases. If suitable (when more than 10 trials are included in a meta‐analysis), we will examine funnel plots to assess the potential for small study effects, such as publication bias.\n\n【86】#### Data synthesis\n\n【87】We will pool data for meta‐analysis using Review Manager 5if studies are comparable with respect to participants, interventions and outcomes ( RevMan 2014 ). We will aim to combine studies at the level of the intervention itself (e.g. psychostimulant, cognitive behavioural therapy, exercise) rather than broad categories (e.g. pharmacological, psychological, behavioural). The meta‐analysis will be carried out as follows.\n\n【88】*   We will pool the MDs between the treatment arms at the end of follow‐up if all trials measure the outcome on the same scale and at the same primary study endpoint, otherwise we will pool SMDs.\n    \n*   For dichotomous data, we will use risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs.\n    \n*   We will use random‐effects models with inverse variance weighting for all meta‐analyses, with a 95% CI ( DerSimonian 1986 ).\n    \n*   For dichotomous data for adverse events, we will pool RRs.\n    \n*   We will note the time points at which outcomes were collected and reported.\n    \n\n【89】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【90】We will also conduct subgroup analyses comparing changes in scale score studies using identical scales, where appropriate.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】Compare the topical anaesthetics amethocaine (Ametop) and EMLA in terms of anaesthetic efficacy and safety in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle.\n\n【3】Subgroup analysis\n\n【4】We will compare the effects of each topical anaesthetic in the following subgroups of patients:\n\n【5】*   gestational age at birth (term infants 37 weeks' gestation and above); preterm infants (29 to 36 weeks' gestation); very preterm infants (< 29 weeks' gestation);\n    \n\n【6】*   type of infants (e.g. healthy newborn infants (e.g. those in the normal newborn nursery vs. sick infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)).\n    \n\n【7】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【8】Background\n----------\n\n【9】### Description of the condition\n\n【10】Hospitalised newborn neonates frequently undergo painful invasive procedures that involve penetration of the skin and other tissues by a needle, often multiple times per procedure. These procedures include needle‐related painful procedures associated with venepuncture, arterial puncture, heel lancing, lumbar puncture, supra‐pubic aspiration of urine, percutaneous venous catheter placement and intramuscular injection. Compared with adults, both preterm and term infants display a hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli ( Fitzgerald 2001 ). Neonates have difficulty communicating the experience of pain to those managing it. Anatomical maturation of nociceptive pathways is complete by mid‐ to late second trimester and painful stimuli result in immediate hormonal, physiological and behavioural responses ( Anand 1987 ). Prior pain experience in term infants has been found to increase subsequent behavioural responses to pain, whereas preterm neonates may have a diminished subsequent behavioural response, but not necessarily altered experience of pain ( Whitfield 2000 ). Ongoing pain and distress may also have long‐term consequences for brain development and behaviour ( Anand 2000 ). Importantly too, several studies have highlighted that one of the most salient sources of stress for parents of hospitalised infants is the witnessing of painful procedures inflicted upon their infant ( Foster 2008 ; Franck 2004 ).\n\n【11】Assessment of pain and the efficacy of treatment modalities is challenging in non‐verbal neonates. Multi‐dimensional pain measurement tools have been developed including the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) ( Lawrence 1993 ) and the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) _(_ Stevens 1996 ). Physiological and behavioural responses to painful stimuli can be minimised and even ameliorated by appropriate analgesia ( Anand 2001 ; Bell 1994 ).\n\n【12】One intervention that can be used prior to a needle insertion procedure is application of a topical local anaesthetic. Topical anaesthetics have been shown to be effective in minimising the pain of venepuncture and intravenous cannulation in children ( Lander 1996 ; Lawson 1995 ; Manner 1987 ; Maunuksela 1986 ; Woolfson 1990 ). A Cochrane review comparing EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics) and Ametop (amethocaine) in children concluded that although EMLA is an effective topical anaesthetic, Ametop is superior in preventing pain associated with needle procedures ( Lander 2006 ).\n\n【13】### Description of the intervention\n\n【14】EMLA and Ametop are the two most widely used percutaneous topical local anaesthetics for use on intact skin. EMLA is a water‐based cream and each gram contains lidocaine 25 mg (2.5%) and prilocaine 25 mg (2.5%). Lidocaine and prilocaine are amide‐type local anaesthetic agents ( AstraZeneca 2008 ). Prior to the procedure, EMLA is applied using an occlusive dressing to cover the cream and numbing of the skin usually occurs approximately one hour after application and lasts for one to two hours after removal of the cream. Approximately 1 g is sufficient to cover up to 10 cm <sup>2 </sup> (approximately 3 x 3 cm) ( AstraZeneca 2008 ).\n\n【15】One more recently introduced alternative to EMLA is Ametop gel (also marketed as Angel). Ametop belongs to the family of local, aminoester‐type anaesthetics and is a white opalescent gel with each gram containing 40 mg of tetracaine base (4% amethocaine) ( Smith 2012 ). As with EMLA, Ametop gel is applied to the site and sealed with an occlusive dressing. Ametop reportedly has a faster anaesthetic effect than EMLA, and can usually be achieved following a 30‐minute application time for venepuncture, and a 45‐minute application time for venous cannulation. Ametop should be removed with a gauze swab, and the site prepared with an antiseptic wipe prior to the procedure. Anaesthesia is reported to also last longer than EMLA, remaining for four to six hours in most patients after a single application ( Smith 2012 ). Approximately 1 g is sufficient to cover and anaesthetise an area of up to 30 cm <sup>2 </sup> (6 x 5 cm). Smaller areas of anaesthetised skin may be adequate in infants and small children ( Smith 2012 ). Numbing of the skin can take between 45 and 60 minutes, an unsuccessful attempt for venous cannulation may require a new application of topical anaesthetic at another site, and thus a further delay in attempting to cannulate until numbing of the skin occurs.\n\n【16】Although the side effects of EMLA are usually mild and include transient local skin reactions, potential life‐threatening complications have been reported in infants. Compared with children and adults, infants are believed to be at increased risk of methaemoglobinaemia (MetHb) because they have a deficiency in the enzyme that reduces MetHb, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cytochrome b <sub>5 </sub> reductase ( Camp 2007 ; Nilsson 1990 ; Taddio 1998 ; Weinberger 2001 ). The higher body surface body surface area to weight ratio in infants compared with adults may result in higher systemic exposure. In addition, preterm infants may be at even greater risk because immaturity of their skin may enhance drug absorption of drugs ( Taddio 1999 ). As methaemoglobin levels increase, oxygen delivery to tissues is impaired and cellular hypoxia develops ( Stephens 2007 ; Wright 1999 ; Zaky 2009 ). Normal physiological levels of methaemoglobin are 0% to 2% but levels less than 5% may be acceptable upon discussion with the medical team. Methaemoglobin levels 5% and above are generally regarded as clinically significant. The half‐life of methaemoglobin is 55 minutes ( Coleman 1996 ; Sashdeva 2003 ). MetHb has been shown to inhibit surfactant activity directly ( Weinberger 2001 ). Infants with severe MetHb will exhibit signs such as cyanosis, respiratory distress/increasing ventilator requirements and lethargy ( Weinberger 2001 ).\n\n【17】One Cochrane review ( Brady‐Fryer 2004 ) compared EMLA and a range of pain‐relieving measures during circumcision. One Cochrane review by Taddio 1999 compared EMLA with placebo or no treatment for boys undergoing circumcision. Both reviews found that a single dose of EMLA is safe and does not cause MetHb; however, there were insufficient data to assess the risk of MetHb with multiple doses ( Brady‐Fryer 2004 ; Taddio 1999 ). One non‐Cochrane systematic review ( Taddio 1998 ) found EMLA to be effective during circumcision, venepuncture, arterial puncture and percutaneous venous catheter placement in newborns but did not diminish the pain from heel‐lancing. One case of MetHb was reported in 1995 by Tse 1995 after injection of prilocaine for a neonatal circumcision.\n\n【18】A study by Browne 1999 reported that vasoconstriction following the use of EMLA may render cannulation more difficult in adults. A reported benefit of Ametop is that it causes vasodilation of the blood vessels and, therefore, may make cannulation easier. Hypersensitivity to Ametop such as erythema, oedema, pruritus and blistering of the skin has been reported in adults ( Smith 2012 ).\n\n【19】### How the intervention might work\n\n【20】Both EMLA and Ametop topical anaesthetics act by causing a reversible block to conduction along nerve fibres. Ametop is believed to block nerve conduction mainly by inhibiting sodium ion flux across the axon membrane. Ametop achieves this by acting upon specific receptors that control gating mechanisms responsible for conductance changes in specialised proteinaceous sodium channels ( Smith 2012 ). EMLA similarly works by stabilising the neuronal membrane preventing the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses ( AstraZeneca 2008 ).\n\n【21】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【22】Invasive procedures such as venepuncture or heel puncture are painful and can cause considerable stress to the neonate, and also for the parents. EMLA ( AstraZeneca 2008 ) and Ametop ( Smith 2012 ) are not recommended for use in preterm or term newborn infants by their respective manufacturing pharmaceutical companies but both topical anaesthetics are used and studied in these populations. This review will help determine which topical anaesthetic preparation (Ametop or EMLA) is superior in relation to its efficacy and safety for needle‐related procedures in newborn infants.\n\n【23】Objectives\n----------\n\n【24】Compare the topical anaesthetics amethocaine (Ametop) and EMLA in terms of anaesthetic efficacy and safety in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle.\n\n【25】### Subgroup analysis\n\n【26】We will compare the effects of each topical anaesthetic in the following subgroups of patients:\n\n【27】*   gestational age at birth (term infants 37 weeks' gestation and above); preterm infants (29 to 36 weeks' gestation); very preterm infants (< 29 weeks' gestation);\n    \n\n【28】*   type of infants (e.g. healthy newborn infants (e.g. those in the normal newborn nursery vs. sick infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)).\n    \n\n【29】Methods\n-------\n\n【30】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【31】#### Types of studies\n\n【32】We will consider all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs for inclusion in this review.\n\n【33】We will include cluster and cross‐over randomised trials.\n\n【34】#### Types of participants\n\n【35】Newborn term or preterm (or both) infants up to a postnatal age maximum of 28 days requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle (heel lance, venepuncture, arterial puncture, arterial cannulation, supra‐pubic aspiration of urine, lumbar puncture, intramuscular injection, percutaneous venous catheter). We will exclude infants previously exposed to a topical anaesthetic prior to enrolment.\n\n【36】#### Types of interventions\n\n【37】*   EMLA versus Ametop topical anaesthetic.\n    \n\n【38】*   EMLA versus other active drug (topical anaesthetic).\n    \n\n【39】*   EMLA versus placebo.\n    \n\n【40】*   Ametop versus other active drug (topical anaesthetic).\n    \n\n【41】*   Ametop versus placebo.\n    \n\n【42】Amethocaine and EMLA could be given at any dose, location or length of time as determined in each of the included studies.\n\n【43】Topical anaesthesia during circumcision will be excluded.\n\n【44】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【45】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【46】Pain using validated pain score (measured during the procedure, up to one hour following painful procedure or both)\n\n【47】*   NIPS ( Lawrence 1993 ).\n    \n\n【48】*   PIPP ( Stevens 1996 ).\n    \n\n【49】*   Neonatal Facial Action Coding System ( Grunau 1987 ).\n    \n\n【50】*   Other validated pain measures.\n    \n\n【51】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【52】*   Number of infants with methaemoglobin levels 5% and above ( Sashdeva 2003 ).\n    \n\n【53】*   Number of needle prick attempts prior to successful needle‐related procedure (e.g. intravenous or arterial cannulation).\n    \n\n【54】*   Total cry duration (seconds) from beginning of procedure to cessation of crying or within a specified time limit (e.g. up to 180 seconds).\n    \n\n【55】*   Time taken for completion of procedure (if trial uses same procedure, e.g. intravenous cannulation).\n    \n\n【56】*   Episodes of apnoea ‐ defined as a cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds or a shorter pause associated with bradycardia or cyanosis.\n    \n\n【57】*   Episodes of bradycardia ‐ defined as a fall in heart rate of more than 30% below the baseline or less than 100 beats per minute for 10 seconds or longer.\n    \n\n【58】*   Episodes of oxygen desaturation ‐ defined as a spontaneous fall in SpO <sub>2 </sub> of 85% for 10 seconds or longer in duration.\n    \n\n【59】*   Neurodevelopmental disability (after at least 18 months' postnatal age) defined as neurological abnormality including cerebral palsy on clinical examination, developmental delay more than two standard deviations (SDs) below population mean on a standardised test of development.\n    \n\n【60】*   Other adverse events (as determined by the study).\n    \n\n【61】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【62】#### Electronic searches\n\n【63】Two review authors will independently perform the electronic database searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, _The Cochrane Library_ ‐ current), MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to current), EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to current) and CINAHL via Ovid (1982 to current). Text word fields and, where applicable, database subject heading fields (e.g. MeSH) will be searched using the following terms: neonat\\* OR Infant\\* OR Newborn AND Venepuncture OR venipuncture OR arterial puncture OR lumbar puncture OR injection OR needle OR percutaneous venous catheter OR heel lanc\\* OR supra‐pubic aspiration AND Pain OR Analgesia OR Topical anaes\\* OR topical anesthes\\* OR Prilocaine OR Amethocaine OR Tetracaine OR EMLA OR Angel OR Ametop OR \"eutectic mixture of local anesthetics\" OR topical anesthe\\* OR topical anaesthe\\*. We will not apply any language restrictions.\n\n【64】#### Searching other resources\n\n【65】The search strategy will also include communication with expert informants, bibliographies of reviews and trials for references to other trials. Previous reviews including cross‐references, abstracts, and conferences and symposia proceedings of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies (American Pediatric Society, Society for Pediatric Research and European Society for Paediatric Research) from 1990 to current. We will contact the corresponding investigators for information if we identify any unpublished trials. We will consider unpublished studies or studies only reported as abstracts as eligible for review if methods and data can be confirmed by the author. We will also contact the corresponding authors of identified RCTs for additional information about their studies when further data are required. Clinical trials registries will be searched for ongoing or recently completed trials ( clinicaltrials.gov ; controlled‐trials.com ; and who.int/ictrp ). There will be no language restriction.\n\n【66】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【67】We will use the standard systematic review methods of The Cochrane Collaboration documented in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【68】#### Selection of studies\n\n【69】Two review authors (JF and CT) will independently assess for inclusion all the potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a Cochrane review arbiter.\n\n【70】Specifically, we will:\n\n【71】1.  merge search results using reference management software and remove duplicate records of the same report;\n    \n2.  examine titles and abstracts to remove irrelevant reports;\n    \n3.  retrieve full text of the potentially relevant reports;\n    \n4.  link together multiple reports of the same study;\n    \n5.  examine full‐text reports for compliance of studies with eligibility criteria;\n    \n6.  correspond with investigators, when appropriate, to clarify study eligibility;\n    \n7.  at all stages, reasons for inclusion and exclusion of articles will be noted. Disagreements will be resolved through consensus, or refereed for arbitration to the editorial base of the Cochrane Neonatal Group if needed;\n    \n8.  make final decisions on study inclusion and proceed to data collection;\n    \n9.  all discrepancies will be resolved through a consensus process.\n    \n\n【72】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【73】We will use the standardised review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) ( neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html ) to assess the methodological quality of included studies. Review authors will independently assess study quality and risk of bias using the following criteria documented in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【74】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【75】Two review authors (JF and CT) will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a review arbiter.\n\n【76】##### (1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【77】We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We will assess the method as:\n\n【78】*   low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);\n    \n*   high risk (any non‐random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);\n    \n*   unclear risk.\n    \n\n【79】##### (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)\n\n【80】We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence in sufficient detail and determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.\n\n【81】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【82】*   low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);\n    \n*   high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non‐opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);\n    \n*   unclear risk.\n    \n\n【83】##### (3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias)\n\n【84】We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will judge studies to be at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.\n\n【85】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【86】*   adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;\n    \n*   adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;\n    \n*   adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.\n    \n\n【87】##### (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop‐outs, protocol deviations)\n\n【88】We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.\n\n【89】Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re‐include missing data in the analyses that we undertake. We will assess methods as:\n\n【90】*   adequate (< 20% missing data);\n    \n*   inadequate;\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【91】##### (5) Outcome reporting bias\n\n【92】We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.\n\n【93】We will assess the methods as:\n\n【94】*   low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre‐specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);\n    \n*   high risk (where not all the study's pre‐specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre‐specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);\n    \n*   unclear risk.\n    \n\n【95】##### (6) Other sources of bias\n\n【96】We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias (e.g. early termination of trial due to data‐dependent process, extreme baseline imbalance, etc.). We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias. We will assess other sources of bias as:\n\n【97】*   yes;\n    \n*   no;\n    \n*   unclear.\n    \n\n【98】##### (7) Overall risk of bias\n\n【99】We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings. We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses ‐ see 'Sensitivity analysis'.\n\n【100】We will judge each criterion as being at 'low risk' of bias, 'high risk' of bias, or 'unclear' risk of bias (for either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias).\n\n【101】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【102】We will analyse the results of the studies using the statistical package using Review Manager 5.1 software ( RevMan 2011 ). Data will be summarised in a meta‐analysis if they are sufficiently homogeneous, both clinically and statistically.\n\n【103】##### Dichotomous data\n\n【104】We will present results as risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. If there is a statistically significant reduction in RD then we will calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and associated 95% CI.\n\n【105】##### Continuous data\n\n【106】We will use the mean difference (MD) if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials for continuous data. We will use the standardised mean difference (WMD) to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods.\n\n【107】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【108】The unit of analysis is the participating infant in individually randomised trials and the neonatal unit (or sub‐unit) for cluster randomised trials.\n\n【109】##### Cluster randomised trials\n\n【110】We will include cluster‐randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will analyse them using the methods described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster‐randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta‐analysis.\n\n【111】##### Cross‐over trials\n\n【112】We will analyse the meta‐analysis for cross‐over trials as recommended by Elbourne 2002 . In the absence of first‐level evidence (parallel trials), we will include second‐level evidence (cross‐over design trials) in the analysis, in which data only from the first treatment period will be used. As such, we will manage data as if it were extracted from a parallel trial. In the absence of second‐level evidence (if we are unable to extract the data from the first period only), we will include third‐level evidence using data from both treatment periods from cross‐over design trials in the analysis. Hence, the analysis would ignore the cross‐over design of the trials. We will only include cross‐over trials where the needle‐related procedure is the same for both treatment periods (e.g. venous cannulation).\n\n【113】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【114】The authors of all published studies will be contacted if clarifications are required or to provide additional information. In the case of missing data, the number of participants with the missing data will be described in the results section and the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. The results will be only presented for the available participants. We will discuss the implications of the missing data in the discussion of the review.\n\n【115】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【116】We will use RevMan 5 ( RevMan 2011 ) to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects between trials. We will use the two formal statistics described below:\n\n【117】1.  the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test for homogeneity. We will calculate whether statistical heterogeneity is present using the Chi <sup>2 </sup> test for homogeneity (P < 0.1). Since this test has low power when the number of studies included in the meta‐analysis is small, we will set the probability at the 10% level of significance ( Higgins 2011 );\n    \n2.  the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic, to ensure that pooling of data is valid. The impact of statistical heterogeneity will be quantified using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic available in RevMan 2011 , which describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. We will grade the degree of heterogeneity as:\n    \n    1.  0% to 30%: might be important;\n        \n    2.  31% to 50%: moderate heterogeneity;\n        \n    3.  51% to 75%: substantial heterogeneity;\n        \n    4.  76% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.\n        \n\n【118】Where there is evidence of apparent or statistical heterogeneity, we will assess the source of the heterogeneity using sensitivity and subgroup analysis looking for evidence of bias or methodological differences between trials.\n\n【119】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【120】We will try to obtain the study protocols of all included studies and we will compare outcome data reported in the protocol to those reported in the findings for each of the included studies. We will investigate reporting and publication bias by examining the degree of asymmetry of a funnel plot. Where we suspect reporting bias (see 'Outcome reporting bias' above), we will attempt to contact study authors asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.\n\n【121】#### Data synthesis\n\n【122】We will use the fixed‐effect model in RevMan 5.1 ( RevMan 2011 ) for meta‐analysis.\n\n【123】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【124】We will compare the effects of each topical anaesthetic in the following subgroups of patients:\n\n【125】*   gestational age at birth (term infants 37 weeks' gestation and above); preterm infants (29 to 36 weeks' gestation); very preterm infants (< 29 weeks' gestation).\n    \n\n【126】*   type of infants (e.g. healthy newborn infants (e.g. those in the normal newborn nursery vs. sick infants in the NICU))\n    \n\n【127】##### Strategies for exploring heterogeneity\n\n【128】*   Identification of the methodological differences between studies.\n    \n\n【129】*   Subgroup analysis.\n    \n\n【130】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【131】We will explore methodological heterogeneity through the use of sensitivity analysis. We will assess studies at low risk of bias as those with adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment and less than 10% losses with intention‐to‐treat analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

There is uncertainty about 'best' management of constipation in palliative care patients and variation in practice between palliative care settings.\n\n【3】### Objectives\n\n【4】Determine the effectiveness of laxative administration for the management of constipation in palliative care patients, and the differential efficacy of the laxatives used to manage constipation.\n\n【5】### Search methods\n\n【6】We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, PUBMED, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, _The Cochrane Library_ , SIGLE, NTIS, DHSS‐DATA, Dissertation Abstracts, Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings and NHS‐NRR in January 2005.\n\n【7】### Selection criteria\n\n【8】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laxatives for constipation in palliative care patients.\n\n【9】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【10】Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted patient‐reported data measuring changes in stool frequency and ease of passing stools, using objective and validated scales. Tolerance or adverse effects of laxatives used were also sought. The appropriateness of synthesizing data from the controlled trials depended upon the clinical and statistical homogeneity of studies identified. If the controlled trials were homogeneous, a meta‐analysis would be attempted.\n\n【11】### Main results\n\n【12】Four trials involving 280 participants were included. Between these trials, the laxatives lactulose; senna; danthron combined with poloxamer (Co‐danthramer); Misrakasneham; magnesium hydroxide combined with liquid paraffin (Milpar) were evaluated. All four trials included number and frequency of bowel movements and relative ease of defecation as part of the assessment of laxative efficacy.\n\n【13】All laxatives demonstrated a limited level of efficacy, although a significant number of participants required rescue laxatives in each of the studies. The only significantly different treatments were in the trial where lactulose plus senna were more effective than danthron combined with poloxamer. Patient preference did not favour either treatment option. Other related systematic reviews have similarly identified that there is a lack of evidence to support the use of one laxative, or combination of laxatives, over another.\n\n【14】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【15】Treatment of constipation in palliative care is based on inadequate evidence, such that there are insufficient RCT data. Recommendations for laxative use can be related to costs as much as to efficacy. There have been few comparative studies, equally there have been few direct comparisons between different classes of laxative and between different combinations of laxatives. There persists an uncertainty about the 'best' management of constipation in this group of patients.\n\n【16】PICOs\n-----\n\n【17】### PICOs\n\n【18】###### Population (12)\n\n【19】*   Child, Preschool 2-5 years\n*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Child 6-12 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Infant 1 to 23 mo\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Birth to 1 mo\n*   Palliative Care\n*   Constipation\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【20】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【21】*   Laxative\n\n【22】###### Comparison (2)\n\n【23】*   Placebo\n*   Usual Care\n\n【24】###### Outcome (4)\n\n【25】*   Laxation response\n*   Bristol Stool Form Scale\n*   Frequency Of Defecation\n*   Adverse Event\n\n【26】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

Constipation is commonly experienced by palliative care patients as a result of the use of medications, such as opioids for pain control; dietary and mobility factors, as well as disease related factors. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation. Four trials involving 280 people were included. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted patient‐reported data measuring changes in stool frequency and ease in passing stools. All of the laxatives used in the trials were ineffective for a significant number of patients and some patients required multiple rescue laxatives, indicating the severity of the problem and relative lack of treatments to relieve constipation. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of one laxative, or combinations of laxative over another.\n\n【31】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【32】Unlock the full review", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To ascertain the efficacy of HDC with AHCT compared with standard‐dose chemotherapy in improving event‐free survival, overall survival, quality adjusted survival and progression‐free survival of children, adolescents and young adults with metastatic ES and to determine their toxicity.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Ewing sarcoma (ES) are solid tumours consisting of small blue round cells with minimal stroma that may exhibit varying degrees of neural differentiation and mainly appear in bone and less frequently in soft tissues ( Gorlick 2013 ; Kauer 2009 ; Ordóñez 2009 ). ES belongs to the Ewing's family of tumours. The other members of the group include primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), extraosseous Ewing sarcoma (EES) and Askin's tumour (ES of the chest wall). The tumours are thought to arise from the same primordial stem cell and are defined by the presence of _EWSR1‐ETS_ gene re‐arrangements. In 85% of cases, ETS transcription factor fuses with _FLI_ , resulting in the _EWS‐FLI_ fusion protein _._ This t(11;12)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation can take place at different intron‐exon sites. More than 18 different translocations have been described ( Delattre 1994 ; Potratz 2012 ). ES most often occur in children, adolescents and young adults and is the second most common bone cancer, with a slight male predominance ( Gurney 1999 ). The incidence is about three cases per million a year ( Esiashvili 2008 ). In children, the incidence is higher (4.5 per million) with a peak incidence of 11 per million at the age of 12 years ( Van den Berg 2008 ). ES often occur in the long bones and pelvis where they can quickly metastasise due to a high grade of malignancy ( Esiashvili 2008 ; Teicher 2011 ; Van den Berg 2008 ). Metastatic disease is typically found in the lungs (60%), bone (43%), bone marrow (19%), or a combination of these ( Cangir 1990 ). Presence of metastases at diagnosis is the most important adverse prognostic factor and is detected in about 20% to 30% of people ( Cotterill 2000 ; Esiashvili 2008 ; Jenkin 2001 ; Lee 2011 ). Multivariable analysis of the most recent European Euro‐Ewing‐99 trial performed in people with primary disseminated multifocal ES showed factors at diagnosis that significantly correlated with a worse outcome: people older than 14 years, tumour volume of 200 mL or greater, more than one bone metastatic site, bone marrow metastases and additional lung metastases ( Ladenstein 2010 ). Additional adverse clinical prognostic factors have been found in people with non‐metastatic ES, such as site of the primary tumour (axial located tumours do worse), poor histological response (10% or greater viable tumour cells) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level ( Bacci 2000 ; Cotterill 2000 ). Besides participant characteristics, local therapy of involved sites affects outcome ( Haeusler 2010 ). Five‐year survival in people with metastatic disease is lower than 30% as compared with a survival expectancy of people with localised disease of 65% to 75% ( Gorlick 2013 ; Ladenstein 2010 ).\n\n【7】### Description of the intervention\n\n【8】High‐dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is used in various unfavourable paediatric groups with diverse solid tumours ( Carli 2004 ; Claviez 2008 ; Matthay 1999 ; Spreafico 2008 ). This seems theoretically a good option to treat the minimal residual disease and to improve survival rate.\n\n【9】### How the intervention might work\n\n【10】While overt metastatic disease is prognostic, it is clear that most people with metastatic disease (also people with localised disease) harbour micro‐metastatic deposits. The hypothesis is that HDC (also known as myeloablative conditioning regimens), may overcome resistance to standard multi‐agent chemotherapy. HDC ablates the person's bone marrow reserve, which is an important adverse effect that requires haematopoietic cell transplantation. To improve the outcome of people with high‐risk ES (people with metastatic disease at presentation or recurrence of disease), several studies have used HDC followed by AHCT to improve survival rate ( Al‐Faris 2007 ; Burdach 2000 ; Drabko 2005 ; Fraser 2006 ; Kushner 2001 ; Meyers 2001 ; Rosenthal 2008 ).\n\n【11】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【12】The value of HDC followed by AHCT in the treatment of people with high‐risk metastatic ES has not been established and this treatment is very intensive and may be associated with important toxicity and adverse effects (including severe mucositis, metabolic problems and long‐lasting bone marrow aplasia with the risk of life‐threatening bleeding and infection). We have identified no systematic reviews that have determined if HDC followed by AHCT contribute to a better survival rate (event‐free survival or overall survival, or both) in people who are in complete remission from metastatic ES after intensive chemotherapy and local treatment (surgery or radiotherapy, or both); thus, such a review is timely.\n\n【13】Objectives\n----------\n\n【14】To ascertain the efficacy of HDC with AHCT compared with standard‐dose chemotherapy in improving event‐free survival, overall survival, quality adjusted survival and progression‐free survival of children, adolescents and young adults with metastatic ES and to determine their toxicity.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【17】#### Types of studies\n\n【18】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or (historical) controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing the effectiveness of HDC and AHCT with standard‐dose chemotherapy for children, adolescents and young adults with metastatic ES.\n\n【19】#### Types of participants\n\n【20】Children, adolescents and young adults (aged less than 30 years at the date of diagnostic biopsy) with a diagnosis of ES confirmed by pathology and evidence of distant metastases. We will consider people to have distant metastases when the tumour is detected clinically or radiographically at one or more sites distant from the primary site and outside the regional lymph nodes. We will include studies that also include people who are not eligible for inclusion in this review (e.g. people older than 30 years at tumour diagnosis), if data for only the eligible people are available.\n\n【21】#### Types of interventions\n\n【22】HDC with AHCT versus conventional standard‐dose chemotherapy. We will define HDC as chemotherapy that ablates the person's bone marrow reserves and creates an absolute requirement for stem cell rescue. We will define standard‐dose chemotherapy as chemotherapy at a lower dose than HDC that does not require stem cell rescue. We will also include studies that add an immunotherapy to HDC with AHCT.\n\n【23】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【24】Outcomes listed here are not used as criteria for including studies, but are the outcomes of interest within studies identified for inclusion.\n\n【25】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【26】1.  Event‐free survival (as defined by the authors of the original study).\n    \n2.  Overall survival (as defined by the authors of the original study).\n    \n3.  Toxicity of the treatment (as defined by the authors of the original study).\n    \n4.  Quality‐adjusted survival (as defined by the authors of the original study).\n    \n\n【27】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【28】1.  Progression‐free survival (as defined by the authors of the original study).\n    \n\n【29】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【30】We will use the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group's methods in the review ( Module CCG 2010 ). We will not impose language restrictions. We will update searches every two years. The Cochrane Childhood Cancer Review Group will run the searches in the Cochrane Central Library of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE; the review authors will run all other searches.\n\n【31】#### Electronic searches\n\n【32】We will search the following electronic databases:\n\n【33】1.  CENTRAL (latest issue);\n    \n2.  MEDLINE in PubMed (from 1966 to present);\n    \n3.  EMBASE (Ovid; from 1980 to present).\n    \n\n【34】The search strategies for the different electronic databases (using a combination of controlled vocabulary and text words) are shown in Appendix 1 ; Appendix 2 ; and Appendix 3 .\n\n【35】#### Searching other resources\n\n【36】We will locate information about trials not registered in CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, either published or unpublished, by searching the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles. We will also scan the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP; 2009 to 2013), the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO; 2009 to 2013), the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS; 2009 to 2013), the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT; 2009 to 2013), the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT; 2009 to 2013) and the European Musculo‐Skeletal Oncology Society (EMSOS; 2009 to 2013); we will perform these searches electronically if available or by handsearching. We will scan ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ) for ongoing trials.\n\n【37】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【38】#### Selection of studies\n\n【39】After applying the search strategy, two review authors will independently identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. We will resolve discrepancies between authors by discussion. If we cannot reach consensus, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator. We will obtain in full any study that seems to meet the inclusion criteria on the grounds of the title or abstract, or both, for closer inspection. We will produce a 'Characteristics of included studies' table and include detailed information for each study. We will clearly state details of the reasons for exclusion of any study considered for the review in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. We will create a PRISMA flow diagram of the selection of studies in the review. If there are multiple reports of the same study, we will use the most recent report as the primary publication; we will check the other available reports for data not reported in the primary publication.\n\n【40】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【41】Two review authors will independently perform data extraction using standardised forms. We will resolve discrepancies between authors by discussion. If we cannot reach consensus, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator. We will extract data on the characteristics of participants (e.g. age, gender, known risk factors for people with metastatic disease (tumour volume, sites of metastases (lungs, bone, bone marrow, or a combination)), interventions, outcome measures, study design, length of follow‐up, details of funding sources and declaration of interests for each included study.\n\n【42】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【43】Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in included studies (i.e. selection bias, performance bias, detection bias (for each outcome separately), attrition bias (for each outcome separately), reporting bias and other bias). We will use the risk of bias items and definitions of low risk or bias, unclear risk of bias and high risk of bias as described in the module of the Childhood Cancer Group ( Module CCG 2010 ), which are based on the recommendations of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve discrepancies between authors by discussion. If this is impossible, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator. We will take into account the risk of bias in included studies in the interpretation of the review's results.\n\n【44】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【45】We will analyse dichotomous variables using risk ratios (RR). We will analyse survival using hazard ratios (HR). We will use Parmar's method if HRs have not been explicitly presented in the study ( Parmar 1998 ). We will resent all results with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n【46】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【47】When relevant data regarding study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment are missing, we will attempt to contact the study authors to retrieve the missing data. We will extract data by the allocated intervention, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an intention‐to‐treat analysis. If this is not possible, we will stated this and we will perform an 'as treated' analysis.\n\n【48】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【49】We will assess heterogeneity both by visual inspection of the forest plots and by a formal statistical test for heterogeneity (i.e. the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic). In the absence of significant heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> less than 50%) ( Higgins 2011 ), we will use a fixed‐effect model for the estimation of treatment effects. Otherwise, we will explore possible reasons for the occurrence of heterogeneity and take appropriate measures, such as using a random‐effects model.\n\n【50】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【51】In addition to the evaluation of reporting bias as described in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section, we will assess reporting bias by constructing a funnel plot where there are a sufficient number of included studies (i.e. at least 10 studies included in a meta‐analysis). When there are fewer studies, the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【52】#### Data synthesis\n\n【53】We will enter data into the Review Manager 5 software ( RevMan 2012 ), as provided by The Cochrane Collaboration and undertake analyses according to the guidelines of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will include outcome measures only if it was the intention of the study to perform the necessary assessments in all randomised participants (i.e. not only optional or only performed in some centres). When the results of a particular outcome measure are available for less than 50% of the participants of a study, due to the associated high risk of attrition bias, we will not report the results of this outcome measure. We will pool results only if both treatment groups are comparable, including the definition of outcomes used. We will provide a descriptive summary for studies for which pooling of results is not possible. We do not expect to find multi‐arm studies (i.e. including more than two treatment groups); however, if we include these studies we will take appropriate measures as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will analyse historical CCTs separately. We will analyse studies that compare immunotherapy plus HDC with AHCT alone separately.\n\n【54】For each comparison, we will prepare a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADEprofiler software in which we plan to present event‐free survival, overall survival, quality adjusted survival, progression‐free survival and toxicity of the treatment. Two review authors will independently assess the quality of the evidence using the five GRADE considerations (i.e. study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias).\n\n【55】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【56】We will not perform subgroup analyses.\n\n【57】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【58】For all outcomes for which pooling is possible, we will perform sensitivity analyses for all risk of bias criteria separately. We will exclude studies with a high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias and compare the results of studies with a low risk of bias with the results of all available studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】This review aims to look at the benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for infected kidney and liver cysts in patients with ADPKD.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder where faulty genes result in the growth of multiple fluid‐filled cysts in the kidney. These cysts grow in size as they accumulate fluid. There are different types of PKD: they may be congenital or acquired, inherited, some may not be clinically relevant, while others may lead to severe complications. The most common cause of PKD is the autosomal dominant form (ADPKD) and is the most common hereditary kidney disease. It affects 1/400 to 1/1000 live births and is a leading cause of ESKD, and a common indication for dialysis or kidney transplantation. It accounts for between 2.4% to 12% of all people starting renal replacement therapy (RRT) ( ANZDATA 2011 ; ERA‐EDTA 2009 ; RMRC 2010 ; Tahvanainen 2005 ; USRDS 2011 ). Kidney failure requiring RRT occurs in approximately 50% of patients and typically develops in the fourth to sixth decade of life ( Torres 2008 ). In ADPKD, in addition to the presence of hundreds to thousands of kidney cysts, cysts are also common in the liver, pancreas and intestine. As a consequence of the structural deformities, kidney complications of this disease arise. Some of these are: hypertension, haematuria, polyuria, flank pain and tendency to recurrent urinary tract infections and kidney stones. These fluid‐filled cysts may collect blood after mild or severe trauma, may be the site of pyogenic infection or, in rare cases, could develop a malignant neoplasm ( Grantham 2008 ; Wilson 2004 ). In ADPKD liver cysts develop later than kidney cysts, with a steady increase in frequency with advancing age, and are more common in women ( Chauveau 2000 ). The majority of these patients report no liver symptoms, although no accurate assessment on the prevalence of liver symptoms has been published. A single centre reported 21% of polycystic patients on dialysis experienced kidney complications: mainly cyst infection, intracystic haemorrhage, post‐traumatic rupture or cyst carcinoma ( Chauveau 2000 ; Telenti 1990 ).\n\n【7】It has been estimated that 30% to 50% of patients with ADPKD will have some sort of kidney infection during their lifetime ( Alam 2009 ). In the particular case of transplant recipients, urinary tract infections are among the leading complication in recipients with ADPKD, and septicaemia the most frequent cause of death ( Stiasny 2002 ), and cyst infections responsible for hospitalisation occurs in 9% of ADPKD patients. An infected cyst and acute pyelonephritis are the most common kidney infections, while complications such as a perinephric abscess and bacteraemia can also occur. Diagnosing infected cysts is a challenge despite improvements in clinical, biological and imagining advances because of the lack of non‐specific clinical symptoms, the limitations of current imaging procedures, and no radiologic gold standard for diagnosing infected cysts ( Jouret 2012 ). It has been estimated that cyst infection rates are approximately 0.01 episodes/patient/year ( Gibson 1998 ; Sallee 2009 ; Sklar 1987 ).\n\n【8】### Description of the intervention\n\n【9】Cyst infections are serious problems often requiring hospitalisation and aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Despite the fact that cyst infection is one of the most frequent complications of ADPKD, published data are scant ( Sallee 2009 ). The treatment of this complication is hampered by the difficultly in identifying the infective organism and the infected cyst itself, the fact that some of these patients are oliguric or anuric, and the poor penetration of the antibiotics into the kidney cysts.\n\n【10】Treatment of cysts infections can be difficult and significant morbidity, mortality and complications, notably the development of abscesses, have been described ( Gibson 1998 ). The optimal duration of therapy for infected cysts is unclear and in some cases, such as in large (diameter > 5 cm) infected cysts, antibiotics alone are not sufficient to successfully treat the infection, and cyst drainage may be indicated ( Akinci 2008 ; Bennett 1987 ; Rosenfeld 2002 ).\n\n【11】### How the intervention might work\n\n【12】There are two groups of antibacterial drugs: bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Bacteriostatic drugs slow the growth or reproduction of micro‐organisms and require the aid of host's defences to clear the infecting micro‐organism. If the host's defences are impaired locally at the site of infection, as it happens inside the cysts, the residual pathogen resumes growth after the bacteriostatic drug has been stopped and the infection reoccurs. Bacterial infection in these circumstances requires use of bactericidal drugs (which kill the bacteria). Antibiotic concentrations at the centre of the infected cysts are much lower than in serum, which confers an inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. Drugs that are bind strongly to serum protein may have reduced antibacterial activity in serum and not penetrate tissues as well as drugs that are less protein bound ( Levison 2004 ). In these cases, the results of the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration may not predict the in vivo effect. Liphophilic compounds, such as ciprofloxacin, new quinolones, trimethoprim‐sulphamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol, which can accumulate in the kidney cysts, do not achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels inside the infected cyst even with high dosing ( Bennett 1985 : Chow 2005 ; Elzinga 1987 ; Elzinga 1988 ; Hiyama 2006 ; Muther 1981 ; Rossi 1993 ; Schwab 1983 ; Schwab 1985 ; Schwab 1986 ). It is also important to consider the peak serum level of free drug after a particular dose regimen and serum half‐life of the drug, to predict efficacy. Moreover, some interventional approaches have been implemented such as ultrasonography‐guided intracystic injection of antibiotics ( Saedi 2009 ), percutaneous puncture or surgical decompression ( Akinci 2008 ; Bennett 1987 ; Chehval 1995 ; Elzinga 1992b ; Elzinga 1992a ; Elzinga 1993 ; Waters 1979 ), drainage with alcohol sclerosis or laparoscopic unroofing ( Lee 2003 ).\n\n【13】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【14】Recent research has been focused on the genetics and pathophysiology of ADPKD and on promising therapies aimed at slowing cyst initiation or expansion. Cyst infection involves the use of important hospital resources, morbidity is high and it affects the quality of life of the patients. Although infection of a single cyst within a polycystic kidney is one of the most common and potentially serious complication of this disease, and it has been reported that infection is the most common cause of death in ADPKD ( Fick 1995 ), there is no evidence‐based strategy for its management.\n\n【15】Objectives\n----------\n\n【16】This review aims to look at the benefits and harms of the currently available treatment options for infected kidney and liver cysts in patients with ADPKD.\n\n【17】Methods\n-------\n\n【18】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【19】#### Types of studies\n\n【20】*   All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at interventions directed at treatment of cyst infection in ADPKD will be included.\n    \n*   Observational cohort studies looking at interventions directed at treatment of cyst infection in ADPKD will also be included and separately analysed.\n    \n\n【21】#### Types of participants\n\n【22】##### Inclusion criteria\n\n【23】All patients with ADPKD (men, women, any age, with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney transplant recipients) with a diagnosis of infected kidney or liver cysts (including those with a concomitant infected cyst anywhere else).\n\n【24】The diagnosis of cyst infections in patients with ADPKD is made complex and difficult. Although the review will not be limited by the following criteria and we will accept any definition described in the reports, the following diagnostic criteria have been proposed for cyst infection ( Desouza 2009 ; Jouret 2012 ; Sallee 2009 ; Sklar 1987 ).\n\n【25】*   Presence of a cyst aspiration showing evidence of infection (neutrophil debris or micro‐organism or both).\n    \n*   Presence of all of the following features: fever (temperature 38.5°C for three days), abdominal pain (particularly a palpable area of kidney or liver tenderness), increased C‐reactive protein (CRP > 50 mg/L), and the absence of any significant recent intracystic bleeding (based on the results of an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan) or other causes of fever.\n    \n*   Presence of bacteraemia or fungaemia.\n    \n*   Positive kidney ultrasound data detecting debris with a thick wall or a distal acoustic enhancement or both in at least one cyst.\n    \n*   Positive kidney CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data detecting enhanced wall thickening or perilesional inflammation or both in at least one cyst.\n    \n*   Positive positron emission computed tomography ( <sup>18 </sup> FDG‐PET/CT) or positron emission ( <sup>18 </sup> FDG‐PET) scan data detecting focus of increased glucose analogue <sup>18 </sup> FDG uptake in the kidney.\n    \n\n【26】##### Exclusion criteria\n\n【27】Patients with another abdominal complication such as cyst haemorrhage, pyelonephritis, kidney graft infection in kidney transplant recipients, and non‐cystic abdominal infection (e.g. angiocholitis, diverticulitis).\n\n【28】#### Types of interventions\n\n【29】1.

The Cochrane Renal Group’s Specialised Register contains studies identified from the following resources.\n\n【39】1.  Monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).\n    \n2.  Weekly searches of MEDLINE OVID SP.\n    \n3.  Handsearching of kidney‐related journals & the proceedings of major kidney conferences.\n    \n4.  Searching of the current year of EMBASE OVID SP.\n    \n5.  Weekly current awareness alerts for selected kidney journals.\n    \n6.  Searches of the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal & ClinicalTrials.gov.\n    \n\n【40】Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE based on the scope of the Cochrane Renal Group. Details of these strategies as well as a list of handsearched journals, conference proceedings and current awareness alerts are available in the Specialised Register section of information about the Cochrane Renal Group .\n\n【41】See Appendix 1 for search terms used in strategies for this review.\n\n【42】#### Searching other resources\n\n【43】1.  Reference lists of clinical practice guidelines, review articles and relevant studies.\n    \n2.  Letters or emails seeking information about unpublished or incomplete studies to investigators known to be involved in previous studies.\n    \n\n【44】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【45】#### Selection of studies\n\n【46】The search strategy described will be used to obtain titles and abstracts of studies that may be relevant to the review. The titles and abstracts will be screened independently by two authors, who will discard studies that are not applicable, however studies and reviews that might include relevant data or information on studies will be retained initially. Two authors will independently assess retrieved abstracts and, if necessary the full text, of these studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria.\n\n【47】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【48】Data extraction will be carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English, non‐Spanish, non‐French, or non‐Italian language journals will be translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports will be grouped together and the publication with the most complete data will be used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data will be used. Any discrepancy between published versions will be highlighted.\n\n【49】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【50】The following items will be independently assessed by two authors using the risk of bias assessment tool ( Higgins 2011 ) ( _see_ Appendix 2 ).\n\n【51】*   Was there adequate sequence generation (selection bias)?\n    \n*   Was allocation adequately concealed (selection bias)?\n    \n*   Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately prevented during the study (detection bias)?\n    \n    *   Participants and personnel\n        \n    *   Outcome assessors\n        \n*   Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed (attrition bias)?\n    \n*   Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting (reporting bias)?\n    \n*   Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a risk of bias?\n    \n\n【52】For assessing the quality of non‐randomised studies we will use the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale with the following items ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【53】*   Cohort studies\n    \n\n【54】*   *   Was the exposed cohort representative of the population of PKD?\n        \n    *   Was the selection of the non‐exposed cohort adequate?\n        \n    *   Was valid the ascertainment of exposure and that the outcome of interest was not present at start of study?\n        \n    *   Were the cohorts comparable on the basis of the design or analysis?\n        \n    *   Was the outcome correctly assessed?\n        \n    *   Was follow‐up long enough for outcomes to occur considering in this study that it will be sufficient for one month?\n        \n    *   Was the follow‐up of the exposed and non‐exposed cohorts adequate to ensure that losses are not related to either the exposure or the outcome?\n        \n\n【55】*   Case control studies:\n    \n\n【56】*   *   Is the case definition adequate?\n        \n    *   Are the cases representative?\n        \n    *   Are the controls selected from the same population? Is there specified the history of outcome?\n        \n    *   Are cases and controls comparable?\n        \n    *   Was valid the ascertainment of exposure?\n        \n    *   Is there specified a non‐response rate?\n        \n\n【57】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【58】The data will be disaggregated for kidney, liver and other cysts. For dichotomous outcomes (persistent bacteriuria or bacteraemia after completion of antibiotics, recurrence of infection after initial eradication, mortality related to infection, clinical outcomes, adverse effects) results will be expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement are used to assess the effects of treatment (microbial resistance, duration of the therapy or the hospitalisation, laboratory finding, reduction cyst volume, quality of life, economic costs of the treatment), the mean difference (MD) will be used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales have been used (quality of life or pain intensity). For time to event data (time of disappearance of symptoms, normalization of CRP, days to get sterile urine culture after completion of antibiotics) we will express the intervention effect as an estimated of the log hazard ratio obtained from statistics computed during a log‐rank analysis. In case it is necessary to deal with change scores (reduction cyst size or volume), the statistical approach will be to include the baseline outcome measurements as a covariate in a regression model or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and will be included in the meta‐analysis using the generic inverse‐variance method. We will approach time‐to‐event outcomes as continuous variables (mean days until an event occurs). For counts and rates the results of a study may be expressed as a RR and the (natural) logarithms of the rate ratios may be combined across studies using the generic inverse‐variance method ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【59】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【60】The unit of analysis issues will be people with infected cysts not the cysts themselves. So if the identified studies report the number of infected cysts we will change the measurement to people with infected cysts. Cross‐over studies will not be included. Although it is highly unlikely to find other studies with non‐standard designs, if a cluster‐RCT is included, statistical advice will be asked for determining the most appropriate method to use and if studies with multiple intervention groups are included, they will be analysed combining groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison.\n\n【61】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【62】Any further information required from the original author will be requested by written correspondence (e.g. emailing the corresponding author) and any relevant information obtained in this manner will be included in the review. Evaluation of important numerical data such as screened, randomised patients as well as intention‐to‐treat (ITT), as‐treated and per‐protocol (PP) population will be carefully performed. Attrition rates, for example drop‐outs, losses to follow‐up and withdrawals will be investigated. Issues of missing data and imputation methods (for example, last‐observation‐carried‐forward (LOCF)) will be critically appraised ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【63】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【64】Heterogeneity will be analysed using a Chi² test on N‐1 degrees of freedom, with an alpha of 0.05 used for statistical significance and with the I² test ( Higgins 2003 ). I² values of 25%, 50% and 75% correspond to low, medium and high levels of heterogeneity.\n\n【65】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【66】If possible, funnel plots will be used to assess for the potential existence of small study bias ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【67】#### Data synthesis\n\n【68】Data will be pooled using the random‐effects model.\n\n【69】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【70】Subgroup analysis will be used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (e.g. participants (stage of CKD, haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant recipients, diabetes), interventions, organism involved, diagnostic imaging technique used (CT, MRI, 18FDG‐PET, US); localisation of infected cyst, concomitant liver or other cysts infections and haematogenous infection). Heterogeneity among participants could be related to age and renal pathology (e.g. stage of CKD, haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients or kidney transplant recipients, diabetes). Heterogeneity in treatments could be related to prior agent(s) used and the agent, dose, route of administration and duration of therapy. Adverse effects will be tabulated and assessed with descriptive techniques, as they are likely to be different for the various agents used. Where possible, the risk difference with 95% CI will be calculated for each adverse effect, either compared to no treatment or to another agent.\n\n【71】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【72】We will perform sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factors on effect size.\n\n【73】*   Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies.\n    \n*   Repeating the analysis taking account of risk of bias, as specified above.\n    \n*   Repeating the analysis excluding any very long or large studies to establish how much they dominate the results.\n    \n*   Repeating the analysis excluding studies using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), and country.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

These are routinely offered and fitted to those who seek help for hearing difficulties. By amplifying and improving access to sounds, and speech sounds in particular, the aim of hearing aid use is to reduce the negative consequences of hearing loss and improve participation in everyday life.\n\n【5】### Objectives\n\n【6】To evaluate the effects of hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss in adults.\n\n【7】### Search methods\n\n【8】The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; the Cochrane Register of Studies Online; MEDLINE; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 March 2017.\n\n【9】### Selection criteria\n\n【10】Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hearing aids compared to a passive or active control in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss.\n\n【11】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【12】We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes in this review were hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life and the adverse effect pain. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, listening ability and the adverse effect noise‐induced hearing loss. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in _italics_ .\n\n【13】### Main results\n\n【14】We included five RCTs involving 825 participants. The studies were carried out in the USA and Europe, and were published between 1987 and 2017. Risk of bias across the studies varied. Most had low risk for selection, reporting and attrition bias, and a high risk for performance and detection bias because blinding was inadequate or absent.\n\n【15】All participants had mild to moderate hearing loss. The average age across all five studies was between 69 and 83 years. The duration of the studies ranged between six weeks and six months.\n\n【16】There was a large beneficial effect of hearing aids on hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life associated with participation in daily life as measured using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE, scale range 1 to 100) compared to the unaided/placebo condition (mean difference (MD) ‐26.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐42.16 to ‐10.77; 722 participants; three studies) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ).\n\n【17】There was a small beneficial effect of hearing aids on general health‐related quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.21; 568 participants; two studies) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ). There was a large beneficial effect of hearing aids on listening ability (SMD ‐1.88, 95% CI ‐3.24 to ‐0.52; 534 participants; two studies) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ).\n\n【18】Adverse effects were measured in only one study (48 participants) and none were reported ( _very low‐quality evidence_ ).\n\n【19】### Authors' conclusions\n\n【20】The available evidence concurs that hearing aids are effective at improving hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life, general health‐related quality of life and listening ability in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. The evidence is compatible with the widespread provision of hearing aids as the first‐line clinical management in those who seek help for hearing difficulties. Greater consistency is needed in the choice of outcome measures used to assess benefits from hearing aids. Further placebo‐controlled studies would increase our confidence in the estimates of these effects and ascertain whether they vary according to age, gender, degree of hearing loss and type of hearing aid.\n\n【21】PICOs\n-----\n\n【22】### PICOs\n\n【23】###### Population (7)\n\n【24】*   Aged 80 and over 80+ years\n*   Adult 19-44 years\n*   Middle Aged 45-64 years\n*   Hearing impairment\n*   Young Adult 19-24 years\n*   Aged 65-79 years\n*   Adolescent 13-18 years\n\n【25】###### Intervention (1)\n\n【26】*   Hearing Aid\n\n【27】###### Comparison (7)\n\n【28】*   Referral To Assistive Listening Device Service\n*   Listening Skills Promotion Therapy\n*   Aid To Hearing\n*   Communication Interventions\n*   Waiting list control\n*   Hearing Therapy\n*   Self-care Patient Education\n\n【29】###### Outcome (6)\n\n【30】*   Ear Infection\n*   Quality Of Life Decreased\n*   Hearing\n*   Pain\n*   Noise-induced Hearing Loss\n*   Skin Irritation\n\n【31】The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses.

We were interested in (1) a person's ability to take part in everyday situations, (2) general health‐related quality of life, (3) ability to listen to other people, and (4) harm, such as pain or over‐exposure to noise.\n\n【39】**Background**\n\n【40】Hearing loss is very common and adults with hearing loss may be offered hearing aids. These devices increase the loudness, and may improve the clarity, of sounds so that they are easier to hear. The main goal of hearing aids is to reduce the impact of hearing loss and to improve a person's ability to take part in everyday life. Although hearing aids are the most common technology for adults with hearing loss and are in widespread use, it is not clear how beneficial they are.\n\n【41】**Study characteristics**\n\n【42】The evidence is up to date to 23 March 2017. We found five clinical studies involving 825 adults with mild to moderate hearing loss who were randomly given either hearing aids, no hearing aids or placebo hearing aids. Studies involved older adults with the average age within studies between 69 and 83 years. The duration of the studies was between six weeks and six months.\n\n【43】**Key results**\n\n【44】We found evidence in three studies that hearing aids have a large beneficial effect in improving the ability of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to take part in everyday situations. Hearing aids have a small beneficial effect in improving general health‐related quality of life, such as physical, social, emotional and mental well‐being, and have a large effect in improving the ability to listen to other people.\n\n【45】Only one study attempted to measure harms due to hearing aids. None were reported.\n\n【46】**Quality of the evidence**\n\n【47】We judged the evidence that hearing aids improve the ability to take part in everyday situations, improve general health‐related quality of life and improve listening ability to be of moderate quality. This means that while we are reasonably confident that the reported benefits of hearing aids are real, there is a possibility that if further studies are conducted the size of the benefit might differ. We judged the quality of evidence for harms to be very low _,_ because this was only measured in one small study.\n\n【48】**Conclusions**\n\n【49】We found that hearing aids improve the ability of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to take part in everyday life, their general quality of life and their ability to listen to other people. If an adult with mild to moderate hearing loss seeks help for their hearing difficulties, hearing aids are an effective clinical option. It is important that future studies measure benefits consistently and report benefits separately for different age groups, genders, levels of hearing loss and types of hearing aids.\n\n【50】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【51】Authors' conclusions\n--------------------\n\n【52】### Implications for practice\n\n【53】There is evidence of moderate quality that hearing aids improve participation, overall health‐related quality of life and listening ability in adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. If the goals and needs of an individual with hearing loss are to improve their listening abilities and, in doing so, improve their participation with others in everyday life and their health‐related quality of life more generally, then hearing aids are an appropriate intervention. The evidence is generally compatible with the widespread provision of hearing aids as the first‐line clinical management option in those individuals who seek help. Evidence not considered by this review also suggests that self‐management of hearing aids should be considered alongside clinical management to improve hearing‐related participation and communication over the short term ( Barker 2016 ), and increase hearing aid use ( Ferguson 2016 ).\n\n【54】In light of an absence of evidence for the long‐term effects of hearing aids on any of the reported outcome measures, outcomes should be monitored up to at least one year post‐fitting to determine whether short‐term effects are sustained, and whether additional intervention may be required. The fact that hearing aids are in widespread use as an intervention for hearing loss means that questions about long‐term effects could be usefully addressed by a synthesis of evidence from large‐scale cohort studies. Such a synthesis would be enabled through the consistent collection and reporting of outcomes at consistent time points following hearing aid fitting.\n\n【55】### Implications for research\n\n【56】Well‐designed trials are needed to establish whether the effects of hearing aids vary according to age, gender, type of hearing aid, and degree and type of hearing loss. Trial populations should be sampled to be representative of typical first‐time hearing aid recipients in terms of gender, age and hearing thresholds. Trial sample sizes need to be large enough to allow subgroup analysis (e.g. comparison of men and women) and to identify the extent of effects of hearing aids within specific patient groups. The reporting of trials also needs to be sufficiently detailed to permit the extraction of data within such subgroups. Trial sample sizes need to be large enough to achieve sufficient statistical power to detect the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the primary outcome measure. However, further research is needed to determine the MCID on outcome measures relevant to hearing aids as there is currently an absence of such information. Fitting hearing aids to standard fitting protocols and hearing aid prescriptions (e.g. NAL‐NL2) using probe tube microphones to obtain well‐fitted hearing aids is also necessary to ensure hearing aids are functioning as intended.\n\n【57】The choice of outcome measure for assessing the effects of hearing aids on broader aspects of health should be considered carefully. Generic measures of health that include relevant domains such as communication (e.g. WHO‐DAS 2.0) may be more likely to show effects of hearing aids than measures that do not include such domains. To demonstrate cost‐effectiveness of hearing aid provision, and for comparison against other healthcare conditions and interventions, the use of preference‐based instruments should also be considered. These measures need to be selected based on evidence for their validity in evaluating hearing‐related interventions and their sensitivity to hearing‐related changes in health‐related quality of life. For example, the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI‐3) has been shown to be more sensitive to improvements in quality of life resulting from hearing aids compared to both the EQ‐5D and the SF‐36, which are less sensitive to hearing‐related changes in health ( Barton 2004 ; Davis 2007 ; Joore 2003 ).\n\n【58】Greater consistency in the choice of outcome measures across studies would enable direct comparisons of the effects of hearing aids and facilitate meta‐analyses. The development of a core outcome set for use in auditory rehabilitation research would not only encourage consistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes ( Barker 2016 ); if selected through an appropriate process, it would also ensure that outcomes are meaningful to patients and clinicians. There is also a need for greater consistency in the time points at which patients are followed up after hearing aid fitting, with more emphasis on longer‐term follow‐up outcomes measured at greater than one year.\n\n【59】Measures of cognition should be included in future review updates with a proposed hierarchy based on publications from current ongoing systematic reviews (e.g. Loughrey 2015 ) and expert consensus (e.g. Pichora‐Fuller 2016 ). The reporting of adverse effects in our included studies was limited and inconsistent and therefore should be given specific attention in the design and reporting of future hearing aid trials. Hearing aid take‐up and use was not an outcome in this review as we were specifically examining the difference between the aided and unaided conditions. However, there is value in obtaining a metric for hearing aid use as a secondary measure in future studies in any aided groups. This should be based on a relevant model of health behaviour to help determine behaviours that effectively promote hearing aid use, and how it might be improved ( Barker 2016 ; Coulson 2016 ).\n\n【60】Further studies should be designed to minimise the risk of performance and detection bias that is inherent in most hearing aid trials. Blinding the patient to the intervention is difficult to achieve with hearing aids but can be achieved by programming hearing aids to provide no amplification, which may be acceptable where there is genuine equipoise around their effectiveness. However, care must still be taken to ensure that such placebo hearing aids cannot be distinguished from active hearing aids based on either their visual appearance or the manner in which they are fitted. Blinding of outcome assessors should be incorporated into the design of future trials and particular care should be taken to ensure both patient and outcome assessor remain blinded when collecting patient‐reported outcomes. For example, self‐reported outcome data could be obtained via telephone rather than through self‐completion of questionnaires on paper or through interview; telephone administration has the additional benefit of increasing the test‐retest reliability of patient‐reported outcome measures ( Weinstein 1997 ).\n\n【61】Reporting of all future trials should follow the CONSORT guidelines ( CONSORT 2010 ).\n\n【62】Summary of findings\n-------------------\n\n【63】Open in table viewer\n\n【64】Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Untreated, adult hearing loss results in communication difficulties that can lead to social isolation and withdrawal, depression and reduced quality of life ( Davis 2007 ). Hearing loss is also associated with an increased risk of dementia, although currently the underlying mechanism is unknown ( Lin 2011 ).\n\n【70】According to the World Health Organization, hearing loss is the 13th most common global disease burden and the third leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) ( WHO 2008 ). Disabling hearing loss is estimated to affect 360 million people globally (5.3% of the world's population) ( WHO 2012a ). The prevalence of hearing loss increases with age ( Akeroyd 2014 ), and given the ageing society it is predicted that by 2030 adult‐onset hearing loss will be the seventh largest disease burden, above diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ( WHO 2008 ).\n\n【71】Epidemiological data suggest that the majority of cases of hearing loss in adults are sensorineural in nature (92%) and occur bilaterally (94.8%) ( Cruickshanks 1998 ). There are numerous definitions of hearing loss across different countries and organisations ( Timmer 2015 ). In this review, hearing loss is defined according to averaged pure‐tone thresholds across combinations of frequencies (0.5 kHz, 1.0 kHz, 2.0 kHz and 4.0 kHz), and grades of hearing impairment are consistent with the World Health Organization ( Mathers 2000 ). The majority of hearing losses (92%) are those that are defined as mild or moderate ( AoHL 2015 ). Mild (or slight) hearing loss is indicated as 26 to 40 dB hearing level (HL) and described as the ability to hear and repeat words spoken in a normal voice at one metre. Moderate hearing loss is indicated as 41 to 60 dB HL and described as the ability to hear and repeat words using a raised voice at one metre ( Mathers 2000 ). In addition to a loss of hearing sensitivity there may be additional sensory deficits of temporal and spectral processing that contribute to speech perception ( Hopkins 2011 ), not necessarily captured by pure‐tone audiometry.\n\n【72】### Description of the intervention\n\n【73】There are no effective medical or surgical treatments for mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss ( Chisolm 2007 ), so the main clinical intervention is the use of acoustic hearing aids ( Kochkin 2009 ). It was estimated that in 2012, 11 million hearing aids were sold worldwide ( Kirkwood 2013 ). Hearing aids detect and amplify sound, and deliver an amplified acoustic signal via air conduction to the external auditory canal on the same side as the signals are detected. Hearing aids are described according to where they are worn (e.g. behind‐the‐ear, in‐the‐ear, in‐the‐canal, completely‐in‐the‐canal) or classified by their technology (i.e. analogue, digitally programmable analogue or digital hearing aids) ( Dillon 2012 ). Hearing aids are typically fitted by healthcare professionals who have been trained in audiology or the dispensing of hearing aids.\n\n【74】Hearing aid fittings can be unilateral or bilateral and they are typically programmed according to the user's pure‐tone hearing thresholds using hearing aid prescription formulae ( Mueller 2005 ). Changes to the hearing aid programme may be made according to subjective preference for sound quality, such as the perceived loudness of sounds or the clarity of speech ( McArdle 2005 ). Hearing aid orientation that includes information on hearing aid use and care, expectations and limitations is typically offered as usual care ( Boothroyd 2007 ; Reese 2005 ).\n\n【75】The use of hearing aids to amplify sounds does not necessarily restore hearing function. Frequency response characteristics of hearing aids, distortions arising from peak clipping, poor clarity or loudness of speech can all have an impact on successful listening ( Dillon 2012 ). As hearing aids amplify all sounds, not just speech sounds, their use can lead to continued communication difficulties, particularly in noisy backgrounds ( Picou 2013 ). These and other reasons can lead to non‐use of hearing aids ( McCormack 2013 ), with estimates of non‐use varying from 3% ( Bertoli 2009 ) to 24% ( Lupsakko 2005 ). Recent studies have shown non‐use at 10% ( Aazh 2015 ) and 15.5% ( Solheim 2017 ), consistent with commercial surveys (4.7% to 7% ( Hougaard 2011 ), 12.4% ( Kochkin 2010 )). Additional interventions may be used to promote the use of hearing aids in people with hearing loss ( Barker 2016 ).\n\n【76】### How the intervention might work\n\n【77】The primary function of hearing aids is to amplify and improve the audibility of sounds, and speech in particular. However, improving the audibility of sounds or speech signals forms only one element within the broader concept of rehabilitating a person with hearing loss, where the overall aim is to reduce the negative consequences of hearing loss and improve communication. In order to communicate effectively, an individual needs to access the acoustic information (hearing, a passive process), employ attention and intention (listening, an active process), correctly interpret the acoustic and linguistic information (comprehension, a unidirectional process) and use and transmit this information effectively (communication, a bidirectional process) ( Kiessling 2003 ). These processes can be mapped onto the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, WHO 2001 ), which provides a theoretical framework upon which to measure the success of amplification using hearing aids.\n\n【78】Based on the ICF Core Set ( Danermark 2013 ), the goal of amplification with hearing aids where there is mild to moderate hearing loss is to reduce the auditory deficits associated with body functions and structures, thereby reducing activity limitations and participation restrictions ( Chisolm 2007 ; Kiessling 2003 ). Participation has been defined as involvement in a life situation, especially engagement in a social domain, such as family relationships, community life, employment, education and recreation and leisure ( Danermark 2013 ; Resnik 2009 ; WHO 2002 ). Hearing‐related participation also has an emotional component, particularly feelings of social isolation and loneliness ( Ventry 1982 ).\n\n【79】Improvements in the ability of a patient with hearing aids to detect and discriminate sounds and speech can be measured by acoustic outcomes (e.g. free‐field threshold and speech audiometry). The consequences of these improvements in terms of activities and participation can then be measured by patient‐reported outcomes such as self‐report questionnaires, which can be defined as either disease‐specific (e.g. hearing) or generic (e.g. health‐related quality of life). Generic health‐related quality of life measures generally show limited benefit from hearing aids as they lack sensitivity to the consequences of hearing loss ( Joore 2002 ; Joore 2003 ; Stark 2004 ). There is, however, some evidence that the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) is useful ( Barton 2004 ; Davis 2007 ). Currently, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal set of outcome measures to use in hearing research ( Granberg 2014 ).\n\n【80】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【81】Hearing aids are routinely offered and fitted for people with hearing loss. It might seem obvious that such an intervention is bound to be associated with an improvement in a patient's ability to hear and to communicate, but is this true? If there is an improvement in a patient's ability to hear and communicate, how big an improvement is it? There is little high‐level evidence to answer these questions and to inform discussions around the effectiveness of hearing aids, their provision within a population and the approach to be taken by those who might fund such provision.\n\n【82】There are no recent or ongoing systematic reviews that provide the high‐level evidence to inform clinical decision‐making on this important topic. A previous systematic review of the published evidence included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised trials published up to August 2004 that met specific criteria. It sought to address a specific objective: to determine if the use of hearing aids compared to the non‐use of hearing aids resulted in improvements in health‐related quality of life for adults with sensorineural hearing loss using disease‐specific and generic instruments ( Chisolm 2007 ). The authors reported that there were only two RCTs suitable for inclusion at that time, although only one trial randomised the whole patient sample ( Mulrow 1990 ), therefore limiting the generalisability of the findings and the robustness of the conclusions. A more recent systematic review that investigated hearing aid benefit in those with mild sensorineural hearing loss included 10 studies, but none of these were RCTs ( Johnson 2016 ).\n\n【83】The present review does not compare the evidence for the bilateral versus unilateral fitting of hearing aids, for which there is an ongoing Cochrane Review ( Browning 2017 ).\n\n【84】Objectives\n----------\n\n【85】To evaluate the effects of hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss in adults.\n\n【86】Methods\n-------\n\n【87】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【88】#### Types of studies\n\n【89】We included randomised controlled trials and used the first treatment period of cross‐over trials (i.e. treated as a parallel‐arm trial) provided the study reporting permitted, where the unit of analysis was the individual participant.\n\n【90】#### Types of participants\n\n【91】Adults (≥ 18 years old) who have mild to moderate hearing loss. For inclusion, hearing loss of participants had to be either described qualitatively as 'mild' and/or 'moderate', or the study group had to be quantitatively defined as having an average pure‐tone threshold within the mild or moderate ranges of hearing loss as defined by the WHO (mild: 26 to 40 dB HL inclusive; moderate: 41 to 60 dB HL inclusive). Here, an average pure‐tone threshold is defined as the mean of at least two octave frequencies up to and including 4 kHz.\n\n【92】#### Types of interventions\n\n【93】Acoustic hearing aids, irrespective of where they are worn or the type of technology (analogue or digital).\n\n【94】We excluded hearing aids or implantable devices whose primary purpose is to deliver bone conduction sound or those that detect and deliver sound via air conduction to the contralateral ear.\n\n【95】The comparisons of interest were hearing aids versus either a passive control (no intervention, waiting list control; these were pooled in the meta‐analysis) or an active control that involved:\n\n【96】*   information/education only, listening tactics and communication training;\n    \n*   assistive listening devices; or\n    \n*   auditory training (we planned to analyse these second two in separate meta‐analyses).\n    \n\n【97】We did not consider studies where the intervention was delivered in a group setting.\n\n【98】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【99】The following outcomes were analysed in the review, but we did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies. We analysed the data at the trial endpoint, with a planned subgroup analysis to compare different trial endpoints. The ranked hierarchy of instruments was derived from those reported in two systematic reviews ( Chisolm 2007 Table 4; Granberg 2014 Table 4).\n\n【100】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【101】*   Hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life, where participation was the key domain. This was measured using self‐report questionnaires. Where multiple questionnaires were used in a study, we proposed a ranked hierarchy of instruments whereby we identified the primary outcome based on the following in order of importance:\n    \n    *   Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE; Ventry 1982 ) or HHI for Adults (HHIA; Newman 1990 ), if the HHIE was not used;\n        \n    *   Quantified Denver Scale of Communication (QDS; Tuley 1990 );\n        \n    *   Auditory Disability Preference ‐ Visual Analogue Scale (ADPI‐VAS; Joore 2002 ); and\n        \n    *   any questionnaire not specified above that was relevant to hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life.\n        \n\n【102】For example, if both the HHIE and QDS were included in one study, we would use only the HHIE in any meta‐analysis.\n\n【103】*   Adverse effect: pain. As reported by the patient as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or reported as occurrence of ear infection as a consequence of hearing aid fitting.\n    \n\n【104】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【105】*   Health‐related quality of life. A ranked hierarchy of self‐report outcome measures was proposed in the following order:\n    \n    *   Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI‐3; Furlong 2001 );\n        \n    *   EQ‐5D ( Rabin 2001 );\n        \n    *   SF‐36 ( Ware 1992 ), or if not reported other short forms of the SF‐36;\n        \n    *   Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI; Robinson 1996 );\n        \n    *   World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO‐DAS; WHO 2012b );\n        \n    *   Self‐Evaluation of Life Function (SELF; Linn 1984 ); and\n        \n    *   any questionnaire not specified above that was relevant to health‐related quality of life.\n        \n*   Listening ability. A ranked hierarchy of self‐report outcome measures was proposed in the following order:\n    \n    *   Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB; Cox 1995 );\n        \n    *   Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing (SSQ; Gatehouse 2004 );\n        \n    *   Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP, residual disability subscale; Gatehouse 1999 ); and\n        \n    *   any questionnaire not specified above that was relevant to self‐report of listening ability.\n        \n*   Adverse effect: noise‐induced hearing loss, for example due to over‐amplification from inappropriate hearing aid fitting.\n    \n\n【106】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【107】The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist conducted systematic searches for randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. There were no language, publication year or publication status restrictions. The date of the search was 23 March 2017. We contacted original authors for clarification and further data when trial reports were unclear, and arranged translations of papers where necessary.\n\n【108】#### Electronic searches\n\n【109】We searched the following databases from their inception for published, unpublished and ongoing trials:\n\n【110】*   the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (searched 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R) (1946 to 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   Ovid Cab (1910 to 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   LILACS (searched 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   KoreaMed (searched 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   PakMediNet (searched 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   Web of Knowledge, Web of Science (1945 to 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov (searched via the Cochrane Register of Studies 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), www.who.int/ictrp (searched 23 March 2017);\n    \n*   Google Scholar (searched 23 March 2017).\n    \n\n【111】In searches prior to 2017 we also searched PubMed 1946 to January 2016 as a top‐up to Ovid MEDLINE and IndMed to January 2017.\n\n【112】The Information Specialist modelled subject strategies for databases on the search strategy designed for CENTRAL. Where appropriate, they were combined with subject strategy adaptations of the highly sensitive search strategy designed by Cochrane for identifying randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials (as described in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ Version 5.1.0, Box 6.4.b. ( Handbook 2011 ). Search strategies for major databases including CENTRAL are provided in Appendix 1 .\n\n【113】#### Searching other resources\n\n【114】We scanned the reference lists of identified publications for additional trials and contacted trial authors where necessary. In addition, the Information Specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE to retrieve existing systematic reviews relevant to this systematic review so that we could scan their reference lists for additional trials.\n\n【115】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【116】#### Selection of studies\n\n【117】Material downloaded from electronic sources included details of author, institution, journal of publication and abstract. Two of the three screening authors (MF, DH and FB) independently screened each study against the inclusion criteria to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the review. Where the decision about any one study was not unanimous among the screening authors or there was insufficient information, we acquired the full article for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained, we decided whether the studies met the review criteria, and where there were disagreements we reached a final decision by discussion and consensus.\n\n【118】We revised the inclusion criteria for participants part‐way through the review process. The revised definition for Types of participants and the final decision about which studies to include were subject to independent review by an external expert committee to ensure that it was appropriate for the review question. The risk of revising the protocol was minimised, because this committee also independently evaluated the studies (shortlisted by the authors) and agreed that they met the new inclusion criterion. See Differences between protocol and review for details.\n\n【119】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【120】MF and PK independently extracted data from the articles. We recorded the extracted data using the Covidence systematic review software ( Covidence 2017 ) on review‐specific forms. We developed and assessed these for suitability through pilot testing prior to independent data extraction. Where there were discrepancies in the data extracted from either the main body or a table we made a final decision by discussion. Where data were extracted from graphs, we used the average of the two independent extractions. Whenever discrepancies were detected, a third author was involved to reconsider and resolve the differences.\n\n【121】Information extracted included: trial design, setting, methods of randomisation and blinding, power, inclusion and exclusion criteria, type of intervention and control, time since hearing aid fitting, duration of follow‐up, outcome measures and statistical tests.\n\n【122】For both the intervention and control groups, data extraction included: baseline characteristics of participants (number, sex, age), details of their hearing loss (mean, standard deviation, range), and details of any attrition or exclusion. For the intervention group, we extracted details of hearing aids (ear on which they were worn, analogue or digital, in‐the‐ear or behind‐the‐ear, manufacturer, unilateral or bilateral hearing aid fittings, and fitting procedures if reported).\n\n【123】Outcome measure data included: group means and standard deviations at pre‐ and post‐intervention and follow‐up, number of participants and results of statistical tests of between‐group comparisons.\n\n【124】We contacted the authors of all included studies as further information was required on all studies after inspection of the full articles. After independent data extraction by MF and PK, there were no disagreements that could not be resolved through discussion.\n\n【125】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【126】MF and PK independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials, with the following taken into consideration, as guided by the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Handbook 2011 ):\n\n【127】*   sequence generation;\n    \n*   allocation concealment;\n    \n*   blinding of (i) participants and study personnel (performance bias), and (ii) outcome assessment (detection bias);\n    \n*   incomplete outcome data;\n    \n*   selective outcome reporting; and\n    \n*   other sources of bias.\n    \n\n【128】We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool in RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ), which involved describing each of these domains as reported in the trial and then assigning a judgement about the risk of bias on the outcomes measured as a result of each entry: 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias. Where there were disagreements that could not be resolved, DH reviewed the paper and made a final judgement.\n\n【129】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【130】We expressed continuous outcomes as the size of the difference in treatment effect between an intervention group and a comparator group at the trial endpoint in terms of either the mean difference (MD), when the same outcome measures were used across studies, or the standardised mean difference (SMD), when different outcome measures were used across studies. The calculation of the effect size used the pooled standard deviation, and we reported the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each MD or SMD. An effect size less than 0 indicated that a larger treatment effect was observed in the treatment group relative to the comparator group. We did not extract any binary data.\n\n【131】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【132】The unit of analysis was the participant. We anticipated that participant‐level data would not generally be available and therefore reported suitable summary statistics that were provided in the articles. As stated above, in the case of cross‐over trials we only included data from the first period.\n\n【133】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【134】We contacted the corresponding authors of all the included studies to obtain missing data, except McArdle 2005 because they used imputation to account for missing data. We obtained participant‐level data from Humes 2017 , but we received no data from the other three studies, two of which no longer had the data available ( Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). We either took data from tables presented in the published manuscripts or estimated data from published figures, as described in the Data extraction and management section. Where standard deviations were not reported or provided by the authors, we estimated standard deviations in RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ) using available data, such as standard errors, 95% confidence intervals, P values and t values. We reported the extent of the missing data within studies. Data were not available for any subgroups of interest.\n\n【135】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【136】We assessed heterogeneity among treatment effect sizes using RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ), and we expressed this in terms of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic. We assessed the statistical significance (P = 0.10) using a Chi <sup>2 </sup> test with K‐1 degrees of freedom. We quantified heterogeneity in terms of the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic with low, medium and high ranges of 0% to 40%, 41% to 60% and 61% to 100%, respectively.\n\n【137】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【138】We planned to assess publication bias by examining a funnel plot of the size of treatment effects plotted against their variability. However, there were insufficient studies to assess whether the plot was symmetrical or to quantify the deviation from the expected symmetrical pattern using the 'trim and fill' method ( Duval 2000 ).\n\n【139】#### Data synthesis\n\n【140】We conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses of the MDs and SMDs using RevMan 5.3 ( RevMan 2014 ). We used random‐effects models as we anticipated significant heterogeneity among treatment effects across studies. For each meta‐analysis, we reported a summary effect size estimate in terms of the MD or SMD, together with its 95% confidence interval. We calculated summary effects using the inverse variance procedure.\n\n【141】To help with the interpretation of data, we estimated the 'equivalent' change on one of the more commonly used scales whenever SMDs were used to summarise data from a few different patient‐reported outcome instruments. We multiplied the observed SMD by the standard deviation of a representative study.\n\n【142】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【143】We had planned to use subgroup analyses to assess possible sources of heterogeneity. While heterogeneity was identified (see Effects of interventions ), it was not possible to perform subgroup analyses based on age, sex and degree of hearing loss as data on subgroups were not available. Time between fitting and trial endpoint was also identified as a possible source of heterogeneity, but a planned subgroup analysis comparing trials with different endpoints (up to three months, over three months to six months and six months or more) was not possible due to the small number of included studies. We conducted a post‐hoc subgroup analysis for the hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life outcome due to the observed pattern of effects across studies (see Effects of interventions ) and the differences in participant groups (e.g. military personnel compared with community dwellers).\n\n【144】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【145】We had planned to perform sensitivity analyses to informally test the robustness of assumptions from the data. The small number of studies precluded sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty about aspects of the included studies, in terms of randomisation (random/quasi‐random), missing data (greater than 30% at the primary endpoint) and description of hearing loss (mild/moderate).\n\n【146】##### GRADE and 'Summary of findings' table\n\n【147】Using the GRADE approach, two review authors (PK, DH) independently rated the overall quality of evidence using the GDT tool ( http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/ ) for the main comparison pairs listed in the Types of interventions section. MF and LYC reviewed the ratings and resolved any queries and disagreements. In addition, we also presented the data to a guideline panel that consisted of clinical experts, methodologists and patient representatives and we took their comments into account to reach the final ratings. The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is close to its true value and we applied this in the interpretation of results. The four possible ratings were: high, moderate, low and very low. A rating of high quality of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of very low quality implies that any estimate of effect obtained is very uncertain.\n\n【148】The GRADE approach rates evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as high quality. However, several factors can lead to the downgrading of the evidence to moderate, low or very low. The degree of downgrading is determined by the seriousness of these factors:\n\n【149】*   study limitations (risk of bias);\n    \n*   inconsistency;\n    \n*   indirectness of evidence;\n    \n*   imprecision; and\n    \n*   publication bias.\n    \n\n【150】We included a 'Summary of findings' table, constructed according to the recommendations described in Chapter 10 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Handbook 2011 ). We included the following outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table: hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life, health‐related quality of life, listening ability and adverse effects.\n\n【151】Results\n-------\n\n【152】### Description of studies\n\n【153】See: Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【154】#### Results of the search\n\n【155】The search identified 4821 records including papers, reviews, conference abstracts and registered clinical trials, of which 2840 remained after removing duplicates. We discarded 2748 records based on the title and/or abstract, which left 92 records. We discarded a further 81 records. Of these, we discarded 69 on the basis that they were not RCTs, 10 because the intervention was not hearing aids alone, one because the control was not appropriate according to the protocol, and one record was an ongoing clinical trial ( NCT03002142 ).\n\n【156】Subsequently, we formally excluded five studies for the reasons given in Excluded studies . An erratum ( McArdle 2006 ) was associated with one of the included studies ( McArdle 2005 ). Five studies were eligible for inclusion in the review ( Figure 1 ). Three studies reported quantitative data that could be included in the meta‐analyses ( Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ). Methodological information was supplemented by other articles on the same study for McArdle 2005 by Chisolm 2005 , and for Adrait 2017 by Nguyen 2017 .\n\n【157】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【158】Figure 1\n\n【159】* * *\n\n【160】* * *\n\n【161】Study flow diagram.\n\n【162】#### Included studies\n\n【163】##### Design\n\n【164】All five included studies reported using a randomised controlled (parallel) design. Three studies used a waiting list control group ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and the control group in two studies used placebo hearing aids ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ). All five studies specified that the control group received the active hearing aid intervention at the end of the randomised phase, and further follow‐up was conducted in all but one study ( Mulrow 1990 ). Participants in the waiting list groups received hearing aids ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and the placebo hearing aids were reprogrammed to provide amplification ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ).\n\n【165】The trial endpoint varied across studies with post‐hearing aid fitting outcomes obtained at six weeks ( Humes 2017 ; Melin 1987 ), two months ( McArdle 2005 ), 16 weeks ( Mulrow 1990 ), and six months ( Adrait 2017 ). None of the studies reported long‐term outcomes of over one year.\n\n【166】##### Setting\n\n【167】Three studies were published between 1987 and 2005 ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and two were published in 2017 ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ). Two studies were set in Veterans Association clinics in the USA ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), two in university clinics in the USA and Sweden ( Humes 2017 ; Melin 1987 ), and one in a hospital setting in France ( Adrait 2017 ).\n\n【168】##### Population and sample size\n\n【169】Age, sex and hearing loss were reported at the group level for all studies except Melin 1987 , which reported these data at the participant level. The total sample size for the included studies was 825.\n\n【170】All the studies recruited older adult participants, with the mean age in individual studies ranging between 69 and 83 years. Two studies involved military personnel and had almost exclusively male participants ( McArdle 2005 98%; Mulrow 1990 99%), whereas in the other studies males accounted for between 33% and 57% of the samples. All reported mean thresholds were within the mild to moderate hearing loss range of this review's inclusion criteria as described in Types of participants . The frequencies at which mean hearing thresholds were reported varied across studies. All studies had hearing loss as an inclusion criterion but the frequencies and hearing levels used to define the inclusion criteria varied across studies. It is possible that the military veterans were at increased risk of having noise‐induced hearing loss. This is typically shown by a notch in the pure‐tone audiogram around 4 kHz (i.e. thresholds close to that frequency would be better at adjacent frequencies). There was no evidence of noise‐induced hearing loss in the group audiometric results in McArdle 2005 , and the presence of noise‐induced hearing loss could not be determined in Mulrow 1990 . The participants in Humes 2017 , who lived independently in the community, showed no evidence of noise‐induced hearing loss in the group audiometric results. The participants in Adrait 2017 all had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Two studies used normal cognitive function based on the Mini‐Mental State Examination as an inclusion criterion ( Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ), and those with disabling comorbid conditions were excluded from Mulrow 1990 .\n\n【171】##### Interventions and comparisons\n\n【172】The intervention in each study was acoustic hearing aids, which met the inclusion criteria of this review as described in Types of interventions . Three studies used bilateral hearing fittings ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ), and in the two early studies hearing aids were fitted to one ear only in 95% and 97% participants respectively ( Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). Two studies reported using in‐the‐ear hearing aids ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and three studies used behind‐the‐ear hearing aids ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ; Melin 1987 ), with three studies reporting the manufacturer and model of hearing aid used ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ; Melin 1987 ). Fully digitally programmable hearing aids were used in two studies ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ), with both digital or analogue hearing aids used by McArdle 2005 . Humes 2017 used two programming methods for the intervention group. The hearing aids for the Audiology Best practice group were programmed using real‐ear measurements according to NAL‐NL2, whereas the hearing aids for the Consumer Decides group were preset to three common audiogram configurations, and the participants chose which programme they preferred. The two early studies did not report the technology type ( Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). Three studies used a waiting list comparison group until the first treatment period was completed ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and two studies used placebo hearing aids as the comparison ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ), which were programmed to provide no gain so as to be as acoustically transparent as possible.\n\n【173】##### Outcomes\n\n【174】Adrait 2017 is one of a series of papers reporting the results of a clinical trial aimed at studying the effects of bilateral hearing aids in patients with age‐related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer Disease, Presbycusis and Hearing Aids, ADPHA study) on the cognitive, behavioural, quality of life and economic aspects. There were no hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life or listening ability outcomes measured. Apart from adverse effects, this study did not use any of the outcome measures pre‐specified in this review ( Types of outcome measures ).\n\n【175】###### Primary outcomes\n\n【176】Three studies reported hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life using the HHIE ( Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ). In addition to the HHIE, Mulrow 1990 also used the Quantified Denver Scale of Communication (QDS). Using the outcome hierarchy defined in Primary outcomes , we only included the HHIE data from Mulrow 1990 in the meta‐analyses.\n\n【177】Only one study measured adverse effects ( Adrait 2017 ); no adverse effects related to pain were reported.\n\n【178】###### Secondary outcomes\n\n【179】Health‐related quality of life was reported by three studies ( Adrait 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ). Two studies used outcome measures that were generic to the clinical population being assessed: McArdle 2005 used the WHO‐DAS II and Mulrow 1990 used the Self‐Evaluation of Life Function (SELF).\n\n【180】Adrait 2017 used a disease‐specific health‐related quality of life measure for patients with Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Disease Related Quality of Life, ADRQL; Rabins 1999 ). Data for the ADRQL were collected from the caregivers, rather than the patients. Therefore, this was not an outcome measure of interest pre‐specified in this review.\n\n【181】Listening ability was reported in three studies. Humes 2017 used the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (PHAP; Cox 1990 ), McArdle 2005 used the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and Melin 1987 used a hearing ability scaling assessment. We did not include the hearing ability scaling assessment, which is not a validated measure, in the meta‐analysis as not all the data required were available in the paper and were no longer available.\n\n【182】Only one study measured adverse effects ( Adrait 2017 ); no adverse effects related to noise‐induced hearing loss were reported.\n\n【183】#### Excluded studies\n\n【184】Details of the five studies that we excluded after clarification of the methods used are shown in Characteristics of excluded studies .\n\n【185】### Risk of bias in included studies\n\n【186】Two authors (MF, PK) critically reviewed the methodology of the included studies. We contacted the authors from all five included studies to further establish aspects of risk of bias that were unclear from the full article. We received responses from four authors ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ). The 'Risk of bias' summary for the included studies is shown in Figure 2 . One study showed a low risk of bias in six categories ( Adrait 2017 ), two studies showed a low risk of bias in four categories ( Humes 2017 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and two studies showed a low risk of bias in three categories ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ).The 'Risk of bias' graph presented as percentages across all studies is shown in Figure 3 . Further details are described below.\n\n【187】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【188】Figure 2\n\n【189】* * *\n\n【190】* * *\n\n【191】'Risk of bias' summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【192】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【193】Figure 3\n\n【194】* * *\n\n【195】* * *\n\n【196】'Risk of bias' graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【197】#### Allocation\n\n【198】##### Random sequence generation\n\n【199】We judged all five included studies to be at a low risk of bias due to sequence generation.\n\n【200】##### Allocation concealment\n\n【201】We judged three studies to be at low risk of bias due to allocation concealment as a remote allocation service or sealed, opaque envelopes were used ( Adrait 2017 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). There was insufficient information to make a judgement for McArdle 2005 , and we judged Humes 2017 to be at high risk of bias because the randomisation list was visible to the clinical trial co‐ordinator who also allocated participants to the treatment or comparator group.\n\n【202】#### Blinding\n\n【203】Until recently, the nature of hearing aids as an intervention has led to substantial difficulty in designing trials that aim to control for performance bias. In addition, the visibility of hearing aids increases the risk of detection bias when a researcher measures outcomes. Thus, we judged all the studies published during or before 2005 that used waiting list controls to be at high risk for both performance and detection bias ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). The use of placebo hearing aids allows blinding of participants and personnel and blinded assessment of outcomes if they are visibly identical to active hearing aids and the fitting procedure for active and placebo devices is indistinguishable to the participant. These criteria were met by Adrait 2017 , which we judged to be at low risk of performance and detection bias. The Humes 2017 study also used placebo devices but we judged this to have an unclear risk of performance and detection bias as there was potential for participants to be unblinded due to contact with the clinical trial co‐ordinator who was not blinded to allocation.\n\n【204】#### Incomplete outcome data\n\n【205】We judged attrition bias to be low for three studies ( Humes 2017 ; McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), as dropouts were clearly reported and dropout numbers were low and were equal across both the intervention and comparator groups. The reasons for dropouts were generally not related to the intervention. McArdle 2005 used imputation to account for missing data due to dropouts. There was insufficient information about the other two studies to assess the risk of bias ( Adrait 2017 ; Melin 1987 ), which led to a judgement of unclear risk.\n\n【206】#### Selective reporting\n\n【207】We judged all five included studies to be at low risk of selective reporting. Two studies published study protocols and reported the stated outcomes ( Adrait 2017 ; Humes 2017 ). Although no protocols had been published prior to the completion of two of the older studies ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), the reported outcomes followed the rationale of the studies. Contact with the authors of Melin 1987 indicated that all outcomes measured had been included.\n\n【208】#### Other potential sources of bias\n\n【209】Three of the included studies had the comparator group on a waiting list ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and all of these studies had specified that all patients would receive hearing aids at the end of the randomised phase. Studies using waiting list controls have a risk of overestimating the benefit of an intervention, especially if participants perceived that the reported outcomes could determine their eligibility for an intervention ( Furukawa 2014 ). As all the participants were aware that they would receive the interventions at the end of the study, we thought that the risks were less clear in this case (unclear risk of bias).\n\n【210】### Effects of interventions\n\n【211】See: **Summary of findings for the main comparison** Hearing aids versus no hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss in adults\n\n【212】See: summary of findings Table for the main comparison .\n\n【213】For the McArdle 2005 study, we extracted data from Table 3, except the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) data from the control group at the two‐month follow‐up, which we took from the table in the Erratum ( McArdle 2006 ). Humes 2017 did not report the six‐week follow‐up results, so we obtained these from the study dataset that was sent at our request. We directly extracted data from Mulrow 1990 . Data from Melin 1987 and Adrait 2017 were not included in the meta‐analysis (see Characteristics of included studies ).\n\n【214】#### Comparison: hearing aids versus no hearing aids\n\n【215】##### Primary outcome measures\n\n【216】###### 1\\. Hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life\n\n【217】The HHIE at study endpoint was used to measure hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life in all three studies included in a meta‐analysis. Mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown in Analysis 1.1 ( Figure 4 ).\n\n【218】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【219】Figure 4\n\n【220】* * *\n\n【221】* * *\n\n【222】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Hearing aids versus no/placebo hearing aids, outcome: 1.1 Hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life. Assessed using Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) in all studies.\n\n【223】The random‐effects meta‐analysis showed a significant overall effect that favoured hearing aids over the unaided/placebo comparison (scale range 0 to 100) (MD ‐26.47, 95% CI ‐42.16 to ‐10.77; 722 participants; three studies) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ) ( Analysis 1.1 ). We observed considerable heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 97%), which was statistically significant (Chi <sup>2 </sup> \\= 63.84, df = 2, P < 0.00001). We conducted an unplanned subgroup analysis (Veterans Association setting, mostly male, in‐the‐ear hearing aids, waiting list control versus community setting, male‐female balance, behind‐the‐ear hearing aids, placebo control study) to explore this statistical heterogeneity. This showed statistically significant subgroup effects (P < 0.00001). The MD was ‐33.48, (95% CI ‐36.72 to ‐30.23; 568 participants; two studies; I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 4%) for the veterans subgroup ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and ‐10.54 (95% CI ‐15.26 to ‐5.82; 154 participants) for the community setting subgroup ( Humes 2017 ).\n\n【224】The Quantified Denver Scale of Communication (QDS) results from Mulrow 1990 were not included in the meta‐analysis as our protocol specified a hierarchy of inclusion in which the HHIE had a higher priority. However, the QDS also indicated a significant effect favouring hearing aids (scale range 0 to 100) (MD ‐26.5, 95% CI ‐33.6 to ‐19.4; 188 participants).\n\n【225】###### 2\\. Adverse effects\n\n【226】Only one study (n = 48) measured adverse effects ( Adrait 2017 ), and no adverse effects related to pain were reported ( _very low‐quality evidence_ ).\n\n【227】##### Secondary outcome measures\n\n【228】###### 1\\. Health‐related quality of life\n\n【229】Health‐related quality of life at study endpoint was measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO‐DAS) II ( McArdle 2005 ) and the Self‐Evaluation of Life Function (SELF) ( Mulrow 1990 ). A random‐effects meta‐analysis showed a significant overall effect that favoured hearing aids over the unaided/placebo comparison (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.38, 95% CI ‐0.55 to ‐0.21; 568 participants; two studies, I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 6%) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ) (see Analysis 1.2 ; Figure 5 ).\n\n【230】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【231】Figure 5\n\n【232】* * *\n\n【233】* * *\n\n【234】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Hearing aids versus no/placebo hearing aids, outcome: 1.2 Health‐related quality of life.\n\n【235】###### 2\\. Listening ability\n\n【236】Listening ability at study endpoint was measured using the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (PHAP) in Humes 2017 and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) in McArdle 2005 . A random‐effects meta‐analysis showed a significant overall effect that favoured hearing aids over the unaided/placebo comparison (SMD ‐1.88, 95% CI ‐3.24 to ‐0.52; 534 participants; two studies) ( _moderate‐quality evidence_ ) ( Analysis 1.3 ; Figure 6 ). We observed considerable heterogeneity (I <sup>2 </sup> \\= 97%), which was statistically significant (Chi <sup>2 </sup> \\= 31.12, df = 1, P < 0.00001). The unplanned subgroup analysis showed statistically significant (P < 0.00001) subgroup effects, where McArdle 2005 had a SMD of ‐2.57 (95% CI ‐2.84 to ‐2.30; 380 participants) and Humes 2017 had a SMD of ‐1.18 (95% CI ‐1.54 to ‐0.81; 154 participants).\n\n【237】*   Open in figure viewer\n\n【238】Figure 6\n\n【239】* * *\n\n【240】* * *\n\n【241】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Hearing aids versus no/placebo hearing aids, outcome: 1.3 Listening ability.\n\n【242】###### 3\\. Adverse effects\n\n【243】Only one study (n = 48) measured adverse effects ( Adrait 2017 ), and no adverse effects related to noise‐induced hearing loss were reported ( _very low‐quality evidence_ ).\n\n【244】Discussion\n----------\n\n【245】### Summary of main results\n\n【246】For hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life where participation is the key domain (primary outcome measure), we found evidence that hearing aids had a large beneficial effect in reducing participation restrictions. Our confidence in the quality of the evidence for hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life was moderate due to high risk of bias (see summary of findings Table for the main comparison ). Significant differences in the size of effects were apparent across studies; the effects reported by the two individual Veterans Association (VA) studies were similar ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ), and more than twice the size of the effect reported by Humes 2017 . However, all three studies individually reported large effects (standardised mean difference (SMD) > 0.70) that favoured hearing aids, meaning that while further evidence may change the size of the overall effect on hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life, we have high confidence in the magnitude and direction of the effect.\n\n【247】For health‐related quality of life (secondary outcome measure) there was evidence of a small beneficial overall effect of hearing aids compared to the unaided/placebo condition. Two different outcome measures were used. One study reported a significant benefit of hearing aids compared to the unaided/placebo condition using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO‐DAS II) (SMD ‐0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.65 to ‐0.24; 380 participants), and another study reported no significant effect of hearing aids using the Self‐Evaluation of Life Function (SELF) (SMD ‐0.26, 95% CI ‐0.55 to 0.03; 188 participants). Heterogeneity was low. Our confidence in the quality of the evidence for health‐related quality of life was moderate due to high risk of bias (see summary of findings Table for the main comparison ).\n\n【248】For listening ability (secondary outcome measure), there was a large beneficial effect of hearing aids when compared to the unaided/placebo condition. The two studies used different outcome measures with one, Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), being an abbreviated version of the other (PHAP). Both measures revealed large beneficial effects that favoured the use of hearing aids. Our confidence in the quality of the evidence for listening ability was moderate due to high risk of bias (see summary of findings Table for the main comparison ), although we have high confidence that the effect was both large and beneficial.\n\n【249】Adverse effects associated with hearing aids were measured in only one study but no adverse effects were reported that related to pain or noise‐induced hearing loss, so it was not possible to comment on the reported benefits against harms.\n\n【250】### Overall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\n【251】Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for this review. Three studies assessed hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life using measures that fit within our pre‐defined hierarchy of self‐report outcome measures, of which one measure (the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, HHIE) was used in all three studies. High heterogeneity and subgroup differences for the HHIE results stem from the Humes 2017 study of older adults living in the general community, in which a smaller effect was observed than was found in the two VA studies ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ). The participants in the Humes 2017 study had a more even male‐female split (57:43), had better average hearing thresholds, were provided with behind‐the‐ear hearing aids for a cost, and the comparison group received placebo hearing aids. In contrast, the participants in the VA studies were almost exclusively male veterans who may have experienced gunfire or explosive noise that may have resulted in noise‐induced hearing loss and the possibility of compensation claims, had poorer hearing, were provided with in‐the‐ear hearing aids at no cost, and were compared to a waiting list (passive control) group. These participant and methodological differences were likely to account for the differences in the estimated size of the effects between the studies for both the hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life and listening ability outcomes. As there were numerous differences between these two groups of participants (military veterans versus community dwellers), we considered whether it was appropriate to pool the studies. On the basis that recommendations for the clinical management of hearing loss using hearing aids would not differ between these two groups, we concluded that the data from the studies should therefore be pooled. The choice of outcome measure to assess health‐related quality of life was inconsistent, although heterogeneity in the reported effects was low. The WHO‐DAS II used in the McArdle 2005 study has since been superseded by the WHO‐DAS 2.0 ( WHO 2012b ), which directly links to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework.\n\n【252】We did not include cognition as an outcome in the protocol because of the wide variety and uncertainty of definitions of specific domains within the broader context of cognition (e.g. attention, memory, processing speed). The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and Geriatric Depression Scale measures reported in one included study ( Mulrow 1990 ), alongside a raft of measures related to Alzheimer's disease in another study ( Adrait 2017 ), were not specified in the protocol, and we did not analyse or report the results. Mulrow 1990 reported significant improvements in the hearing aid group on both measures, whereas there were no group differences for any of the measures reported by Adrait 2017 .\n\n【253】The planned subgroup analyses (age, sex and degree of hearing loss) could not be performed as data from these subgroups were not reported. Outcomes were measured for short‐to‐medium term follow‐up only (six weeks to six months), with no studies reporting long‐term outcome at more than one year for either intervention or control groups separately. In terms of completeness, there are a limited number of RCTs, a preponderance of participants who were men who had poorer hearing, inconsistency in the choice of outcome measures to assess health‐related quality of life and listening ability, and inconsistency in the choice of comparator (waiting list versus placebo control).\n\n【254】In terms of applicability, all participant samples were reported to have mild to moderate hearing loss. The three studies included in the meta‐analyses represented the majority of the participants from the included studies (n = 738; 89%). However, two of these study samples (n = 574) were overwhelmingly male military veterans (97% and 99%) who received their hearing aids free of charge, although there is evidence that the price of hearing aids does not affect outcomes ( Humes 2017 ). Generalisability to other non‐military populations that would certainly include a greater proportion of women represents a limitation, which these studies acknowledged, and may reflect the size of the effects on hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life and listening ability. There was also variability in whether hearing aids were fitted unilaterally or bilaterally. Three of the studies had exclusion criteria that were specific to other comorbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment (two studies specifically screened for this using the Mini‐Mental State Examination), which could also limit applicability of the findings to general clinical populations, such as those with dementia. Although Adrait 2017 reported no effect of hearing aids in their population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, the outcomes in that study differed to those specified in our review.\n\n【255】Finally, only two of the five included studies set out specifically to examine whether hearing aids improved quality of life in those who had hearing loss ( Adrait 2017 ; Mulrow 1990 ), but one of these recruited only people with Alzheimer's disease. The primary aim of McArdle 2005 was to assess the properties of the WHO‐DAS II as an outcome measure by examining its responsiveness to the effects of hearing aids. The Melin 1987 study was primarily designed to examine hearing aids as an intervention for people with tinnitus, and the Humes 2017 study focused on different service delivery models.\n\n【256】### Quality of the evidence\n\n【257】We considered the quality of evidence for the primary outcome measure (hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life) and secondary outcome measures (health‐related quality of life and listening ability), as assessed by the GRADE system, to be moderate. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level because all studies contributing data to these outcomes had either a rating of unclear and/or high risk bias in at least one of the domains of selection bias, performance and/or detection bias (see summary of findings Table for the main comparison ).\n\n【258】All five included studies were RCTs. We judged three studies to be at high risk of performance and detection bias ( McArdle 2005 ; Melin 1987 ; Mulrow 1990 ). These biases are recognised widely to be problematic in hearing aid intervention studies as blinding of patients and assessors can be difficult to achieve. Although Humes 2017 used a placebo hearing aid comparison to control for these biases, the potential for unblinding led to our judgements of unclear risk. However, the use of placebo hearing aids with zero‐gain prescriptions adopted by both Adrait 2017 and Humes 2017 does demonstrate that it is now possible to blind participants and outcome assessors in hearing aid trials.\n\n【259】We considered downgrading the evidence for the effects of hearing aids on hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life and listening ability due to both inconsistency and indirectness. There were concerns over inconsistency because of the observed statistical heterogeneity between VA studies ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ) and the study of Humes 2017 conducted in the community setting. Concerns arose over indirectness both because the analyses included data from male military veterans and also because of the short follow‐up period in Humes 2017 (six weeks). We took the decision not to downgrade due to either inconsistency or indirectness as all studies individually reported large beneficial effects of hearing aids on both outcomes, regardless of whether they had been conducted in the military or community settings and regardless of the duration of follow‐up. Thus, the observed heterogeneity did not reduce our confidence in the estimates of these effects.\n\n【260】Finally, we considered downgrading the evidence for health‐related quality of life due to indirectness. Both studies included in the analysis had samples that were almost exclusively male military veterans ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ). However, we did not downgrade the evidence because the estimates of the effect were similar across the two studies and heterogeneity was low despite numerous other differences in their samples and designs (i.e. different outcome measure, follow‐up period and hearing aid style and number fitted). Our confidence in the size of the effect was therefore not reduced.\n\n【261】Limitations of the evidence reviewed were the numerous methodological and sampling differences between the two veteran studies ( McArdle 2005 ; Mulrow 1990 ) and the other included studies, and the lack of long‐term outcomes (i.e. greater than one year). There were also inconsistencies in the reporting of the studies and clarification on methodological details had to be sought from the authors of all five studies, with four providing information that was not published. Two of the studies were published before the 2001 CONSORT guidelines yet only one out of the other three studies that could have feasibly been able to follow these guidelines reported the study to that standard ( Humes 2017 ).\n\n【262】### Potential biases in the review process\n\n【263】The electronic searches for this review were comprehensive, with a second search carried out within two months of submission to ensure an up‐to‐date review. The protocol defined the review process and the roles of the authors, and each source was independently reviewed by two authors. Inclusion did not require specific outcome tools.\n\n【264】We revised the inclusion criteria relating to the types of participants due to concerns that the original criteria stated in the protocol had the potential to bias the study selection process (see Differences between protocol and review ).\n\n【265】Although we revised the inclusion criteria for Types of participants part‐way through the review, we did this with the important rationale of avoiding a potential bias where studies that were reported in less detail (e.g. group mean hearing threshold data or qualitative descriptions) were more likely to be included than those studies that either reported in more detail or provided us with participant‐level data. To minimise the risk of bias in this process, the revised definition for Types of participants and the final decisions about which studies were eligible for inclusion in the review were subject to independent review by an external expert committee to ensure that this was appropriate for the review question.\n\n【266】### Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\n【267】This review is consistent with the conclusions of a previous systematic review on hearing aids ( Chisolm 2007 ). Both reviews conclude that hearing aids improve hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life compared to no hearing aids. However, whereas Chisolm 2007 identified a lack of evidence for more general effects on health‐related quality of life in people with hearing loss, in our review we showed a small beneficial effect. These reviews differ in a number of methodological details. The current review includes only randomised controlled trials, whereas Chisolm 2007 included randomised and non‐randomised trials. Chisolm 2007 used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) grading system ( Harbour 2001 ), and included two studies that met the highest level of evidence (level 1, RCTs) ( Mulrow 1990 ; Yueh 2001 ). We did not include the Yueh 2001 study as the randomisation took place after the participants had been allocated to either hearing aids or no hearing aids on the basis of whether they were eligible to receive hearing aids or not. Our review included the McArdle 2005 study, which had not been published at the time the Chisolm 2007 review was conducted, and we included the study by Melin 1987 . The other main differences between the reviews were that our review was able to include three generally well‐designed RCTs in the meta‐analyses and used a pre‐defined hierarchy of outcome measures for each outcome domain.\n\n【268】A more recent review on the benefit of hearing aids for patients with mild sensorineural hearing loss concludes that there is evidence that hearing aids benefit adults with mild sensorineural hearing loss ( Johnson 2016 ). None of the studies included in this review were RCTs, and so we cannot compare the results and conclusions of that review with ours.\n\n【269】Figures and Tables -\n\n【270】Figure 1\n\n【271】Study flow diagram.\n\n【272】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【273】Figures and Tables -\n\n【274】Figure 2\n\n【275】'Risk of bias' summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study.\n\n【276】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【277】Figures and Tables -\n\n【278】Figure 3\n\n【279】'Risk of bias' graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies.\n\n【280】Navigate to figure in Review Print figure Open in new tab\n\n【281】Figures and Tables -\n\n【282】Figure 4\n\n【283】Forest plot of comparison: 1 Hearing aids versus no/placebo hearing aids, outcome: 1.1 Hearing‐specific health‐related quality of life.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】The primary purpose of this review is to evaluate if psychological therapies are helpful in improving the ability of people with hemophilia to cope with their chronic condition.\n\n【3】The chronic aspect of hemophilia, its clinical variabilities and the differences in treatment availability across countries are all factors that affect wellness in its emotional, intellectual, spiritual and behavioural dimensions.\n\n【4】The main objectives are to determine in people with hemophilia:\n\n【5】1.  if any psychotherapies are effective in the management of the disease;\n    \n2.  which phase of the patient's life or phase of treatment, or both, this effectiveness occurs;\n    \n3.  which psychological therapies (as described under Types of interventions ) are more effective for any given situation.\n    \n\n【6】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【7】Background\n----------\n\n【8】### Description of the condition\n\n【9】A glossary of terms is available ( Appendix 1 ).  \n  \nHemophilia A and B (Christmas Disease) are rare chronic and inherited blood clotting disorders ( Lozier 2004 ; Rodgers 1999 ). Although hemophilia A and B are hereditary disorders, 30% to 40% of hemophilia cases are due to a spontaneous mutation, meaning that in such families there is no preceding history of hemophilia ( Hoots 2007 ; Rodgers 1999 ).\n\n【10】Internationally, the treatment of hemophilia varies widely, dependent upon healthcare systems and infrastructure, governmental support and gross domestic product (GDP). In developing nations access to hemophilia care and treatment is limited and disability consequent upon hemophilia is greater and more frequent, with significant reduced life expectancy and societal integration. Therefore, relationships, understanding, opportunities and attitudes to hemophilia _per se_ and to patients with hemophilia, vary nation to nation and healthcare system to healthcare system.\n\n【11】Clinically, hemophilia manifests through a wide and varied pattern of bleeding events. Most bleeding events in severe and moderate hemophilia occur in the joints and muscles. Bleeds may also occur in other soft tissues (often associated with trauma), or with surgical or dental interventions or generally in the oral cavity (tongue and lips lesions) ( Lozier 2004 ). Epistaxis, hematuria and gastro‐intestinal and iliopsoas bleeding may also occur ( Kessler 2006 ).\n\n【12】The primary consequence of hemarthrosis is the development of chronic hemophilic arthropathy, which may occur if hemarthroses are recurrent, untreated, or inadequately treated. Chronic hemophilic arthropathy results in deformity, impairment of joint movement, reduced mobility and chronic pain ( Roosendaal 2006 ; Villaça 2004 ).\n\n【13】The standard medical treatment for hemophilia is factor replacement therapy, given by intravenous infusion either on demand (when the bleeding occurs) or, in patients with severe hemophilia, prophylactically to prevent recurrent hemorrhage and so the development of chronic hemophilic arthropathy ( Iorio 2011 ). Some patients develop antibodies directed against missing or abnormal clotting factor that inhibit the effect of transfused factor concentrates. In the presence of such antibodies (inhibitors), management of both bleeding events and the hemophilia in general, is significantly more complex. Therapies to control bleeding are effective but very costly ( Iorio 2010 ) and attempts to eradicate the inhibitors are an option to be considered.\n\n【14】Historically (until late 1980s), prior to the implementation of specific donor testing and the development of effective virus inactivation processes in the manufacture of plasma concentrates, many patients acquired blood borne virus infections (HIV or hepatitis C (HCV), or both) through the use of large pool plasma‐derived concentrates. This has been a significant legacy, physically and psychologically, of earlier generation plasma‐derived factor concentrate treatments.\n\n【15】Besides medical treatment, management of hemophilia also represents a challenge due to the peculiarities of this inherited bleeding disorder. The ability to cope with the bleeding disorder and taking into account the self‐perception of the patient are critical. Several psychosocial issues should be considered in the management of hemophilia, including the following.\n\n【16】1.  Hemophilia is a chronic and incurable condition, which requires each individual to have an adaptation process to be able to optimally interact with peers ( Barlow 2007 ; Dunn 2008 ; Plug 2008 ; Remor 2002 ; Stieltjes 2009 ; Talaulikar 2006 ). For example, sports are recommended by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), but the choice and practice represent a psychosocial issue that requires perception of limitations, expectations and cultural influences on the child and family, along with the advice by the hemophilia centers ( Mulder 2004 ; von Mackensen 2007 ).\n    \n2.  Where treatment is available and prophylaxis is used, it is only when a bleed occurs or pain is felt, or when day‐to‐day activities are interrupted or restricted by the consequences of bleeding, that the person with hemophilia becomes aware of the disease and feels himself or herself as a patient. This fact can lead to a denial of the bleeding disorder, which is a commonly used mechanism, particularly in adolescence and to non‐adherence (Khair 2010; Penica 2008 ).\n    \n3.  Where treatment is unavailable, acute and chronic pain and arthropathy become an experience from childhood onwards. The development towards a functional and productive adult personality including undertaking studies and maintaining both employment and relationships can become issues ( Barlow 2007 ; Elander 2009 ; Plug 2008 ; Siboni 2009 ).\n    \n4.  Parents and relatives, due to the highly demanding situation and the complexity of the relationships in the setting of a genetically transmitted disease, may have their own issues that contribute to making life easier or more difficult for the patient.\n    \n5.  Feelings of anxiety, sadness and depression traducing in mental health disorders are reported in hemophilia patients but will vary in its influence in the individual's quality of life depending on cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs, family support and others variables ( Cassis 2007 ; Ghanizadeh 2009 ).\n    \n\n【17】### Description of the intervention\n\n【18】Psychological interventions are used to help individuals with hemophilia deal better with the different psychological issues that they experience throughout their whole life cycle. These interventions can include family members such as parents and siblings. The interventions are carried out in either treatment centers, in facilities linked to the medical team and in a non‐medical environment, such as an association of patients or any other community‐based setting.\n\n【19】There are different types of interventions based on the objectives to be achieved and on other characteristics, such as the patient's availability to frequently attend the center, or his or her physical and emotional wellness state.\n\n【20】These interventions include: cognitive therapy; psychodynamic psychotherapy; psycho‐education; behavioural therapy; and systemic therapy.\n\n【21】### How the intervention might work\n\n【22】A better functional status (as measured with objective instruments) and an improved quality of life are expected as a result of the intervention. Physical limitations or impairment are not always correlated with a poor mental health quality ( Stieltjes 2009 ) showing how important adaptive coping strategies are in coping with living with hemophilia's issues. Reports on the importance of acceptance of hemophilia as part of oneself are well documented ( Albrecht 1999 ; Beeton 2005 ).\n\n【23】Parents can receive support through counselling, from the moment of diagnosis through the entire life cycle, with the aim of helping to understand each cognitive stage of development of their child ( Bottos 2007 ). Children themselves can receive support through play therapy. This preventive approach aims to avoid: rejection of hemophilia; fear of reporting bleedings; and non‐compliance ( Cassis 2007 ).\n\n【24】One of the outcomes usually measured to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions is quality of life. Different approaches have been undertaken with questionnaires to assess this outcome. For children there is the CHO‐KLAT questionnaire ( Young 2006 ) and for children and adults, the Haemo‐Qol instrument ( Remor 2002 ; von Mackensen 2004 ). There have also been studies of elderly patients ( Siboni 2009 ).\n\n【25】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【26】People with hemophilia, whether this is mild, moderate, or severe, with or without inhibitors, often present with the effects of psychosocial stressors. Psychological interventions to help coping with these psychosocial issues are often claimed to be helpful and needed by several hemophilia healthcare professionals and patients's organizations in many countries. Various schemes and programs to provide support on emotional, cognitive and educational grounds have been proposed by psychologists, social workers and counsellors. Although many different interventions have been used and published on, a systematic review in the field of psychological therapies would provide a knowledge base illustrating which psychological therapies are often utilised and which are proven effective.\n\n【27】Objectives\n----------\n\n【28】The primary purpose of this review is to evaluate if psychological therapies are helpful in improving the ability of people with hemophilia to cope with their chronic condition.\n\n【29】The chronic aspect of hemophilia, its clinical variabilities and the differences in treatment availability across countries are all factors that affect wellness in its emotional, intellectual, spiritual and behavioural dimensions.\n\n【30】The main objectives are to determine in people with hemophilia:\n\n【31】1.  if any psychotherapies are effective in the management of the disease;\n    \n2.  which phase of the patient's life or phase of treatment, or both, this effectiveness occurs;\n    \n3.  which psychological therapies (as described under Types of interventions ) are more effective for any given situation.\n    \n\n【32】Methods\n-------\n\n【33】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【34】#### Types of studies\n\n【35】All randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐randomized trials or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).\n\n【36】#### Types of participants\n\n【37】Patients with hemophilia of any age or gender, type A or B, any severity (severe, moderate, mild), with or without inhibitors. Patients with HIV and or HCV are eligible for inclusion.\n\n【38】#### Types of interventions\n\n【39】This review targets all psychological interventions which have the objective to promote emotional, intellectual and spiritual wellness. Individual, group or family group therapy interventions are eligible for inclusion. Family group therapy will be included if family members are participating with the patient.\n\n【40】The interventions are based on the issues we wish to explore: early understanding of the chronic condition (education); adherence or compliance to treatment (on‐demand or prophylaxis); inclusion in social life; and pain management (chronic or acute).\n\n【41】##### Psycho‐education and low intensity psycho‐educational intervention (telephone, Internet, diaries as following up tools)\n\n【42】Psycho‐education means providing information and learning about oneself and one's own treatment aiming an increase in self‐confidence for a better day‐to‐day life. It is also used to provide early coping strategies to the patient and his or her parents, to deal with stressors linked to hemophilia and its peculiarities.\n\n【43】1\\. Management of treatment for hemophilia A and B (including those with inhibitors)\n\n【44】2\\. Management of treatment for hemophilia and HIV or HCV, or both\n\n【45】3\\. Self‐infusion therapy programs on‐demand or on prophylaxis\n\n【46】4\\. Port‐a‐cath procedure\n\n【47】5\\. Learning and counselling with educational tools\n\n【48】##### Cognitive therapy\n\n【49】1\\. Investigate ways of thinking, perceiving and feeling, i.e. low self‐esteem, misunderstandings\n\n【50】2\\. Inform and re‐frame inappropriate thoughts or beliefs\n\n【51】3\\.

Learning new approaches to cope with problems between members of the family\n\n【65】2\\. The psychological frame can vary from psychodynamic, behavioural or interactional therapy\n\n【66】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【67】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【68】1.  Mood ‐ anxiety and depression (any measure with adequate psychometric properties that identify psychiatric symptomatology, emotional or behavioural difficulties in child or adult)\n    \n2.  Coping strategies for relief of pain, anxiety, early report of bleeding, preparation for joint replacement and surgery, complications such as HCV and HIV, and adherence to treatment\n    \n3.  Quality of life (any measure that quantifies the extent to which the child or adult is able to participate in developmentally appropriate social activities in the field of education, employment, leisure time)\n    \n\n【69】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【70】1.  Compliance or adherence to prophylaxis treatment\n    \n2.  Phyisical health\n    \n    1.  frequency of bleedings and emergency department visits\n        \n    2.  hospital admissions\n        \n    3.  duration of hospitalisations\n        \n    4.  presence of co‐morbidities\n        \n3.  Cost of psychological intervention\n    \n4.  Family adjustment\n    \n\n【71】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【72】#### Electronic searches\n\n【73】We will identify relevant studies from the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register.\n\n【74】The Coagulopathies Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of _The Cochrane Library_ ) and quarterly searches of MEDLINE and the prospective handsearching of one journal ‐ _Haemophilia._ Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of major conferences: the European Haematology Association conference; the American Society of Hematology conference; the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting; and the Congress of the World Federation of Hemophilia. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant section of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module .\n\n【75】We also plan to search: a clinical trials registry: ClinicalTrial.gov ; EMBASE (www.embase.com) ; and PsycINFO/PsycLit ( www.apa.org ).\n\n【76】#### Searching other resources\n\n【77】We will search conference proceedings of the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis from 1990 to the present day. We will scan the reference lists of all retrieved publications and 'grey' literature such as reports and doctoral dissertations that may contain psychological studies.\n\n【78】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【79】#### Selection of studies\n\n【80】Two authors will independently assess study eligibility using a standardized form. We aim to solve any disagreements by discussion, or if unsuccessful, by asking a third author. If we identify multiple publications on the same trial they will list all these references together under one study identifier and use all available data.\n\n【81】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【82】Two authors will independently perform data extraction using a standardized form. We aim to solve any disagreements by discussion, or if unsuccessful, by asking a third author. We plan to extract the following: bibliographical data (authors, journal, publication year, publication type); study type; type of participants (patients, carriers, carers); number of participants, intervention(s) number; and type of comparator. If required, the authors will request any additional data not found in the publication from the study authors.\n\n【83】We will group outcome data as follows: short‐term (on treatment); mid‐term (end of treatment to three months); long‐term (over three months).\n\n【84】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【85】The standard risk of bias assessment tool incorporated in RevMan will be used ( RevMan 2011 ). Risk of bias will be assessed over the five domains of:\n\n【86】1.  random sequence generation;\n    \n2.  allocation concealment;\n    \n3.  blinding;\n    \n4.  incomplete outcome data;\n    \n5.  selective outcome reporting.\n    \n\n【87】Assessment will be done in duplicate by the authors in the data extraction phase. Disagreement will be solved by discussion, or if unsuccessful, by asking a third author. We will assess the risk of bias separately for any outcome for items 3 to 5, and report these (for any outcome and for the study) as low, high, or unclear.\n\n【88】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【89】For dichotomous outcomes we plan to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data, whenever possible, we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and their 95% CIs.\n\n【90】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【91】If cluster‐randomised trials are identified we will check these for unit of analysis errors based on the advice given in chapter 16 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【92】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【93】All the analyses will be by intention‐to‐treat. Since we do expect an effect of treatment progressively increasing over time during treatment and progressively decreasing thereafter, we do not foresee applicability of the last observation carried forward methods. We will then perform a sensitivity analysis with the best and worst case scenario methods to assess effect of the missing data.\n\n【94】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【95】We will investigate heterogeneity between trials through visual examination of the combined data presented in the forest plots and by using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic together with chi‐squared values and their CIs ( Deeks 2011 )\n\n【96】This measure describes the percentage of total variation across trials that are due to heterogeneity rather than by chance ( Higgins 2003 )\n\n【97】The values of I <sup>2 </sup> lie between 0% and 100%. We will use a categorization of heterogeneity according to the following values:\n\n【98】*   not important (I <sup>2 </sup> values 0% to 40%);\n    \n*   moderate (I <sup>2 </sup> values 30% to 60%);\n    \n*   substantial (I <sup>2 </sup> values 50% to 90%); and\n    \n*   considerable (I <sup>2 </sup> values 75% to 100%).\n    \n\n【99】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【100】We will assess the consistency of measurements and outcomes planned by the original Investigators during the trial and those reported within the published paper by comparing the trial protocols (when available) with the information in the final publication. If protocols are not available, we plan to compare the 'Methods' and the 'Results' sections of the published papers. We will also use our knowledge of the clinical background to identify standard outcome measures usually taken, but not reported by the trial investigators.\n\n【101】If we include a sufficient number of trials (10 or more), we will attempt to assess whether the review is subject to publication bias by using a funnel plot. If we detect asymmetry, we will explore causes other than publication bias.\n\n【102】#### Data synthesis\n\n【103】We will extract data and input them into RevMan for any included studies ( RevMan 2011 ). We will use a fixed‐effect model for the meta‐analysis unless we find substantial or considerable heterogeneity (as defined above), in which case, we will use a random‐effects model.\n\n【104】If, given the data, we are unable to undertake meta‐analyses, we will use a narrative approach supported by relevant tables.\n\n【105】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【106】We will investigate any heterogeneity we identify using subgroup analysis of potential confounding factors, if sufficient numbers (at least 10 trials) are available. For this review, these confounding factors will be:\n\n【107】1.  treatment;\n    \n2.  age;\n    \n3.  inhibitor status;\n    \n4.  in different phases of life during treatment: moment of diagnosis; childhood, self‐infusion phase; port‐a‐cath; status and treatment for HCV or HIV (or both); education level.\n    \n\n【108】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【109】The authors will undertake sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our review results by repeating the analysis with the following adjustments:\n\n【110】*   exclusion of trials with unclear or inadequate allocation concealment;\n    \n*   exclusion of trials with unclear or inadequate blinding of outcomes assessment;\n    \n*   exclusion of trials with unclear or inadequate completeness of follow‐up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "42beffa0-be8a-4196-a9ea-6d6e2b7131ea", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To evaluate the existing evidence on the association between childhood cancer treatment including platinum analogues and the occurrence of hearing loss.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】Platinum‐based therapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin or a combination, is used to treat a variety of paediatric malignancies. Unfortunately one of the most important adverse effects is the occurrence of hearing loss (ototoxicity). It usually manifests as bilateral, symmetrical, sensorineural hearing loss first affecting the higher frequencies (≥ 6000 Hz) ( McHaney 1983 ) and it is often accompanied by tinnitus ( Reddel 1982 ).\n\n【6】The hearing loss not only develops during platinum‐based therapy but also years after completion of the therapy ( Bertolini 2004 ; Knight 2005 ). This might be explained by the prolonged retention of platinum in the body; up to 20 years after treatment circulating platinum is still detectable in the plasma ( Gietema 2000 ). Platinum‐induced hearing loss seems to be irreversible and worsening of hearing loss occurs during follow‐up ( McHaney 1983 ; Bertolini 2004 ).\n\n【7】There is a wide variation in the reported frequency of platinum‐induced hearing loss; frequencies as high as 88% have been described ( McHaney 1983 ). Several risk factors have been mentioned in the literature, such as the type of platinum analogue used. Cisplatin seems to cause substantially more hearing loss than carboplatin and the highest incidence of hearing loss has been found in patients who received both cisplatin and carboplatin ( Bertolini 2004 ; Dean 2008 ); the ototoxicity of oxaliplatin as compared to the other platinum analogues is not as well established but oxaliplatin seems to be the least ototoxic ( Eloxatin SPC ). Furthermore, the incidence of platinum‐induced hearing loss seems to be dose‐dependent, increasing with higher cumulative doses ( McHaney 1983 ; Schell 1989 ; Bertolini 2004 ; Li 2004 ) and with higher individual doses ( Reddel 1982 ; Li 2004 ). Different dosing formulas, like dose per body surface area or per kilogram bodyweight, can influence the platinum doses actually received, especially in infants ( Leahey 2012 ; Qaddoumi 2012 ). Also, bolus injections seem to be more ototoxic than longer infusion durations ( Reddel 1982 ). Cranial radiotherapy ( Schell 1989 ), younger age ( Schell 1989 ; Li 2004 ; Qaddoumi 2012 ), genetic variants ( Ross 2009 ; Grewal 2010 ) and other host‐specific factors ( Veal 2001 ), impaired renal function at the time of platinum treatment ( Skinner 2004 ) and other ototoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides ( Skinner 2004 ; Cancer in Children 2005 ) and furosemide ( Gallagher 1979 ), have been reported as additional risk factors.\n\n【8】Although platinum‐induced hearing loss is not life‐threatening, loss of hearing, especially during the first three years of life and even when only borderline to mild, can have important implications. It can negatively impact speech and language development, which may lead to difficulties with school performance and psychosocial functioning ( Gregg 2004 ; Skinner 2004 ; Dean 2008 ). This is even more true for children who suffer dual sensory loss, like retinoblastoma or optic pathway glioma patients.\n\n【9】A recent systematic review has shown that at the moment there is no evidence which underscores the use of medical interventions, such as amifostine, to prevent the occurrence of platinum‐induced ototoxicity ( Van As 2012 ). More insight into the prevalence of and risk factors for platinum‐induced hearing loss is essential in order to develop less ototoxic treatment protocols for future childhood cancer patients and to develop adequate follow‐up protocols for childhood cancer survivors treated with platinum‐based therapy. This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review on this important topic.\n\n【10】Objectives\n----------\n\n【11】To evaluate the existing evidence on the association between childhood cancer treatment including platinum analogues and the occurrence of hearing loss.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【14】#### Types of studies\n\n【15】All study designs, except case reports, case series (i.e. a description of non‐consecutive patients) and studies including fewer than 50 patients, examining the association between childhood cancer treatment including platinum analogues and the occurrence of hearing loss.\n\n【16】We will define cohort studies as studies in which a group of consecutive patients were followed from a similar well‐defined point in the course of the disease. The described study group could be the original cohort or a subgroup of the original cohort based on well‐defined inclusion criteria.\n\n【17】#### Types of participants\n\n【18】Patients (aged 0 to 18 years at tumour diagnosis) treated with platinum‐based therapy for any type of childhood malignancy. All patients should have finished treatment. Studies including both children and adults were only eligible for inclusion in this review if the majority of participants were children (i.e. either more than 90% children or the maximal age did not exceed 22 years).\n\n【19】#### Types of interventions\n\n【20】Treatment including one or more platinum analogues. Studies also including patients who did not receive platinum‐based therapy were only eligible for inclusion in this review if separate data were available for the patients treated with platinum‐based therapy.\n\n【21】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【22】Hearing loss, tinnitus or both (as defined by the authors of the original studies).\n\n【23】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【24】See: Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group methods used in reviews ( Module CCG ).\n\n【25】We will not impose language restrictions. We will update the searches every two years.\n\n【26】#### Electronic searches\n\n【27】We will search the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( _The Cochrane Library_ , latest issue), MEDLINE in PubMed (from 1945 to present) and EMBASE in Ovid (from 1980 to present). The search strategies for the different electronic databases (using a combination of controlled vocabulary and text words) are shown in the appendices ( Appendix 1 ; Appendix 2 ; Appendix 3 ).\n\n【28】#### Searching other resources\n\n【29】We will locate information about trials not registered in CENTRAL, MEDLINE or EMBASE, either published or unpublished, by searching the reference lists of included articles and review articles. We will handsearch the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2007 to 2011), the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) (from 2008 to 2012) and the International Conference on Long‐Term Complications of Treatment of Children and Adolescents for Cancer (from 2010 and 2012).\n\n【30】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【31】#### Selection of studies\n\n【32】After employing the search strategy described previously, two review authors will independently identify studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Discrepancies between authors will be resolved by discussion. If this is impossible, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator. We will obtain in full any study which seems to meet the inclusion criteria on the grounds of the title or abstract, or both, for closer inspection. We will clearly state details of the reasons for exclusion of any study considered for the review.\n\n【33】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【34】Two review authors will independently perform data extraction using standardised forms. We will extract data on study characteristics (such as study design, number of patients enrolled in the study, number of patients fulfilling the review's inclusion criteria), patient characteristics (such as age, sex, type of malignancy, prior hearing loss and renal function at time of platinum treatment), interventions (such as information on the received antineoplastic treatment including cumulative doses, possible other ototoxic drugs like aminoglycosides, furosemide and vincristine, and the use of otoprotective medical interventions), outcome measures (including definition used and method of detection), risk factors and length of follow‐up. We will resolve discrepancies between authors by discussion. If this is impossible, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator.\n\n【35】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【36】Two review authors will independently perform assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies. For randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) we will use the 'Risk of bias' items as described in the module of the Childhood Cancer Group ( Module CCG ), which are based on the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). The assessment of risk of bias in observational studies will be based on previously described checklists according to evidence‐based medicine criteria ( Laupacis 1994 ; Grimes 2002 ). See Table 1 for the definitions of the different 'Risk of bias' criteria. For the 'Risk of bias' assessment of case‐control studies the criteria will be slightly adapted with regard to the selection of cases and controls, which should be based on comparable patient characteristics (like age, gender and cancer treatment). We will resolve discrepancies between authors by discussion. If this is impossible, we will achieve final resolution using a third‐party arbitrator. We will take the risk of bias in included studies into account in the interpretation of the review's results.\n\n【37】Open in table viewer\n\n【38】Table 1. Risk of bias assessment criteria for observational studies\n\n|  | **Internal validity**  | **External validity**  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Study group**  | **Selection bias** (representative: yes/no): if the described study group consisted of more than 90% of the childhood cancer patients treated with platinum‐based therapy included in the original cohort; _or_ if it was a random sample of these patients with respect to the cancer treatment and important prognostic factors (i.e. age, gender, renal function at time of platinum treatment, other ototoxic drugs, prior hearing loss)  | **Reporting bias** (well‐defined: yes/no): if the mean/median or range of the cumulative platinum dose was mentioned; _and_ when it was described what other (prior) treatment (including the received doses) was given  |\n| **Follow‐up**  | **Attrition bias** (adequate: yes/no): if the outcome was assessed for more than 90% of the study group of interest (++); _or_ if the outcome was assessed for 60% to 90% of the study group of interest (+)  | **Reporting bias** (well‐defined: yes/no): if the length of follow‐up was mentioned  |\n| **Outcome**  | **Detection bias** (blind: yes/no): if the outcome assessors were blinded to the investigated determinant  | **Reporting bias** (well‐defined: yes/no): if the method of detection and the definition of an abnormal outcome were provided  |\n| **Risk assessment**  | **Confounding** (adjustment for other factors: yes/no): if important prognostic factors (i.e. age, gender, renal function at time of platinum treatment, other ototoxic drugs, prior hearing loss) and follow‐up were taken adequately into account  | **Analyses** (well‐defined: yes/no): if a relative risk, odds ratio, attributable risk, linear or logistic regression model, mean difference or Chi 2 was calculated  |\n\n【40】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【41】If a control group is available we will analyse hearing loss, tinnitus or both using risk ratios (RR). If no control group is available we will use the prevalence to analyse hearing loss, tinnitus or both. We will present all results with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\n【42】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【43】When relevant data regarding study selection, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment are missing, we will attempt to contact the study authors to retrieve the missing data.\n\n【44】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【45】We will assess heterogeneity both by visual inspection of the forest plots and by a formal statistical test for heterogeneity, that is the I² statistic. In the absence of significant heterogeneity (I² < 50%) ( Higgins 2011 ), we will use a fixed‐effect model for the estimation of hearing loss, tinnitus or both. Otherwise, we will explore possible reasons for the occurrence of heterogeneity and take appropriate measures.\n\n【46】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【47】In addition to the evaluation of reporting bias as described in the ' Assessment of risk of bias in included studies ' section, we will assess reporting bias by constructing a funnel plot where there are a sufficient number of included studies (that is at least 10 studies included in a meta‐analysis). When there are fewer studies the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry ( Higgins 2011 ).\n\n【48】#### Data synthesis\n\n【49】We will enter data into the Review Manager (RevMan) software as provided by The Cochrane Collaboration ( RevMan 2011 ) and undertake analyses according to the guidelines of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will include outcome measures only if it was the intention of the study to perform the necessary assessments in all included patients (that is, not optional only or only performed in some centres). When the results of a particular outcome measure are available for less than 50% of the patients of a study, due to the associated high risk of attrition bias, we will not report the results of this outcome measure. We will perform pooling of results only if studies (in case of observational studies) or treatment groups (in case of RCTs and CCTs) are comparable, including the definition of ototoxicity that was used. We will use the generic inverse variance function of RevMan to combine prevalences. If a study presents the results of hearing tests at different time points, we will use the final test result for our calculations. We will take different study designs into account in the analyses. We will summarise studies for which pooling of results is not possible descriptively. Across the various studies, we will conduct a multivariate linear or logistic meta‐regression analysis (or both) with a backward selection strategy (P < 0.10) to examine the relation between potential predictive factors and platinum‐induced hearing loss. Only studies which performed a multivariate analysis (i.e. including two or more potential predictive factors) and case‐control studies are eligible for these meta‐regression analyses.\n\n【50】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【51】For all outcomes for which pooling is possible we will perform sensitivity analyses for all 'Risk of bias' criteria separately. We will exclude studies with a high risk of bias and studies for which the risk of bias is unclear, and compare the results of studies with a low risk of bias with the results of all available studies.\n\n【52】Table 1.

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】We aim to describe and assess the effects of using active versus passive parental consent on participant recruitment and outcomes in studies targeting children and young people.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the problem or issue\n\n【6】There is widespread consensus about the need for including children and young people in health and medical research as participants ( United Nations 1989 ; United Nations 2003 ). However, debate still exists about the best way to facilitate such inclusion. One aspect of ongoing debates focuses on the choice between obtaining active or passive parental consent. Active (opt‐in) parental consent requires parents to notify researchers of their informed consent if they wish their children to take part in research. Passive (opt‐out) parental consent requires parents to notify researchers if they do _not_ want their children to take part in research. Active consent procedures often result in low, inadequate participation rates. However, passive parental consent remains controversial.\n\n【7】Ethically, there are important reasons to investigate the differences between active and passive parental consent. In order to uphold the principles of nonmaleficence (do no harm) and autonomy, it is considered an ethical requirement that participants involved in research have the opportunity to provide informed consent ( Beauchamp 2001 ). That is, they must receive adequate information about the research study, have the capacities for understanding this information, and be provided with the freedom to come to a decision voluntarily ( Beauchamp 2001 ). When young people are involved in research, they are often deemed incompetent in relation to providing informed consent themselves and thus their parents act as proxies ( Burke 2005 ; Duncan 2009 ). In these cases, their parents provide informed consent on their behalf through the process outlined above.\n\n【8】When active consent is sought from parents, researchers assume that parents have received the information about the study because, in response to this information, they have chosen to sign and return a form ( McMorris 2004 ; Unger 2004 ). However, when passive parental consent is sought, there is a possibility of confusion about whether parents have in fact received and read the information provided to them. With passive parental consent, the danger is that when parents _fail to object_ to the research (thus failing to opt‐out) it may be a consequence of not receiving the information or not engaging with the information, as opposed to making an informed decision ( Unger 2004 ). It may be that when the research is low risk and non‐invasive this is less of a problem, and as the risk increases, so too do the ethical implications ( Kirk 2007 ). However, others would argue that regardless of the degree of risk associated with a given research project, ensuring that true and informed consent is gained from all parents is paramount ( Punch 2002 ; Weithorn 1994 ).\n\n【9】Given the ethical risks associated with using passive parental consent, it may be questioned why this type of consent is used by researchers. There are at least two key reasons that passive parental consent is considered by some to be desirable. Firstly, use of active parental consent often results in low response rates as children and young people can forget to give the forms to their parents, and then parents can forget to return the form to the researchers ( Stein 2007 ; Unger 2004 ). Second, there is emergent literature suggesting that important groups are less likely to be included. Active parental consent relies on parents returning forms, and so the children and young people who participate in such research are generally those who come from families with more advantaged backgrounds, including higher socioeconomic status, and with fewer risk factors and greater protective factors for poor health outcomes ( Dent 1993 ; Henry 2002 ; Unger 2004 ; Wolfenden 2009 ). Thus, it has been argued that samples recruited using active parental consent are less likely to include those from minority groups, of low socioeconomic status, who engage in health risk behaviours, or have poor health status ( Anderman 1995 ; Chartier 2008 ; Dent 1993 ; Frame 1987 ; Frissell 2004 ; Kearney 1983 ; Severson 1983 ; Unger 2004 ; White 2004 ; Wolfenden 2009 ). Active parental consent in studies can thus result in an important group of children and young people missing out on research participation. This potentially limits both the generalisability of findings, and the extent to which study results are able to address inequalities and disparities in health outcomes by failing to include those children and young people most in need ( Wolfenden 2009 ).\n\n【10】The notion of 'standing consent' has also been raised in relation to children's participation in school‐based research. In these scenarios parents provide consent at the beginning of each school year to their child participating in certain types of research, but are not required to give further consent for each new project ( NHMRC 2007 ). Ethical guidance about parental consent can also be broad and non‐specific. For example, the primary source of ethical guidance for all Australian Human Research Ethics Committees provides detailed information about the importance of assessing competence in young people and of obtaining parental consent, yet does not refer to active or passive parental consent or the advantages and disadvantages of each ( NHMRC 2007 ).\n\n【11】The extent to which active and passive parental consent influence participant recruitment and outcomes in studies targeting children and young people has yet to be systematically examined. In this review, we aim to determine the effects on participant recruitment and study outcomes of using active and passive parental consent and to report potential advantages and disadvantages of both forms of consent. We will consider studies with children and young people from birth to 21 years of age.\n\n【12】### Description of the methods being investigated\n\n【13】This review will compare the impact of active and passive parental consent methods for research involving children and young people. Active parental consent, also known as opt‐in consent, involves parents returning documents to researchers, such as a signed consent form, before their child can participate in a study ( Blom‐Hoffman 2009 ; McMorris 2004 ; Unger 2004 ). In this situation, a non‐response is assumed to be a refusal to participate ( McMorris 2004 ). In contrast, passive parental consent, also known as implied or opt‐out consent, involves advising parents through newsletters or mail of planned studies and requires that parents respond only if they do not wish their children to participate ( McMorris 2004 ; Unger 2004 ).\n\n【14】Studies exist in which the method of parental consent was changed part way through the study, for example beginning with passive parental consent and then later changing to active parental consent. ( Anderman 1995 ; Chartier 2008 ; Dent 1993 ; Eaton 2004 ; Frissell 2004 ; Pokorny 2001 ; Severson 1983 ; White 2004 ). Data from these studies enables the comparison of the impact of different types of parental consent on participation rates, participant demographics and study outcomes.\n\n【15】### How these methods might work\n\n【16】Differential effects of active and passive parental consent on participation rates, participant demographics and study outcomes may occur across a range of dimensions as defined by the PROGRESS acronym: place of residence (urban/rural), race/ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status and social capital ( Tugwell 2006 ). This has been expanded further as PROGRESS‐plus to also include age, disability and sexual orientation ( Kavanagh 2008 ). In the context of research with children and young people we suggest further expansion of the tool to also include consideration of relevant dimensions for both parents/caregivers and children and young people.\n\n【17】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【18】This review is needed in order to examine the differential impacts of active and passive parental consent in studies with children and young people. Potential effects include variations in response rates, participant demographics and study outcomes. This has important implications for current ethics research guidance and for child and youth research internationally, particularly research aiming to address health inequalities.\n\n【19】Objectives\n----------\n\n【20】We aim to describe and assess the effects of using active versus passive parental consent on participant recruitment and outcomes in studies targeting children and young people.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【23】#### Types of studies\n\n【24】The following study designs will be included:\n\n【25】Systematic reviews of interventions with children and young people that have compared and contrasted results from similar studies that used active versus passive consent designs. Ideally we will analyse the overall results presented in a systematic review but we will also analyse component studies individually if this is more appropriate.\n\n【26】Controlled trials (randomised and non‐randomised) that include comparisons of participant characteristics and outcomes for groups recruited using active versus passive parental consent.\n\n【27】Cohort studies that include comparison of subgroups recruited using active versus passive parental consent.\n\n【28】Cross‐sectional studies which include comparison of subgroups recruited using active versus passive parental consent (e.g. across different geographical regions or jurisdictions where different ethics procedures apply to recruitment strategies).\n\n【29】Qualitative studies which include comparison of groups recruited using active versus passive parental consent.\n\n【30】#### Types of data\n\n【31】Studies investigating recruitment of children and young people to research studies. We will also include studies of interventions with children and young people that report the effects of active versus passive parental consent on participant recruitment and study outcomes. We will extract aggregate data rather than individual participant data.\n\n【32】We will consider studies targeting children from birth to 21 years of age.\n\n【33】#### Types of methods\n\n【34】Studies must include comparison of active parental consent versus passive parental consent.\n\n【35】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【36】##### Primary outcomes\n\n【37】###### Participant recruitment\n\n【38】*   Overall participation and recruitment rates (this will need careful data extraction and interpretation as it is likely to be influenced by many factors, including those encompassed by PROGRESS‐Plus as outlined below).\n    \n*   Impact of active versus passive parental consent on participant demographics according to a range of characteristics adapted from PROGRESS‐Plus, including place of residence (urban/rural), race/ethnicity/cultural background, religion, socioeconomic status (including parental occupation, education and/or income), social capital, parental age, parental health status, child age, child gender, child education and child health status.\n    \n\n【39】###### Study outcomes\n\n【40】*   Impact of active versus passive parental consent on primary and secondary outcomes as defined by individual studies.\n    \n*   Impact of different methods of consent on study outcomes according to participant characteristics identified above.\n    \n\n【41】##### Secondary outcomes\n\n【42】*   Method used to compare participant recruitment for active versus passive consent.\n    \n*   Method used to compare study outcomes for active versus passive consent.\n    \n*   Parent/caregiver, provider, and children and young people's understandings of study.\n    \n*   Satisfaction, attitudes and behaviour of parent/caregivers, providers, and children and young people with study.\n    \n*   Implications of ethical review processes on consent methods used in studies.\n    \n\n【43】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【44】#### Electronic searches\n\n【45】We will search the Cochrane Methodology Register as well as the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and ERIC. See Appendix 1 for the MEDLINE search strategy and terms. We will adapt this search strategy for the other electronic databases.\n\n【46】#### Searching other resources\n\n【47】We will search the reference lists of included studies for other potentially relevant studies or similar systematic reviews. We will also contact researchers who are known or who are thought likely to have done relevant studies. We will also conduct internet searches using the Google search engine and contact leading child and youth health research organisations to identify potentially relevant studies.\n\n【48】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【49】#### Selection of studies\n\n【50】Two review authors will work independently and examine the title and abstract of all records identified by the search strategy. We will retrieve the full paper for all potentially eligible studies and two review authors will independently assess these for inclusion in the review according to the eligibility criteria. Two review authors will extract data for each eligible study into an Excel spreadsheet. We will compare the data extracted by both review authors for each study. We will settle disagreement by discussion, with involvement of a third party when necessary. We will document all reasons for exclusion of potentially relevant studies.\n\n【51】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【52】We will extract data on:\n\n【53】*   study design (systematic review, randomised or non‐randomised controlled trial, cohort, cross‐sectional, qualitative);\n    \n*   study characteristics (year(s) study was conducted, year of publication, intended primary and secondary outcomes of study);\n    \n*   population characteristics using an adapted form of PROGRESS‐Plus including place of residence (urban/rural), race/ethnicity/cultural background, religion, socioeconomic status (including parental occupation, education and/or income), social capital, parental age, parental health status, child age, child gender, child education and child health status;\n    \n*   method for obtaining consent from parents (active or passive);\n    \n*   method for obtaining consent from children/young people;\n    \n*   size of difference in participant recruitment across adapted PROGRESS‐Plus dimensions;\n    \n*   method used to assess difference in participant recruitment;\n    \n*   size of difference in study outcomes across adapted PROGRESS‐Plus dimensions;\n    \n*   method used to assess difference in study outcomes;\n    \n*   acceptability of different consent methods to parent/caregivers, health and education staff, and children and young people;\n    \n*   implications of ethical review guidelines and policies on consent methods used in studies;\n    \n*   number of children and young people recruited versus enrolled.\n    \n\n【54】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【55】We will review each study according to its design and its conduct to assess any bias. If randomised studies are identified we will evaluate them based on:\n\n【56】*   concealment of allocation sequence;\n    \n*   generation of allocation sequence;\n    \n*   inclusion of all randomised participants in the analysis.\n    \n\n【57】We will grade allocation concealment as follows.\n\n【58】*   Grade A ‐ clearly adequate concealment\n    \n*   Grade B ‐ possibly adequate\n    \n*   Grade C ‐ clearly inadequate concealment\n    \n\n【59】We will assess non‐randomised studies using the criteria outlined in the MERGE instrument ( MERGE 1996 ).\n\n【60】*   Code A ‐ low risk of bias\n    \n*   Code B1 ‐ low‐moderate risk of bias\n    \n*   Code B2 ‐ moderate‐high risk of bias\n    \n*   Code C ‐ high risk of bias\n    \n\n【61】We will assess systematic reviews using the AMSTAR tool ( Shea 2007 ).\n\n【62】#### Measures of the effect of the methods\n\n【63】We will conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of active and passive parental consent on participant recruitment and on intended study outcomes. For example, whether a study is more or less likely to achieve statistical significance when assessing the effects of interventions on an outcome. It is not expected that statistical pooling of results of studies will be appropriate or feasible given the heterogeneity of studies we expect to identify. We will create a table to summarise the results for each outcome as extracted\n\n【64】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【65】Analysis will be consistent with the unit of analysis of the included study, for example where clustering is present such as in site‐based cluster trials or where more than one parent or more than one child have been included.\n\n【66】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【67】We will contact authors of included studies if insufficient information is available regarding study data.\n\n【68】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【69】If it is possible to pool studies with similar outcome measures, we will explore heterogeneity using the I <sup>2 </sup> statistic and subgroup analyses if appropriate. We will also synthesise results in a narrative summary.\n\n【70】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【71】We will minimise publication bias in this review by the use of a comprehensive search strategy in diverse electronic databases, reviewing citations and contacting authors and experts in the field in order to identify studies. We will address time lag bias by searching trial registers. We will address multiple publication bias by extracting and reporting findings by studies rather than by individual papers. We will address outcome reporting bias by examining original study outcomes identified by studies and matching these to results reported.\n\n【72】#### Data synthesis\n\n【73】We will synthesise results in tables. We will summarise the effects of different consent methods on participant recruitment and on study outcomes across each of the adapted PROGRESS‐Plus dimensions identified above. We will also report results by different study designs. This will be accompanied by a descriptive summary in the results section of the review.\n\n【74】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【75】As this is a descriptive methodology review we will not pool results and we will not conduct sensitivity analysis.\n\n【76】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【77】As this is a descriptive methodology review we will not pool results and we will not conduct sensitivity analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

The objectives are as follows:\n\n【2】To assess the benefits and harms of surgical intervention for the management of early structural knee osteoarthritis.\n\n【3】Visual summary\n--------------\n\n【4】Background\n----------\n\n【5】### Description of the condition\n\n【6】Worldwide musculoskeletal disorders account for 6% to 8% of all disability‐adjusted life years, and osteoarthritis accounts for approximately 10% of this disease burden ( Murray 2012 ). Osteoarthritis affecting the knee is common, with a global prevalence of radiographically confirmed symptomatic knee osteoarthritis estimated to be 3.8% ( Cross 2014 ), and a lifetime risk of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in Western populations estimated to be over 40% ( Murphy 2008 ). In the UK, more people receive disability living allowance as a result of arthritis than for heart disease, stroke, chest disease, and cancer combined ( Department for Work and Pensions 2007 ).\n\n【7】Osteoarthritis of the knee represents a continuum of disease from early cartilage thinning to full‐thickness cartilage loss, bony erosion, and deformity. One or more of the three compartments of the knee (patellofemoral, medial tibiofemoral, and lateral tibiofemoral) can be involved, and the disease affects all of the tissues within the joint.\n\n【8】A revised version of the American College of Rheumatologists classification system for osteoarthritis has been validated for clinical use ( Altman 1991 ). This system defines criteria for knee osteoarthritis based on clinical signs or radiological features, or both:\n\n【9】*   Clinical: knee pain for most days of the prior month, in addition to three of the following:\n    \n    *   Crepitus on active joint motion\n        \n    *   Morning stiffness > 30 minutes duration\n        \n    *   Age > 38 years\n        \n    *   Bony enlargement of the knee on examination\n        \n    *   Bony tenderness of the knee on examination\n        \n    *   No palpable warmth\n        \n*   Clinical plus radiographic: knee pain for most days of the prior month, plus radiographic evidence of osteophytes on joint margins in addition to one of the following:\n    \n    *   Crepitus on active joint motion\n        \n    *   Morning stiffness > 30 minutes duration\n        \n    *   Age > 38 years\n        \n\n【10】Whilst this is a useful algorithm for identifying people with knee osteoarthritis, its use cannot reliably be extended to defining the severity or progression of disease.\n\n【11】There are many radiographic descriptions of osteoarthritis that attempt to identify both the presence of osteoarthritis and the severity of the disease. Kellgren and Lawrence described a radiographic classification system that identifies various features of osteoarthritis including osteophytes, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral bone cysts and bone deformity ( Kellgren 1957 ). The whole knee is then graded with regards to the severity of these features: none (0), doubtful (1), minimal (2), moderate (3), severe (4).\n\n【12】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non‐invasive imaging modality that allows for a detailed assessment of structures within the knee. It can be used to establish osteoarthritis diagnosis, assess disease severity, and monitor disease progression. MRI can detect cartilage loss when none is evident on plain film radiographs and can be used to identify structural changes within the knee of a person with osteoarthritis symptoms but no radiographic changes ( Amin 2005 ; Javaid 2009 ).\n\n【13】In an effort to synthesise the available information regarding knee osteoarthritis, Luyten et al described early knee osteoarthritis as a combination of clinical (at least two episodes of pain for 10 days or more in the last year) and imaging (radiographic changes of Kellgren‐Lawrence 2 or less and MRI or arthroscopic evidence of cartilage change) findings ( Luyten 2012 ). This classification recognises the importance of structural changes within the knee that can precede changes seen on plain film radiographs.\n\n【14】The distinctions between the different stages of osteoarthritis are important. End‐stage, bone‐on‐bone osteoarthritis is treated dependably with arthroplasty in the form of total or unicompartmental knee replacement. Arthroplasty surgery is not routinely offered to those with early knee osteoarthritis (EKOA), as it is associated with a poorer outcome ( Dowsey 2012 ; Niinimaki 2011 ). People with EKOA are in a 'treatment gap', where symptoms and disability can be significant, and yet surgical options are limited ( London 2011 ). This review will establish whether or not any surgery is safe and or effective for treating people with symptomatic EKOA.\n\n【15】In the absence of any agreed‐on definition for EKOA, this systematic review will deliberately maintain a broad definition with a focus on the presence of pain and the exclusion of people with diffuse full‐thickness disease who would be considered suitable for arthroplasty surgery.\n\n【16】### Description of the intervention\n\n【17】This systematic review will take a disease‐based approach in order to assess the effectiveness of any surgical intervention that may be employed in the management of early structural knee osteoarthritis. This broad approach will enable the full scope of surgical interventions available for this condition to be considered simultaneously. Surgical interventions for the treatment of EKOA include the following.\n\n【18】#### Arthroscopic procedures\n\n【19】Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that is offered to people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Generally, two small incisions are made in the front of the knee enabling the passage of a fibreoptic camera through one incision and surgical instruments through the other. Many surgical procedures can be performed using this technique.\n\n【20】Arthroscopic irrigation, also termed joint lavage, involves flushing the joint through with a sterile solution. Arthroscopic debridement is a surgical intervention that enables resection of damaged tissue within the knee joint. This may involve a variety of different procedures, including excision of inflammatory synovium, burring down of obstructive osteophytes, and removal of loose bodies.\n\n【21】A meniscectomy involving excision of all (total meniscectomy) or part (partial meniscectomy) of a degenerate meniscus can be perfomed arthroscopically. Alternatively, a meniscal repair using sutures or anchors to repair a degenerate tear whilst preserving the remaining meniscus is possible. Partial or total meniscal substitutes with a synthetic or donor meniscus (meniscal allograft) can be used to restore a defunctioned meniscus.\n\n【22】Cartilage repair can be performed using a variety of techniques. Chondroplasty involves the trimming down of loose or damaged articular cartilage. Subchondral bone marrow stimulation encompasses a variety of techniques that perforate the subchondral bone and expose a cartilage‐deficient region to the underlying bone marrow. Autologous chondrocyte implantation and matrix‐assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation involve the application of cultured chondrocytes (cartilage‐producing cells) to regenerate cartilage in areas where it is deficient.\n\n【23】#### Load‐modifying procedures\n\n【24】An osteotomy for osteoarthritis of the knee joint is a re‐alignment procedure aimed at transferring the weight‐bearing region of the knee joint from the diseased region to a disease‐free region. This is achieved by cutting and reshaping the bone in the proximal tibia (high tibial osteotomy) or distal femur (distal femoral osteotomy).\n\n【25】Chronic medial compartment joint‐loading can be modified using an extracapsular device. Devices such as the KineSpring® (Moximed Inc, Hayward, CA, USA) have been developed to partially absorb the load passing through the medial compartment without compromising the joint surface ( Clifford 2011 ).\n\n【26】Metallic interpositional devices are designed to remedy medial joint space narrowing caused by osteoarthritis; in so doing, a varus (bow‐legged) knee can be placed into a more neutral alignment ( Clarius 2010 ). Such devices can be inserted using minimally invasive techniques and without the need for resection of underlying bone.\n\n【27】Knee joint distraction is a surgical technique that uses an external fixation device to separate the knee joint surfaces for a defined period of time. Joint distraction aims to reduce mechanical stresses on the joint surface, prevent further wear and tear of the cartilage, and allow chondrocytes to initiate repair ( Lafeber 2006 ).\n\n【28】#### Knee replacement surgery\n\n【29】Total knee replacement involves replacing the surfaces of the knee joint with artificial implants. The implants are usually made from a combination of metal alloy and high‐density plastic, and require bone to be resected in order to accommodate them. Unicompartmental knee replacement only involves replacing the surfaces of a single diseased compartment (medial, lateral, or patellofemoral), rather than the whole joint surface.\n\n【30】### How the intervention might work\n\n【31】#### Arthroscopic procedures\n\n【32】Arthroscopic procedures for osteoarthritis of the knee are generally intended to promote a smooth excursion of the knee joint surface. This may be achieved by washing debris out of the knee joint (irrigation), removing torn or irregular cartilage (debridement or chondroplasty), reconstituting a degenerate meniscus (meniscal repair/replacement), or promoting cartilage growth in areas of deficiency (subchondral bone marrow stimulation or autologous chondrocyte implantation). The exact mechanism by which a smooth joint surface relates to pain‐free movement is unclear.\n\n【33】Evidence for arthroscopic irrigation is poor, with a previous Cochrane review concluding no benefit for joint lavage when compared to sham surgery or no intervention ( Reichenbach 2010 ). The trials included in this review did not stratify results based on stage of osteoarthritis. A further Cochrane review found no significant benefit for arthroscopic debridement compared to sham surgery or arthroscopic irrigation ( Laupattarakasem 2008 ). Interestingly, the one trial in this review that reported improved outcomes in the arthroscopic debridement group involved people with single degenerative lesions, suggesting less extensive disease ( Hubbard 1996 ).\n\n【34】Cartilage repair techniques aim to restore a smooth articular surface. Loss of cartilage and exposure of the subchondral bone leads to crepitation and pain ( Buckwalter 1998 ), therefore any efforts to reduce friction or cover the subchondral bone may improve this. Trials in this area have involved isolated full‐thickness cartilage lesions outside the context of osteoarthritis.\n\n【35】The meniscus is responsible for increasing surface area of the knee and dissipating load through the knee joint. Meniscal injury causes symptoms by promoting inflammation and pain. Meniscal resection, either total or partial, has been used where the meniscus is irreparably damaged. However, there is growing concern over the effect of this operation, as it may in fact accelerate progression of osteoarthritis ( Roos 2001 ). Meniscal repair is usually performed in the context of isolated injuries. Meniscal replacement in the form of cadaveric (allograft) or synthetic grafts is appealing in that it aims to restore the function of the meniscus.\n\n【36】#### Load‐modifying procedures\n\n【37】Longitudinal cohort studies have demonstrated that malalignment at the knee is associated with both incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis ( Hayashi 2012 ; Sharma 2001 ; Sharma 2013 ; Tanamas 2009 ). The effect of malalignment on osteoarthritis is attributed to its unequal influence on loading of the knee joint. In cases of varus deformity, more load crosses the medial compartment, and in valgus (knock‐knee) alignment, more load crosses the lateral compartment. Load‐modifying procedures aim to lessen the load passing through the compartment in order to both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression.\n\n【38】The results for osteotomy are good, but patient selection, operative technique, and degree of correction have all been demonstrated to influence outcome ( Briem 2007 ; Coventry 1993 ; Duivenvoorden 2014 ). A previous Cochrane review concluded that although there was good evidence to support the fact that high tibial osteotomy (HTO) improves function and pain in people with osteoarthritis, there is significant heterogeneity of the clinical trials to date ( Brouwer 2007 ).\n\n【39】KineSpring® is a relatively new device that is both extra‐articular and extra‐capsular. It is specifically indicated for medial compartment osteoarthritis and consists of a load absorber that can absorb a maximal load of 30 pounds in weight, with promising results in the short and medium term ( Clifford 2011 ; London 2013 ).\n\n【40】Interpositional arthroplasty is indicated for unicompartmental osteoarthritis. The result is a protection to the underlying subchondral bone exposed due to damaged cartilage and intra‐articular correction of varus deformity ( Koeck 2009 ). Reports of high revision rates and unpredictable outcomes have raised concerns over these implants ( Bailie 2008 ).\n\n【41】The principle of joint distraction is to offload the knee joint and reduce the mechanical stresses that contribute to the degeneration of cartilage. One study has demonstrated both symptom improvement and cartilage repair using this technique ( Wiegant 2013 ), however the exact mechanism by which cartilage regenerates under these conditions remains unclear.\n\n【42】#### Knee replacement surgery\n\n【43】Knee replacement surgery is an established technique for end‐stage osteoarthritis, with good clinical outcomes described for both total knee replacement and partial knee replacement. However, the use of arthroplasty surgery is not routinely extended to those with less severe osteoarthritis, as it is associated with a poorer outcome ( Dowsey 2012 ; Niinimaki 2011 ).\n\n【44】### Why it is important to do this review\n\n【45】The current literature concerning osteoarthritis of the knee frequently takes an intervention‐based approach. Many of these studies have not stratified their results based on the severity of the disease at baseline or recruitment. Where early osteoarthritis of the knee is considered, there is often a focus on non‐surgical or pharmacological treatments ( Brahmachari 2009 ; Jang 2013 ; Nelson 2013 ).\n\n【46】Many people who present with features of EKOA will have pain and functional profiles that are similar to people with end‐stage disease undergoing arthroplasty ( Jones 2014 ). People with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis who are not suitable for arthroplasty surgery may dwell in the ‘treatment gap’ for over 20 years, with significant clinical and economic implications ( London 2011 ). The James Lind Alliance, a patient‐driven enterprise that works to prioritise unanswered questions about the effects of treatments, has highlighted the outcome of arthroplasty and non‐arthroplasty surgery in this patient group as an important area for research ( JLA 2015 ).\n\n【47】This systematic review will drive the direction of future research in this hard‐to‐treat patient group and will be conducted according to the guidelines recommended by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Editorial Board ( Ghogomu 2014 ).\n\n【48】Objectives\n----------\n\n【49】To assess the benefits and harms of surgical intervention for the management of early structural knee osteoarthritis.\n\n【50】Methods\n-------\n\n【51】### Criteria for considering studies for this review\n\n【52】#### Types of studies\n\n【53】We will include randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials only. We will include studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. There will be no language restriction.\n\n【54】#### Types of participants\n\n【55】We will include adults (18 years of age and older) with diagnosis of early structural knee osteoarthritis defined as the presence of pain and one of the following features:\n\n【56】##### Radiographic\n\n【57】Kellgren‐Lawrence grade 1, 2, 3 or equivalent.\n\n【58】##### MRI\n\n【59】Cartilage degradation but minimal full‐thickness loss (< 10% of surface area or < 1 cm)\n\n【60】e.g. Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Score (BLOKS) cartilage morphology ( Hunter 2008 )\n\n【61】Per cent of subregion surface area affected by cartilage loss (any loss score):\n\n【62】*   grade 1: < 10%\n    \n*   grade 2: 10% to 75%\n    \n*   grade 3: > 75%\n    \n\n【63】Extent of full‐thickness loss (full‐thickness loss score):\n\n【64】*   grade 0: none\n    \n*   grade 1: < 10%\n    \n\n【65】OR\n\n【66】Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) cartilage morphology ( Peterfy 2004 )\n\n【67】*   grade 1: increased signal from normal‐thickness cartilage\n    \n*   grade 2: partial‐thickness focal defect < 1 cm\n    \n*   grade 2.5: full‐thickness focal defect < 1 cm\n    \n*   grade 3: multiple areas of partial‐thickness defect within areas of normal thickness\n    \n*   grade 4: diffuse partial‐thickness loss\n    \n\n【68】OR\n\n【69】MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) cartilage morphology ( Hunter 2011 )\n\n【70】Size of any cartilage loss as a % of surface area\n\n【71】*   grade 1: < 10%\n    \n*   grade 2: 10% to 75%\n    \n*   grade 2: > 75%\n    \n\n【72】Extent of full‐thickness cartilage loss in a region\n\n【73】*   grade 0: < 10%\n    \n*   grade 1: < 10%\n    \n\n【74】or any equivalent MRI scoring system.\n\n【75】##### Arthroscopy\n\n【76】Cartilage degradation but no more than one isolated full‐thickness defect\n\n【77】e.g. International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score ( ICRS 2000 )\n\n【78】*   grade 1: soft indentation (A) and/or superficial fissures and cracks (B)\n    \n*   grade 2: lesions extending down to < 50% of cartilage depth\n    \n*   grade 3: cartilage defects extending down > 50% of cartilage depth (A) as well as down to calcified layer (B)\n    \n\n【79】or any equivalent arthroscopic scoring system.\n\n【80】We will exclude participants with the following comorbidities/characteristics:\n\n【81】*   asymptomatic individuals\n    \n*   end‐stage osteoarthritis full‐thickness cartilage loss (> 1 cm) or boney deformity (Kellgren‐Lawrence grade 4), or both\n    \n*   history of trauma\n    \n*   inflammatory arthropathy, metabolic bone disease, rheumatoid arthritis\n    \n\n【82】If a trial includes a subgroup of participants with EKOA (as defined above), and these results are reported separately from those with non‐early osteoarthritis, then we will include the data that relates to EKOA only. In the event that a trial appears to have a subgroup of participants with EKOA but has not reported their results separately, then we will attempt to contact the authors of the trial to ask them to provide the data for the EKOA subgroup.\n\n【83】#### Types of interventions\n\n【84】We plan to assess trials comparing ANY type of surgical intervention (see Description of the intervention ) with ANY non‐surgical intervention (for example sham surgery, physiotherapy, bracing, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, orthotics) in people with early structural knee osteoarthritis. We will include trials comparing ANY surgical intervention with ANY injectable therapy (for example steroid, hyaluronic acid, and regenerative therapies: stem cell therapy, platelet rich plasma, platelet lysates, prolotherapy). We will also include trials comparing ANY surgical intervention with ANY OTHER type of surgical intervention. We will include trials that compare the effect of a surgical intervention with or without ANY co‐interventions.\n\n【85】#### Types of outcome measures\n\n【86】##### Major outcomes\n\n【87】1.  Pain with a hierarchy of 11 levels (when more than one is reported, the highest on the list will be used):\n    \n    1.  Pain overall\n        \n    2.  Pain on walking\n        \n    3.  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale\n        \n    4.  Pain on activities other than walking\n        \n    5.  WOMAC global scale\n        \n    6.  Lequesne osteoarthritis index global score\n        \n    7.  Other algofunctional scale\n        \n    8.  Patient’s global assessment\n        \n    9.  Physician’s global assessment\n        \n    10.  Other outcome\n        \n    11.  No continuous outcome reported\n        \n2.  Physical function with a hierarchy of eight levels (when more than one is reported, the highest on the list will be used):\n    \n    1.  Global disability score\n        \n    2.  Walking disability\n        \n    3.  WOMAC disability subscore\n        \n    4.  Composite disability scores other than WOMAC\n        \n    5.  Disability other than walking\n        \n    6.  WOMAC global scale\n        \n    7.  Lequesne osteoarthritis index global score\n        \n    8.  Other algofunctional scale\n        \n3.  Radiographic joint structure changes according to the given hierarchy (the first two outcomes, minimum joint‐space width and median joint‐space width, are used most often):\n    \n    1.  Minimum joint‐space width\n        \n    2.  Median joint‐space width\n        \n    3.  Semi‐quantitative measurement\n        \n4.  Quality of life\n    \n5.  Short‐term serious adverse effects from trials\n    \n6.  Re‐operation rate or conversion to total knee replacement (indicating failure of the primary intervention)\n    \n7.  Withdrawals due to adverse events\n    \n\n【88】If multiple time points are reported, we will group them into short‐ (less than one year), intermediate‐ (one to three years), and long‐term (greater than three years) follow‐up.\n\n【89】### Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【90】#### Electronic searches\n\n【91】We will search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE.\n\n【92】We will also conduct searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ).\n\n【93】We will search all databases from their inception to the present, and we will impose no restriction on language of publication.\n\n【94】See Appendix 1 for the MEDLINE search strategy.\n\n【95】#### Searching other resources\n\n【96】We will check reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We will search relevant manufacturers' websites for trial information and contact individuals or organisations where appropriate.\n\n【97】We will search for errata or retractions from included studies published in full text on PubMed ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) and report the date this was done within the review.\n\n【98】### Data collection and analysis\n\n【99】#### Selection of studies\n\n【100】All review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search for inclusion and code them as 'retrieve' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or 'do not retrieve'. We will retrieve the full‐text study reports/publication, and all review authors will independently screen the full text and identify studies for inclusion, and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreements through discussion. If an agreement cannot be reached within the group, all seven authors will be given an 'in' or 'out' vote to decide whether or not to include the study. We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table.\n\n【101】#### Data extraction and management\n\n【102】We will use a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that has been piloted on at least one study in the review. One review author (JSP) will extract study characteristics from the included studies. A second review author (SH) will spot‐check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. We will extract the following study characteristics:\n\n【103】1.  Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of any 'run in' period, number of study centres and location, study setting, withdrawals, and date of study.\n    \n2.  Participants: N, mean age, age range, sex, body mass index, disease duration, severity of condition, comorbidities, socio‐demographics, ethnicity, diagnostic criteria, important baseline data, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria.\n    \n3.  Interventions: total number of intervention groups within each trial, specific details of each intervention and comparator, e.g who provided the intervention, materials used, standardisation of the surgical intervention and adherence to the standardised technique, any modifications or tailoring of the intervention during the trial period.\n    \n4.  Outcomes: major outcomes specified and collected, and time points reported.\n    \n5.  Characteristics of the design of the trial as outlined below in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section.\n    \n6.  Notes: funding for trial, and notable declarations of interest of trial authors.\n    \n\n【104】Two review authors (JSP, LEB) will independently extract outcome data from included studies. We will extract the number of events and number of participants per treatment group for dichotomous outcomes, and means and standard deviations and number of participants per treatment group for continuous outcomes. We will note in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table if outcome data was not reported in a usable way and when data was transformed or estimated from a graph. We will resolve disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (AJP). One review author (JSP) will transfer data into the Review Manager file ( RevMan 2012 ). We will double‐check that data is entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the study reports.\n\n【105】If more than one outcome measure is reported in a trial, we will prioritise outcomes based on the hierarchy of major outcomes listed above.\n\n【106】Where both final values and change from baseline values are reported for a given outcome, we will extract the final value; if both unadjusted and adjusted values for the same outcome are reported, we will extract the unadjusted value.\n\n【107】##### Main planned comparisons\n\n【108】1.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY non‐surgical intervention. Where possible, we will present data separately according to the type of non‐surgical comparator (e.g. sham surgery, physiotherapy, bracing, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, orthotics).\n    \n2.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY injectable therapy.\n    \n3.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY OTHER surgical intervention.\n    \n\n【109】Where possible, we will perform subgroup analysis according to the type of surgical intervention (for example arthroscopic, load‐modifying, and knee replacement procedures) and surgical procedure (for example arthroscopic irrigation, arthroscopic debridement, osteotomy).\n\n【110】#### Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【111】Two review authors (APM, JSP) will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011 ). We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author (SH). We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains.\n\n【112】1.  Random sequence generation.\n    \n2.  Allocation concealment.\n    \n3.  Blinding of participants and personnel.\n    \n4.  Blinding of outcome assessment.\n    \n5.  Incomplete outcome data.\n    \n6.  Selective outcome reporting.\n    \n7.  Major baseline imbalance.\n    \n8.  Differences in rehabilitation.\n    \n\n【113】We will grade each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear risk of bias and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in the 'Risk of bias' table. We will summarise the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. We will consider blinding separately for different key outcomes where necessary (for example for unblinded outcome assessment, risk of bias for all‐cause mortality may be different than for a patient‐reported pain scale). We will also consider the impact of missing data by key outcomes.\n\n【114】Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the 'Risk of bias' table.\n\n【115】When considering treatment effects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome.\n\n【116】We will present the figures generated by the 'Risk of bias' tool to provide summary assessments of the risk of bias.\n\n【117】##### Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review\n\n【118】We will conduct the review according to this published protocol and report any deviations from it in the 'Differences between protocol and review' section of the systematic review.\n\n【119】#### Measures of treatment effect\n\n【120】We will analyse dichotomous data as risk ratios or Peto odds ratio when the outcome is a rare event (approximately less than 10%), and use 95% confidence intervals. We will analyse continuous data as mean difference or standardised mean difference (SMD), depending on whether the same scale is used to measure an outcome, and 95% confidence intervals. We will enter data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of effect across studies.\n\n【121】When different scales are used to measure the same conceptual outcome (for example disability), we will calculate SMDs instead, with corresponding 95% confidence interval. We will back‐translate SMD to a typical scale (for example 0 to 10 for pain) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among‐person standard deviation (for example the standard deviation of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial), as per Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Schünemann 2011b ).\n\n【122】In the 'Effects of intervention' results section and the 'Comments' column of the 'Summary of findings' table, we will provide the absolute per cent difference, the relative per cent change from baseline, the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (we will provide the NNTH and NNTB only when the outcome shows a statistically significant difference).\n\n【123】For dichotomous outcomes such as serious adverse events, we will calculate the NNTH and NNTB from the control group event rate and the relative risk using the Visual Rx calculator ( Cates 2008 ). We will calculate the NNTH and NNTB for continuous measures using the Wells calculator (available at the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Editorial office, http://musculoskeletal.cochrane.org/ ).\n\n【124】For dichotomous outcomes, the absolute risk difference will be calculated using the risk difference statistic in Review Manager and the result expressed as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, the absolute benefit will be calculated as the improvement in the intervention group minus the improvement in the control group, in the original units.\n\n【125】The relative per cent change for dichotomous data will be calculated as the risk ratio ‐1 and expressed as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, we will calculate the relative difference in the change from baseline as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group.\n\n【126】#### Unit of analysis issues\n\n【127】Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the relevant arms. If two comparisons (for example surgical intervention A versus non‐surgical intervention and surgical intervention B versus non‐surgical intervention) are combined in the same meta‐analysis, we will halve the control group to avoid double‐counting.\n\n【128】If multiple time points are reported, we will group them into short‐ (less than one year), intermediate‐ (one to three years), and long‐term (greater than three years) follow‐up. If a single trial reports multiple time points within one of these groups, then we will extract the data that relates to the later time point (for example if one trial reports outcomes at six months and one year, we will extract the one‐year results only).\n\n【129】#### Dealing with missing data\n\n【130】We will contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data (for example when a study is identified as abstract only or when data are not available for all participants). Where this is not possible, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias, we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis. We will clearly describe any assumptions and imputations to handle missing data and explore the effect of imputation by sensitivity analyses.\n\n【131】For dichotomous outcomes (for example number of withdrawals due to adverse events), we will calculate the withdrawal rate using the number of participants randomised in the group as the denominator.\n\n【132】For continuous outcomes (for example mean change in pain score), we will calculate the mean difference or SMD based on the number of participants analysed at that time point. If the number of participants analysed is not presented for each time point, we will use the number of randomised participants in each group at baseline.\n\n【133】Where possible, we will compute missing standard deviations from other statistics such as standard errors, confidence intervals, or P values, according to the methods recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Higgins 2011a ). If standard deviations cannot be calculated, they will be imputed (for example from other studies in the meta‐analysis).\n\n【134】#### Assessment of heterogeneity\n\n【135】We will assess clinical and methodological diversity in terms of participants, interventions, outcomes, and study characteristics for the included studies in order to determine whether a meta‐analysis is appropriate. We will conduct this by observing this data from the data extraction tables. We will assess statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plot for obvious differences in results between the studies, and by using the I² and Chi² statistical tests.\n\n【136】As recommended in the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2011 ), the interpretation of an I² value of 0% to 40% might 'not be important'; 30% to 60% may represent 'moderate' heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent 'substantial' heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% represents 'considerable' heterogeneity. As noted in the _Cochrane Handbook_ , we will keep in mind that the importance of I² depends on (i) magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) strength of evidence for heterogeneity.\n\n【137】We will interpret the Chi² test where a P value less than or equal to 0.10 will indicate evidence of statistical heterogeneity.\n\n【138】If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will report it and investigate possible causes by following the recommendations in Section 9.6 of the _Cochrane Handbook_ ( Deeks 2011 ).\n\n【139】#### Assessment of reporting biases\n\n【140】We will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small‐study biases. In interpreting funnel plots, we will examine the different possible reasons for funnel plot asymmetry as outlined in Section 10.4 of the _Cochrane Handbook_ ( Sterne 2011 ) and relate this to the results of the review. If we are able to pool more than 10 trials, we will undertake formal statistical tests to investigate funnel plot asymmetry, and will follow the recommendations in Section 10.4 of the _Cochrane Handbook_ ( Sterne 2011 ).\n\n【141】We will check trial protocols against published reports to assess outcome reporting bias. For studies published after 1 July 2005, we will screen the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ) for the a priori trial protocol. We will evaluate whether selective reporting of outcomes is present.\n\n【142】#### Data synthesis\n\n【143】We will undertake meta‐analyses only where this is meaningful, that is if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical questions are similar enough for pooling to make sense.\n\n【144】We will analyse data separately for each of the three main comparisons: surgical intervention versus non‐surgical intervention, surgical intervention versus injectable therapy, and surgical intervention versus other surgical intervention. Where possible, we will analyse data separately according to the type of non‐surgical comparator (for example sham surgery, physiotherapy, bracing, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, orthotics). If sufficient data are available, we will identify subgroups within each of the main analyses based on type of surgical intervention (for example arthroscopic, load‐modifying, and knee replacement procedures). We will only do further analysis within each subgroup based on surgical procedure (for example arthroscopic irrigation, arthroscopic debridement, cartilage repair) if sufficient data are collated from our search.\n\n【145】There is likely to be significant clinical heterogeneity between participants across different trials. As such, we will use a random‐effects model and perform a sensitivity analysis with a fixed‐effect model.\n\n【146】##### Summary of findings table\n\n【147】We will include 'Summary of findings' tables based on the following three main comparisons:\n\n【148】1.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY non‐surgical intervention.\n    \n2.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY injectable therapy.\n    \n3.  ANY type of surgical intervention versus ANY OTHER surgical intervention.\n    \n\n【149】Where possible, we will present data separately according to the type of surgical intervention (for example arthroscopic, load‐modifying, and knee replacement procedures) and type of non‐surgical comparator (for example sham surgery, physiotherapy, bracing, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, orthotics).\n\n【150】We will include the following outcomes in each of the 'Summary of findings' tables:\n\n【151】1.  Pain\n    \n2.  Physical function\n    \n3.  Radiographic joint structure changes\n    \n4.  Quality of life\n    \n5.  Short‐term serious adverse effects from trials\n    \n6.  Re‐operation rate or conversion to total knee replacement, or both (indicating failure of the primary intervention)\n    \n7.  Withdrawals due to adverse events\n    \n\n【152】Two review authors (JSP, APM) will independently assess the quality of the evidence. We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contribute data to the meta‐analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We will use methods and recommendations described in Sections 8.5 and 8.7, Chapter 11, and Chapter 13 Section 13.5 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ using GRADEpro software ( Higgins 2011 ; Schünemann 2011a ; GRADEpro 2015 ). We will justify all decisions to down‐ or up‐grade the quality of studies using footnotes, and we will make comments to aid reader's understanding of the review where necessary.\n\n【153】In the 'Comments' column of the 'Summary of findings' table, we will provide the absolute per cent difference, the relative per cent change from baseline, the NNTH and NNTB (the NNTH and NNTB will be provided only when the outcome shows a statistically signficant difference).\n\n【154】For dichotomous outcomes such as serious adverse events, we will calculate the NNTH and NNTB from the control group event rate and the risk ratio using the Visual Rx calculator ( Cates 2008 ). We will calculate the NNTH and NNTB for continuous measures using the Wells calculator (available from Cochrane Musculoskeletal staff: http://musculoskeletal.cochrane.org/).\n\n【155】For dichotomous outcomes, the absolute risk difference will be calculated using the risk difference statistic in Review Manager and the result expressed as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, the absolute benefit will be calculated as the improvement in the intervention group minus the improvement in the control group (mean difference), in the original units, and expressed as a percentage.\n\n【156】The relative per cent change for dichotomous data will be calculated as the risk ratio minus one and expressed as a percentage. For continuous outcomes, the relative difference in the change from baseline will be calculated as the absolute benefit divided by the baseline mean of the control group, expressed as a percentage.\n\n【157】#### Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\n【158】Where sufficient data are available, we plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses for outcomes related to patient‐reported pain and function.\n\n【159】1.  Age 18 to 40 years, 40 to 65 years, > 65 years\n    \n2.  Gender\n    \n3.  Type of surgical intervention (e.g. arthroscopic, load‐modifying, and knee replacement procedures)\n    \n4.  Type of surgical procedure (e.g. arthroscopic irrigation, arthroscopic debridement, osteotomy)\n    \n\n【160】We will use the formal test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager ( RevMan 2012 ) and will use caution in the interpretation of subgroup analyses as advised in Section 9.6 of the _Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions_ ( Deeks 2011 ). The magnitude of the effects will be compared between the subgroups by means of assessing the overlap of the confidence intervals of the summary estimated. Non‐overlap of the confidence intervals indicates statistical significance.\n\n【161】#### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【162】We plan to carry out sensitivity analyses on pain and function by examining the effects of:\n\n【163】1.  including missing or inappropriately analysed data;\n    \n2.  including trials with unclear allocation concealment (at risk of selection bias);\n    \n3.  including trials with an incomplete description of EKOA;\n    \n4.  the choice of statistical model for pooling (fixed‐effect versus random‐effects);\n    \n5.  including trials at risk of detection bias (i.e. unclear or no blinding of participant for participant‐reported outcomes).\n    \n\n【164】##### Interpreting results and reaching conclusions\n\n【165】We will follow the guidelines in Chapter 12 of the _Cochrane Handbook_ for interpreting results and will be aware of distinguishing a lack of evidence of effect from a lack of effect ( Schünemann 2011b ). We will base our conclusions only on findings from the quantitative or narrative synthesis of included studies for this review. We will avoid making recommendations for practice, and our implications for research will suggest priorities for future research and outline what the remaining uncertainties are in the area.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "cochrane", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}
